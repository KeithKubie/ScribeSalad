00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.800
What we have depicted right over
here is a combustion reaction.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.730
We have the hydrocarbon
methane right over here.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:07.470
You take that.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.840
You take some molecular oxygen.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.440
You give them enough heat.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.560
And then, they are
going to combust.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.880
And they're going to produce
carbon dioxide, water, and then

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.110
more energy than you put in.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.800
This is an exothermic reaction.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.270
More energy comes
out than you put in.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.770
This is why fires
keep spreading.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.304
This is why combustion
is used to power things.

00:00:30.304 --> 00:00:32.720
But that's not what we're going
to focus on in this video.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.960
In this video, we want
to think about-- which

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.950
of these components, of
these molecules, what's

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.250
being oxidized and
what is being reduced?

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.930
And to do that,
let's first think

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.740
about the oxidation
states of the input atoms

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.970
and the oxidation
states of the outputs--

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.840
of the different constituents
of these molecules.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.090
So I encourage you to
now pause this video

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.280
and try to figure
that out on your own.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.190
So I'm assuming you've
given a go at it.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.050
Now, let's work
through this together.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.910
Let's first think
about the methane.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.250
And I have a bunch of
electronegativities here based

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.540
on the Pauling scale
listed out here,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.230
but let's just
visualize methane.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.725
Methane is a carbon
bonded to 4 hydrogens.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.730
In our oxidation state world--
even though, this, in reality,

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.980
is a covalent bond--
we pretend like they're

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.850
hypothetically ionic bonds.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.070
So we have to give the electron
pair to one of the parties

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.460
to the bond.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.650
If we look between
carbon and hydrogen,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.090
carbon is more
electronegative than hydrogen.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.260
So we will assume that carbon
will be hogging the electrons

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.010
and that hydrogen will be
giving away the electrons.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.370
So carbon's going to take--
in this hypothetical world--

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.440
hypothetically take an electron
from each of these hydrogens.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.320
It is going to have an
oxidation state of negative 4,

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.370
an electron from
each of 4 hydrogens.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.160
Negative 4.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.590
And once again, we write
the sign after the number

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.289
probably so that we don't get
these confused with exponents.

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:05.830
Now, let's think
about the hydrogens.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.880
Each of those
hydrogens is having--

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.260
in this hypothetical world--
an electron taken away from it.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.280
We could say it has an
oxidation state of plus 1, which

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.976
we could write as 1 plus.

00:02:16.976 --> 00:02:18.600
Or we could just
write a positive right

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.240
over here-- a plus sign.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.960
Now, we have molecular oxygen--
oxygen bonded to oxygen.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.132
Well, all oxygens
are created equal.

00:02:29.132 --> 00:02:31.340
Or we'll assume that these
oxygens are created equal,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.780
that they're not different
isotopes or anything like that.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.280
In this reality,
there's no reason

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.610
why one oxygen would
hog any electrons

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.860
from the other oxygen.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.360
In this world, the oxygen
has an oxidation state--

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.340
when it's in this
molecular oxygen

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.970
form-- it has an
oxidation state of 0

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.570
or an oxidation number of 0.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.990
Now, let's think about
this side-- the products.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.060
Now, what's happening
here with carbon dioxide?

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.510
Carbon dioxide is
a carbon double

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.175
bonded to 2 different oxygens.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.150
We see oxygen is one of the
most electronegative elements

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.270
out there, definitely more
electronegative than carbon.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.400
So in our hypothetical
ionic bond world,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.874
we would say that oxygen
would take 4 electrons.

00:03:19.874 --> 00:03:22.040
These bonds would all go
to the different electrons.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.900
Each oxygen will take 2
electrons from the carbon.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.830
The carbon will
lose 4 electrons.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.090
We could say the carbon
loses 4 electrons.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.370
You lose 4 electrons.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.290
That gives you a hypothetical
positive charge of positive 4.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.060
Each of these oxygens
is gaining 2 electrons.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.060
So it gives them each
a hypothetical charge

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.770
of negative 2.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.100
And we see it nets out.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.890
Positive 4.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.730
2 times negative
2 is negative 4.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:47.600
It all adds up.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.860
This is a neutral molecule.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.490
And we saw that over here--
for negative 4 plus 4 times

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:53.510
positive 1.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.210
It all nets out to be neutral.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.720
And that makes sense because
these are neutral molecules.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.630
And then, finally,
you have water.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.110
And we've seen that
multiple times already.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.520
Oxygen-- what, in reality,
are covalent bonds

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.310
with the hydrogens-- in
our hypothetical ionic bond

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.830
world, oxygen is a good
bit more electronegative.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.370
So we're assuming
it's going to take

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.450
the electrons from
the hydrogens.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.260
So each of the hydrogens
loses an electron,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.375
giving it an
oxidation number of 1.

00:04:24.375 --> 00:04:26.250
I could even write it
like this, if you like.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.840
An oxidation number
of positive 1.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.970
The oxygen has
gained 2 electrons.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:41.664
So that gives it an oxidation
number of negative 2.

00:04:41.664 --> 00:04:43.330
So now that we've
done that, let's think

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.700
about who is getting oxidized
and who is being reduced.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.500
So let's first
focus on the carbon.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:58.520
The carbon starts off at an
oxidation number of negative 4.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.570
The reaction takes place.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.060
And then, carbon now has an
oxidation number of positive 4.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.840
So how does something go from an
oxidation number of negative 4

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.220
to positive 4?

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.250
Well, the way to
increase your charge

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.690
or your hypothetical charge
is to lose electrons.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.627
Every time you lose an electron,
this becomes less negative.

00:05:20.627 --> 00:05:22.210
And eventually, it'll
become positive.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.260
So you have to lose 8 electrons.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.539
So I'll write plus 8
electrons right over here.

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:31.580
You take these electrons,
give it to this carbon.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.344
You're going to get to
this side of this reaction.

00:05:34.344 --> 00:05:35.760
And the way I'm
writing right now,

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.190
these are called
"half reactions"

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.330
where I'm independently
focusing on each

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.570
of the elemental components
of these reactions.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.260
So here, you have carbon.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.890
In this reaction, carbon--
in our hypothetical oxidation

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.770
number world-- has
lost 8 electrons.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.360
What do we call it
when you are losing

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.990
these hypothetical electrons?

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.490
Well, we can remind ourselves
OIL RIG-- oxidation is losing

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.120
electrons, reduction is gaining.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.290
Or LEO-- losing
electrons is oxidation--

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.800
the lion says GER-- gaining
electrons is reduction.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.950
So it's clear right over here
that carbon is being oxidized.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.670
It is losing electrons.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.015
Oxidation is losing electrons.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.455
Carbon is oxidized.

00:06:31.679 --> 00:06:32.970
Let's think about the hydrogen.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.740
On the left-hand side,
you have 4 hydrogens

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.270
that each have an
oxidation number of plus 1.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.180
On the right-hand side,
you have 4 hydrogens.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.930
We're writing it a
slightly different way.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.640
We could write it
like this-- 2H2's

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.790
that each have an
oxidation number of plus 1.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.550
The oxidation numbers for the
hydrogens has not changed.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.490
The hydrogens has neither
been oxidized nor reduced.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.280
Let's think about the oxygens.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:16.170
On the left-hand side, you have
2O2's neutral oxidation number.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.050
And on the right-hand
side, what do you have?

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.700
You have 4 total oxygens.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.130
I'll combine these together.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.440
I'll just write this
as 4 total oxygens.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.000
And what's each of
their oxidation numbers?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.465
Well, we see it's a negative 2.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.940
So what happened to
each of these 4 oxygens?

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.520
I could have written
4O here instead of 2O2.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.050
Either way, I'm
just really trying

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.280
to account for the oxygens.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.265
Here I have 4 oxygens with
a neutral oxidation number--

00:07:48.265 --> 00:07:49.515
with an oxidation number of 0.

00:07:49.515 --> 00:07:55.570
And here I have 4 oxygens with
a negative oxidation number.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.600
How do you go from
0 to negative?

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.140
Each of them must have
gained 2 electrons.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.402
If you have 4 oxygens, each
of them gained 2 electrons,

00:08:03.402 --> 00:08:05.360
we could actually write
the reaction like this.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.860
Actually, let me
write it like this.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.140
Let me move this part.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.970
So cut and paste.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.960
Let me move it over to
the right a little bit

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.380
because what I want to show is
the gaining of the electrons.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:22.270
So plus 8 electrons.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:23.740
So what happened to oxygen?

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.340
Well, oxygen gained electrons.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.700
What is gaining electrons?

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.615
Reduction is gaining-- RIG.

00:08:29.615 --> 00:08:31.590
GER-- gaining
electrons is reduction.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:40.450
Oxygen has been reduced.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.970
Now, what oxidized carbon?

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:49.900
Well, carbon lost
electrons to the oxygen.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.310
So carbon oxidized
by the oxygen,

00:08:53.310 --> 00:09:00.080
which is part of the motivation
for calling it "oxidation."

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.170
And what reduced the oxygen?

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:07.270
Well, oxygen took those
electrons from the carbon.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.470
So oxygen reduced by the carbon.

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.590
And this type of
reaction-- where

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.060
you have both oxidation
and reduction taking place,

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.396
and really they're two
sides of the same coin.

00:09:20.396 --> 00:09:21.770
One thing is going
to be oxidized

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.610
if another thing is being
reduced, and vice versa.

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:28.410
We call these oxidation
reduction reactions.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.790
Or sometimes "redox" for short.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:44.830
Take the "red" from "reduction"
and the "ox" from "oxidation,"

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:46.420
and you've got "redox."

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.100
This is a redox reaction.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.840
Something is being oxidized.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.720
Something else is being reduced.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.800
Not everything is being
oxidized or reduced,

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.670
and we can see that very
clearly when we depict it

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.250
in these half reactions.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.500
And one way to check that
your half reactions actually

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.240
makes sense is you can
actually sum up the two sides.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.980
If you take this left side right
over here and you sum them up,

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.810
you should get all the
constituents right over here

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.490
minus the electrons.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:12.732
And the same thing over here.

00:10:12.732 --> 00:10:14.190
You should get all
the constituents

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:17.100
that you have on the right-hand
side minus the electrons.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.510
So one way to think about it,
if you added all this stuff

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:28.020
on the left-hand side, you would
get this plus this 8 electrons

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:28.970
on the left-hand side.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:32.400
If you added all of this up, you
would have the plus 8 electrons

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.780
on that side as well.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.916
And so the 8 electrons
you could kind of say, oh,

00:10:35.916 --> 00:10:39.225
let's take them away
from both sides.

00:10:39.225 --> 00:10:41.800
You would get your
original reaction.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.300
And so I'm going
to leave you there.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.390
This is a very, very
powerful tool in chemistry

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.920
because it really helps us
think about what's actually

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:53.141
going on inside of some
type of a reaction.
