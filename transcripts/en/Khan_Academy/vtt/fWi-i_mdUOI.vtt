00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.147
- [Instructor] Let's get some practice

00:00:01.147 --> 00:00:04.270
adding numbers that involve hundredths.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.422
Pause this video and see if
you can add these two numbers.

00:00:07.422 --> 00:00:08.844
See what you get.

00:00:08.844 --> 00:00:10.497
Alright, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:10.497 --> 00:00:14.039
Now there is many different
ways to add decimals.

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:15.833
And you'll learn more systematic,

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:17.946
faster ways of doing it in the future,

00:00:17.946 --> 00:00:20.179
but I'll show you a few ways

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:22.730
that my brain might think about it.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.674
One way to think about it is you could say

00:00:24.674 --> 00:00:27.418
that this is 53/100.

00:00:27.418 --> 00:00:32.230
You could read this as either
5/10 and 3/100, or 53/100.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.263
You could say this is 53/100.

00:00:36.263 --> 00:00:37.180
Hundredths.

00:00:38.711 --> 00:00:43.452
And to that you're going to add 42/100.

00:00:43.452 --> 00:00:44.952
42/100.

00:00:47.783 --> 00:00:50.632
And so if I have 53 of
something and I'm gonna add 42

00:00:50.632 --> 00:00:54.024
of that same something to
it, what am I going to get?

00:00:54.024 --> 00:00:55.941
Well what's 53 plus 42?

00:00:56.884 --> 00:01:00.804
Well in my head I say
well 50 plus 40 is 90,

00:01:00.804 --> 00:01:03.463
and three plus two is five.

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:06.380
It's going to be 95/100.

00:01:07.332 --> 00:01:08.981
95/100.

00:01:08.981 --> 00:01:11.531
And if I wanted to write
that as a pure number,

00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:13.781
I would write that as 0.95,

00:01:15.186 --> 00:01:18.390
which I could write as 95/100, hundredths,

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.219
or 9/10 and 5/100.

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:22.896
Now the other way we
could've thought about it

00:01:22.896 --> 00:01:25.265
is we could've broken these numbers up.

00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:27.193
We could've said that this first number

00:01:27.193 --> 00:01:31.360
is 5/10 plus 3/100, hundredths.

00:01:33.236 --> 00:01:35.541
And then the second number,
we could've rewritten

00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:38.958
as 4/10 plus 2/100.

00:01:41.148 --> 00:01:42.617
Let me make sure of my decimals.

00:01:42.617 --> 00:01:44.651
Plus 2/100.

00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:46.910
And then we could've separately added

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.070
the tenths and the hundredths.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.153
So you have 5/10 plus 4/10,

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.064
so 5/10 plus 4/10,

00:01:58.064 --> 00:02:02.231
and then you could separately
add 3/100 plus 2/100.

00:02:03.178 --> 00:02:06.783
So 3/100, I have a little
trouble saying that,

00:02:06.783 --> 00:02:10.450
plus 2/100, and so what do I get?

00:02:11.287 --> 00:02:15.925
Well 5/10 and 4/10, and we've
done this in previous videos,

00:02:15.925 --> 00:02:17.482
if I have five of something
and I add four of it,

00:02:17.482 --> 00:02:19.180
that's gonna be 9/10.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.347
So it's gonna be 9/10, and
then the 3/100 plus 2/100.

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.547
Well that's going to be 5/100.

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:28.630
So plus 0.05.

00:02:30.154 --> 00:02:34.066
And then 9/10 plus 5/100 is gonna be,

00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:35.916
I know I'm saying
hundredths kinda strange,

00:02:35.916 --> 00:02:40.243
is going to be 9/10 and 5/100,

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:44.076
which you could also say as 95/100.

00:02:46.493 --> 00:02:49.049
Let's do another example.

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.497
One that's a little bit more involved.

00:02:52.497 --> 00:02:55.914
Let's say I want to add 68/100

00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:00.755
to 33/100.

00:03:04.148 --> 00:03:06.841
What is this going to be?

00:03:06.841 --> 00:03:09.320
And like always, pause the video and see

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.804
if you can figure it out on your own.

00:03:11.804 --> 00:03:14.858
Well there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:03:14.858 --> 00:03:17.817
One way we could split up the
tenths and the hundredths,

00:03:17.817 --> 00:03:20.508
actually let's do it that way.

00:03:20.508 --> 00:03:24.675
We could rewrite this first
number as 6/10 plus 8/100,

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.537
and the second number we could
write as 3/10 plus 3/100.

00:03:34.844 --> 00:03:37.519
Let me do that in that orange color.

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.436
3/10 plus...

00:03:41.948 --> 00:03:45.531
Plus 3/10 plus 3/100.

00:03:49.648 --> 00:03:53.514
So if I add the 6/10 and the 3/10,

00:03:53.514 --> 00:03:54.798
so let me just do that.

00:03:54.798 --> 00:03:56.102
I'm gonna write every step here.

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:57.096
If you're doing this in your head

00:03:57.096 --> 00:03:58.024
or if you're doing this on paper

00:03:58.024 --> 00:04:00.323
you wouldn't necessarily
write every step here.

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:01.751
Those are the tenths.

00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:04.530
And then separately I'm
gonna add the hundredths.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.280
Plus 8/100, plus 3/100.

00:04:09.835 --> 00:04:11.668
Plus 3/100.

00:04:13.737 --> 00:04:16.988
6/10 plus 3/10, we've done
this in previous videos,

00:04:16.988 --> 00:04:19.151
that's hopefully pretty
straightforward by this point.

00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:20.638
If it's not, I encourage you to review

00:04:20.638 --> 00:04:22.924
some of those earlier videos.

00:04:22.924 --> 00:04:26.169
That's going to be 9/10.

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:27.938
If I have six of something
and then I add three of them,

00:04:27.938 --> 00:04:29.327
in this case we're talking about tenths,

00:04:29.327 --> 00:04:31.839
I'm gonna get nine of them, so 9/10.

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:33.669
And so what's this going to be?

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.784
Well you could view this is as 8/100.

00:04:36.784 --> 00:04:40.034
8/100 plus 3/100.

00:04:42.841 --> 00:04:45.131
If I have eight of something
and I add three of something,

00:04:45.131 --> 00:04:47.421
that's gonna get 11 of that something.

00:04:47.421 --> 00:04:48.921
11/100.

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:55.558
How do we write 11/100 as a decimal?

00:04:55.558 --> 00:05:00.247
Well one way to write it, you
could just view this as 0.11.

00:05:00.247 --> 00:05:02.298
This is 11/100.

00:05:02.298 --> 00:05:04.577
Many people would read this as 11/100.

00:05:04.577 --> 00:05:09.141
Or you could view this as equaling 10/100,

00:05:09.141 --> 00:05:12.474
10/100 plus 1/100.

00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:15.464
Hundredth.

00:05:15.464 --> 00:05:19.773
And 10/100 right over here is 1/10.

00:05:19.773 --> 00:05:22.940
You could view this as 1/10

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:26.193
and 1/100.

00:05:26.193 --> 00:05:28.858
1/10 and 1/100.

00:05:28.858 --> 00:05:31.679
When you add everything
together, what do you get?

00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:35.846
Well you get 9/10, plus 1/10, plus 1/100.

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:40.287
Well now this is gonna get
interesting still, so let's see.

00:05:40.287 --> 00:05:41.663
Let me actually rewrite this.

00:05:41.663 --> 00:05:45.042
It's gonna be 9/10, and
this one let me write it

00:05:45.042 --> 00:05:46.792
plus 1/10,

00:05:48.758 --> 00:05:52.561
plus that 1/100 leftover.

00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:54.557
Plus that 1/100.

00:05:54.557 --> 00:05:56.049
What is this going to be?

00:05:56.049 --> 00:06:00.216
9/10 and 1/10, that's going to be,

00:06:02.371 --> 00:06:05.935
9/10 and 1/10 is going to be 10/10.

00:06:05.935 --> 00:06:10.850
10/10, which is the
same thing as one whole.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.382
This is just going to be equal to one.

00:06:13.382 --> 00:06:16.498
It's going to be one plus 1/100.

00:06:16.498 --> 00:06:20.665
It's going to be one and
1/100, and we are done.

00:06:22.212 --> 00:06:24.191
As I keep mentioning in future videos

00:06:24.191 --> 00:06:27.118
we're gonna learn maybe
faster ways of doing this.

00:06:27.118 --> 00:06:28.403
Maybe ways that you might be able to do it

00:06:28.403 --> 00:06:29.596
a little bit more automatically.

00:06:29.596 --> 00:06:31.694
But it's really important to think about

00:06:31.694 --> 00:06:34.212
what we just went here and
how we were able to think,

00:06:34.212 --> 00:06:38.225
okay 11/100 is the same thing
as a tenth and a hundredth,

00:06:38.225 --> 00:06:41.109
and then taking that tenth,
and then adding it to the 9/10

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:43.113
that we already had and
say, hey that's whole.

00:06:43.113 --> 00:06:44.680
In the future, we're gonna be doing things

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.500
like carrying with decimals,
but this is essentially

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.789
what is happening underneath conceptually.

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:51.907
It's really important
you get a sense of that

00:06:51.907 --> 00:06:54.990
before you learn the faster methods.
