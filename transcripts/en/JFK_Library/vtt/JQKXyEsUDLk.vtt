00:00:00.754 --> 00:00:02.657
- And Roseburg, which
of course, has seen one

00:00:02.657 --> 00:00:05.168
of the very many mass
killings of recent years.

00:00:05.168 --> 00:00:09.118
Bobby Kennedy spoke there
ten days before he was shot.

00:00:09.118 --> 00:00:12.735
And he was warned by the
Sheriff, "Don't talk gun control.

00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:15.729
There's a whole bunch of Lumberjacks here,

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:17.818
they're very gun oriented..."
they're all Second Amendment,

00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:18.831
they don't say Second Amendment back then,

00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:22.922
they just said, "pro-gun people
and you better not do it."

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:25.847
So he walked out and gave
a pro-gun control speech

00:00:25.847 --> 00:00:27.884
right in their face.

00:00:27.884 --> 00:00:29.992
Which is very Bobby just
like talking to students

00:00:29.992 --> 00:00:32.266
about they shouldn't
have their deferments.

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.326
He was very direct with people
and he'd challenge them.

00:00:34.326 --> 00:00:37.946
He was not a, he was not
a pander bear at all,

00:00:37.946 --> 00:00:41.152
unlike almost every politician today is.

00:00:41.152 --> 00:00:43.103
And he said you gotta do guns

00:00:43.103 --> 00:00:45.816
and he talked about the
case of mail order rifles.

00:00:45.816 --> 00:00:47.309
Like the one that killed his brother.

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.392
A mail order rifle.

00:00:48.392 --> 00:00:50.364
And he talked about the ridiculous case,

00:00:50.364 --> 00:00:52.741
it may have been
apocryphal, it seems crazy.

00:00:52.741 --> 00:00:55.307
That somebody on death row ordered a rifle

00:00:55.307 --> 00:00:59.320
and they brought it, this
Post Office delivered it.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.436
I have no idea what klutz
in the post office said,

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:04.185
"Oh, it's a rifle, I know it's
a rifle, but he ordered it,

00:01:04.185 --> 00:01:06.462
I gotta do it, you know..."

00:01:06.462 --> 00:01:09.232
The days of Amazon coming early.

00:01:09.232 --> 00:01:12.475
But, you know, he talked
about that and he said,

00:01:12.475 --> 00:01:14.302
"People with mental conditions

00:01:14.302 --> 00:01:16.404
shouldn't be getting guns.

00:01:16.404 --> 00:01:18.309
Kids shouldn't be getting guns."

00:01:18.309 --> 00:01:20.715
He gave all the reasons we give today.

00:01:20.715 --> 00:01:22.297
For people who have mental handicaps

00:01:22.297 --> 00:01:25.777
that are killing people
like this marital dispute

00:01:25.777 --> 00:01:27.564
or Mother-In-Law dispute or whatever.

00:01:27.564 --> 00:01:29.727
I can't believe it, they're fairly common.

00:01:29.727 --> 00:01:33.606
You know, you can't get
rid of Mother-In-Laws,

00:01:33.606 --> 00:01:36.158
but how about looking at the guns?

00:01:36.158 --> 00:01:40.688
And it was as you say
Sir, he was in Roseburg.

00:01:40.688 --> 00:01:42.589
Which later became the
scene of a mass killing,

00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:44.366
and he's begging people.

00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:46.597
And I put that in a column
to the Times two weeks

00:01:46.597 --> 00:01:49.393
ago saying, "They always
say right after the killing

00:01:49.393 --> 00:01:51.177
let's not talk politics now."

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:52.389
Because they wait for two weeks

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:54.378
when no one's talking about guns.

00:01:54.378 --> 00:01:56.495
And of course you've got to talk politics,

00:01:56.495 --> 00:01:58.200
if it's an immigrant who shoots somebody,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.590
immediately, Trump's talking
about immigration law.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.707
So he doesn't have any
problem jumping on the button.

00:02:04.707 --> 00:02:06.411
And playing a political card immediately.

00:02:06.411 --> 00:02:08.637
You gotta talk gun control
when there's been a killing.

00:02:08.637 --> 00:02:09.470
That's when you do focus on things.
