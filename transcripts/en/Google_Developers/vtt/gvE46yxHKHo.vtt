JACOB ROSENBERG: It's
an online direct lender

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.690
that is a socially responsible
alternative to payday loans

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.890
that makes loans online to
people whom banks and credit

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.140
unions would normally decline.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.850
It's really important to
us morally as a company

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.430
to contribute the positive
repayment behavior that people

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.310
are giving, that people are
doing as they use our products,

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.350
and that we share that.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.250
Because that's the
way that you reward

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.850
people for the
positive behavior.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.084
If you talked to many
companies in the space,

00:00:36.084 --> 00:00:37.500
they will tell you
that they don't

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.749
want to report that information
because why would they

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:42.290
want to tell everybody who
their best customers are?

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.990
But the truth is, we just
think it's a moral imperative

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.800
that you be rewarded
for the right behavior.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.710
And it really ties in
with our first value here,

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.230
which is ladders not chutes.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.760
We always want to be building
products that help people up

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.060
on the landscape of
financial health.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.632
And we always think
about, when we're

00:00:58.632 --> 00:01:01.130
building a product,
if someone uses it,

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.380
whether they're going to be
better off a year from now

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.880
or not.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.110
And if they're not, we don't
want to build that product.
