JANET RANKIN: The
beach ball strategy

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.250
is a way to get
students who might not

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.580
want to answer questions
or be a little less

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.350
outgoing in their answering of
questions to answer questions.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.480
So there's a few different
ways to use the beach

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.590
ball, actually.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.500
And one is you just
pose a question

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.470
that has enough variation
in the types of responses.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.331
So you wouldn't say
OK, what's 2 plus 2

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:33.080
as an example for the
beach ball question.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.350
You would have to have something
that was a little bit richer.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.130
And then you throw the
ball at one student

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.580
or up into the lecture hall,
if it's a big lecture hall.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.910
And whoever catches
it has to respond.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.270
And that response, you
share it with the group,

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.500
comment on it if you
want to comment on it.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.130
And then that person who gave
the first response throws

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.810
the ball to somebody else.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.540
And then whoever catches
the ball that time responds,

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.700
et cetera.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.060
You can use it coupled with
a picture prompt or a graph.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.950
So if you show a graph
or an image and you say,

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.930
tell me something you
observe about this image,

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.790
and then you throw the
ball and the person

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.484
catches it first says one thing
they observe, and they throw it

00:01:16.484 --> 00:01:17.900
and the next person
says something

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.760
that they observed about
the picture prompt.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.630
So that gives a
foundation and it opens up

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.186
space for lots of responses.

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:28.560
The beach ball
does a few things.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.800
One is that as the
instructor, you

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.632
don't have to be the one
that calls on the students

00:01:33.632 --> 00:01:35.090
all the time, so
the students don't

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.520
feel like you're picking
on them, that you're

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.200
the one that's cold
calling on them.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.850
And in fact you can throw on
the beach ball completely blind

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.850
the first time, close
your eyes, throw the ball,

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.420
and so nobody really feels
that you've called on them.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.610
And then subsequently,
it's other students that

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.990
are throwing the
ball, so there's

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.240
no issue that you're the one
that's picking on the students.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.040
The other thing is
it's kind of fun,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.380
you're throwing the ball around,
so it's hard to get upset,

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.230
it's hard to get as
a student nervous

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.330
that you're going to have
to answer the question.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.280
And in fact, you
could dodge the ball

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.160
if you really didn't want
to answer the question.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.800
So it's a great way to
get students talking.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.250
And in general, it's pretty fun.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.510
And at first I thought
oh, I can't really

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.980
use this with grad
students, it's too goofy,

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.870
it's too baby or silly.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.000
But actually,
every time I use it

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.890
with grad students,
postdocs, everybody

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.120
seems perfectly fine with it.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.910
I think it's more to do with
the nature of the question.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.370
If you just ask stupid questions
and throw the ball around,

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.080
it'll be stupid.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.980
But if you ask good
questions and it's

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.040
a way for students to
give you their answers,

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.650
then it seems to
work totally fine.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.880
That's the general way.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.170
Sometimes I'll actually write
questions on the beach ball

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.450
and then throw the
ball into the class.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.600
And then students
are loosely supposed

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.760
to answer the question
that's in front of them

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.060
when they catch the ball.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.730
So that's another way to do it.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.880
But it's a nice, inexpensive,
fairly flexible technique.
