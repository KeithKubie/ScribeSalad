Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
U.S. history, and today we’re going to talk

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.420
about a topic so huge to history buffs that
we can only discuss a tiny, little fraction

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.719
of it. I am of course referring to paratroopering.
No World War II.

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.460
World War II is the only historical event
that has, like, its own cable channel. Well

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.170
I should say it used to have its own cable
channel. These days the History Channel is

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.750
of course devoted primarily to lumberjacks
and oh my gosh is that guy really going to

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.950
shoot an alligator.
Who knew how nostalgic we could be for documentaries

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.660
about Joseph Stalin.
Mr. Green, Mr. Green. Finally we get to the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.059
good stuff: like Patton, and Rommel, and Churchill,
and Eisenhower, Stalingrad, Gomer Pyle!

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.199
Oh I’m sorry to disappoint you, Me From
the Past, but while Patton and Eisenhower

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.199
were Americans, Rommel was a German (or General
Monty Montgomery’s dog).

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.960
Regardless, they were both from the green
parts of not-America also no Americans fought

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.379
at the battle of Stalingrad, although we did
talk about that in Crash Course World History.

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.780
And Gomer Pyle was a television character
played by Jim Nabors. I believe that you mean

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.780
to refer to the journalist Ernie Pyle.
intro

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.510
So here at CrashCourse we like to focus on
causes and effects of wars rather than strategy

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.270
and tactics, but given the importance that
World War II has in the American imagination,

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.860
we’re gonna discuss those a bit too today.
We’re going to defy Maria von Trapp and

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.050
start before the very beginning, because America’s
ideas about foreign policy were shaped by

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.890
two things: The Great Depression and World
War I.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.640
After the American experience of World War
I, it’s not surprising that Americans were

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.440
just a smidge gun shy about involvement in
foreign affairs. Seriously Stan? A gun pun?

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.530
Now? No.
Now America actually came out of World War

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.880
I stronger than ever but man did a lot of
people die for not much change.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.120
I mean I guess the Treaty of Versailles sort
of re-made Europe, but it didn’t make it

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.160
better.
And the League of Nations was a flop and generally

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.650
there was a lot of disappoin ted idealism.
The period of time between 1920 and the U.S.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.900
entry into World War II has been called an
age of isolationism, although that isn’t

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.790
100% accurate.
I mean, for one thing the U.S. sponsored a

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.540
series of arms reduction negotiations that
resulted in the Washington treaties limiting

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.670
the number of battleships that a country could
possess.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.079
But of course those negotiations led to a
fat lot of nothing because the idea of a nation

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:15.829
limiting its battleships was a bigger joke
even than the League of Nations, which I will

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:21.030
remind you, we invented and then did not join.
Another way that the U.S. was less-than isolationist

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.739
was our pursuance of the Good Neighbor Policy
with Latin America. So called because we were

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.769
not a good neighbor.
Our idea was to be less intrusive in Latin

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.819
American politics, and we did remove troops
from the Dominican Republic and Haiti, which

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.069
was something but “good neighbor” is a
bit of an exaggeration.

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.120
I mean we continued to support repressive
dictators like Somoza in Nicaragua and Batista

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.709
in Cuba. You know, we’d never really been
great neighbors.

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.879
However, we were isolationist in the sense
that the United States was much less involved

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.340
in world trade, largely because of the Depression,
you know that meant that there wasn’t much

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.930
world trade, but also because of tariff policies.
But there was also something isolationist

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.219
about the formal actions of Congress, like
after Europe and Asia began to become belligerent

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:05.279
in the 1930s with Japan’s invasion of China,
and Italy’s invasion of Ethiopia, and the

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:10.260
rise of fascist dictators in Spain and, of
course Germany, Congress responded by passing

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.389
a series of Neutrality Acts which banned the
sale of arms to belligerents.

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.760
Even if they were really nice, tea-drinking
belligerents who we were pals with.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.749
And that points to another reason why people
tend to regard this as a time of isolationist

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:25.849
sentiment, our old friend Eurocentrism.
We were generally neutral in terms of foreign

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.019
intervention when it came to Europe.
Popular groups, like America First with celebrity

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.639
members from Charles Lindbergh to E. E. Cummings
cautioned against involvement in foreign affairs.

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.249
But they mostly meant European affairs.
The U.S. didn’t officially get involved

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:43.930
in the war until two years after Hitler invaded
Poland but America was deeply involved in

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.249
the European war before we actually sent troops.
FDR really wanted to help the Allies, especially

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:53.409
the Brits, who after the French surrender
in 1940 were the only ones actually fighting

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:57.359
the Nazis until 1941, when there were a whole
lot of Russians also fighting them.

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.870
Even Congress recognized that the Nazis were
a threat, and in 1940 it agreed to allow Cash

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.620
and Carry arms sales to Great Britain.
By the way, “Cash and Carry” is the name

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.340
of a liquor store near Stan’s house, but
anyway the sale of arms were “cash” sales

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.079
meaning that they were not paid for with loans
or IOUs and the carry part meant that the

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.310
British would carry their own arms over, you
know, to Britain.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.459
It’s the difference between buying a pizza
at a grocery store and getting it delivery,

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.110
except, you know, it’s not like that at
all and I just want pizza.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.120
Then, in September 1940 Congress created the
nation’s first peacetime draft, taking the

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.060
next step toward involvement. And that was
a huge deal because, you know, you don’t

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.110
muster an army with no desire to eventually
use it.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.150
By 1941, in spite of all our neutrality, FDR
had pretty clearly sided with the Allies.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.650
America became the “arsenal of democracy”
with the Lend Lease Act authorizing military

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.620
aid to countries that promised to pay it back
somehow after the war. We promise, we’ll

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.090
figure it out.
So, the U.S. essentially gave billions of

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.120
dollars worth of arms and war material to
Britain and, after the Nazis invaded in June

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.220
of 1941, to the USSR as well.
And the U.S. also froze Japanese assets here

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.310
and basically ended all trade between America
and Japan.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.500
But of course the event that pushed us fully
into the war happened on December 7, 1941

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.889
when Japanese pilots attacked the American
naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:17.819
187 aircraft were destroyed, 18 naval vessels
were damaged or destroyed, and more than 2000

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:21.190
American servicemen were killed.
FDR asked Congress for a declaration of war,

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.430
which they granted voting 477 to 1. And the
day after that, Germany declared war on the

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.639
United States and World War II officially
became a world war.

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.319
We almost always start the American story
of World War II in Europe because, you know,

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:38.470
Hitler, so I’m going to start in the Pacific,
where until 1944 there were actually more

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.139
American personnel deployed than in Europe.
Things didn’t start well in the Pacific.

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.150
Let’s go to the ThoughtBubble.
Perhaps worse than Pearl Harbor was the surrender

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.460
of 78,000 American and Filipino troops at
Bataan. This was the largest surrender by

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.680
American troops in history and it resulted
in thousands dying on the Bataan Death March

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.509
to prisoner of war camps where thousands more
would die.

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:01.720
But in May of 1942 we protected Australia
from the Japanese fleet by winning the Battle

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.990
of the Coral Sea, and then in June we won
a huge victory at Midway island, midway between

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.449
Hawaii and Japan I guess, and probably named
by historians.

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:13.990
The U.S. strategy in the Pacific has been
called Island Hopping and it involved taking

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.389
Japanese controlled islands one at a time
to be used as bases for bombers that could

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:23.159
then be used against Japan itself. It was
a slow process and the fighting over these

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:27.770
jungle-y South Pacific islands was fierce
and extraordinarily costly. The battle at

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:33.970
Guadalcanal went from August 1942 to February
1943 and they didn’t freeze like in Stalingrad,

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.139
but conditions weren’t much better.
And now let’s switch to the European theater.

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:42.259
We call this the European war because we were
fighting against Europeans and it ended in

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:46.509
Europe, but the first U.S. troops to fight
against Nazis actually did so in North Africa,

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:49.750
so it’s kind of a misnomer.
American weaponry was pretty poor but after

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:55.379
our initial invasion in North Africa in November
1942 we got into it, and by 1943 we and the

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:59.740
British defeated Rommel in the desert and
we were ready to invade Europe, which should

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.719
have made Stalin happy because up to this
point Russians had been doing the bulk of

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:06.550
the dying in the war.
But Stalin wasn’t happy, first because he

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.370
was a mean and nasty person and those kinds
of people are rarely happy, and secondly,

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.240
because rather than invading France and striking
at Germany more directly, the Allies invaded

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:21.680
Sicily and Italy where we fought for most
of 1943 and much of 1944 until finally, on

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:27.259
June 6th we joined some Brits and Canadians
in invading Normandy on D-Day. And that was

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:30.710
the beginning of the end for the Nazis.
Thanks, ThoughtBubble. Oh it’s time for

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:35.780
the Mystery Document already? Alright. The
rules here are simple.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.699
I read the Mystery Document and usually I
get it wrong and I get shocked.

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:43.509
“They seemed terribly pathetic to me. They
weren’t warriors. They were American boys

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:48.569
who by mere chance of fate had wound up with
guns in their hands, sneaking up a death-laden

00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:53.979
street in a strange and shattered city in
a faraway country in a driving rain. They

00:07:53.979 --> 00:07:59.249
were afraid, but it was beyond their power
to quit. They had no choice. They were good

00:07:59.249 --> 00:08:04.389
boys. I talked with them all afternoon as
we sneaked slowly forward along the mysterious

00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:08.360
and rubbled streets, and I know they were
good boys. And even though they weren’t

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.659
warriors born to the kill, they won their
battles. That was the point.”

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:19.659
Man, that is some good writing, Stan. By famous
war correspondent Ernie Pyle. Pewwww. That

00:08:20.969 --> 00:08:26.030
was me being a warrior. Pew, pew.
I can’t even make finger guns. That’s-that’s

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:31.219
how much of a not-warrior I am. I’m a worrier.
I knew it was Ernie Pyle for two reasons.

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:35.190
First, he’s talking about cities so it’s
the European theatre. Secondly, he’s the

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.829
best European theatre American writer in World
War II by far.

00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:42.599
So while Americans did liberate Paris and
were part of the final assault on Germany,

00:08:42.599 --> 00:08:46.860
and also liberated a number of concentration
camps, Russians did most of the fighting in

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:52.050
Europe, losing at least 20 million people,
and in the end it was the Russians who captured

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.959
Berlin.
Although the Nazis never really had a chance

00:08:53.959 --> 00:08:57.610
to win the war after they started fighting
the Russians and the Americans entered into

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:02.820
it, it didn’t actually end until May 8th
or 9th, 1945 (depending on when you got the

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.959
news)
And the war in the Pacific continued until

00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:08.870
August. Japan surrendered unconditionally
after the United States dropped an atomic

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.300
bomb on Hiroshima on August 6th and on Nagasaki
on August 9th.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.740
We don’t celebrate the end of World War
II in the United States, and I guess this

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.820
is because we would have to decide whether
to celebrate the end of the war in Europe

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:24.620
or in Japan. Or maybe it’s just because
it’s difficult to celebrate the use of atomic

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.760
weapons.
Atomic bombs were developed through the Manhattan

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.630
Project, so called because the bombs were
partly invented in Chicago and then built

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.660
and tested in New Mexico. Trickery.
That was the sort of covert thing the U.S.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:38.459
used to do really well before we developed
the Internet. Although we weren’t that good

00:09:38.459 --> 00:09:42.709
at it since the Soviets did steal our technology
and build a nuclear bomb like three years

00:09:42.709 --> 00:09:44.350
later.
The two atomic bombs that were eventually

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:48.120
dropped were the most destructive weapons
the world had ever seen. The one dropped on

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:54.079
Hiroshima killed 70,000 people instantly and
by the end of 1945 another 70,000 had died

00:09:54.079 --> 00:09:57.110
from radiation poisoning.
The bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki also

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:02.120
killed 70,000 people. In fact, the death toll
from those two bombs was greater than the

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.790
number of American fatalities in the entire
Pacific War.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.529
And that leads to one of the most hotly debated
questions in recent history: was the use of

00:10:09.529 --> 00:10:13.829
atomic bombs justified or ethical?
Those arguing against their use often point

00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:17.760
out that the Truman administration had good
evidence that Japan would surrender if they

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.910
were allowed to keep their emperor on the
throne.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:24.380
And some also point out that the primary targets
were not military, although there were 40,000

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.399
troops stationed in Hiroshima.
Others argue that the real reason the United

00:10:27.399 --> 00:10:32.220
States dropped the bombs was to threaten the
USSR, and prevent them from taking more territory

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.449
in the east. And then there’s the argument
that using such a destructive weapon was morally

00:10:36.449 --> 00:10:41.589
reprehensible because it was so destructive
as to be qualitatively different from other

00:10:41.589 --> 00:10:43.300
weapons.
For a couple centuries, our weapons had had

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:48.160
the theoretical capability of eliminating
all humans, but never before had it been so

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.470
easy.
But others reply that dropping the bombs helped

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:55.970
save American lives. Some of Truman’s advisers
worried that invasion of Japan would result

00:10:55.970 --> 00:11:00.660
in 250,000 American deaths and at least that
many Japanese deaths.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.850
And that’s important to note because if
there was one thing truly, horribly innovative

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:09.630
about World War II, it was bombing.
Sure there was radar and jets, but they weren’t

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:14.519
nearly as significant as aerial bombardment,
and by the time the a-bombs dropped, the idea

00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:19.260
of precision bombing only military targets
wasn’t an option, in part because bombing

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:24.750
was incredibly risky to planes and pilots.
And by 1945, it was an acceptable and widespread

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:30.070
strategy to target civilians as part of a
total war. In World War II perhaps 40% of

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:32.860
the estimated 50 million people killed were
civilians.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.420
Compare that with World War I, where it was
only 10%.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:39.690
We should be horrified that 140,000 people
were killed in Hiroshima, but we should be

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:45.550
horrified by all the civilian attacks in World
War II. 25,000 people died in Dresden, more

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:49.769
than 100,000 died in the firebombing of Tokyo
in March of 1945.

00:11:49.769 --> 00:11:53.579
Thinking about Truman’s decision to drop
the atomic bombs is important because it forces

00:11:53.579 --> 00:11:57.810
us to consider our understanding of history.
Part of why we say that using atomic bombs

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:02.269
was worse than conventional bombing was because
we know what came after – the Cold War,

00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:07.399
the threat of nuclear annihilation. From the
present, the dawn of atomic warfare is indeed

00:12:07.399 --> 00:12:09.600
terrifying.
But people living at the time were living

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:14.120
amid a different kind of terror and they couldn’t
have known that there would be a nuclear arms

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.410
race that threatened all of humanity.
The Japanese didn’t look like they were

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:22.339
going to give up and people on both sides
were dying every day, so before we pass judgment,

00:12:22.339 --> 00:12:27.600
let’s try to put ourselves in the shoes
of both the soldiers who were fighting, who

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.180
didn’t have to fight on mainland Japan,
and the civilians who were killed by the bombs.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.630
There’s no answer to be found there, but
the opportunity of studying history is the

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.790
opportunity to experience empathy.
Now of course we’re never going to know

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:43.389
what it’s like to be someone else, to have
your life saved or taken by decisions made

00:12:43.389 --> 00:12:46.560
by the Allied command.
Studying history and making genuine attempts

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:51.610
at empathy helps us to grapple with the complexity
of the world, not as we wish it were, but

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:55.139
as we find it. Thanks for watching. I’ll
see you next week.

00:12:55.139 --> 00:12:58.940
