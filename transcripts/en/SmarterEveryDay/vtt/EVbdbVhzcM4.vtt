00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.740
[Gasps] Was it -- that was it, wasn't it?

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.080
I think we've been doing it so long we don't know what perfect looks like [Laughs]

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.040
What's up, I'm Destin.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.920
I do not even know how to start this video

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.180
I'll just try to explain it and -- I mean, this is a huge deal.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.680
Five years ago, someone sent me a link and I opened it, and I love fluid dynamics

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.000
and this was cool, it was like this lab video from Australia of two vortex rings colliding

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.580
and they did this really weird thing, and then these other rings poked out

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.780
and I was like "Oh, that was -", and my brain didn't even understand

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.000
So I hit refresh, and refresh, and refresh

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.500
And the more I watched it, the more I realized, this is really special.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.700
Like there's some complex fluid mechanics going on here that needs to be understood

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.600
So, I started Googling, because that's what you do. I want to learn more about it

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.240
and I found some research papers, where people had numerically tried to figure it out

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.560
but nobody's actually done it. Why?

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.440
So I started trying to do it myself.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.660
That didn't work, at all.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.760
I started trying to get help. So I got some undergraduate research students to help.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.360
They had some limited results. But it's a very difficult problem.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.640
So at this point, I realized: this is serious.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.680
I mean, this has not been recreated since cameras looked like this, right?

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:20.120
So you can't Google it, money can't buy it. If I ever want to see it better than this [gestures to camera], I have to do it myself.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.640
So I used some Patreon funding, and I went to this friend of mine.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.460
He's a motion control engineer. His name is David Lenderman.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.580
We've been working on this for well over 3 years.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.680
I mean, this has descended into madness. We've created all different types of prototypes.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.660
I don't know how to explain why, other than, "This had to be done."

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:51.120
So I wanted to see the vortex collision, recreated with modern imagery technology. And that's what this video is.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.040
I hope you enjoy it.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.460
So, in 1992 in the journal "Letters to Nature," there was an article written by

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.100
Doctor T. T. Lim, now you see this right here on the toolbox

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.620
in David's shop, because for the past year, we've been trying to recreate this device.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:14.260
It's a device he created--you may have seen the video-- two vortex rings were collided together,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.360
and they created these secondary rings that came off the edges.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.120
Now the problem with this, is, it was filmed with a potato.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.420
We're going to use this, it's a Phantom v2511,

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.480
and the goal here is to get those secondary rings.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.100
[MUSIC]

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.940
You have an electromechanical actuator that's driving

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.580
a pneumatic cylinder, which is pumping air to a valve

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.760
so that you can control the input to both cylinders at the same time.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.800
DAVID: Right, which seems to be fairly effective and predictable.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:58.840
DESTIN: So it's basically a very precisely calibrated syringe with a stroke of a certain throw, OK.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.140
DAVID: It's more of a messy process.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.120
DESTIN: I'm ready.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.540
DAVID: Doesn't look bad for the first one.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.920
DESTIN: That wasn't bad.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.760
How do you change the water?

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.020
DAVID: Pump it out.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.020
DESTIN: That is impressive.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.680
You want to do the mixing routine?

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.620
Really good one on that side.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.580
[MUSICAL IMPACT]

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.480
DESTIN: Ohhhh it's pretty.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.520
DAVID: That was a good one.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.720
DESTIN: That was pretty.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.600
[GASP]

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.940
When you get done with a shot it looks like you're growing your own organs in the aquarium.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.700
DESTIN: Opening...

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:50.980
[BOTH EXCLAIM]

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.320
Ohhh, I triggered on that.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.760
So this is what, this is round how many? Five? Four? Seven? [CHUCKLES]

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.060
[MUSIC CONTINUES]

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.600
750...

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.160
We are refilling the tank for the hundred somethingth time.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.140
It's going to work.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.360
That is going to work.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.580
Oh

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.640
I think today might be the day.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.000
[MUSICAL IMPACT]

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.680
Haha, got the secondaries.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.280
Look at those, man.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.060
Wow

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.740
[MUSIC CONTINUES]

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.380
I started this process simply wanting to recreate something that captured my imagination.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.780
But obviously it morphed into something much larger than that.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.900
It wasn't about fluid dynamics or motion control.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.940
It was about patience and persistence.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.920
The value of surrounding yourself with people who get this, cannot be overstated.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.920
David wouldn't quit, which taught me to power through,

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.020
even when it might not make sense on paper.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.640
Every time we failed, we learned something.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.220
So ask yourself this:

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.040
What are you too intimidated to try?

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.500
All you gotta do is fill the tank back up, and give it another shot.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.360
So three years, and a bunch of ink in an aquarium?

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.440
No, this is so much more than that -- this is what taught me persistence.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.700
For you, example, what is your vortex collision?

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.300
Is it something at school that's hard, a subject?

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.220
Is it a project at work that you don't think you can overcome?

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.000
Is it some skill you want to learn?

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.220
What is the thing you have to overcome,

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.160
and how are you going to do it?

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.540
The payoff here, was visual data that was not filmed with a potato.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.000
This is a big deal, because we can now see things,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.760
we could never see before.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.680
For example, if you look closely,

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.820
you can see as the outer ring of the vortex starts to break up,

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.000
you get these little nodules that have a low pressure spot right in the middle.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.520
and Don Pettit, an astronaut, his theory is that, that low pressure zone starts to suck material away

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.400
from the outside perimeter, breaking up the ring into regular intervals.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.520
The next part, however, remains a mystery:

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:50.620
how does that, once it breaks up, turn 90Â°, and turn into a ring facing outwards?

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.260
That is the mystery, and now we have the visual data to look at it.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.660
You can see that over on the second channel, I have twelve hours of footage of everything

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.700
we recorded, it's all there, go check that out if you're interested in seeing how all this stuff works.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.900
I want to say thanks to the sponsor which is Audible.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.040
you can get an audio book for free by going to

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.560
or texting the word: "smarter" to 500-500.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.660
I recommend the book "Letters to a Young Scientist" by E. O. Wilson.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.080
He's an amazing Pulitzer Prize winning author that tells you

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.120
at the end of his career, tells you young scientists what path you should take, and how you should go about it.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.840
You can listen to this entire book on one road trip,

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.400
or just a couple of commutes. I highly recommend "Letters to a Young Scientist" by E. O. Wilson,

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.780
get that by going to:

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.960
You get that book for free and a thirty-day free trial, or you can text the word:

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.000
"smarter" to 500-500, and they'll send you a link.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.200
OK, I hope you enjoyed this video, I hope it earned your subscription

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.320
obviously this was a lot of work, I would love it if this was the video that you started

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.120
the subscription to Smarter Every Day on, that would be awesome.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.320
Anyway, big thanks to David, thank you to Gordon from A Shell In The Pit for writing this song

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.280
specifically for this video, and also to the patrons,

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.820
who have supported Smarter Every Day in the background for years,

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.940
and let me do long, drawn out projects like this, it's fantastic.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.040
I learned a lot, I hope you did too,

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.540
I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day,

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.020
have a good one, bye.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.140
Hey, on the way out here, a lot of times

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:17.520
people will share a video like this in the form of GIFs, and this took so long and so much effort,

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.040
I would really appreciate it you'd get people here to the channel

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.120
by sharing the entire video, that is such a big help.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:28.640
Patrons, I left the hi-res images of these shots on Patreon so you can print those out

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.640
and stare at them like I do, cause they're awesome. Thank you so much for enjoying this

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.960
with me, I appreciate ya. Bye.
