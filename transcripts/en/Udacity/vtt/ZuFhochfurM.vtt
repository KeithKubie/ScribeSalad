00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.360
Now that we have seen some examples of semantic networks,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.000
let us try to characterize semantic networks as a knowledgeable presentation.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.660
A knowledgeable presentation, will have a lexicon. That tells us

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.100
something about the vocabulary of the presentation language. A structure

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.340
which tells us about how the words of that vocabulary can be composed together

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.270
into complex representations and the semantics which tells us how

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.360
the representation allows us to draw inferences so that we can in fact reason.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.360
In case of semantic network the basic lexicon consists of nodes that

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.100
capture objects. So, x, y, z. What about this structural specification?

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.300
Structural specification here consists of links which have directions.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.810
These links capture relationships and allows to compose these notes together

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.480
into complex representations. What about the semantics? In case of semantics,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.070
we are going to put labels on these links which are then going to

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.070
allow us to do, draw inferences and do reasoning over these representations.
