00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now, this is a huge claim for Newton to be making--

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that there is some mysterious entity pulling apples to the ground,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
which he calls some force--iin fact, it calls it "gravity"--and that that same force somehow

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
causes the moon to go in a circular orbit around the earth.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Now, Newton calls this force gravity, and there's a few properties he claims it has.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
He calls it a mutually attractive force, which means that all objects,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
anything with mass, attracts every other object with mass.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So, right now my hand is attracted to this pen with some gravitational force,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
just as he claims the earth is attracted to the moon.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Next, he claims this force is proportional to 1/r².

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
When I say "r", I mean the separation distance between the center

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
of the two things we're talking about.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We talked about this idea of proportionality last time,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and we know that 1/r² means that if we were to, say, double this distance

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
what would happen to the force?

00:00:54.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Use your knowledge of proportionality to answer this question as best you can.
