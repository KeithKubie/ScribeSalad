00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.880
You know what’s fun about summertime?

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:02.880
Going swimming.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.200
You know what’s not so fun?

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.210
Catching diseases from the germ infested water.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.240
Hey guys, Chastity here for DNews.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.240
Summer is coming.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.620
As the temperatures warm up, many of you will
be hitting the beaches or hanging out at the

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.620
pool.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.560
But something dangerous lurks in those waters.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.640
I’m not talking about sharks.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.640
Chances are, you’re swimming in germs.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.890
In the U.S., oceans are contaminated with
oil, sewage, and storm runoff containing parasites,

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.720
bacteria, and viruses.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.460
These can cause a number of diseases.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.351
According to the EPA, up to 3.5 million people
become ill from contact with raw sewage from

00:00:35.351 --> 00:00:37.739
sanitary sewer overflows each year.

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.559
Polluted beach water-related illnesses include
stomach flu, skin rashes, pinkeye, respiratory

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.489
infections, meningitis, and hepatitis.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.630
Legionnaire’s disease can be contracted
by inhaling contaminated mist or vapor.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.719
This form of pneumonia is a common waterborne
infection that causes high fever, coughing,

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:53.719
and muscle aches.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.059
Health officials recommend waiting at least
72 hours after a storm before going into the

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.059
ocean.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.879
Within those 72 hours, coastal waters are
polluted with runoff that may contain sewage

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.699
from sewer pipes and manholes.

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.950
According to a study conducted by the Santa
Monica Bay Restoration Project, there is an

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.320
increased risk for swimmers within 400 yards
of a flowing storm drain.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.670
So watch where you swim.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.670
Surfers and divers are at greater risk of
getting sick from infested water than swimmers.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.262
Staphylococcus aureus is a common bacteria
found on the human body, but a cut or a wound

00:01:22.262 --> 00:01:25.170
in the skin can open it up to a staph infection.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.260
Surfers are especially prone to staph infections
and are at risk of the more resistant strain,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.350
MRSA, especially if they have wounds that
are not properly treated.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.990
The results can be life-threatening.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.670
Orange County surfer Timmy Turner nearly died
after a staph infection attacked his brain.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.240
Water went up his nose during a stormy day,
which started off with sinusitis and an ear

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.719
infection and lead to something much worse.

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:48.979
Last Christmas, former surf champion Gary
Ault died from a staph infection, after surfing

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.700
in San Diego two days after a rainstorm.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.880
Swimming in lake water comes with risks, too.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.530
Last summer, 70 people who swam at an Oregon
lake caught norovirus, a virus that causes

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.399
inflammation of the stomach and large intestine
lining.

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.609
More than half were children between the ages
of 4 and 10.

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:08.429
Officials believe a swimmer with norovirus
infected the water with vomit or diarrhea,

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.819
which the other swimmers then swallowed.

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:11.819
Gross.

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.040
While that may have been an extreme isolated
incident, lakes and streams are still in danger

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.010
of pollution from sewage, livestock waste,
and improperly functioning septic systems.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.690
Also, when entering the water, you should
look out for blue-green algae, also known

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.470
as cyanobacteria.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.060
Swimmers and water skiers may experience stomach
pain, vomiting, diarrhea, or an allergic reaction

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.159
after contacting water with this toxic blue-green
algae.

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.680
So I’ve scared you off from open water,
but surely swimming pools and hot tubs must

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.720
be safe, right?

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.720
They’re chlorinated!

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.240
Sorry guys, but the chlorine used to disinfect
pools does not kill all germs instantly.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.129
According to the CDC, there are germs tolerant
to chlorine that can take anywhere from minutes

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.819
to days for chlorine to kill them.

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.730
If you swallow or breathe in even a little
water with these germs, you can catch a Recreational

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.730
Water Illness, or RWI.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:54.730
RWI’s include gastrointestinal, skin, ear,
respiratory, eye, neurologic, and wound infections.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.200
But the most common RWI is diarrhea.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.019
Cryptosporidium, a diarrhea causing parasite,
can survive for days in well-maintained pools.

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.709
Reported crypto cases went from just over
3,000 in 2004 to 10,500 in 2008.

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:42.790
That’s an increase of over 200 percent!
