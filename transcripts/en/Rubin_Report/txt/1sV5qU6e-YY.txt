Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible] all right, let's talk about systemic racism or at least the idea of systemic racism. So I think you've seen the video of me about two or two and a half years ago with Larry elder and I brought up systemic racism. Larry elder proceeded to commit a hate crime on me, a white man. He beat me senseless with statistics and I came to a fight not ready to fight basically. And that was definitely one of my red pillow moments, so to speak. I was not prepared. I heard new information. I did research after that. Subsequently, I've had many people on this show and many conversations, uh, that have led me to two more of Larry's original premise. Um, so I guess first when you, when you saw that moment, uh, was that the first time you'd ever seen me do anything? Cause that's, a lot of people tell me and I'm like, oh, I don't think it was the first time. But I think, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:58          I mean I don't envy anyone who is debating Larry elder on anything. He's, he's pretty devastating.

Speaker 1:          01:05          It must've been kind of refreshing though when you saw this moment where he laid it out and yeah. You know there was no counter cause there is no counter. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:14          Well yeah he, he what he did with you there is he, he went through each specific venue in which supposedly there is this big systemic racism problem where the system is rigged in such a way that it doesn't require any individual in the system to be racist in order for the system to spit out racist outcomes. That's essentially the idea of systemic racism. So he went, he went with you through, he said just name, name a place in society where you think systemic racism exists and he just di Ba ba basically destroyed each one with the specifics of, of the case. And I'm not going to do a better job than he did there and then he's capable of doing. But there's a bigger picture way to test this systemic racism hypothesis, which is to take two populations where it's, it's a very messy crude science experiment.

Speaker 2:          02:10          But to take two populations where you're holding systemic racism, constant, namely black Americans like myself and black immigrants, especially black immigrants from the West indies and their children. So we're talking about immigrants from Jamaica, Barbados, other places in the West indies and specifically their children. They're American born children. So these are people you could not tell apart from black. Like you couldn't tell if I didn't tell you that I wasn't the child of a Jamaican immigrant or something. Right. And you find that the, the thing about these is that these two populations differ in many ways. Some, some, some ways are very hard to quantify, but they differ culturally. They differ for all kinds of reasons. Um, because partially because the kind of immigrant who gets out of a Jamaica differs systematically is going to be disproportionately intelligent, disproportionately hardworking, whatever the traits are that get you from Jamaica to New York.

Speaker 2:          03:07          Say That's a cluster of attributes that that makes that population differ. But there's, there's one thing that is not different, which is they're subjected to whatever level of systemic racism exists. So t Thomas soul has done good work on it. Back in the 70s, he showed that, uh, second generation west Indian west Indians living in the same city as black Americans were earning 58% more, right? So they're, they're both being treated to whatever degree badly by white people there. Whatever this, whatever system you want, I suppose is holding by people back is equally affecting both of them. Uh, the, the Columbia. So sociologist van Tran has a great essay in which, uh, um, the, this, this difference is brought out. You find neighborhoods of, of black Americans right next to neighborhoods of black west Indians in New York, they're equally segregated from white people. So it gets rid of, you know, the, the idea that being segregated by a seller, living around people who only look like you is inherently a, um, a disadvantage.

Speaker 2:          04:19          Um, it gets around the policing issue because these populations are being police. The police can't tell the difference between a second generation west Indian end and a black person. It gets around whatever level of systemic racism is or isn't in, in the pipeline with regard to schools and you find wildly different outcomes. You find, you know, rate of high school graduation, much higher for Black West Indians, uh, rate of enrollment in college, much higher rate of professional occupation, much higher crime, lower right. So this suggests to me that there are, that, that the role of systemic racism tool to whatever degree it exists is, is minimal at this point. Uh, and there's a whole narrative built around the idea that this is the primary obstacle facing black people. And it's worth noting, I don't, I don't think most black people actually believe this because I mean there are various poles to site here, but there's, there's one from Pew that, that asked black people without s without college educations has, has race.

Speaker 2:          05:29          How has your race held you back at all in life? 60% said no. It's a recent pew poll. Another Gallup poll asked his bias, the main issue facing you in, in, in jobs and housing. 60% again said no. The A, a Harvard sociologist, Ethan Foss has done extensive polling of the black community and found that disconnected black youth, which are, you know, black youth without who aren't in schools and don't have the jobs. The people on the lowest rung of society may something something around 30% of them think the system is rigged and 70% don't. So what, what we're getting is we're getting the voices of black people who believe the systemic racism narrative promoted to the, to the most powerful media positions in our country. So we're getting the impression that this is a uniform view and it's not

Speaker 1:          06:20          right. So this is sort of the Jesse Jackson's Al Sharp. They get moved up because they're given sort of simple answers. Right. So I guess it, it hearkens the question then I can ask this either way. What is it that the west Indian immigrants are doing right? Or what is it that the other folks are doing wrong? Yeah, I mean you can answer that in either direction you want to go first.

Speaker 2:          06:43          Well, partly I, part of it is just immigration selection factors that I mentioned. Right? So the, the kind of Jamaican or Barbadian who makes it off the island to New York did likely to be disproportionately hardworking, disproportional, disproportionately x for whatever x factor is. And so in that sense the direct comparison can be misleading, but it just analyzing why these two populations differ. You Find West Indian immigrants, uh, more likely to come from a two parent home. Um, you know, more likely to have, have had a more classically socially conservative upbringing, which is, you know, you don't talk back to your parents. Parents are rather strict. There are downsides of course to that style of parenting. But um, basically what I'm saying is that there are cultural factors that are important that differ between these two groups. Right? And you find the, there, there are many, I mean this is, this is where the conversation for many people gets especially uncomfortable, right? It's the idea that every culture, every subculture is identical in the behave behavioral patterns that are inculcated and wherever there is some, wherever there is a disparity in some outcome, it's not possible that culture accounts for some or most of of that disparity, which I think is very silly idea.

Speaker 1:          08:09          Well, it's completely nonsensical. Yeah. Cultures are different. Different people and different groups put different emphasis on certain things. So I'm a little more on families and put more on education, so but more on sports or whatever the hell, whatever the hell it is. So when you hear Larry elder make the argument, you know, something around until 1972 the black family had a higher rate of, of staying in marriages and then he lays out the reasons that he believes policies of the Democrats destroyed all that. That that obviously resonates with you. Right? Because you're, you're giving me some piece of this. Both answers I think resonate or went back to family rates of marriage and some sort of conservative ideals. Right? Well, yeah. I mean that's a very complex, people hate when you talk with, when anyone talks about this about family, people just absolutely hate it. It is a fact

Speaker 2:          08:56          that black, the, the rate of two parent homes and marriages was pretty similar to the white rate until the 60s. Um, it is, it is a, it's a matter of scholarly dispute as to what was the cause I think it's certain at this point there was no one cause welfare state may have had something to do with it, but I think it may have just been changing norms in the culture. What, cause we're seeing the same thing happen in, in, in the white working class as well now with the decline of, of two parent homes to a lesser extent than, than has happened in the black community. Um, yeah. So, so I guess what, yeah, so I mean we could talk about some of the, the most important behavioral patterns that are different between a black families and white families and Asian families. Um, I mean there, there are some statistics that I, I just, I don't see any way in which this could possibly be explained by systemic racism.

Speaker 2:          09:55          For example, one is that if you ask 13 year olds if they've had their first sexual experience yet, you get 9% of of white saying yes, you got 21% of black people saying yes. Right? So it's more than a two fold difference there. And that has everything to do with family dynamics with, with there not being two parents in the home. It is a development issue more than it is an issue of treatment by white people. Right. I have another piece in Colette, uh, called Black American culture and, and the racial wealth gap where I talk about spending differences and you, you, you know, Nielsen, the marketing firm has done, done research on this, found that the average black woman is more likely to own a luxury vehicle than the average white woman. Despite the fact that the average black family has one 10th the wealth of, of, of the average average white family spending patterns on, on jewelry and expensive clothes are very different in the black community. Um, whatever you want to say about these from an ethical a, this is not a, I mean I'm not big in the ethical judgment is, I mean I'm not finger wagging and people saying do x, don't do y. I'm saying there are, there are entire books written by respected left wing scholars about issues like wealth or income or that just don't mention a single one of these facts as if it's not relevant. Right. So what's the,

Speaker 1:          11:28          what's the through line then or the connection between all of this and the welfare state? Because the more that I've explored these ideas, the more that I am starting to buy that that almost is the real problem here that we've given a certain amount and then it's just human nature. People don't want to stop being on the Dole. That has nothing to do with race. You could give it to anyone. But in this case, we happen be talking about black Americans, but I can give you just one simple example, which is my sister lives in a, in Manhattan, not that far from you actually, and she's in a building that's part subsidized. So there's a lot of black people in the building that had been there for generations now that are, they're subsidized. My sister and her husband, two kids, they're not rolling in dough. They're paying full market price. But the people that are in the subsidized housing, it's almost impossible for them to leave. I don't even blame them because they're paying next to nothing. And if they wanted to work more, they'd probably, and then get off the subsidies. The subsidies, they probably have to leave the building in the first place and then go live somewhere worse. So we end up with this horrific catch 22 that again, I don't believe, I don't put this on race. It just seems to be affecting people of a certain race more.

Speaker 2:          12:38          Yes. I think, I mean, I think it's clear that there was a point in, in, in the late sixties and seventies where the welfare state was clearly incentivizing counterproductive behavior disproportionately among black people. Um, I mean, the reason I, yeah, I, I, I, I don't, I think we need a welfare state. I think there's, there's really no free market. There's no capitalist economy in the world that doesn't have one because they're just, and you know, people's jobs are being taken by automation and that's only going in one direction. And we clearly need a welfare state and we need one that doesn't incentivize, uh, you know, counterproductive behavior. And we haven't always had that. And when you say,

Speaker 1:          13:27          you mean some sort of social safety net? Yes, correct. Because I think people would, you say welfare state, I think people have a different sort of, kind of

Speaker 2:          13:33          perhaps. Yeah. I mean as social, I mean something that catches the people who can't really, can't help themselves, who can't trade their skills for money in the market. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          13:43          I'm with Ya. So, so then how do we untether the issue of people that are now stuck in that machine where every time you talk about it, you're called a racist?

Speaker 2:          13:53          No, I mean this is, yeah, it is extremely pernicious because I think it's clear that the welfare state, the way it was rolled out in the sixties and seventies had bad effects for black people. Right? It's, it's, it's hard to fully explain the decline in two parent homes without noticing that, you know, a black mother in the early seventies stood to lose money by getting married to a guy. Right? Because of the perverse incentives of the welfare state. That said, it's not just because the welfare state was one of the causes of the decline of the black family doesn't imply that taking it away would repair it. So I think, I think that is something like Charles Murray, for example, grow big book in the 80s that made him big losing ground, which criticize the welfare state very much along these grounds. But I think even he has acknowledged that at this point removing it once you've said it all into motion, it's not obvious that removing it is a cure, which is, which is tragic, but

Speaker 1:          14:58          true. Yeah, it's, it's a real tragedy because then it's like, I mean this is where you would definitely have a difference of opinion with Candice. We're at her argument is rip the Bandaid, rip the Bandaid, let the pieces fall where they may, I don't know what her policy is on that and helping the poorest of the poor or whatever. Like are you literally going to be kicking people out of their houses? I don't know what the answer to that is, but I think there's, there's a growing feeling I think at least at a certain set of people that it's not working. You're acknowledging why it's not working and these little bandaid fixes seemingly only make it worse.

Speaker 2:          15:30          Yeah. It's, I think it's a very complex issue because there are some, there are some elements of the social safety net that I think economists agree are working like the earned income tax credit, which actually incentivizes you to work. It helps the worst off people in society without, it basically corrects the massive mistake of welfare in the Lyndon Johnson era. Um, but yeah, no, it's a, it's a complex issue.

Speaker 1:          15:56          Yeah, sure. So I hate to talk about race this whole time. It's like kind of annoying. I know it's what you mostly write about. What else is kind of on your mind? Like what are the other issues that you care about? I mean, we can keep going on that, but I always feel like it's like, it's, that's also a sort of tragedy of all of this. It's like your whole world view is to move past all this and yet because of that you get thrust into the conversation. It's a weird, a weird psychological condition, I suppose. Yes, it is. Does that just drive you crazy in general?

Speaker 2:          16:25          Yeah. I mean I don't, before we move on, I am racist. Not something I find inherently interesting. Yeah. I think it is like when I have, when I have a free moment to, to read a book, I'm not ordering the race book because, but at the same time, it is a topic that's looms so large in our politics. And so much of what is said makes so little sense that I, it, it, it just gets to me. So I have to say something, but it's not something I enjoy. I mean what, what I really enjoy is a philosophy and science. Um, so, so when I have free moments, I tend to read things in those, in those Janrus.

Speaker 1:          17:06          Yeah. Well you're working for the right lady Claire Over collect cause that's what she cares about too. So actually we can shift a little bit. So, uh, you attended an event, uh, that, uh, there's an IDW group in New York put together. Uh, it was put together in like two or three days. It was me and Eric Weinstein and Faisal Machar and Melissa Chen. And we're just kind of doing like IDW one on one stuff. And you, you asked me an interesting question during the Q and a, so I'll let you present the question and then I want to hear your answer actually before I repeat my answer. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          17:38          So my, my question was essentially there are a lot of people who really don't like the intellectual dark web. I think it's just a bunch of cranks who are, you know, playing footsie the outright in this objectionable way, um, and totally dismissed the whole thing. But then there are, there are, there are many other people who think, well, you know, I, I like, I like half of the people in the, in the intellectual dark web, you know, I don't maybe like the other half, but I think it's, they have a kind of nuanced take on it, but they're really where one loses them is the fact that, you know, you've had Stefan Molyneux ma, I don't know how to promote some new Molyneux. Right. So this, this, this character that people view as objectionable to whatever degree. I Dunno, I don't follow him. So I don't know whether they should or shouldn't view him that way.

Speaker 2:          18:30          But you know, or Sam Harris has had Charles Murray on the podcast, which you know, many, he just has a terrible reputation on the left, largely undeserved or Joe Rogan head. Alex Jones done. Exactly. We can do, you can do this ad infinitum. And it seems like that is is the last place where people who might otherwise see this phenomenon as good get off the ship. Yeah. Or I've, I've had, I think I've had conversations with people where that was kind of the last trench to die in, in terms of criticizing the phenomenon. So my question was, what do you like, what do you think about this, do you think? I mean, this is also a criticism that Barry Weiss raised in her, in her piece about it. So I guess my answer to that would be, I'm, I mean, well, do you know this guy, Daryl Davis? He, he, he's a black guy who did a documentary, can't remember the name of it, where he met with the white supremist.

Speaker 2:          19:30          He met with Ku Klux Klan members as a black person and just hung out with them, talk to them about various issues. Became friends with them. Right? So imagine the psychological courage this takes to sit across from someone who literally thinks you are an inferior kind of human being. And to put that aside and just expand your circle of empathy to include them preemptively, incredibly inspirational. So, and he ends up getting over 200 Ku Klux Klan members to renounce their membership and he keeps their robes in his closet as a kind of trophy of having d radicalized them. Okay. And then he gets harshly criticized from blacks, black lives matter for having, having done this, um, which is, which I find, I find to be the most galling irony in the world because we're talking about a person who has done more to reduce racism in this society than almost anyone I could name in black lives matter, right?

Speaker 2:          20:30          He is, he is gone like a, you know, many, many progressive activists, they, they tend to go to the spaces that are actually most progressive already and try to make them even more progressive. So they show up on the university campuses already the most progressive places on planet earth and then accused them of being systemically racist. Right. So we're talking about a guy who actually went into the trenches. Yeah. He plays the belly of the beast. Exactly. And was successful in d radicalizing people from white racism. Um, the, the point, the point I'm making here is not, not to compare obviously Charles Murray or Stefan to, to a Ku Klux Klan member. My point is we ought to be expanding the range of people were willing to talk to and disagree with. And I think that insofar as you're able to challenge people or just expose, expose people's ideas, I think that in the long run, as uncomfortable as it is and counterintuitive as it is, tends to, tends to be better.

Speaker 1:          21:31          Yeah. So I'll just repeat it quickly, but that in essence, that last portion especially really was my answer. Now, first off, some of us Rogan me in San particularly, we interview people. So we can't say we're for plurality of ideas and we want to talk to people we disagree with and all that. And then only talk to people we agree with. So that means we are going to talk to some of these characters without getting into any of the specifics of the people that I've had on the show. Of course, sometimes somebody you may not ask the right question here or there. I'm not even, I'm not even saying that that's what I did or didn't do. But you have like, otherwise we're not taking any risks. And the group of people that will talk to will become infinitely smaller and smaller and smaller. And also we'll be sort of, um, we'll be hostages to people that don't like us in the first place.

Speaker 1:          22:19          And that's what I'm more concerned about. It's like, I don't want people who don't want any conversation to be happening at all to have ownership over who I'm going to talk to. Yeah. Now, on any specific moment, could any of us do something a little bit differently? Sure. But in essence, yeah, you're asking about the gatekeeping that, that Barry was talking about. Yeah. I don't even know that it's, it's for me to say. And as I said before, you know, we don't even have, it's not like we're walking around with laminated cards and we'd go to a secret meetings. I'm right. But I think the best sunlight is the best disinfectant. I just, I just fundamentally believe that. And as far as I know, no one was hurt by any of the interviews that I've done. And I think I've, I've helped a lot of people that were maybe into some of those ideas.

Speaker 1:          23:01          You know, that was the one that people were giving me a lotta. That's the day I said Daryl Davis phenomenon 80. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, nobody's lost. I mean, that's what I really believe. And maybe that's a little, um, rose colored glasses of me. But I believe that, you know, when, when people were giving me crap for doing Alex Jones to like, forget what he thinks about things for a moment, clearly hundreds of thousands or millions of people are watching this. I came on on a live show. I said, whatever. I believe, I didn't lie about anything. I said the same thing as I say here. And then I got emails from his people saying, you know, I never heard a decent liberal talk before. Now I watched your interview with Bret Weinstein. So like, wow, that's pretty cool man. So I just think perhaps we, and I mean you and I in this case, we just have a little bit more

Speaker 2:          23:46          tolerance for, I don't think if someone hears something it's going to immediately infect them and then they're going to take that infection and infect other people. But I think a lot of people operate in that prison. I think so, uh, one of the reasons I asked this question at the event is I was glad you did by the way. Yeah. It's because, for example, Charles Murray has retweeted some of my pieces and you know, I've, I've gotten into exchanges with some of my critics where I've, I've kind of talked them down off of the ledge of me being a sellout or convinced them that I'm, I'm operating in good faith and the trench there dying and criticizing me is, well, Charles Murray retweeted you and he is x, y and Z. Therefore, I think a, that's just, that's like two layers of Ad Hominem. Ad Hominem is attacking you instead of your belief, but attacking someone else instead of your belief.

Speaker 2:          24:43          It's like, that's a bit much. Yeah, it's Ad Hominem twice over. But we seem to be in this, in this place now where people like lists, you know, the SPLC is making lists of people that are bad people. You know, there was this alternative influencer graph that you probably saw that tried to link together. I didn't even know, probably 10 or 15 of the people on there and I don't, you know, and I looked at the list after where they're including me in this like crazy, whatever it was, white supremacists list or something. Not only did I not know plenty of the people, several of them I have muted because they hate me. So it's like, like you just come together with anyone that has walked past you. Oh, you shook hands with that guy. You didn't know who he was. Too Bad. You're, you're screwed man.

Speaker 2:          25:20          Yeah, that's it. No, I think, I think I was telling this to you before we filmed, but I think we live in a McCarthy asked era with regard to, especially racism, but also other, other isms. Um, I mean I hope historians look back on it as that, but you know, we're getting, we're getting people fired for, you know, for saying the n word and an antiracist context. You know, Papa John's for example, the CEO of that got fired for saying the n word and there was no pushback on that. The Guy said it in the context of an anti racist razor, like recalling his, the racist of his youth and the heinous things they would say. Yeah, right. And it gets fired and get, gets his name taken off the gym of his local hometown. Just gets his reputation deep. Sixth and right. So like this is happening.

Speaker 2:          26:11          It happened a month later to, to, to this executive at Netflix who's in a, in a meeting about offensive words and Netflix is comedy context. So how do you have a meeting about offensive words without saying offensive words unless you're just going to be talking like alphabet soup and the entire time. So he says this fired. So these are note nobody upon reflection thinks that these people are racists. It is completely, it is, it is analogous to McCarthyism in that sense. And the word racism has been denuded so fully of of its, of its moral valence and its moral charge at this point that you know, people, you know, we're, we're caring less and less about actual racism too. That that's a fear here. Like, once you, once you strip this word of all of this all its moral charge, then you have a boy who cried wolf scenario, which ends up backfiring spectacularly. And I would argue that that is happening. We're seeing a, a surge, uh, on the, on the far right as well. Right. So I think

Speaker 1:          27:14          that that was also my concern. I mean, before the election, I did plenty of videos about you gotta stop calling Trump Hitler. Yeah. Because if he is not Hitler, and for all the reasons that people don't like them, the guy's not Hitler. And it's like you keep doing that. You won't even realize when the real bad guys go. Yeah. And the people that would be sympathetic to your views will no longer listen to you. Yeah. Because they'll view you as the boy who cried wolf.

Speaker 2:          27:36          Yeah. And Bill Mar del Mar called himself out for doing this for calling, you know, Bush and Romney racists or whatever it was.

Speaker 1:          27:44          Right. He said that Romney or hated women.

Speaker 2:          27:46          Yes, yes. Yeah. And he called himself out for being hyperbolic so that when, when trunk Trump came along who actually has done clearly or has said clearly misogynous things is alleged to have said some things that if he did say them are, are clearly racist. Yeah. Um, people don't care anymore because they've been so solid. You know, they've, they've been called racist a thousand times by the pundits at Msnbc and it's, it's been true maybe 10% of the times, but not true. Like for the, the, the funniest case of this to me was, uh, when, when Trump called Omarosa a dog, right? At Wash u turn on NBC and Msnbc after this or are read the New York Times. It is just obvious to those people that this is a racist slur. He's called this black woman a dog. This is obviously racist. And if you're defending it, you're a racist too.

Speaker 2:          28:41          Okay. And then you just, if you have an internet connection, yeah. You look at the other people, Trump has directly called the dog. You find Mac Miller before he passed away. Of course you find, um, David Axelrod, you find Adriana Huffington, just, you, you find white person after white person that he is directly called the dog, not said they did something like a dog cause he does, he likes that construction too. Right? But he's called the white person after white person a dog. There's no reason to believe that this was a racist incident. And yet every pundit at Msnbc is saying that it is. And anyone who likes Trump and you know, watches Fox News, they're getting these clips exported from MSNBC seeing themselves called as racist by called racist by implication or by association. And then seeing someone like Tucker Carlson who you know, I have, I have reservations about, but seeing someone like Tucker Carlson make perfect sense about it, just destroy this view with, with simple logic and facts and imagine how, how refreshing it is to have someone like Tucker doing that.

Speaker 2:          29:47          And obviously like you're, you're going to get tired of being called a racist in, in cases when it's so obviously not true and there's just a lack of due diligence. There's a lack of any concern for, for facts. And for logic and that ends up having a very, uh, a bad effect on the other end because now Trump, I mean there are some things Trump has said for which racism I think is the best explanation. I don't think he's a Klan member. I think he's a very mild kind of New York racist of his era. You know, there, there degrees of racism in other words. But the point is, it's like the, the reason that Trump voters, I think for the most part, excuse him, on some of the things he said is not because, or not for the most part because of a random upsurge and racism that happened in 2016 but wasn't present the past eight years. You, they're like, there are counties that went for Obama twice that went for Trump. It is, it is. I think it's largely because people are absolutely sick of, of being tarred as racists, untethered to the facts of the specific cases.

Speaker 1:          30:56          Yeah. And then now we've got just the match made in hell. We've got a group that calls everyone racist. The guy who, you know, is happy to bite them on every bit of it and use that as fuel to get his base going. And Yeah. So what do you, somehow I said we were going to shift that a race and we went right back to exactly. Yeah. All right. We're going to try to finish up something else. But what do you, what do you even consider yourself politically these days? If I, if I was trying to label you, I mean I have a sense, you know, you're somewhere in that classical liberal situation, but does, does that even matter to you? Do you, do you think of yourself a certain way?

Speaker 2:          31:26          I think if you can be gender fluid, you should be able to be political fluid at this point. Yeah. I think, uh, I don't,

Speaker 1:          31:33          and I, I find your political views to be,

Speaker 2:          31:36          I appreciate that. I appreciate that. Um, no, but I think, I mean, it is, it is strange that is it, like politics is a social construct, political ideologies. These are fully social constructs and it seems like we're getting more and more rigid with the degree to which we take them seriously. Um, obviously one should take ideas seriously, but I don't see anything to be gained from anchoring myself to conservatism or liberalism or libertarianism, even though I find wisdom and, and all of these three, uh, political ideologies. Um, so yeah, I mean, I think, I think if I can, if I can make politically fluid a meme, that would be, that'd be great. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          32:21          I will see what I can do. All right. Give me one other thing besides race. What are you doing for fun days? Man,

Speaker 2:          32:25          I'm reading, I'm reading a lot about, I'm taking metaphysics, taking philosophy of language in mind. Both of them.

Speaker 1:          32:33          What are you doing? Facetime, reading metaphors. You've got a political future in front of you or, Oh God, no.

Speaker 2:          32:40          And this is the of it, right? People often ask me that. No, I would never go into politics. Actually. People assume that about me, which I think is really interesting because I detest politics. I hate it so much. Um, yeah, no, I don't. I Dunno. I Dunno why I give that vibe off, but it's, yeah. I, I cannot see myself as a politician. You're too sane. That's the problem. It's been a pleasure, man. Likewise. All right. We're more on Coleman. Follow them on the Twitter at Cold X. Man.
