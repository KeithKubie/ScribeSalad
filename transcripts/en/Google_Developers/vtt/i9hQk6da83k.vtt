LAURA DELLA TORRE: Hi.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.060
I'm Laura Della Torre.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.590
I'm on the Developer
Marketing Team

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.570
on the Google Play
side of things.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.580
Today, we've got a
special treat for you.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.140
We know that we get a
lot questions, requests,

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.820
and wish list items
for how we can

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.680
help you grow your
business on Google Play.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.850
I have a special treat.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.010
We have some product
managers, we have our business

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.080
development folks,
and we're going

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.120
to have them give
a quick short intro

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.890
but then what we want
to do is we actually

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.460
want to throw the
questions out at you.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.710
Here are the product managers.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.610
This is a great opportunity for
you to get in what you need.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.710
I get a lot of questions.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.430
Do you have x?

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.560
Do you have y?

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.160
If you want your voices heard,
this is the place to be.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.660
So with that, I am going
to go ahead and hand

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.530
the mic on over to Greg and
he'll introduced himself.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.280
GREG HARTRELL: Hi.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.440
I'm Greg Hartrell, the Lead
Product Manager for Google

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.877
Play games.

00:00:54.877 --> 00:00:55.585
ELLIE POWERS: Hi.

00:00:55.585 --> 00:00:56.580
I'm Ellie Powers.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.334
I'm the Lead Product Manager
for Apps on Google Play.

00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:00.000
DAN LAVELLE: Hi.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.320
I'm Dan Lavelle, End
Developer Operations,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.542
and I work with the folks
that support you day to day.

00:01:05.542 --> 00:01:07.250
SERGE KASSARDJIAN:
I'm Serge Kassardijan.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.740
I work in-- I lead up business
development for East Coast

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.817
Apps, Games, Partners.

00:01:12.817 --> 00:01:13.650
BRAHIM ELBOUCHIKIHi.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.660
I'm Brahim Elbouchiki.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.679
I work on Payments, Search,
Discovery for Google Play.

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:19.720
LAURA DELLA TORRE: Great.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.210
So first thing we want
to do is throw out

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.492
some easy questions for you.

00:01:23.492 --> 00:01:25.450
How many people, show of
hands, how many people

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.820
are making games?

00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:29.810
OK.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:30.950
The rest are apps?

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.030
Apps?

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.530
OK.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.030
Wow.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.630
OK, we got a good
apps folks here.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.991
Um, let's start off with hmm.

00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:43.800
Greg, what do you think?

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.700
Let's get the games
guys talking for a bit.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.020
Let's ask them some questions.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.350
What do you-- what do you want?

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.440
What kinds of things
are you looking

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.576
at building that you
want their input on?

00:01:54.576 --> 00:01:57.200
GREG HARTRELL: Yeah, to open up
the floor looking for questions

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.950
around-- we build
this game network

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.480
that we call Google
Play Games which

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.154
helps enhance gameplay and
get your game discovered.

00:02:04.154 --> 00:02:06.570
I think it'd be fascinating
to hear any questions that you

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.330
have around any
challenges integrating

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.930
those types of services or
getting your game discovered.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.990
Would love to hear
any type of feedback

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.450
that you have in that area.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.170
Maybe Ellie or Brahim,
you have other-- want

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.472
to add some texture to that?

00:02:24.824 --> 00:02:26.490
BRAHIM ELBOUCHIKI:
Do you want to answer

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.617
the question is that--

00:02:28.617 --> 00:02:30.450
LAURA DELLA TORRE: What
do you want to know?

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.920
BRAHIM ELBOUCHIKI: Oh, yeah.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.780
One is just the
basic like what are

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.000
a few things we could do
to change your businesses

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.320
and make them and help them
grow and make your lives easier

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.380
on the areas that I work on
way, which are like commerce

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.000
and payments, search,
and discovery.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.464
So how do you acquire users?

00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:54.130
How can we help you
acquire them better?

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.600
How do you-- what do you think
of the organic acquisition

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.890
on the Play store?

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.760
What do you think
of monetization?

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.660
You know, how are
the trends looking?

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.980
So anything around
that would be awesome.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.896
LAURA DELLA TORRE: Here,
I'm going to go ahead

00:03:06.896 --> 00:03:09.300
and I'll-- there you go.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.930
AUDIENCE: Well, I can address
the monetization question.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.690
So one of the
challenges of being

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:25.750
in the kids educational app
category is the monetization.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.620
We're sitting on a lot of users,
we have over 30 million users.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.840
But because only 2% of
them converts to paid,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.890
that creates the limits--
that limits the monetization.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.290
That's what the monetization is
limited, essentially 2%, right?

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.580
So if we are selling
our games to teach kids

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.091
how to learn their
letters and letters

00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:51.590
A through E available on the
free version, the rest is paid.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.580
Well, only 2% convert
and that's actually

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.970
considered pretty
good for-- compared

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.580
to even so our competitors.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.300
So maybe, OK, we
can get the rate up

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.980
if we optimize things to 3%.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.750
But it's still-- it's
a sad, it's a sad thing

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.710
that we should be
sitting on so many users

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.110
and have this kind
of monetization.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.110
And another thing, another
interesting phenomena

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.930
that I'm noticing is
that it's almost like--

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.880
so that's as far as the upsell.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.589
And as far as the
cross sell also,

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:26.120
70% of our users
download one app from us.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.319
Now this one is paid.

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:30.110
So in terms of cross
sell from one paid app

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.330
to another, what we are
seeing it's about 70%

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.550
have just one app.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.452
And that despite our
apps like literally

00:04:37.452 --> 00:04:39.410
stacked at the top of
the educational category,

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.420
number one, number two,
number three, and so on.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.870
So it's almost to
us, it almost seems

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.950
as if the user has x
amount of money to spend.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.950
It's like they-- let's
say they have $10 a month

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.040
they are going to spend.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.360
And no matter how many
apps you're offering,

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.560
that's just-- you can
be making more apps

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.110
but they still have the same
amount of money to spend.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.160
And they have to spend it on
you and on your competitors.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.860
So that has been a real problem.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.730
BRAHIM ELBOUCHIKI: Is
your app a paid app?

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.792
Or is it free with
in-app purchases?

00:05:13.792 --> 00:05:15.000
AUDIENCE: So we have 15 apps.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.050
And each one has--
there's a free app.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.960
And there is a paid app that
has more letters or more

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.920
numbers or more activities.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.200
That's the model right now.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.116
BRAHIM ELBOUCHIKI: OK.

00:05:27.116 --> 00:05:29.730
So, I think the freemium
model definitely

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.970
tends to have far
fewer convert to buyers

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.050
than your actual users.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.400
And the hope is that
your marginal costs,

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.580
so your incremental costs
of running the thing

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.070
is actually supported by such
a small number of buyers,

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.800
you might definitely
optimize and Ellie

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.090
might jump on this one, too,
by having the same app actually

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.182
have in-app purchases
in it so somebody

00:05:51.182 --> 00:05:52.390
can enhance their experience.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.650
I know a lot of schools
don't like that because they

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.420
want to have the "I want to
get the whole app going--"

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.740
AUDIENCE: Well, the school
thing is a separate conversation

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.573
because Google Play for
education right now,

00:06:00.573 --> 00:06:02.600
I mean we've-- you
know, like I said,

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.380
we're at the top of
the education category

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.090
and we've made like so far like
exactly $1,000 in the Google

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.950
Play for Education.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.347
So that's, again, not talking
main Google Play, just

00:06:11.347 --> 00:06:12.430
Google Play for Education.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.710
So that's still ramping up so
I'm not even that-- I'm not--

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.700
I'm not.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.552
I'm being patient.

00:06:18.552 --> 00:06:20.010
Obviously, it's
going to take time.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.120
You know this is a
big endeavor that's

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.130
Google is undertaking
with that so I'm

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.890
going to wait for
that to take off.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:36.380
But in Google Play, just
in regular Google Play,

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.960
we tried simply searching the
model to in-app purchases.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.680
So simply having the
same content available

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.651
as in-app purchase
doesn't do anything.

00:06:44.651 --> 00:06:46.150
In-app purchases
seemed to work when

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.990
you're playing an
arcade type games

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.700
and you're buying more lives
and you're buying more powers.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.550
So that works.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.920
But if you just take-- in a kid.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.425
So essentially when your
customer's a kid and the buyers

00:06:59.425 --> 00:07:02.075
are parents, so you
can't serve ads.

00:07:02.075 --> 00:07:04.200
The conventional in-app
purchases don't do anything

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.220
and it's a-- no, it
is really a-- the only

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.760
model right now, vital model is
the one we are using right now,

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.700
which is limited.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.330
Now subscription
would work if we

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.280
could have new content that
is being constantly released.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.670
But that's not applicable.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.391
So in the end, it's just a--

00:07:22.391 --> 00:07:23.766
BRAHIM ELBOUCHIKI:
I want to talk

00:07:23.766 --> 00:07:26.840
to you offline because I
think it feels like there's

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.860
a way for you to use in-app
for that, for your app as well.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.372
Maybe we'll catch up offline.

00:07:31.372 --> 00:07:32.413
LAURA DELLA TORRE: Great.

00:07:32.413 --> 00:07:35.680
Got a question?

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.230
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.820
My question is about the organic
discovery of apps and all.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.970
And how does the installation
and uninstallation

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.110
impacts that?

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.470
So what do count as install?

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.410
Is it the download started
or the download CRC

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:49.900
done and finished?

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.100
What counts as an
install in Play?

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:53.970
Because we've seen
some discrepancies

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:57.940
when we look at our own database
because we have a registration.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.190
So when we see the
registration and when

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.170
we look at the Play Store
count, there's some discrepancy.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:06.830
And when we see--
because our apps syncs,

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.470
we see the number
of unique syncs.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.300
What is an uninstall?

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.770
So how does that get in?

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.460
How do you measure
the uninstall?

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:20.040
And how does the uninstall
impacts the discoverability?

00:08:22.675 --> 00:08:24.300
BRAHIM ELBOUCHIKI:
I can take that one.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.460
So I can't really
disclose the details

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.350
of how we're using
all these signals.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:29.920
All I can tell you
is that they all

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.820
contribute to how the
organic discovery of your app

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:37.960
works, uninstalls, installs,
how much-- how long

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.490
is the install duration for?

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:40.615
There's a number of things.

00:08:40.615 --> 00:08:42.470
We've posted a
video, actually, one

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:45.600
of the DevBytes about search
and discovery on Google Play.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.780
So you can watch that.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.870
But the second part
of your question

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:51.777
was around-- sorry--
uninstalls, right?

00:08:51.777 --> 00:08:53.610
So installs definitely
really matter, right?

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:57.120
Because it's a signal about
whether is a user still engaged

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.380
with the application or not?

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.480
Have they-- ratings also
matter quite a bit, right?

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.850
So all of these
things are signals

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:07.020
that go into the overall model.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.370
AUDIENCE: So why do you
consider uninstalls specifically

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.060
intent to uninstall or
somebody hasn't connected

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.450
to the internet for
like a fortnight

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.760
and count that app
as an uninstall.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.540
Because what's
happening-- like the way--

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.480
BRAHIM ELBOUCHIKI: No, it has
to be a literal uninstall so--

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.110
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.200
Because the way it's
happening for me

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.480
is that my APK, for
some strange reason

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.020
end up on some third
party websites, OK.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.750
And now these guys--
I have no way for them

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:36.350
to like upgrade to
the latest version.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.242
And now these guys
are uninstalling.

00:09:38.242 --> 00:09:40.200
BRAHIM ELBOUCHIKI: But
if it wasn't distributed

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.130
through Play, it
doesn't matter, right?

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:45.410
AUDIENCE: No, but because
it has the same signature.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:45.910
OK.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:48.539
So when it uninstall, will
it imbed my discovery--

00:09:48.539 --> 00:09:50.830
BRAHIM ELBOUCHIKI: It's
uninstalled only on the system,

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.132
only on the device.

00:09:52.132 --> 00:09:53.840
If it's distributed
through a third party

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.320
website or somewhere, we--

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.028
AUDIENCE: No, no.

00:09:56.028 --> 00:09:58.670
So they got the same APK from
Play Store, they can download

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.344
and then they basically
provided for like you know--

00:10:02.344 --> 00:10:04.010
BRAHIM ELBOUCHIKI:
Let's take it offline

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:06.468
because I think it's specific
to what you're talking about.

00:10:06.468 --> 00:10:08.940
But I don't think
that's the case.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:13.360
AUDIENCE: So for example, if
I'm advertising an app in Asia,

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.920
because for me it's cheaper
20 cents per download,

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.700
around that.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.420
And how does the search rankings
and organic rankings will be

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.870
mattering in the US?

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:23.720
Will that affect?

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.000
Are all of the
continents or countries

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.880
are independent in the
rankings section because yeah?

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.860
BRAHIM ELBOUCHIKI:
So, so I hope it's

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.430
to basically have
a store per user.

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.370
So each user has a
unique store that

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:41.380
is personalized and
tailored to them.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.100
And so that would contribute.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.220
So if your installs
are coming from Asia,

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.070
then we can understand that
this is a popular app in Asia.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.000
And that would influence what
your growth is like in Asia.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.750
It will also be
signaled in the US

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.130
but this is all weighted
in different ways.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.070
But there is a signal of like
you're a popular app in Asia

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.474
because most of your
installs are in Asia.

00:11:00.474 --> 00:11:02.390
LAURA DELLA TORRE: I
know that a lot of people

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:05.056
want to ask a bunch of questions
but this is a great opportunity

00:11:05.056 --> 00:11:06.170
to get in your wish list.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.780
What I would love
to do is let's have

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:10.970
one of you guys ask a
question of the audience

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.355
and let's get their input.

00:11:14.355 --> 00:11:16.480
SERGE KASSARDJIAN: So one
of the big things for us,

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.220
we see a lot of people
invest a lot of time,

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.230
sources, people, money
into building apps.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.280
And we always struggle
trying to understand

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.420
what your success metrics are.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:31.550
So after the launch, after
something goes to market,

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:37.230
how do define successful and how
do you see success or failure?

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:44.220
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we do invest
a lot into building apps.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.011
I'm Rafael from
[INAUDIBLE] and we recently

00:11:46.011 --> 00:11:48.560
launched on the
Android Play Store.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.570
It was a great experience
because at first we

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.910
had some level of transparency
that we didn't have before

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:58.050
but to us, besides the usual
conversion, engagement,

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:01.780
and retention metrics that
are platform dependent,

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:05.350
I think the organic metric,
organic downloads are actually

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.964
the most important,
organic users really.

00:12:08.964 --> 00:12:10.630
I think there's
something very powerful,

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.450
potential in the Store which
is the +1 recommendation,

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.470
which is basically the only App
Store that provides this kind

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:17.982
of layer.

00:12:17.982 --> 00:12:19.440
Unfortunately, I
think we're really

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.170
missing the tools
to harness that.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:26.070
So we were able to get a lot of
+1s from a lot of people but we

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:29.430
have no ability to see how does
it impact keywords or how does

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:33.890
it impact the scoreability in
the store in an accurate way.

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:37.040
And it would make sense
that only some users have

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.135
social circles on Google
Plus and for those people,

00:12:41.135 --> 00:12:43.010
we should try to present
that in a better way

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.630
before there's just
a waste of time.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.980
And does it impact different
metrics on the store?

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.896
Because organic is really
the important thing.

00:12:48.896 --> 00:12:50.920
And organic, I think,
should be a common metric

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.350
between apps and the
store because if there

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:57.400
is organic downloads, it
means that the user is happy

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.400
and the app is happy.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.810
And I think there is
nowhere close to the ability

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:03.930
to really look into that and
understand how it impacts

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:06.730
and how to optimize for
that in a meaningful way.

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.330
And that is, I would say,
in the area of the +1,

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.790
first and foremost.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.630
But also in the
place for listing,

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.797
I think the ability to
test different versions

00:13:14.797 --> 00:13:16.630
and look at different
combinations for maybe

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:17.980
different kinds of users.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.535
I mean, we're-- there are many
different intents to download

00:13:20.535 --> 00:13:22.868
an app and we should be able
to test different variances

00:13:22.868 --> 00:13:23.369
of that.

00:13:23.369 --> 00:13:24.784
And I think, I
would say these are

00:13:24.784 --> 00:13:25.980
the two most important ones.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.771
SERGE KASSARDJIAN: And
how much A/B testing

00:13:27.771 --> 00:13:30.100
do you guys do across
the different versions

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.195
at the same time?

00:13:31.195 --> 00:13:33.070
AUDIENCE: So we do that
actually quite a lot.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.440
We use straight
roll out as well,

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.080
which is good for
some level of that.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.760
But for the Play
Store, we try to do it.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.740
We've even use some
external service that

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.300
is doing a proxy
for this testing

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.366
because it's difficult
to do on the store.

00:13:47.366 --> 00:13:48.740
But we would like
to do much more

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:52.075
and it's just that the tooling
is just very limited to do so.

00:13:52.075 --> 00:13:53.450
LAURA DELLA TORRE:
That actually,

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:54.880
and I will absolutely
get to that.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.470
But I want to touch
on the A/B testing.

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:00.580
How many people are
using our A/B testing

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.720
in the developer console?

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.740
Very few.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.073
How many people are interested
in doing beta testing?

00:14:08.073 --> 00:14:09.885
OK.

00:14:09.885 --> 00:14:11.420
All right.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:13.510
You had something
you wanted to say?

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:18.370
AUDIENCE: So I'm [INAUDIBLE]
from Magma Mobile, a game

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:19.160
developer.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.610
We've had 300 million downloads
of our games on Android.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:26.670
And the biggest challenge
to us is retention.

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:30.230
And the matrix that we're
using is DAU over MAU

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:32.040
to really track their retention.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.310
So I guess my
challenge to you guys

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:37.170
is what can you guys do
to really help us out

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.430
with retention?

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.080
So in terms of suggestions
and things like that,

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.060
there's a few ideas, like for
example, the Google Play Game

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.990
App is too static these days.

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:50.680
And I think it should
surface more data.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.870
I mean, really quickly,
you could pick up

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:57.240
that a game is 50% off
and there's an opportunity

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:01.050
or there are some quests
or leader boards or quests

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:02.500
that about to
expire and you want

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.247
to send them back to the game.

00:15:04.247 --> 00:15:05.580
So that's one of my suggestions.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.121
And also to what extent you guys
can work with the Google Now

00:15:08.121 --> 00:15:12.090
team to surface some
game data on Google Now

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:14.940
because these days people
are using Google Now a lot

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.210
because it's updated
data, it's tailored data.

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:21.430
And to what extent it can also
apply to all their app activity

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.932
on a daily basis?

00:15:23.932 --> 00:15:25.140
LAURA DELLA TORRE: Thank you.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.765
GREG HARTRELL: This
is music to my ears

00:15:26.765 --> 00:15:30.780
because one of the reasons why
a lot of our game services exist

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.405
is to solve many of the problems
that you're just describing.

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:37.367
I'll reiterate
some of the things

00:15:37.367 --> 00:15:38.950
we announced yesterday
because I think

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:42.380
that they match what some of
the recommendations you have.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.880
So we launched a couple
new game services,

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.916
one's called Save Games.

00:15:46.916 --> 00:15:48.540
This is not just
blobs storage but what

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:51.280
we do is we ask developers
to send us a screen

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.720
shot and metadata
that we surface

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.530
inside of the Play
Games Apps and inside

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:56.564
of other experiences.

00:15:56.564 --> 00:15:57.980
And the way that
we think about it

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:01.920
is we run into this
in mobile, everybody

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.930
has constant partial attention.

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:06.420
So they go on vacation,
they forget about the game

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.840
that they were
playing and there's

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.548
nothing there to remind
them coming back.

00:16:09.548 --> 00:16:11.560
And there's a sea
of icons there.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.310
What's nice about
Save Games is if you

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.164
show a very vivid
image of the last time

00:16:16.164 --> 00:16:18.080
that they play the game
or maybe the character

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.061
that they're working
on inside of the game,

00:16:20.061 --> 00:16:22.560
it acts as a digital bookmark
to remind them saying, "Hey, I

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.090
was playing your game."

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:26.620
Yeah, I walked away
from it for a week

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.710
but I remember that I
left off at level five.

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:30.730
The description of the
Save Games tells me that.

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:34.630
So we're starting to add
aspects of games services that

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:37.120
build that relationship
with your users.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.010
The other one that you
may or may not be aware of

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:42.550
is we launched another
service that we call Quests.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.160
And Quests literally
is a service

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.300
that drives time-based
challenges, in the vein of what

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.430
you just described, it's
all game activity based.

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:55.130
So by sending telemetry
into this Quests service,

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.840
you're able to configure
time-based challenges

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.580
like a weekend, I don't
know, zombie killing

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.000
fest, or whatever
your game is into.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.470
And you're able to constantly
re-engage users and most

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.190
automatically send
notifications to those users

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:09.579
as the Quests expire.

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:11.420
So I would encourage
all developers

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.700
who are interested in
just boosting retention

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.110
these services
including multiplayer

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:18.359
achievements in leader boards.

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:23.140
We're seeing developers show us
20%, 30%, 40% bumps in day two

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:26.819
retention and number in
sessions played per day, just

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:29.220
by virtue of integrating
and doing a very well, very

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.260
good design around them.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:34.770
Oh, sorry.

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:35.880
Google Now?

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.910
I think as we get
more signals and we

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:42.670
like to take
advantage of the data

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:46.140
that we have at Google to build
better user experiences, that's

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.710
a really fascinating idea.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.360
I think that we'll
take it to heart

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.479
and we'll talk with
the Google Now team.

00:17:52.479 --> 00:17:53.520
LAURA DELLA TORRE: Great.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.895
I think we got another product
requests coming over here.

00:17:57.907 --> 00:17:59.490
AUDIENCE: Not really
a product request

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:02.320
but I'm Josh with OpenTable.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.160
One of the biggest--

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.600
GREG HARTRELL: Fan of your app.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.310
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:06.810
One of the greatest
challenges we've

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:09.860
had with our latest update
is the new permissions.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.780
So every time somebody
updates the app,

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.940
they get bombarded with
all the things that we do

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.810
and there was an
attempt recently

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:19.880
to re-categorize this
permissions in such a way that

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.290
make them seem less arcane
but unfortunately, it

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:23.510
had other side effects.

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:25.925
So for example, for us,
we have a permission

00:18:25.925 --> 00:18:27.300
that we have to
ask for it to use

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.250
Google Maps in our app, that's
called Read, Write, External

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:33.530
Storage or Write
External Storage.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.270
That's for caching
of the map tiles.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.780
And unfortunately,
it's rolled up

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:41.850
under Read, Video, Files,
and Music or whatever it is.

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:44.740
And so all of our users are
rating our app very negatively

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.550
because they think that
we're stealing their files,

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:50.240
reading their files, doing
all these sorts of things.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.830
And it's something that's
really avoidable if were either

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.640
able to explain in-line
with the permission,

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.600
saying why do we use this
permission or some other way

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.220
that they're not just
rolled up to seem more

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.160
intrusive than
they actually are.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.965
Thanks.

00:19:05.965 --> 00:19:08.712
ELLIE POWERS: Yeah,
tanks for the feedback.

00:19:08.712 --> 00:19:10.670
I guess just to give a
little bit of background

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:11.294
on the change.

00:19:11.294 --> 00:19:13.460
One of the things we had
noticed with a lot of users

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:16.590
was that users, in the majority,
were simply not reading

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.680
permissions at all
because it was just

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.240
sort of this long list of
very obscure technical words.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.710
And so a lot of people had no
idea what they were actually

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:28.660
granting access to when
they install applications.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.330
So by giving little icons
and sort of grouping together

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:32.799
the different types
of permissions,

00:19:32.799 --> 00:19:35.090
we wanted to make people more
aware of the capabilities

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:35.965
that we are granting.

00:19:35.965 --> 00:19:37.830
And I guess
definitely what you're

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:40.210
running into is that
how do I put this,

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:43.210
I guess when you get that,
Read, Write, External

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:46.600
Storage permission, you
actually did have the ability

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.920
to do exactly what
it now describes.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.365
But your app is obviously
not doing that, right?

00:19:51.365 --> 00:19:53.490
Not reading the user's
photos and things like that.

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:57.480
So I think the changes that we
made or something that we hope

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.020
are going to get more people
interested in permissions

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:03.240
and making them more
aware of what's possible.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:06.070
But we're definitely
thinking a lot more long term

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:09.340
about what would a better, more
comprehensive change look like.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:13.007
So, I think the idea
of explaining, allowing

00:20:13.007 --> 00:20:15.590
a developer to explain why the
permissions are being requested

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:16.756
is a really interesting one.

00:20:16.756 --> 00:20:20.287
It's certainly something we've
thought about on the team.

00:20:20.287 --> 00:20:22.620
So I guess what I would say
is just that we are planning

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.640
to make more additional
changes and we

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:29.840
hope that by getting more users
aware of what's happening,

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.111
they will pay more attention
to what capabilities

00:20:32.111 --> 00:20:32.860
they are granting.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.450
But I totally get that
this can be really painful

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:38.850
if the actual access
that the user is granting

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:43.090
is actually greater
access then what maybe

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:44.530
your app is actually doing.

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.796
Your app may have the ability
to read the user photos

00:20:46.796 --> 00:20:48.420
but you may not
actually be doing that.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.420
But it can be tricky
because if you

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:53.052
say a phrase like "Read, Write,
External Storage" to my mom

00:20:53.052 --> 00:20:54.510
or something like
that, she's going

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:56.020
to have no idea what that means.

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.090
But actually, if she does
grant that permission

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.530
to an application, it could
actually read her photos

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:01.890
and edit them.

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.680
So even though
OpenTable obviously

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.150
wouldn't do that, I'm a huge
customer and huge fan of,

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.879
made many, many restaurant
reservations through it.

00:21:09.879 --> 00:21:12.420
I think, just definitely know
that this is an area that we're

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.580
thinking about on a weekly
basis, within the team,

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.900
and we're trying to
figure out more ways

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.890
to balance making users
aware of the capabilities

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:25.030
an application has
access to, and also

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.140
to make sure the developers
have a good experience as well.

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.660
So thanks for the feedback.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:30.701
LAURA DELLA TORRE: Great.

00:21:30.701 --> 00:21:32.620
Other product requests?

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:37.692
Maybe something from developer
console or search or Store?

00:21:37.692 --> 00:21:38.900
AUDIENCE: It's Store as well.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:39.920
This is fairly simple.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.790
I'm wondering if there's going
to be any sort of a supported

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:46.070
API for the data and the
use case I'm thinking about

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.237
is now that native ads are--

00:21:47.237 --> 00:21:49.611
LAURA DELLA TORRE: Could you
repeat that a little louder?

00:21:49.611 --> 00:21:51.110
A request for what API?

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:53.590
AUDIENCE: In API for
Store listing data.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:56.430
And in particular, I'll
give you a use case.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:58.240
So as native ads get
more and more popular,

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.530
it'd be nice to do
something like show the star

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:04.615
rating next to the
ad, in the screen.

00:22:04.615 --> 00:22:06.365
ELLIE POWERS: OK, so
just so I understand.

00:22:06.365 --> 00:22:07.781
The API you're
talking about would

00:22:07.781 --> 00:22:10.380
be something for making ads?

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:12.450
I didn't quite understand that.

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:14.680
AUDIENCE: Just
attributes on the apps

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.180
that are listed in Google Play.

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:20.030
So for instance, OpenTable
star rating 4.5 or whatever

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:23.110
it is, if I see through
a native ad listing,

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:26.630
I have an ad here to show
in my stream for OpenTable,

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:31.814
it'd be nice to show 4.5 stars
and know that it's right.

00:22:31.814 --> 00:22:32.730
LAURA DELLA TORRE: OK.

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:33.980
I think what their request is.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.930
A request is probably
for our ads team,

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:37.490
specifically, because
they're look--

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:39.710
you're talking about
ads-- yeah, but you

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:42.770
want to be able to retrieve
information about ads,

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:44.854
though right?

00:22:44.854 --> 00:22:48.840
AUDIENCE: Information about apps
that are-- retrieve information

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:50.659
about apps that
are in Google Play.

00:22:50.659 --> 00:22:52.200
ELLIE POWERS: Yeah,
totally get that.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.200
I'm just trying
to understand what

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.090
you'd be doing with it
because actually, when

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:55.860
you mentioned ads--

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:56.760
LAURA DELLA TORRE:
What's the use case?

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:57.180
How do use it?

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:58.721
ELLIE POWERS: When
you mentioned ads,

00:22:58.721 --> 00:23:01.080
we actually have the most
standard format on AdMob

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.626
is like the name of
app, number of star

00:23:03.626 --> 00:23:04.750
rating, that sort of thing.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.050
So I'm trying to understand
what you'd want to do.

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:07.210
AUDIENCE: No, I get you.

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:11.240
I'm thinking in the context
of native mobile ads.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:15.540
So for instance, if I get
native ads through InMobi,

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.340
as an example, so I've
got a package name,

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:20.460
it'd be nice to
get the star rating

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.590
and know that it's right,
as opposed to whatever

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:24.422
maybe the advertiser put in.

00:23:24.422 --> 00:23:26.630
ELLIE POWERS: Well, that's
an interesting suggestion.

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:31.110
I hadn't heard about
exactly exposing that API.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.855
Cool.

00:23:31.855 --> 00:23:33.224
Yeah, thanks for the suggestion.

00:23:33.224 --> 00:23:34.890
LAURA DELLA TORRE:
All right, panelists.

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:36.140
What else do you want to know?

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:38.510
Is there anything specific
you guys are thinking about

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:39.910
that you want feedback on?

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:40.660
DAN LAVELLE: Sure.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:44.920
So has anyone in the audience
contacted Support before?

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.700
Issues using the
console or yeah?

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:50.230
So what we want
to know primarily

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:54.110
is what's effective for you
in terms of contacting us,

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:56.370
be it the end of the
channels you contact us

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:59.200
through or the
content that we host?

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.197
And what are your experiences?

00:24:01.197 --> 00:24:03.780
What suggestions do you have so
that we can make better enable

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:07.130
you as you're either
triaging issue or you're

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:08.730
trying to-- the player app?

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:09.709
How can we help there?

00:24:09.709 --> 00:24:12.250
LAURA DELLA TORRE: First of all,
I haven't-- a show of hands,

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:14.960
how many people are developers
that would be looking

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.841
for technical help?

00:24:16.841 --> 00:24:17.340
OK.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.970
And how many folks that are
more on the business side, maybe

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:23.150
looking for some
marketing assistance?

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:24.230
OK.

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:26.610
I want to know who, what
everybody else does here.

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:27.320
I want your job.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:30.840
OK.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.340
Anybody want to comment
on the support channels

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.310
or how we can help you?

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:36.790
I think, really for us,
we want to understand

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:38.680
what is the best way
to get you information.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.334
Because I'd be willing to
bet, from those developers,

00:24:41.334 --> 00:24:43.000
how many people are
using Stack Overflow

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.580
to get their questions answered?

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.220
Yeah, that's what I thought.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.280
That's what I thought.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.270
What I'm very
curious about is-- we

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:53.040
do have a variety of
different features for you.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.270
Is there something we
can do to help answer

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.920
those questions for you, whether
they be technical or business?

00:25:01.421 --> 00:25:02.920
AUDIENCE: This is
completely selfish

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.740
but I'll be completely selfish.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:10.930
I've been trying to put up
a Jango app on App Engine.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:14.310
And of course, it appears
now but it changed.

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:17.890
And there's great instruction
for writing it from scratch

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:20.060
but I want to take
something that's

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:22.050
more thoroughly
developed like mezzanine,

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:24.370
which is built on top of Jango.

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:26.860
Can't find any place to
get started with that.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:30.740
And so all the mappings
are kind of screwy.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.890
And it should be a fairly
straightforward thing

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:35.160
to do but it's not.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:39.010
And also between the
change to Compute Engine

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:41.520
and some of this
containerization,

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.774
I'm completely lost
where to get started.

00:25:44.774 --> 00:25:46.190
LAURA DELLA TORRE:
Where would you

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:47.640
like to go get that information?

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.628
AUDIENCE: Any old
website. [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:53.916 --> 00:25:55.290
LAURA DELLA TORRE:
OK, so there's

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:56.600
some standard documentation.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:57.380
Anybody else?

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.180
Anybody else have--
want to know where

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:01.230
they would get
technical support?

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:03.380
Maybe some business?

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:03.880
OK.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:04.380
Yep.

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:05.290
Totally understand.

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:07.610
Absolutely.

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:09.387
Yes.

00:26:09.387 --> 00:26:11.470
AUDIENCE: So I'd like to
add something that is not

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:14.620
about support with Google
but support with our users.

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.870
So it's excellent
that you can reply

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:19.780
in the reviews,
that's really good.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.820
And what about making
a threaded replies?

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:25.150
We see that users for when they
have to give us some permission

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:28.840
really have to, really like
to look into those replies

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.780
and reviews.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:32.860
And most times, when
you're actually reactive

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:36.030
with comments, you
reply to review

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:39.150
and then the person who wrote
the review in the first place

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:42.060
changes it as a
means to an answer.

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:43.510
So it doesn't make sense.

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:46.460
So every time there is a
reply, that is quick enough

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:49.730
for the first user to
actually reply to the reply,

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:52.317
you have comments that just
don't really don't make sense.

00:26:52.317 --> 00:26:54.150
ELLIE POWERS: Yeah,
thanks for the feedback.

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:56.450
It was definitely something
we had thought about,

00:26:56.450 --> 00:27:01.880
which was how far into a forum
do we want our reviews to go?

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:06.550
We decided we did want to
have a reply as unique way

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:11.189
to allow that direct interaction
between developers and users.

00:27:11.189 --> 00:27:13.230
We're definitely aware
that has some limitations.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:15.450
On the other hand,
we aren't sure

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:17.620
that we really want to
create a discussion forum.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:21.969
So I think we're kind of in
this intermediate position

00:27:21.969 --> 00:27:24.010
right now where we're
aware that it's not perfect

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:25.551
as it is but we're
not sure we really

00:27:25.551 --> 00:27:28.125
want to go into a full-on
multi-threaded forum.

00:27:28.125 --> 00:27:29.041
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:31.392 --> 00:27:32.600
ELLIE POWERS: It says, sorry.

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.190
Can you repeat that?

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:34.820
AUDIENCE: Maybe
just add a tag that

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.930
says "Answered"
or "Reviewed" just

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:40.222
to know to read it differently.

00:27:40.222 --> 00:27:40.930
ELLIE POWERS: OK.

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:43.370
Yeah, I think that's actually
could be a good suggestion.

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:44.900
Yeah, thanks for that.

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.480
LAURA DELLA TORRE: Great.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.780
Some more feedback here.

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:50.180
AUDIENCE: Hi, guys.

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:51.960
I'm [INAUDIBLE], I'm
one of the owners

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.660
of an app developer from
Australia called b2cloud.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.150
We're actually a
service provider.

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:59.470
So we build applications
for many other businesses.

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:03.610
So we ourselves don't have a
huge presence on the Play Store

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:05.462
but rather always
encourage our customers

00:28:05.462 --> 00:28:06.920
to be creating
their own Play Store

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.100
accounts to be
releasing their apps on.

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:12.730
So we don't have really strong
relationships with Google,

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:15.780
although we'd really like to
have stronger relationships.

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:17.480
We've got some
contacts there but it

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.290
seems like we can't get as
much traction as perhaps larger

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:23.290
developers who've got
their own Play Store

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:25.700
accounts with a significant
number of users who would

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.430
typically attract a little
more attention from you guys.

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:31.900
How are we able to better
connect, stay ahead, be

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:33.711
able to get what's
coming up, what

00:28:33.711 --> 00:28:35.210
are the sort of
things that you want

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:37.940
to be able to see in your apps
that we can be encouraging

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:41.240
our customers and that we
can be suggesting features

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.230
to be including in our
applications for our customers?

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:45.490
SERGE KASSARDJIAN: Yeah, so.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:47.550
So we knew we work
with-- and I think

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:49.560
it's been primarily
in the US but we

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.470
want to expand it to
Australian and other regions

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:55.430
with development firms who are
building for their clients.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:58.490
We provide them materials
and we show them

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:00.210
what our best practices
are so that they

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:02.797
can become a channel
for us, so that you

00:29:02.797 --> 00:29:04.380
could distribute
these best practices.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:04.880
So--

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.296
LAURA DELLA TORRE:
But I hear you.

00:29:06.296 --> 00:29:07.380
I think it's a good point.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:08.504
Thank you for the feedback.

00:29:08.504 --> 00:29:11.030
Maybe there's something we can
do from a program perspective

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:13.480
and give you visibility
amongst other developers

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.810
or figure out
exactly where brands

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:18.930
go to get their
development firm support.

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:20.650
So thank you very much for that.

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:22.940
We have exactly one
minute left so I

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:24.550
am going to turn it
over to you guys,

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:27.210
if you have anything else
that's burning on your mind.

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:29.376
Is there something you guys
are thinking about doing

00:29:29.376 --> 00:29:32.730
and want some quick feedback?

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:35.480
ELLIE POWERS: So I guess
I would ask all of you

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.810
how do you currently gain
distribution for your apps?

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:39.030
What's working the best?

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:42.800
And what can we do
to help enhance it?

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:45.034
LAURA DELLA TORRE: Super short.

00:29:45.034 --> 00:29:46.200
AUDIENCE: My favorite topic.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.200
So thanks for your
presentation yesterday

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.734
when you mentioned matchmaking,
that made me think about that.

00:29:51.734 --> 00:29:53.400
Another presentation
I went to yesterday

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.500
talked about all kinds of
different contextual signals

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.650
that people are going to
be using for Google Now

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:00.360
in these kinds of devices.

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:04.330
And I was thinking well why
is the Play Store so limited

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:07.000
in the signals that it's taking
in from its users, right?

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.650
You've got a search term
but that's it, right?

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:12.930
That might work great for games
or other kind of blockbuster,

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:15.100
maybe short-term
engagement apps.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.270
But for something
more niche, long-term,

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:20.190
like an OpenTable or that
the company I work with,

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:21.940
GetYourGuide, which
is a travel app.

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.920
Find things to do
when you travel.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.510
We really want the
clue of somebody

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:30.220
when they're in a city that's
not their home or these other,

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.970
when they've got an
appointment, all these

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:35.070
are the contextual things that
are being considered for Now.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:38.180
Are they on the roadmap
for Google Play?

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:39.930
ELLIE POWERS: I guess
we'll say that we're

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:41.660
worth thinking about a
lot of the same questions.

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:43.080
And I'd love to hear
from another developer.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.060
So thanks for the feedback.

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.070
LAURA DELLA TORRE: So here's
what we're going to do.

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:46.528
We have to wrap-up,
just because we

00:30:46.528 --> 00:30:48.449
have another panel
coming on here.

00:30:48.449 --> 00:30:49.990
Thank you guys so
much for your time.

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:51.760
We were going to
be around here, out

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.030
of the way of the next
session coming through.

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:55.070
But thank you so much.

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:56.944
Really appreciate your
help and your feedback

00:30:56.944 --> 00:30:59.040
and please keep it coming.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.890
Thank you.
