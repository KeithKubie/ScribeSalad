00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.360
When it comes to the diagnosis and treatment
of mental illnesses, clinicians and psychologists

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.010
have myriad resources at their disposal. But
of all the tools available, the DSM-5 is the

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.900
holy grail. The diagnostic and statistical
manual of mental disorders is a big fat book

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.880
that codifies all the illnesses and their
complexities. We thought it would be neat

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.650
to take a look at some Disney icons through
a psychological lens. We’re not professionals,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.551
but we did recently graduate from Internet
University. So here are 10 Disney Characters

00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:40.390
With Serious Mental Disorders. And if you
like what you see, stay tuned to hear more

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.559
details about our YouTube channel.

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.829
Hades, Hercules: Intermittent Explosive Disorder
The main antagonist in 1997’s Hercules is

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:57.769
literally animated to be a hot-head. And even
though Hades is aware of his temper, he just

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.399
can’t seem to get a handle on it. Suffering
embarrassment at the hands of infant Hercules,

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.310
the ruler of the Underworld seeks to have
the boy killed. Which feels like more than

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.010
a slight overreaction. Those afflicted with
Intermittent Explosive Disorder are prone

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.720
to outbursts and temper tantrums that come
about with almost no warning. And, depending

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.750
on the person, sometimes ends with injury,
property damage, or both. Hades’ outbursts

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.880
are more intense than the situation calls
for, even his underlings are afraid of him.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.810
Alice, Alice in Wonderland: Schizophrenia
When thinking about the story of Alice in

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.810
Wonderland, three letters come to mind: WTF.
And of the many incarnations dedicated to

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.780
the classic Lewis Carrol story, Disney is
responsible for three. The surreal environments

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.890
and bizarre characters add to the story’s
overwhelming peculiarity. And for as lost

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.340
as she looks, Alice seems to be the only one
who has any grip on reality. But after learning

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.990
about schizophrenia, we began to wonder if
maybe we had the whole thing backwards. Audio

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.500
and visual phantasms, disorganized thought
and speech patterns, and fear of persecution

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.180
can all be symptoms of the illness. And Alice
is 5 for 5.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.980
Gaston, Beauty and the Beast: Narcissistic
Personality Disorder

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.780
Here’s a guy who has an entire musical number
devoted to his malady, Belle’s oh-so-charming

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.590
suitor, Gaston. And while we thought he was
just a turbo-jerk, it turns out the overconfident

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.970
oaf has a textbook case of Narcissistic Personality
Disorder. For evidence, one need only look

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.270
at the lyrics of his song — it’s three
straight minutes of bragging, a hallmark of

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.630
the disorder. Signs of NPD include an inflated
sense of self and tendency to look down upon

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.060
others. Gaston can’t handle criticism or
rejection but sees himself as the most important,

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.060
strongest, admired man who ever lived. Plus,
no one can eat 4 dozen eggs in one sitting,

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.870
so I guess he’s also a liar.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.940
Ariel, Little Mermaid: Hoarding
If we learned anything from The Little Mermaid,

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.260
it’s that the ocean is full of trash. Sunken
ships litter the ocean floor, their contents

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.790
spilled all over the place. But one water-dweller
is single-handedly cleaning up the mess. Ariel

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.710
is constantly messing around were she’s
not supposed to be, collecting discarded pieces

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.180
of other people’s lives. Her compulsion
to collect whozits and whatzits galore puts

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.880
strain on her family relationships. And while
she might see her activities as “collecting”,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.810
it looks a lot more like Hoarding. This branch
of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is characterized

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.770
by needless accumulation of worthless items.
Old cutlery and bottles? Not exactly a priceless

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.700
compilation.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.440
Captain Jack Sparrow, Pirates: Alcohol Use
Disorder (Alcoholism)

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.200
Pirates have a lot of iconography. But peg
legs, parrots, and eye patches all pale in

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.530
comparison to one thing: booze. Sea-roving
is a hard life, and drinking is a nice way

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.040
to pass the time — within reason, of course.
But Captain Jack Sparrow didn’t get the

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.040
moderation memo, and his relationship with
rum is borderline unhealthy. Professionals

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.560
use the term Alcohol Use Disorder (aka ‘Alcoholism’)
to refer to people who can’t self-regulate

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.150
their drinking. Alcoholics will continue consuming
even if it causes them personal problems or

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:13.709
puts them in harms way. Like, say, going on
a bender and then stealing a ship. Or throwing

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.500
a tantrum when the booze runs out. Stuff like
that.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.289
Cruella DeVil, 101 Dalmatians: Psychopathy
Every story needs a villain, and Cruella DeVil

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.960
is one of Disney’s most iconic. The would-be
puppy murderer is a straight up psychopath,

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.240
and here’s how we know. Doctors use a diagnostic
tool called the PCL-R when assessing wether

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.870
or not a person fits the medical definition
of a psychopath. The 20-point checklist references

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.809
things like callousness, over-inflated sense
of self-worth, and a lack of realistic long-term

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:47.180
goals as indicators. We’re not professionals,
but engineering an entire scheme that hinges

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.210
on the wrangling of 101 puppies quietly and
efficiently seems pretty unrealistic. Plus

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.400
there’s the whole, you know, coat thing.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.650
Scar, The Lion King: Anti-social Personality
Disorder

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.919
These days, George R. R. Martin gets all the
credit for killing your favorite character.

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.229
But back in the day, Disney was the finest
assassin in town. Famous for murdering an

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.979
important parental figure within the first
five minutes of any given movie, The Lion

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:15.990
King is no exception. Since we’ve all spent
decades trying to suppress the memory of Mufasa’s

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.410
death, we’re not even gonna go there. Instead,
let’s chat about the cat responsible — Scar.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.710
He takes no time to think about morality,
strong-arms others to get what he wants, and

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.159
doesn’t learn from bad experiences. Some
have hypothesized that Simba’s uncle suffers

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:34.349
from anti-social personality disorder, and
we’re inclined to agree.

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:40.080
Elsa, Frozen: Agoraphobia
We can think of a lot of good reasons to stay

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.439
home. Netflix, sweatpants, unlimited bathroom
breaks… the list goes on. But for people

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:49.240
living with agoraphobia, staying home isn’t
always a choice. The fear of being surrounded

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.740
by people, feeling trapped, or becoming overwhelmed
by circumstances can make it impossible for

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.560
them to leave the house. With this in mind,
take another look at the 2013 juggernaut Frozen,

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.999
and pay specific attention to Elsa. Fear of
real and imagined scenarios? Check. Avoidance

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:09.650
of populated places? Check. Anxiety about
feeling trapped or embarrassed? Check and

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.219
check. Granted, most people don’t run the
risk of accidentally killing everyone they

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:18.529
love with ice when they feel overwhelmed,
so it makes sense that Elsa prefers a low

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:19.529
profile.

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:23.820
Captain Hook, Peter Pan: Herpetophobia
Anxiety disorders are as varied as they are

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.860
intense, and manifest themselves differently
in every sufferer. Phobias are a type of anxiety

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.789
rooted to a specific thing, and is a fancy-pants
way of saying something scares the sh*t out

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:38.319
of you. Take Captain Hook, for example. After
mixing it up with a crocodile, Hook runs for

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:42.039
the hills the second they’re mentioned.
Medically speaking, the Captains aversion

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:46.419
is called Herpetophobia — or fear of reptiles.
It’s in our best interest to keep a little

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:50.499
space between us and the crocodile, but we
aren’t constantly worried about being attacked

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:53.809
by one. Hook isn’t so lucky.

00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:58.909
Rapunzel, Tangled: Stockholm Syndrome
Imagine being trapped in a tower with a treacherous

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:04.030
custodian and no agency over your own life.
If that sounds like a good time, you might

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.879
have Stockholm Syndrome. After the release
of Tangled in 2010, people couldn’t help

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:13.279
but notice Rapunzel’s tendency to side with
her malicious captor. And the conversation

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:18.169
is still happening today. A victims attempts
to align with, sympathize, or otherwise defend

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:23.189
their jailor is clear indication of the syndrome.
And makes absolutely no sense to anyone outside

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:27.500
of the captor/captive relationship. It’s
clear to the audience that Mother Gothel is

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.880
an abusive guardian, but Rapunzel interprets
her behavior as being rooted in love, not

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.880
power.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:41.620
