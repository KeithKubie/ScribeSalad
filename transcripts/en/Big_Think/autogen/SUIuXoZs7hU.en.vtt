Canada where it's very cold in the
 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.090
Canada where it's very cold in the
winter and very hot in the summer and I

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100
winter and very hot in the summer and I
 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.670
winter and very hot in the summer and I
look at these boys with a magnifying

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680
look at these boys with a magnifying
 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.890
look at these boys with a magnifying
glass and they were burning a piece of

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900
glass and they were burning a piece of
 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.400
glass and they were burning a piece of
paper by focusing the Rays of the Sun to

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410

this paper through a magnifying glass

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820
this paper through a magnifying glass
 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.320
this paper through a magnifying glass
and I just have to know how that works

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330
and I just have to know how that works
 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.090
and I just have to know how that works
and so I did the obvious thing I took a

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100
and so I did the obvious thing I took a
 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.400
and so I did the obvious thing I took a
soda pop bottle and broken and try to

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410
soda pop bottle and broken and try to
 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.110
soda pop bottle and broken and try to
make a magnifying glass out of it and

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120
make a magnifying glass out of it and
 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.030
make a magnifying glass out of it and
that's when I realized now that I had

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040
that's when I realized now that I had
 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.440
that's when I realized now that I had
discovered that I was going to be an

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450
discovered that I was going to be an
 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.940
discovered that I was going to be an
engineer because I want to know how

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950
engineer because I want to know how
 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.650
engineer because I want to know how
everything works and I always have

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660
 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.540
when I was nine years old I invented at

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550
when I was nine years old I invented at
 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.720
when I was nine years old I invented at
least I think I invented a train that

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730
least I think I invented a train that
 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.330
least I think I invented a train that
could travel through a tunnel from one

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340
could travel through a tunnel from one
 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.760
could travel through a tunnel from one
end of the country to another and what

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770
end of the country to another and what
 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.500
end of the country to another and what
was unique about this crane was two

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510
was unique about this crane was two
 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.370
was unique about this crane was two
things I had learned about friction and

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380
things I had learned about friction and
 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.430
things I had learned about friction and
so we had to get rid of friction and so

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440
so we had to get rid of friction and so
 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.800
so we had to get rid of friction and so
I thought about why don't we support

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810
I thought about why don't we support
 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.890
I thought about why don't we support
this train on a magnetic field because I

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900
this train on a magnetic field because I
 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.450
this train on a magnetic field because I
knew the two magnets when they are close

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460
knew the two magnets when they are close
 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.660
knew the two magnets when they are close
together for sub cells apart and the

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670
together for sub cells apart and the
 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.700
together for sub cells apart and the
second thing is if we want to get a rid

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710
second thing is if we want to get a rid
 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.230
second thing is if we want to get a rid
of all friction we have to get rid of

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240
of all friction we have to get rid of
 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.690
of all friction we have to get rid of
the error so this train travelled in a

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700
the error so this train travelled in a
 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.030
the error so this train travelled in a
tunnel that was totally evacuated it was

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040
tunnel that was totally evacuated it was
 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.660
tunnel that was totally evacuated it was
it a vacuum and macey enough they are

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670
it a vacuum and macey enough they are
 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.280
it a vacuum and macey enough they are
just starting to build trains like that

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290
just starting to build trains like that
 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.290
just starting to build trains like that
maybe without the vacuum but with

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300
maybe without the vacuum but with
 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.680
maybe without the vacuum but with
magnetic levitation so maybe it wasn't

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690
magnetic levitation so maybe it wasn't
 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.950
magnetic levitation so maybe it wasn't
such a dumb idea after all

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960
 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.860
science has been part of my life from

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870
science has been part of my life from
 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.520
science has been part of my life from
the time I was four years old just

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530
the time I was four years old just
 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.050
the time I was four years old just
knowing how things work now having a

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060
knowing how things work now having a
 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.280
knowing how things work now having a
curiosity and and my curiosity has been

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290
curiosity and and my curiosity has been
 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.830
curiosity and and my curiosity has been
limitless and that's quite a handicap

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840
limitless and that's quite a handicap
 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.240
limitless and that's quite a handicap
because there are times in your life

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250
because there are times in your life
 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.480
because there are times in your life
when you have to specialize but I

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490
when you have to specialize but I
 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.880
when you have to specialize but I
literally want to know everything and

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890
literally want to know everything and
 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.770
literally want to know everything and
only in recent years have I finally

only in recent years have I finally
 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.780
only in recent years have I finally
realized that I'm never going to know

realized that I'm never going to know
 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.520
realized that I'm never going to know
everything in fact the older I get and

everything in fact the older I get and
 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.640
everything in fact the older I get and
the more stupid I find out that i am but

can be fun and if in fact teachers learn
 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.710
can be fun and if in fact teachers learn
how to present a science in that way and

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940
scientist everybody doesn't have to be a
 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.300
scientist everybody doesn't have to be a
mathematician make it interesting enough

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310
mathematician make it interesting enough
 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.280
mathematician make it interesting enough
so the people that have that interest

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290
so the people that have that interest
 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.550
so the people that have that interest
that have that challenge do latch on to

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560
that have that challenge do latch on to
 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.630
that have that challenge do latch on to
the wonderful world that will open up if

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640
the wonderful world that will open up if
 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.360
the wonderful world that will open up if
they dig into science and mathematics

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370
they dig into science and mathematics
 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.210
they dig into science and mathematics
the teaching of science mathematics of

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220
the teaching of science mathematics of
 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.670
the teaching of science mathematics of
anything there really is no different

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680
anything there really is no different
 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.500
anything there really is no different
than a game if you make a game dull if

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510
than a game if you make a game dull if
 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.750
than a game if you make a game dull if
make it uninteresting if you don't have

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760
make it uninteresting if you don't have
 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.390
make it uninteresting if you don't have
something that grabs people they won't

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400
something that grabs people they won't
 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.520
something that grabs people they won't
get interested and go do something else

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530
get interested and go do something else
 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.890
get interested and go do something else
so I don't see why teaching should be

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900
so I don't see why teaching should be
 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.700
so I don't see why teaching should be
any different than teeth then creating

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710
any different than teeth then creating
 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.120
any different than teeth then creating
games creating a curriculum a lot to be

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130
games creating a curriculum a lot to be
 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.340
games creating a curriculum a lot to be
the same as creating a game make it

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350
the same as creating a game make it
 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.530
the same as creating a game make it
interesting make it fun make it a

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540
interesting make it fun make it a
 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.050
interesting make it fun make it a
challenge all of those things all of the

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060
challenge all of those things all of the
 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.250
challenge all of those things all of the
attributes of player game are the things

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260
attributes of player game are the things
 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.880
attributes of player game are the things
that draw people into learning and I

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890
that draw people into learning and I
 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.950
that draw people into learning and I
think that's what we ought to do we are

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960
think that's what we ought to do we are
 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.310
think that's what we ought to do we are
somehow coalesce the concept of teaching

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320
somehow coalesce the concept of teaching
 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.820
somehow coalesce the concept of teaching
with the concept of game playing and

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830
with the concept of game playing and
 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.160
with the concept of game playing and
we're going to find that a lot more of

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.170
we're going to find that a lot more of
 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.660
we're going to find that a lot more of
our youngsters are going to get

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670
our youngsters are going to get
 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.900
our youngsters are going to get
interested in learning and specifically

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910
interested in learning and specifically
 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:10.540
interested in learning and specifically
about science mathematics technology

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550
