&gt;&gt; Vic Gundotra: To introduce the next section,
I'd like to invite up the product lead for

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.690
a new initiative, Rishi Chandra.
Rishi, come on up on stage.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:20.070
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: All right.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.980
Thank you, Vic.
And thank you for all being here.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.789
We're going to have some fun today.
I'm going to introduce you to Google TV, a

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.210
new platform --
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.730
&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: Thank you.
-- a new platform that we believe will change

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.260
the future of television.
But before we start talking about the future,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.069
let's talk a little bit about the present.
I tried to pull together a few interesting

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:53.210
facts to just help convey how important TV
is to the world today.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.460
So let's just go through those facts really
quickly.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.799
First interesting fact: Five hours per day.
That's the average amount of time an American

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.320
spends in front of the television.
And, in fact, people are watching more TV

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.130
now than they ever were in the past.
That's pretty amazing.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:20.720
Second interesting fact: $70 billion.
That's the annual advertising spend in the

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.390
U.S. alone on TV.
There's still no better medium to reach a

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:35.060
wider and broader audience than the television.
And then third interesting fact: 4 billion

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.450
TV users worldwide.
4 billion.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.150
That's just staggering.
Even if you compare to very large markets,

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.560
like the mobile market, which has a couple
billion, or the PC market, which has a billion.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.990
For a developer, there is no bigger market
than the TV market.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.030
And the reality is, people just love television.
[ Laughter ]

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.180
&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: Right?
I love TV.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.030
And I'm not embarrassed to say I watch a lot
of television.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.490
So why is that?
Well, it turns out that TV just works.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.700
Right?
It's easy.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.670
It's reliable.
And it gets you access to really cool stuff,

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.360
my favorite sports, my favorite movies, my
favorite shows.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.710
In fact, it's become such a natural and predictable
part of our lives that you don't even have

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.480
to think about it anymore.
There aren't many technologies that can say

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.770
that.
And as other technologies evolved and changed,

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.230
TV's basically stayed the same.
And to many people, that's actually pretty

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.090
comforting.
But increasingly, more and more of my entertainment

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.390
experiences in the living room are actually
not happening on the TV.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.100
Right?
They're happening on my mobile phone or my

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.340
PC.
And that's really being driven by the Web.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.209
The Web has completely transformed the PC
space, and much more recently, transformed

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.300
the mobile space, with the introduction of
the smartphone.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.800
But even today, the Web has had very limited
adoption in the premier entertainment device

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.349
in your living room, the TV.
And so you're kind of stuck there.

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.370
Right?
There's two completely separate worlds for

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.000
most users.
One world where I have all this great, compelling

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.730
content on my television, my favorite sports,
my favorite shows, my favorite movies.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.819
And then this other world where I have all
my great Web videos and my favorite Web sites.

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.500
So what ends up happening?
Well, naturally, users adjust.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.870
But they adjust by doing unnatural things
to make it all work.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.600
Let me give you an example.
This happens at my house all the time.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.530
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: And it might resonate with

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.010
many of you here as well.
Family and friends huddle around this small

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.160
PC to watch really cool Web content.
This just doesn't make sense.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.980
Video should be consumed on the biggest, best,
and brightest screen in the house.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.010
And that's your TV.
It's not a PC, it's not a phone or anything

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.410
in between.
So how do we actually start bringing these

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.879
two worlds together?
I'll be the first to admit that we're not

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.040
the first to make an attempt on this.
Right?

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.020
Many people have tried.
And today, many devices now in the living

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.000
room will actually be connected to the Web.
But if you look at the data today, it's still

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.060
pretty limited adoption.
Now, I'm going to argue that there's three

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.190
reasons why many of the solutions today just
haven't made much traction.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.920
They have three major limitations.
First limitation: They all try to dumb down

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.870
the Web for TV.
Here's the problem when you try to dumb down

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.820
the Web.
Then you're effectively recreating the Web.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.840
Does that sound familiar to people in this
room?

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.730
It's WAP all over again.
[ Applause ]

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.500
&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: Right?
And what we learned in the mobile space is

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.660
that it just doesn't scale.
Yeah, maybe you'll get 20 apps, 50 apps, maybe

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.010
a hundred.
We need to find a way to bring the entire

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:06.770
Web to the television.
Second limitation, they're all closed.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.690
Closed does not work anymore.
Once a user experiences the freedom to go

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.990
anywhere they want to go on the Web, they're
not going back.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:22.900
And third, many of these solutions today make
you choose between TV or Web.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.680
The minute that user has to hit that dreaded
input selector button to go from TV to Web,

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.830
you've lost 90% of them.
Because they don't know how to get back.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.080
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: And the reality is, the choice,

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.100
if you give a user a choice between TV or
Web, they're going to choose TV.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:44.320
That's the experience they know.
So what's the answer here?

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.600
Well, we have our opinion, obviously.
We believe it takes -- it requires taking

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.490
the best of what TV has to offer today and
the best of what the Web has to offer today,

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.320
and bringing them into a single, seamless
experience.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.580
It really is about how do we make TV and Web
better.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.569
So with that, I'm very happy to introduce
Google TV.

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:18.350
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: Where TV meets Web and Web

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.229
meets TV.
Now, before we dive into the demo, which I

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:26.980
know you guys are all anxious for, I want
you to remember four ways that we believe

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.320
we are going to redefine the television experience.
First, we're going to show you how you can

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:38.440
spend less time finding and more time watching
your favorite content.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.240
Second, we're going to also show you how you
can control and personalize what you watch

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.300
and when you watch it.
Third, we're going to make your existing TV

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.050
content much more interesting.
I'll show you how.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.020
And, finally, we're going to make your TV
much more than a TV.
