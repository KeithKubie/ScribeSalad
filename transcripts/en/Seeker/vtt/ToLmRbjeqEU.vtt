00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:16.950
There are a number of ways to improve the
efficiency of aircraft: Shape, fuel, engine

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.810
efficiency, even the material the airplane
is made of.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.910
One study from 2004 looked at shaping wings
more like humpback whale flippers -- complete

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.450
with weird bumps -- makes them more efficient,
creates more lift and less drag than sleeker

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.450
shapes.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.940
But while the engineers plan the look of new
future planes, the more imminent impact is

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.050
on the environment.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.340
Just in the last year there have been a number
of proposed "new" planes that are more efficient,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.390
more sleek, or just plain MORE, but one thing
is clear -- current jet fuels are out.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.651
The Chief Technology Officer at Boeing told
the BBC last year, "Probably 75% of the research

00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:57.250
and development dollars we invest in the commercial
airplane side goes towards improving our environmental

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.370
footprint."

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.320
A single flight from New York to San Francisco
or Europe creates 2 to 3 tons of greenhouse-causing

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.320
gasses.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.490
In a year, the average European generates
10 tons of carbon dioxide a year; the average

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.549
American?

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:11.610
19.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.640
A Boeing 747 uses about 1 gallon of fuel per
second (4L) or about 5 gallons per mile and

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.219
there are around 7,000 flights over the US
at any given moment.

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:26.609
And that is SO MUCH FUEL to replace, but that
also makes for a huge market.

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:31.670
At the end of 2014, the world's first biofuel
powered plane took off in Canada.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.700
The biofuel was made using rapeseed oil, though
the researchers pointed out it could have

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.970
just as easily come from flax, coconut husks,
cooking oil or algae.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.399
Even though it releases CO2 when burned, biofuel
is considered carbon neutral, because the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.600
plants it's made from absorbed CO2 as they
grow.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.619
Though MIT studies show that it might not
be QUITE as "Green" as first thought; it all

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.950
depends on the crops used and the way they're
harvested.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.389
More research def needed.

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:58.779
Other fuels are being explored too.

00:01:58.779 --> 00:02:04.609
Manufacturer Airbus is exploring hydrogen
fuel cells not for the engines, but for the

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:09.530
internal power -- replacing the gas turbine
engines that currently provide on-board electrical

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.610
systems.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.670
Hydrogen fuel cells could provide enough power
for the plane, but ALSO create fresh water

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.810
right there on board!

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.280
They're even looking into hydrogen-powered
front wheels, for emission-free taxiing while

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.280
on the ground.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.000
Earlier this year Boeing and NASA launched
the ecoDemonstrator -- a 757 which doesn't

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.030
burn a new fuel, but DOES improve efficiency.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.830
The plane's tail is 17 percent smaller, and
contains tiny forced-air jets to stabilize

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.690
the plane during take-off and landing; increasing
rudder efficiency up to 20 percent!

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.280
At the speeds airlines fly, a chip in the
paint or misplaced rivet will increase drag

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.210
costing fuel and polluting more; but so will
bug splatters!

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.100
So they've developed a few new insect-repellant
coatings to reduce the drag cost from insect

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.100
strikes.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.450
Sure, efficiency isn't super sexy, but even
a small increase can mean thousands of gallons

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.690
of fuel saved, plus it's better for the environment.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.230
The crazytown airplane award has to go to
Solar Impulse, though, for forgoing fuel altogether.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.200
The Solar Impulse is flying around the world
powered only by light from the sun.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.480
Though at the moment they're trapped in Japan
trying to fly from there to Hawaii and wrap

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.480
this shiz up.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.780
It's not exactly market-ready, but it's a
proof of concept!

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.780
They're proving it!

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.480
YOU CAN DO IT SOLAR IMPULSE!!

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.810
In the end, airplanes are 20th century technology
that's being innovated into the 21st century.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.280
It's slow going, but it's GOING.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.680
Petroleum packs a lot of umph for it's weight,
which is key on an airplane.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.350
Maybe, like with the automobile industry,
different engines are needed for different

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.040
jobs.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.710
Hydrogen-powered jet engines to get off the
ground, and hyper-efficient pulse detonation

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.010
engines or wind generators for cruising -- like
an airplane hybrid.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.570
That, combined with more efficient wings,
and fuel cells and solar for electricity…

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.540
and we'd be well on our way.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.850
So even though the idea of an “eco-friendly”
plane sounds like a pipe dream, there are

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.380
many people trying to make it a reality.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.200
Meanwhile on the road, Toyota is fueling the
future with the new Toyota Mirai.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.441
Using the most abundant element in the universe,
Hydrogen, the new Mirai is looking to the

00:04:16.441 --> 00:04:18.280
future with sustainability in mind.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.280
What do you think?

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.360
Have an idea that could make planes better?

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:30.130
