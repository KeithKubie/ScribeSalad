00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now the last thing I think I really want to mention

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and it really does belong in this lecture

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
is the affect of market type on revenue.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This is really interesting, because you might have heard about startups

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
about something called the hockey stick,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and the hockey stick is actually this kind of curve.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now, it turns out that what the hockey stick really represents

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
are startups in a new market. Wow. That's kind of interesting. Why?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Well, if you think about it, in a new market on year 1

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
you have no customers, and so your revenue is essentially flat.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
In year 2, revenue still might be flat.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Year 3, it might be flat.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Year 4, oh my gosh, something changed about the market.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
There might be a tipping point, an inflection point,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
where sales literally go exponential and start to skyrocket.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
What happened is a market that didn't exist all things have just come together,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and it's become the year of online education,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
or it's become the year of the network,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
or it's become the year of the mobile phone or smart phone.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The unfortunate part is most startups that are in a new market

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
see something that looks like this and go out of business.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
What we're really hoping for is that we could influence and affect

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
this tipping point by our customer strategies, our value proposition,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and our get, keep, and grow strategies.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
But the key idea is we want to hoard as much cash as we can,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
because almost no startup in a new market can affect the diffusion of innovation by itself.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Other things need to happen.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
By the way, this little bump in year one—

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
this represents the fallacy in new markets.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
In almost every new market you could find crazy people just like you

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
who'd be happy to buy one for their lab or their home.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Such early adopters—they want to have one.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Startup founders look at that curve and say, "Look! It's just going to look like this,"

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and start scaling their sales and marketing and spending and then it all collapses again,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
because it really was an early adopter sign, not mainstream adoption.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
We want to be careful about what our sales curve looks like.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Now, what's really interesting is if we're an existing market—

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and remember, in an existing market what do we know?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Well, there are customers and there are competitors.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
What we have if by our definition a better or higher performance product

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
on axes that the customers have defined.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Our job in an existing market is simply year-after-year,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
if we execute pristinely, simply to take share away from the incumbents.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So, our sales curve in an existing market literally should be one of taking shares.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Finally, in a resegmented market, this is kind of a hybrid of both new and existing.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
What's happening in years 1, 2, 3, etc, in the early days

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
is you're actually getting revenue from the existing markets.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
That is, people might actually kind of find you are an okay substitute,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
but really don't understand your unique value

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
until some tipping point where they realize, oh my gosh, you're just not another vendor

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
in an existing market, you actually solve better a set of needs for a niche

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
or you're a low-cost supplier that really makes you unique and special

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and revenues take off.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And so what you have to do is husband your cash but not as much in a new market

00:03:45.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and figure out how to get you differentiated from the mainstream in existence.
