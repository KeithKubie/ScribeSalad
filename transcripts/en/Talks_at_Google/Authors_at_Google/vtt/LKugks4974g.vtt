00:00:01.257 --> 00:00:01.840
PRESENTER: Hi.

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:02.381
Good morning.

00:00:02.381 --> 00:00:04.800
My name is Jason, and
I'm here to introduce

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.490
our wonderful speakers
today-- the authors of "State

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.340
of Play" and "Minecraft:
Second Edition."

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:12.900
Welcome.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.760
Thank you.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.691
DANIEL GOLDBERG:
Thank you very much.

00:00:14.691 --> 00:00:15.441
PRESENTER: Cheers.

00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:16.134
It's all yours.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.160
DANIEL GOLDBERG: So my
name is Daniel Goldberg.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.940
This, again, is my
co-writer, Linus Larson.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.100
Thanks again for coming
down to listen to us.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.800
We're authors and
we're journalists,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.990
and we're based in
Stockholm in Sweden, where

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.280
we write about technology
and, I would say,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.760
the intersection between
technology and society

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.510
and the economy in a variety
of different ways for a variety

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.750
of different publications.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.167
And we also write books.

00:00:45.167 --> 00:00:47.000
A few years back, we
released our first book

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.440
in English, which is
called "Minecraft:

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.850
the Unlikely Tale of
Markus 'Notch' Perrson

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.550
and the Game That
Changed Everything,"

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.750
which is, as the title
implies, a book about the game

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.550
"Minecraft" but also about the
guy who created "Minecraft"

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.620
and where the inspiration came
from, and why, I would say,

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.374
maybe it's a game that has
a lot of things to say.

00:01:05.374 --> 00:01:06.790
The story of
"Minecraft" has a lot

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.890
of things to say
about the internet,

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.990
about digital technology, and
the world we live in today,

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.430
I suppose.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.040
It's a great book, so please
read it if you haven't already.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.050
But today, we're here
to primarily talk

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.320
about our new book, which is
called "The State of Play."

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.070
And "The State of
Play" is a collection

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.270
of essays about video games
and about video game culture--

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.480
more specifically, a
collection of essays

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.790
that all present
new and interesting,

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.040
and we would think, fairly
different, ways of talking

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.960
about video games and
approaching video games,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.480
and maybe even
creating video games.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.340
So that's what it looks like.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.150
So we'd like to spend
about maybe 25 minutes

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.980
to talk about the major
themes and the major ideas

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:53.630
of the book.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.540
And after that, I think we'll
have time for some questions.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.090
And please do ask questions,
because it makes everything

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.280
a lot more interesting.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.780
Yeah.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.170
So actually, I'd like to
start off with a question,

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.980
actually, before we begin.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.340
So just raise your hand.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.330
Who here has read at least
one book in the past month?

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.210
OK.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.130
So about half of you, which
is pretty good, actually.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.740
So who here has played a video
game, at least one video game

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.930
in the past month?

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:24.605
Almost everyone.

00:02:24.605 --> 00:02:26.730
So more of you have played
a game in the past month

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.740
than have read a book
in the past month.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.370
That's good.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.310
So going back to the
book, then, those of you

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.370
who read the book-- would
you say you learned something

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.500
from reading that book?

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.540
Or perhaps even better--
did that book change

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.050
your opinion on something?

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.876
Just raise your hand
if that's the case.

00:02:43.876 --> 00:02:46.280
So almost everyone, I think.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.470
Would you say the same
thing about the game?

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.230
Did the game teach you
anything or did the game change

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.090
your opinion on anything?

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.710
One, two three-- OK, so less
of you, which is the point,

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.210
I suppose.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.440
That's interesting.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.750
We'll come back to that.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.720
But let's get started.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.180
So video games-- video
games are everywhere today.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.150
Everyone plays video
games-- people of all ages,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.817
people from all over the world.

00:03:13.817 --> 00:03:15.900
Games are on our phones,
they're on our computers,

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.210
they're on our games
consoles, they're on the web.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.860
I think it's fair to say
that video games today

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.080
are one of the, if not
the most influential,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.980
forms of cultural
expression in the time

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.492
we live in today, which is
sort of in this small room

00:03:31.492 --> 00:03:32.950
proven by the fact
that more of you

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.040
have actually played
games in the past month

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.800
than have read books
in the past month.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.830
And also, video games have
come an amazingly long way

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.610
in their very short history--
graphics, gameplay design,

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.290
gameplay features.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.180
The ambition and the scope and
the budgets of big video games

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.820
are now at a point which
I think most people would

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.240
have had a difficult
time imagining only,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.044
say, 20 or 25 years ago.

00:04:00.044 --> 00:04:01.960
Just to give you an
example of this evolution,

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.084
then, there's two examples.

00:04:03.084 --> 00:04:05.850
This first game that you can
see on the screen over there

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.230
at least-- "Super Mario
Brothers" from 1995,

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.700
released for the Nintendo
Entertainment System.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.420
Who's played "Super
Mario Brothers?"

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.340
Almost everyone?

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.610
Everyone?

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.695
It's a fantastic
game, obviously.

00:04:19.695 --> 00:04:21.570
And I would say one of
the all time classics,

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.680
and perhaps also the game that
has done the most in shaping

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.380
our perception of what a
video game should be like,

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.930
what a video game
should look like,

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.820
and what the basic
gameplay should feel like.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.507
This is very much-- this
is what a video game is

00:04:35.507 --> 00:04:36.590
for a lot of people today.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.480
And jumping ahead.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.486
This is a picture
from "Uncharted 3."

00:04:44.486 --> 00:04:46.860
There's actually an "Uncharted
4" that came out, I think,

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.950
a couple of days ago or
a couple of weeks ago.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.470
This was released
for the Playstation 3

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.890
by Naughty Dog studios
in-- I think it was 2012.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.330
Who's played a game in
the "Uncharted" series?

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.790
A few of you, at least.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.290
I absolutely adore
this game series.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.550
It's a fantastic, really
big budget blockbuster,

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.226
very reminiscent of the
"Indiana Jones" films in scope.

00:05:11.226 --> 00:05:12.350
It's a fantastic adventure.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.430
And it's really a game series
that shows how far, I think,

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.710
this format has come in
terms of cinematic ambition

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.780
and storytelling ambition.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.365
So brilliant series.

00:05:22.365 --> 00:05:24.240
Yes, obviously, a lot
of things have changed,

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.656
but there are also
a lot of things

00:05:25.656 --> 00:05:27.050
that haven't changed at all.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.600
So going from "Super
Mario Brothers"

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.370
from 1995 to "Uncharted 3,"
which is just a few years old,

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.280
many things have changed, but
many things really are the same

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.470
as they always have been.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.180
And I think one of the primary
things that I would bring up

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.900
is that both of these games are
primarily about the same thing.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.430
So "Super Mario Brothers"
and "Uncharted 3"

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.180
are primarily games-- or I
would say, only games about fun.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.170
They're created to
be entertaining.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.750
And in fact, most
video games today

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.650
are still largely
produced as and meant

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.410
to be discussed as entertainment
products and nothing else,

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.580
really.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:07.800
There is plenty of action.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.230
There's plenty of adventures.

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:10.870
You're jumping around.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.440
You're blowing a lot
of stuff up, which

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.880
is great fun, obviously.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.020
But there's also an
almost complete detachment

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.840
from the world outside.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.880
These games exist in a vacuum.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.180
They exist in their own world.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.750
And there's really
no attempt made

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.370
to engage with the
world they exist in,

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.820
the social and political
realities these games

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.430
are produced in.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:34.940
So "Super Mario,"
obviously, it's

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.010
a game about an Italian
plumber in a fairy tale

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.590
rescuing a princess, battling
fire-breathing lizards

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.290
and jumping on
mushroom soldiers.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.660
"Uncharted" is
about traveling some

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.270
of the most exotic locations
in the world in search

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.880
of treasures and
forbidden legends,

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.340
forgotten legends, shooting
hundreds of thousands

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.010
of bad guys on the way.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.270
And of course, these games,
like all cultural artifacts,

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.700
they carry plenty of meaning.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.420
There's a lot of meaning
and subtext here,

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.180
and there's lots of things that
can be analyzed and discussed.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.230
But I think it's fair to
say that the producers

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.050
of these games-- of
both the "Super Mario"

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.760
series and the
"Uncharted" series--

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.180
are primarily concerned
with entertainment.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.820
Their concern is
giving you something

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.310
that is fun to
play, which is kind

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.970
of the point, the whole thing.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.710
There's nothing wrong with this.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.160
This is a very--
for odd reasons,

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.530
this is a very sensitive
topic to talk about.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.840
So I'd just like to
get this out of the way

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.620
before you start
throwing things at me.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.930
These are fantastic games
from a design perspective.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.731
And really, of course,
we should appreciate them

00:07:46.731 --> 00:07:47.480
for what they are.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.360
I know I do.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.792
And again, I absolutely adore
both of these game series.

00:07:51.792 --> 00:07:53.250
There's a lot of
interesting things

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.870
to be said about
technical progress.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.852
There's a lot of things to
be said about games design

00:07:57.852 --> 00:07:59.560
and how, maybe, the
"Super Mario" series,

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.680
which is a Japanese
series, have brought

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.060
with it lots of design
conventions to the West

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.670
and influenced how Western
game developers work today.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.410
But again, just to
make that point again,

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.120
these are games that
are pure fantasy.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.170
They don't really make an
effort to engage with the world

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.130
outside of their own.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:20.838
They don't really make
an effort to carry

00:08:20.838 --> 00:08:23.060
any sort of social
or political meaning

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:27.080
or make a point about the
social or political realities

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.400
of the world they exist in.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.690
Recently, there is a
clear and very interesting

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:36.340
trend that we've noticed and
many other people have noticed

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.360
as well, where primarily
small and independent games

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.190
developers have
started using games

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.600
and started thinking
about games in a way that

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.210
is quite different from
the way it's been done

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:51.630
in the past-- more specifically,
thinking about how games can

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:55.600
be used to convey stories
and messages to try to make

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.750
a point about real life issues.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:02.580
I thought I'd leave it to Linus
to talk a bit more about a few

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:03.546
of these examples.

00:09:03.546 --> 00:09:04.600
LINUS LARSSON: Yeah.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.890
So you may be familiar
with some of these games.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.210
I'll take them one by one.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.110
The first one is "Cart Life."

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:17.490
This is a game that was released
by game designer Richard

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.930
Hofmeier back in 2011.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.340
This is a street
vendor simulator,

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.620
but it could just as well be
seen as a game about poverty

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.930
in contemporary America.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.320
Here, you play as one of three
street vendor characters.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.750
And they have different
backgrounds and features,

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.880
one being an immigrant
from Ukraine, for example.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.950
But they all
struggle to make ends

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:41.580
meet with what little
amount of money

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.740
they get from selling
newspapers, bagels,

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.900
or coffee in an American city.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.810
Gameplay in "Cart Life"
consists of the everyday task

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:54.706
of setting up your cart,
getting the necessary equipment,

00:09:54.706 --> 00:09:58.790
and spending what little you
make on what is most important.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.760
In "Cart Life," this
will force the player

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.170
to make some really
heart-wrenching decisions,

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:08.630
like should I use the money
to buy food for my cat,

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:12.400
or should I pay the rent
so that I'm not evicted,

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.890
or should I leave work early one
day to have the time to pick up

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.560
my daughter from school
even though it means I mean

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.604
I will earn even less that day?

00:10:23.604 --> 00:10:25.520
As you can see here, the
graphics in this game

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.950
is fairly simple.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.160
It's the kind of
classic pixel graphics

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.840
that you will see
in older games.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.390
That may look primitive.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.420
But after playing
this game for a while,

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:40.070
I have to say that the
interaction nature of the game

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:45.460
makes you take these
choices really serious.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.350
The more time you invest in
the character, in the game,

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:54.061
the more invested you get in the
decisions that has to be made.

00:10:54.061 --> 00:10:56.120
And after a while,
it doesn't really

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.760
matter how simple
the graphics are

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.330
or how they are
being sketched up.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:07.800
You really feel the
struggle of the characters.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.640
In interviews,
Richard Hofmeier has

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.410
talked about how he used the
simple graphics because that

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.940
will allow the player to
fill in the gaps themselves,

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.280
and also talked about
how he was inspired

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.670
to make this game from
his own experience

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:24.670
from bad and poorly paid jobs.

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:25.920
So moving on to the next game.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.190
This is "Depression
Quest," released in 2013

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:35.940
by Zoe Quinn, who is also one of
the contributors to this book.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.070
She created this
tale about depression

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:42.190
in the form of a text-based
choose your own adventure game.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:47.370
Are you familiar with this
genre where you make decisions?

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.720
Some of you are
nodding, so I assume so.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.960
Here, as a player, you
proceed by making decisions

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.970
in everyday
situations that would

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:02.500
be very challenging to people
suffering from depression.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.080
And in "Depression Quest," as
you can see here, actually,

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.980
with the red choices, as
your condition worsens,

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:14.150
more and more choices that would
seem like the logical one--

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.960
perhaps the best decision
to make for yourself--

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.230
are being blocked
off one by one.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.630
And again, something
quite unique to games

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:23.380
is happening here.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:27.700
By blocking out options, I
think that's a really clever way

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:34.730
of using game mechanics to
convey the feeling of what

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.560
suffering from
depression can feel like,

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.250
where good options
may be obvious,

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.700
but feel out of
reach for the person

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.750
suffering from the condition.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:49.240
Again, I think "Depression
Quest" had to be a game.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.830
It's all text-based,
but I don't think

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:52.590
a straight read-through
of the material

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.040
would be very touching.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.610
But when investing
yourself and your time,

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:03.100
something happens, and it
suddenly feels a lot more real.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:07.210
Zoe was also very careful when
designing "Depression Quest"

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:10.450
not to make a
simplistic, happy ending.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:13.760
So the game is a lot less
about solving puzzles

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.530
in the right way and
finishing the game,

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:20.160
and a lot more about
telling a story

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:25.330
and illustrating the features
of actual depression, not just

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:29.330
to create a conventional game.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.830
Another very good example
is "Papers, Please."

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:37.310
This was also released back
in 2013 by a game designer

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:38.930
called Lucas Pope.

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:42.790
It emulates the work life
of an immigrant official

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:48.540
in a fictitious country
called Arstotzka.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:52.790
And Lucas Pope has dubbed
this game a dystopian document

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.126
thriller.

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:56.750
When you're playing
this, on one level,

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:59.060
it is a fairly
simple puzzle game

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.000
where you use documents
and a rubber stamp

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.890
to decide who should be let in
or sent back into the country.

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:09.660
And when playing, it's
sort of an eerie feeling,

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.440
the kind of power
you get when you're

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.510
the one who decides
who gets sent back

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:17.160
or who is let into the country.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.400
It's very dystopian,
and the setting

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.930
is completely
fictitious, but it's also

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.540
a powerful illustration of
the faceless bureaucracy

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.410
of modern day border control.

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.750
So we're both from
Europe, obviously,

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.680
and you're probably
aware of the situation

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.820
right now with
hundreds of thousands

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.950
of people from Syria and
other war-torn countries

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:41.120
knocking on our door.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.880
And especially in
this situation,

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.590
I think a game like
"Papers, Please"

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:47.700
and the underlying
theme of the game

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.800
is topical to say the least.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.550
In my mind, it's one
of the best examples

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:59.820
of how games can take on serious
issues, serious real life

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:05.780
issues, a lot more than what has
been conventional in the games

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.040
industry before.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.577
One more example-- this
list can go on and on.

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:13.160
This one is called
"This War of Mine."

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:18.700
It was released by a Polish
game studio just last year.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.670
It takes on the very
common theme of war,

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.450
but in a very,
very different way.

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:26.040
Here, you don't play as a
soldier, but as a civilian,

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.580
or actually a
group of civilians,

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.680
trying to survive in
a city under siege.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:37.940
I think it's inspired by
Sarajevo in the 1990s.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.950
You don't take on the
role of the sniper,

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:45.390
but rather, the civilians trying
to escape the sniper's shots.

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:49.420
And you don't go on missions to
try to track down and possibly

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.430
kill enemies, but you
sneak out in the night

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:56.260
to scavenge supplies
that you and your peers

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.620
will need to survive.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:03.260
Also in this game,
you don't win per se.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.250
The best outcome
that you can hope for

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:12.560
is to survive long enough for
a cease fire to be called,

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.010
thus ending the game.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:17.740
Again, war is very
common in games.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:23.790
And if most of the mainstream
blockbuster first person

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:28.860
shooters will be the
romanticized view of war,

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.480
a game like "This War of
Mine" is quite the opposite.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.900
It's a very depressing
view of the war,

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.364
but it's also a very
beautifully designed game.

00:16:36.364 --> 00:16:37.780
DANIEL GOLDBERG:
The big question,

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:40.400
obviously, is what's new here.

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:46.870
So all of these four games,
and many more among them,

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.790
are, in some sense, less, I
would say, about entertainment,

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:51.808
and possibly more
about something else.

00:16:53.935 --> 00:16:55.560
All of these games
are fun, and they're

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.950
interesting to play, sure.

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:59.610
They're great gameplay
experiences in themselves.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:02.750
But they also, again, attempt
to make a point about something.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:07.109
There's a conscious effort to
say something about the world.

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:11.400
In that sense, they also become
very political creations,

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.680
because they have an opinion.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.544
They engage with the current
political and social debate

00:17:16.544 --> 00:17:18.210
in a way that hasn't
really been common,

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.349
I would say, in video
games design in the past.

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:21.240
And the difference
here-- I think

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.073
this is very important--
the difference here

00:17:23.073 --> 00:17:24.460
is in the intention.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.800
As Linus said, war is a very,
very common theme in games.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.760
And again, of course a game
series like the Mario series,

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:37.930
for example, it carries with
it a lot of political meaning.

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:39.570
There's the obvious
feminist analysis

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:42.240
to be done, obviously, about
how Mario and Luigi are both men

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.910
and they always rescue
a princess who's

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.410
female from trouble, but you
never get the other way around.

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:47.660
So the men are
always very active,

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.035
the woman is always
very passive.

00:17:49.035 --> 00:17:50.810
That's a very simple
thing, and there's

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:51.960
a lot of meaning in that.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.330
But there's never-- I
would argue there's never

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.130
been a really conscious
effort on the part of the game

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.030
designers to address that.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:07.100
In a sense, that means a game
like "Super Mario Brothers"

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:11.430
is, at least on one level, an
intensely apolitical creation,

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.950
whereas the examples we
have on the screen here

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:16.450
are very political.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.660
Because as an example,
a game like "Cart Life"

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.720
attempts to make a very
clear and very deliberate

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.400
point about poverty in
contemporary society.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.650
They all attempt to
illustrate and capture

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.990
real life issues,
problems, points of debate.

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:35.290
And no matter what the exact
views that are brought forward,

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:37.260
the intention in
itself means that these

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.120
are political
creations in a way that

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.200
hasn't been common in the
games industry in the past.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.690
So there are, of course,
plenty of historical exceptions

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:45.916
to this.

00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:49.490
This is one example-- a
classic 80s Atari arcade

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:52.320
game called "Missile Command."

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.660
I'm sure if anyone is familiar.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.800
Most people would be,
I assume, familiar

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.880
with "Missile Command."
"Missile Command,"

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.600
it's a game where you
protect a series of cities

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.940
from nuclear bombs that
are falling from the sky.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.830
And this game was
created with the stated

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:11.350
purpose of making people aware
of the horrors of nuclear war.

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:14.390
And this is also a game that
is described and analyzed

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.580
in more detail in one of the
essays in "The State of Play."

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:21.660
And it was actually designed and
originally titled Armageddon,

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.547
and it featured attacks on
actual cities in California.

00:19:24.547 --> 00:19:26.130
So these cities that
you're protecting

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:28.610
would have names of actual
cities in California.

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:31.660
And for some reason--
possibly commercial reasons--

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.320
this was changed
before the game was

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.370
released into a more generic
aliens versus human scenario

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:42.010
where you're protecting the
Earth from an alien onslaught.

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:45.800
But I think the most
iconic feature of this game

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.970
was kept in the final release.

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:51.240
So when you fail a game
of "Missile Command,"

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.610
you don't get the
traditional game over screen.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:58.050
You get a screen
that says "The End."

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:00.560
And this is possibly a
subtle hint that all out war

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.890
isn't a the game, isn't
over, but it could actually

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:09.120
spell the literal end,
possibly, for all of humankind.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.030
So with this in
mind, I think you

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:14.970
could say that "Missile Command"
is an early example of game

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:20.110
designers taking their creations
seriously enough, maybe,

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:23.016
to realize that their
games carry meaning.

00:20:23.016 --> 00:20:27.020
And it's up to the designer,
or the designer of the game

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.390
is free to decide what exactly
that meaning should be.

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:31.640
It doesn't have to be passive.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:35.170
You can take an active role
in that as a games designer.

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.454
And again, "Missile Command"
and the various ways

00:20:37.454 --> 00:20:40.120
that this game can be read, this
is subject of one of the essays

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.420
in "The State of
Play" by a historian

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.622
called William Knoblach.

00:20:44.622 --> 00:20:48.800
And the essay is titled "Game
Over: a Cold War Kid Reflects

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.410
on Apocalyptic Video Games."

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:55.490
LINUS LARSSON: So another
thing that is changing here

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:58.910
is the way we talk about games.

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:02.650
Traditionally, games have
been discussed and reviewed,

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:07.810
especially, more than anything
else like pieces of technology.

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:10.690
Questions like, how
smooth are the animations,

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:12.420
and how advanced
are the graphics,

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:16.120
and how well balanced
the gameplay have

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.750
been central to the reviews.

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:21.530
Basically, games criticism
has had more in common

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:25.070
with the way we would
review a mobile phone,

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:29.870
or a car, or even a
refrigerator than criticism

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:33.956
of literature and music.

00:21:33.956 --> 00:21:38.560
And again, there is absolutely
nothing wrong with that.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.950
We keep repeating this because
people tend to get offended

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:46.520
if you talk about something
else than these aspects

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:51.160
as certain parts of
the gaming community.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.780
Because this is a
perfectly viable way

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.840
of talking about games.

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.640
It's basically consumer advice.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.930
And in fact, it
maybe doesn't even

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:00.990
make sense to talk about
a game like "Uncharted"

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:04.040
in any other way.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.710
Some games are quite expensive.

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:08.070
Before you spend
$60, $70 on a game,

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:10.560
who wouldn't want some
straightforward consumer

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.100
advice?

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.340
I know I would like that.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:16.120
So there is absolutely
nothing wrong with this.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:19.710
But in the past few
years, a new generation

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:22.120
of critics and
academics have begun

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.930
discussing games
that place them more

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:27.990
in a social and political
context, looking

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:32.760
to understand what the games
say about the world around it.

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.800
There is currently
a lot of interest

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:38.420
in the feminist
criticism of games

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:42.580
brought forward by, for example,
Anita Sarkisyan, seen here,

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:45.560
and Catherine Cross, also seen
on the other side of the screen

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.560
there, two of the
most important writers

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:52.980
in covering this area today.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.800
And there is a
growing debate on how

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.600
non-whites and
non-Western minorities are

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.640
being portrayed in video games.

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:06.540
[INAUDIBLE], who writes for
Gawker and Kotaku, who's

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.500
seen in the middle
here with his daughter,

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.100
is a key writer in this field.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:13.430
He's also featured-- they
are all featured with essays

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:15.960
in "The State of Play."

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:20.860
So a couple of more examples of
how this discussion is going.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:24.450
One of our contributors
is named Hussein Ibrahim.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:28.706
He's a video game journalist
based in Beirut, Lebanon,

00:23:28.706 --> 00:23:30.730
and the former editor
in chief of one

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:33.960
of the largest Arab gaming
websites in the world.

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:40.510
Hussein absolutely loved
first person shooters--

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:43.200
games like "Battlefield"
and the "Call of Duty"

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.420
series are his favorites.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:50.530
The thing is, though, as
a player in these games,

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:54.280
he has noticed that a lot of the
people that you will be aiming

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:59.260
your gun at will be
people-- will be largely

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:02.500
Arab people in Arab countries.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:06.210
So Hussein, when
playing, is basically

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:09.760
waging war on people like
himself in the very games

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.000
that he loves the most.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.300
As he writes, as
an American, you

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.070
get to relate to
the hero defending

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:19.110
his country from terrorists
threatening your freedom.

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:22.450
As an Arab, you get to relate
to the guy who wants to blow up

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:24.920
your city, and that is all.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.930
Now, this doesn't mean
that all that Hussein has

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:31.150
abandoned these games and wants
to encourage others to do so.

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:34.850
He's not advocating
a boycott at all.

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:39.010
Because he, like all our
contributors, love video games,

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:44.010
and keeps playing these
first person shooters.

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:45.730
But he does make some
fascinating points

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:48.740
of what it feels like to
have people who look like you

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:55.370
and talk like you always be
the bad guys in the game.

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:58.860
Another-- "The Joy
of Virtual Violence"

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:01.510
is the title of
one of the essays.

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:05.560
It's written as an exchange of
letters between game writers

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:09.240
Cara Ellison and Brendan Keogh.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.880
And it explores the
dynamic that makes us enjoy

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:15.100
violent aspects of video games.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.300
A lot of gamers are fed up
with the talk about violence

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:19.300
in games.

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:24.275
Some become very defensive when
the topic is even brought up.

00:25:24.275 --> 00:25:26.900
And this is not very surprising,
because ever since video games

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.080
came about, there
has been attempts

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:33.360
to stigmatize the whole
form, or to censor

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.750
them, or to criminalize
sale of certain games

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:39.400
to minors, for
example, often done

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.440
with very little understanding
of what games are

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.840
and what makes us
want to play them.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.800
But then again, this
essay, like all the ones

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.710
we feature in the
book, is rooted

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:53.030
in a love of video games-- this
specifically, love of violence,

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:56.900
sometimes very gory ones, where
a perfectly-executed headshot

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.350
can be the most
rewarding action.

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:01.740
But Cara and Brandon
are also decent people

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:05.300
who can be disgusted
by violence,

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.100
so their exchanges of
letters is an attempt

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:12.450
to reconcile these thoughts.

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.780
And obviously, this
discussion goes way

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:19.180
beyond the question of
whether video games should

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:24.060
be as violent as they are, and
is more interested in asking

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:27.920
why violence is such a
common theme in games,

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.820
and what it says about
games as a medium,

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:32.814
and possibly even
about ourselves.

00:26:35.739 --> 00:26:38.030
DANIEL GOLDBERG: Because
everyone likes to shoot people

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:38.640
in games, right?

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.110
LINUS LARSSON: Certainly.

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:40.692
DANIEL GOLDBERG: I know I do.

00:26:40.692 --> 00:26:42.127
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:49.180
So we think a good term for
describing the shift that we're

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.735
talking about is post-escapism.

00:26:54.695 --> 00:26:57.070
To say that the way we talk
about games and the way games

00:26:57.070 --> 00:27:01.410
are designed is moving into
a period of post-escapism.

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:03.610
In essence, this
means that we're now

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:06.940
beginning to move from a
time where games were only

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:10.850
talked about and only created
as products of entertainment,

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:12.800
and judged on
entertainment value

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:17.730
and possibly technical merit
alone, into a time where games

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:20.140
are and can be
discussed and examined

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:24.980
based on the way they relate
to the world they exist in.

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:29.020
And I think, in a way, this
is an important coming of age

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.200
for video games as a medium.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.830
Again, if you make
the comparison

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:36.490
to literature or film, for
example, a genre like satire

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:38.550
has been around for
thousands of years

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.820
and does exactly the thing
we're talking about here.

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:44.720
But video games is a
fairly young medium, still,

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.620
and it's, in many ways, a
fairly immature art form.

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:50.400
But right now, we're
at one of these points

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.730
where games-- and again, the
way we talk about games--

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:55.150
is beginning to
take that next step

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:59.400
and change into something else,
or possibly something more.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.000
So this means, one, we're
in a very exciting time

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.600
if you work with games.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.650
Two, this is a
very exciting time

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:09.472
to be writing about
or discussing games.

00:28:09.472 --> 00:28:11.430
And also, me and Linus
are convinced that these

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:13.560
are very positive developments.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.760
Within the games industry,
as I'm sure many of you know,

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:20.430
there's a long tradition of not
being happy with the way games

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:24.250
and games culture is portrayed
in mainstream circles,

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:27.310
without the gaming community,
outside the gaming community--

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:29.880
the mainstream
media, for example.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.430
But what is happening here
is that these developments

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:36.310
are opening doors, or
opening a lot of new doors,

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:39.930
for both video game
creators and critics who

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:43.110
have their background outside
of traditional gamer circles.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:45.010
This is giving
them ways to relate

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:49.250
to the form that haven't
really been around in the past.

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:53.800
In a sense, by moving closer
to the world outside their own,

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.980
which is exactly what
games are doing right now,

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.210
games are becoming,
or have the potential

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:01.740
of becoming, much richer
experiences and much more

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.200
mature experiences
in the past while

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.690
also opening up for
completely new audiences.

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:11.340
And these audiences are
potentially much, much larger

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.760
than the ones that games
have had in the past.

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.650
So "The State of
Play" is our attempt

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:19.390
to capture what we consider
some of the essential voices

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:20.310
of this era.

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:22.960
The contributors are all game
developers, they're critics,

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.370
and they're academics who
all, but in very, very

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:28.200
different ways, make their
own small contribution

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.957
to this new way of creating
and thinking about games.

00:29:31.957 --> 00:29:33.790
And if you decide to
read it, which we hope,

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:37.000
of course, all of
you do, we hope

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.300
it will help you
find interesting

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.660
and possibly new ways of
appreciating and understanding

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:46.769
this is lovely, wonderful
form of entertainment

00:29:46.769 --> 00:29:48.560
that we are talking
about here as something

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.550
to be taken very
seriously and something

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:54.160
that is to be considered as
more than simply entertainment

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.198
for its own sake.

00:29:58.390 --> 00:29:59.066
That's it.

00:29:59.066 --> 00:30:00.232
Thank you all for listening.

00:30:00.232 --> 00:30:03.049
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:03.049 --> 00:30:04.590
LINUS LARSSON: We
are happy to answer

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:06.562
some questions if you have any.

00:30:06.562 --> 00:30:08.020
AUDIENCE: I'm
curious-- do you guys

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.160
have a perspective on
the social aspect that's

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.280
starting to develop
as we see more

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.720
and more of the kids,
especially teenagers,

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.370
spending the majority of
their social interaction time

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:21.270
now online, even counting time
they have to spend in school.

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:22.890
Being a parent of
one of those, I'm

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:24.530
curious to get your
perspective on it.

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:24.890
LINUS LARSSON: Right.

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:27.850
So you're talking specifically
about online games and the kind

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:28.440
of culture that evolves there?

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:29.856
AUDIENCE: In
particular, he spends

00:30:29.856 --> 00:30:32.740
a lot of time doing team-based
activities in the first person

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:33.600
shooters.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.990
DANIEL GOLDBERG: So this is
actually a good question.

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:37.573
This is something we talk about
quite a lot in our first book,

00:30:37.573 --> 00:30:40.290
which is about "Minecraft"
and specifically

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:44.420
about some of the absolutely
extraordinary creations that

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:47.402
have come out of kids
basically self-organizing

00:30:47.402 --> 00:30:49.110
around this game and
creating some really

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:52.560
stunning things using it.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.930
I'm a parent also.

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:55.480
I have a two-year-old at home.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.170
He's maybe not big enough
to play "Minecraft" yet,

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:00.070
but I'm getting to the
point where I'm asking

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:01.430
the same questions of myself.

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:05.860
I have a very inherently
positive view of these things.

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:08.580
I am not convinced
that-- or I don't really

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:12.350
understand why this in
itself-- why a screen in itself

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:16.030
and talking to someone over
the internet is a bad thing.

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:17.470
Why is that different
than talking

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:18.470
to someone in real life?

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:20.740
I'm not convinced that it is.

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:24.140
What I do know is that some
really fantastic things

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:25.240
can come out of this.

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:28.890
And possibly more specifically
related to "The State of Play,"

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:31.280
which is a book
where-- naturally,

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.310
a lot of the
discussion we bring up

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:36.550
centers around minorities
of various sorts

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:38.900
and how minority communities
are now beginning

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.710
to make themselves heard in the
gaming community in a way that

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:45.860
hasn't been in the past-- again,
very positive development,

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:46.360
I think.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.320
And the internet, by opening
up to the rest of the world,

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.410
means that your chances
of finding someone

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:54.650
who shares your
views on things, who

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:59.932
shares your struggles in life,
are increased exponentially

00:31:59.932 --> 00:32:01.390
compared to how it
was in the past.

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:05.280
So I agree, but I
think it's good.

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:10.120
AUDIENCE: I was curious
where you guys think

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:13.760
the language that we use to
talk about games will come from.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:26.330
Because the medium is so young
that there's no codified way

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:27.990
to talk about it yet.

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:32.930
And I was wondering if you guys
have any thoughts about where

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:36.015
that will come from or what
that process might look like.

00:32:36.015 --> 00:32:39.310
LINUS LARSSON: That's
a really good question.

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:41.020
Just looking at
the kind of essays

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:43.620
we got to include in the book,
they're extremely different.

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:46.150
They range from
the very academic

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:49.400
to the extremely personal.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:53.380
Some of them are
written, as I mentioned,

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:54.570
as an exchange of letters.

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:56.490
There's so many ways
of talking about games,

00:32:56.490 --> 00:33:00.862
and I think there probably will
be a multitude of it happening.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:07.690
There must be something coming
from the fact that games

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:09.850
writing and games
journalism largely

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:14.530
grew-- emerged separate
mainstream media.

00:33:17.074 --> 00:33:18.990
All mainstream media
struggled to cover games.

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:25.490
I work for a large daily myself,
and it's not entirely clear

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:28.670
how it should be covered
in circuits like that.

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:32.747
But I think the way you
can write about the games,

00:33:32.747 --> 00:33:34.830
the language you can use
when talking about games,

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:37.970
has been affected by the
fact that it has grown

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:40.430
separate-- online, more
than anything else--

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:43.470
and separate from the way
we talk about literature,

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:44.940
for example, or film.

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.840
And while it could be
influenced by that,

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:50.229
it will keep some-- it will
be unique in some way as well.

00:33:50.229 --> 00:33:52.520
DANIEL GOLDBERG: It is actually
a really good question.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.940
And I think it sort
of connects to some

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.160
of the points we made
earlier about how,

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:02.080
one, as Linus is saying,
this discourse around games

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:04.930
has its roots in technology,
which means we've tended

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:07.024
to evaluate games based
on technological merit,

00:34:07.024 --> 00:34:08.940
because that's the
language that is available.

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:13.610
And also, it connects to
how the new voices we're

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:16.130
trying to highlight
in "The State of Play"

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:19.750
are approaching games from
a different perspective

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:22.320
and using language that
is, perhaps, closer

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.520
to what traditional cultural
criticism, possibly,

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.690
has been about in the past.

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:30.080
And again, this is something
that is opening doors.

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.130
This means that a new generation
of critics and academics,

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:35.659
but also people who are
interested in games design,

00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:38.540
are able to approach the
field and make something

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:41.227
interesting out of it without
the necessary background

00:34:41.227 --> 00:34:43.810
or the background in technology
that has really been necessary

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:44.730
in the past.

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:47.614
It also comes down to
tools such as Twine.

00:34:47.614 --> 00:34:48.780
Are you familiar with Twine?

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.404
Twine, for those of
you who don't know,

00:34:50.404 --> 00:34:53.010
is a platform that
can be used to create

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:54.760
adventure games or
text-based games

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.534
without a programming
background.

00:34:57.534 --> 00:34:59.400
And [INAUDIBLE] is one
of our contributors

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.930
in the book-- hasn't
got a coding background,

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:04.746
but creates really fascinating
experiences with a platform

00:35:04.746 --> 00:35:06.120
like Twine, which
doesn't require

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.911
you to have a technical
background in order

00:35:07.911 --> 00:35:09.320
to create games.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.920
That's a really fascinating
thing to talk about, actually.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:14.419
AUDIENCE: For me personally,
one of the things that's always

00:35:14.419 --> 00:35:16.916
been very special about
video games and something

00:35:16.916 --> 00:35:19.040
that's attracted me to it--
and I think that's also

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:23.190
a very powerful
aspect of games--

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:26.320
is the fact that when they're
trying to convey a message,

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.600
it's always a very
interactive experience.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.630
So as opposed to reading
something or watching

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:34.250
something, actually stepping
into the shoes of someone who's

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:35.900
in this particular
situation does

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:39.300
a very good job of getting
these kinds of messages across.

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:45.520
But there has been a very large,
widespread new consumption

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:48.710
of games through things
like Let's Play on YouTube

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:50.362
and Twitch TV with streaming.

00:35:50.362 --> 00:35:52.070
And I was wondering
what you guys thought

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:56.560
about the effects of this
more passive consumption

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.287
of video games as a medium.

00:35:58.287 --> 00:36:00.370
DANIEL GOLDBERG: Another
great question, actually.

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:00.840
I agree.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.380
And I think a game
like "Cart Life--"

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:04.796
if you haven't tried "Cart
Life," you should check it out.

00:36:04.796 --> 00:36:07.270
It's a stunning experience
when you're-- as you say,

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:09.660
games make you identify with
the choices in a way that

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:13.040
isn't really possible in more
passive forms of entertainment.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:17.250
And by forcing you to identify
with choices like do I

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:20.812
feed my cat or myself, it's
a heart-wrenching experience.

00:36:20.812 --> 00:36:22.270
It's a very, very
strong experience

00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:25.850
that isn't really possible
outside of games, I think.

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:28.110
I'm not sure.

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:31.070
Having said that, some
games are very well--

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:33.420
narratively-driven games
or story-driven games,

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.980
that isn't the whole picture.

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:41.250
And some games are very
suitable for-- a game

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:43.500
like "Cart Life" wouldn't
be as strong if you watch it

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:44.624
as a let's play, of course.

00:36:44.624 --> 00:36:47.580
But watching someone
play-- I'm not sure.

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:49.310
I'm a big "Dark
Souls" fan myself,

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:51.880
and watching someone play the
"Dark Souls" series on YouTube,

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:54.480
it's a great
experience, because it's

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.580
sort of-- but it's
also different,

00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.890
because it's more
about conveying

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:01.510
that feeling of playing
something with a friend

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:04.170
rather than playing it yourself.

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:08.009
But I think you're right in that
some gameplay experiences can't

00:37:08.009 --> 00:37:10.050
really be conveyed in that
much more passive way,

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:11.466
or a lot of the
force is, perhaps,

00:37:11.466 --> 00:37:12.810
lost in that transition.

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:16.932
I haven't got a good answer,
but it's a fascinating point.

00:37:16.932 --> 00:37:19.140
LINUS LARSSON: And every
play through will be unique,

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.910
and every play through
will, to some extent,

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:23.080
tell a different story.

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:26.700
So reading about someone
and someone's experience

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:29.760
with a game, or watching them
play it in a certain way,

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:34.960
perhaps, this could tell a
different story every time.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:38.450
One example-- there's
actually a comedian in Sweden

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:42.200
who made a point of
trying to play the latest

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:46.350
Sim City as a Swedish
Social Democrat

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:48.970
with the tax levels
we have, which isn't

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:50.080
even possible in the game.

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.410
They're capped way
below what we pay.

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:56.930
But if you max that out to try
to come as close as possible,

00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:59.460
there will be absolute chaos.

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:02.220
There will be fires everywhere,
and the city you make

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:05.244
will just break down and
be completely destroyed,

00:38:05.244 --> 00:38:06.160
and everyone will die.

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:09.400
Well, of course, that's
funny, but it also

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:13.260
obviously says something
where the makers of that game

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.699
came from.

00:38:14.699 --> 00:38:15.740
DANIEL GOLDBERG: Awesome.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.430
And again, thanks for
coming down to listen to us.

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:18.346
LINUS LARSSON: Thanks.

00:38:18.346 --> 00:38:21.380
