00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.794
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We can connect these points to form all the points that represent the miles

00:00:03.794 --> 00:00:07.893
driven and the cost of our truck rental. Here's what our graph would look like.

00:00:07.893 --> 00:00:11.929
And notice that the graph continues to increase up into the right, well that's

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.801
because I can drive more miles and my cost would continue to go up. But wait,

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:20.276
there's something else going here with this equation. If we switch these two

00:00:20.276 --> 00:00:25.353
terms around then the equation becomes y equals 2x plus 20. This is an equation

00:00:25.353 --> 00:00:30.167
in slope intercept form. So, what's the slope and the y-intercept for this

00:00:30.167 --> 00:00:32.391
equation? Put your answers here.
