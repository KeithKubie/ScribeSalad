00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:28.970
other forces leading to climate change
and climate change is not just

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980
and climate change is not just
 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.339
and climate change is not just
temperature but it's precipitation and

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349
temperature but it's precipitation and
 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.010

such as cap-and-trade which you know
 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.090
such as cap-and-trade which you know
here in Europe but carbon taxes which

about foreign languages he stood up and
he said mathematics is language and he

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099
he said mathematics is language and he
 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.320
he said mathematics is language and he
sat down and and he's write the language

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330
sat down and and he's write the language

economists are focused on the strata so

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359
economists are focused on the strata so
 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:13.540

let me just turn out of
 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.000
let me just turn out of
to a little bit of the actual results so

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010
to a little bit of the actual results so
 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.120
to a little bit of the actual results so

and others have focused on strategies to
 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.680
and others have focused on strategies to
slow climate change and they're

it shows some of the trade-off
now that's abatement I'll say a word

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780
now that's abatement I'll say a word
 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.950
now that's abatement I'll say a word
about just a word about damages because

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960
about just a word about damages because
 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.750
about just a word about damages because
in our economics what we're going to do

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760
in our economics what we're going to do
 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.150
in our economics what we're going to do
is weigh the costs of reducing emissions

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160
is weigh the costs of reducing emissions
 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.540
is weigh the costs of reducing emissions
and slowing climate change or limiting

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550
and slowing climate change or limiting

temperature on the one hand with the
 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.170
temperature on the one hand with the
reduction in damages on the other so we

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180
reduction in damages on the other so we
 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.030
reduction in damages on the other so we
have to you have to go out and do the

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.040
have to you have to go out and do the
 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.130
have to you have to go out and do the
modeling you have to determine what the

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:15.140
modeling you have to determine what the
 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.100
modeling you have to determine what the
damages are and you might say well

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110
damages are and you might say well
 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.290
damages are and you might say well
that's impact sound easier because our

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300
that's impact sound easier because our

debate mentor you need the physics and

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280
debate mentor you need the physics and
 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.310
debate mentor you need the physics and
the chemistry and all that but actually

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.320
the chemistry and all that but actually
 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.710
the chemistry and all that but actually
damages damages is just

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720
damages damages is just
 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.650
damages damages is just
comics and ecology but actually damages

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:29.660
comics and ecology but actually damages
 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.250
comics and ecology but actually damages
are much much more difficult and it's

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:33.260
are much much more difficult and it's
 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.020
are much much more difficult and it's
probably the most difficult task in all

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030
probably the most difficult task in all
 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.500
probably the most difficult task in all
of our processes that were on that last

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:38.510
of our processes that were on that last
 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.050
of our processes that were on that last

the things we don't understand very well

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190
the things we don't understand very well
 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.100
the things we don't understand very well
there we don't have historical

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110
there we don't have historical
 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.910
there we don't have historical
experience of this so it's actually

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:47.920
experience of this so it's actually
 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.430
experience of this so it's actually
probably the most difficult so what I'll

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440
probably the most difficult so what I'll
 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.560
probably the most difficult so what I'll
do is I'll show you some illustrative

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:53.570
do is I'll show you some illustrative
 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.630
do is I'll show you some illustrative
results I suppose these slides will be

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:55.640
results I suppose these slides will be
 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.990
results I suppose these slides will be
available so that they will be available

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000
available so that they will be available
 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.180
available so that they will be available
let me I guess they will be available on

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.190
let me I guess they will be available on
 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.120
let me I guess they will be available on
the website so some of you I know this

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.130
the website so some of you I know this
 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.620
the website so some of you I know this
goes by very fast but some of you who

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:05.630
goes by very fast but some of you who
 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.120
goes by very fast but some of you who
want to look at them in detail can go

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.130
want to look at them in detail can go
 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.940
want to look at them in detail can go
back and and find them but I want to

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:09.950
back and and find them but I want to
 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.500
back and and find them but I want to
show you an example of the results from

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:14.510
show you an example of the results from
 

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.860
show you an example of the results from
the the dice model and this I want to

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:17.870
the the dice model and this I want to
 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.000
the the dice model and this I want to
emphasize this is only one of many

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.010
emphasize this is only one of many
 

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.650
emphasize this is only one of many
models there there are people in the

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:20.660
models there there are people in the
 

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.290
models there there are people in the
room who do who do I won't point you out

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:23.300
room who do who do I won't point you out
 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.450
room who do who do I won't point you out
but you know who you are who are doing

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:25.460
but you know who you are who are doing
 

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.600
but you know who you are who are doing
my other models and they're they're

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:27.610
my other models and they're they're
 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.710
my other models and they're they're
wonderful models and people around the

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:29.720
wonderful models and people around the
 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.050
wonderful models and people around the
world who are doing this the only reason

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:32.060
world who are doing this the only reason
 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.190
world who are doing this the only reason
I present well the main reason I

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:33.200
I present well the main reason I
 

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.500
I present well the main reason I
presented is cuz I know it but also it's

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:35.510
presented is cuz I know it but also it's
 

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.120
presented is cuz I know it but also it's
a simple model has a virtue of

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.130
a simple model has a virtue of
 

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.670
a simple model has a virtue of
simplicity and comprehensiveness in the

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680
simplicity and comprehensiveness in the
 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.590
simplicity and comprehensiveness in the
sense that it does close that all the

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:41.600
sense that it does close that all the
 

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.740
sense that it does close that all the
boxes the links in that and another

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:44.750
boxes the links in that and another
 

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.159
boxes the links in that and another
model some do and some don't but I would

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:48.169
model some do and some don't but I would
 

00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:50.260
model some do and some don't but I would
emphasize that these are very simplified

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:50.270
emphasize that these are very simplified
 

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.030
emphasize that these are very simplified
models and so for example the climate

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:52.040
models and so for example the climate
 

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.240
models and so for example the climate
sector two equations whereas if you go

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:55.250
sector two equations whereas if you go
 

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.370
sector two equations whereas if you go
to some of the large climate models

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:57.380
to some of the large climate models
 

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.890
to some of the large climate models
they'll have a million equations and so

00:07:59.890 --> 00:07:59.900
they'll have a million equations and so
 

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.719
they'll have a million equations and so
these are very very these don't have the

00:08:01.719 --> 00:08:01.729
these are very very these don't have the
 

00:08:01.729 --> 00:08:05.320
these are very very these don't have the
resolution of the most the most

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:05.330
resolution of the most the most
 

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.740
resolution of the most the most
comprehensive and up-to-date models so

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:08.750
comprehensive and up-to-date models so
 

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.100
comprehensive and up-to-date models so
he let me give me so I want to talk

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:12.110
he let me give me so I want to talk
 

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.870
he let me give me so I want to talk
about four sets of policies and I'll

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:13.880
about four sets of policies and I'll
 

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.600
about four sets of policies and I'll
just mention these briefly one is what a

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:16.610
just mention these briefly one is what a
 

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.969
just mention these briefly one is what a
business-as-usual which is basically no

00:08:18.969 --> 00:08:18.979
business-as-usual which is basically no
 

00:08:18.979 --> 00:08:21.580
business-as-usual which is basically no
policies or minimal policies a second

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:21.590
policies or minimal policies a second
 

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.290
policies or minimal policies a second
one is where you balance the costs and

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:23.300
one is where you balance the costs and
 

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.380
one is where you balance the costs and
the benefits a third is where you limit

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:26.390
the benefits a third is where you limit
 

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.420
the benefits a third is where you limit
temperatures over time to say one and a

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:28.430
temperatures over time to say one and a
 

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.920
temperatures over time to say one and a
half degrees which is the latest

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:29.930
half degrees which is the latest
 

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:31.659
half degrees which is the latest
objective or two degrees or two and a

00:08:31.659 --> 00:08:31.669
objective or two degrees or two and a
 

00:08:31.669 --> 00:08:33.940
objective or two degrees or two and a
half degrees and a third is my

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:33.950
half degrees and a third is my
 

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.130
half degrees and a third is my
modification of that where you don't

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:36.140
modification of that where you don't
 

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.860
modification of that where you don't
limit it as an absolute cap but you're

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:38.870
limit it as an absolute cap but you're
 

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.319
limit it as an absolute cap but you're
limited over an average period

00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:40.329
limited over an average period
 

00:08:40.329 --> 00:08:42.839
limited over an average period
that actually makes more sense because a

00:08:42.839 --> 00:08:42.849
that actually makes more sense because a
 

00:08:42.849 --> 00:08:44.579
that actually makes more sense because a
lot of processes are function of

00:08:44.579 --> 00:08:44.589
lot of processes are function of
 

00:08:44.589 --> 00:08:46.949
lot of processes are function of
averages rather than just the absolute

00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:46.959
averages rather than just the absolute
 

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:49.379
averages rather than just the absolute
level at a point of time so those are

00:08:49.379 --> 00:08:49.389
level at a point of time so those are
 

00:08:49.389 --> 00:08:51.900
level at a point of time so those are
the four that I'll I'll show you some

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:51.910
the four that I'll I'll show you some
 

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:59.069
the four that I'll I'll show you some
results from so one is you you take

00:08:59.069 --> 00:08:59.079
results from so one is you you take
 

00:08:59.079 --> 00:09:00.780
results from so one is you you take
these and I'll just one other thing so

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:00.790
these and I'll just one other thing so
 

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.220
these and I'll just one other thing so
you take this business as usual what

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:02.230
you take this business as usual what
 

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.889
you take this business as usual what
happened and then let's say if you want

00:09:04.889 --> 00:09:04.899
happened and then let's say if you want
 

00:09:04.899 --> 00:09:06.509
happened and then let's say if you want
to limit the temperature to two degrees

00:09:06.509 --> 00:09:06.519
to limit the temperature to two degrees
 

00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:09.030
to limit the temperature to two degrees
C which is in the third bullet there how

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040
C which is in the third bullet there how
 

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.829
C which is in the third bullet there how
can you do that most efficiently so it's

00:09:10.829 --> 00:09:10.839
can you do that most efficiently so it's
 

00:09:10.839 --> 00:09:13.139
can you do that most efficiently so it's
not just any old way but if that you've

00:09:13.139 --> 00:09:13.149
not just any old way but if that you've
 

00:09:13.149 --> 00:09:15.329
not just any old way but if that you've
got cost of doing it and you've got the

00:09:15.329 --> 00:09:15.339
got cost of doing it and you've got the
 

00:09:15.339 --> 00:09:17.160
got cost of doing it and you've got the
systems and you want to find how can I

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:17.170
systems and you want to find how can I
 

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.840
systems and you want to find how can I
limit it to two degrees in the way

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:18.850
limit it to two degrees in the way
 

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.619
limit it to two degrees in the way
that's the most cost the least costly

00:09:22.619 --> 00:09:22.629
that's the most cost the least costly
 

00:09:22.629 --> 00:09:25.679
that's the most cost the least costly
and in the economic sense so here's a

00:09:25.679 --> 00:09:25.689
and in the economic sense so here's a
 

00:09:25.689 --> 00:09:28.229
and in the economic sense so here's a
here's a picture that shows it's a

00:09:28.229 --> 00:09:28.239
here's a picture that shows it's a
 

00:09:28.239 --> 00:09:30.419
here's a picture that shows it's a
little it's a little crowded but I'll

00:09:30.419 --> 00:09:30.429
little it's a little crowded but I'll
 

00:09:30.429 --> 00:09:32.519
little it's a little crowded but I'll
give you a quick rundown so the top so

00:09:32.519 --> 00:09:32.529
give you a quick rundown so the top so
 

00:09:32.529 --> 00:09:34.919
give you a quick rundown so the top so
on the this is time from 0 to I've gone

00:09:34.919 --> 00:09:34.929
on the this is time from 0 to I've gone
 

00:09:34.929 --> 00:09:37.499
on the this is time from 0 to I've gone
to 2150 just to give it a little further

00:09:37.499 --> 00:09:37.509
to 2150 just to give it a little further
 

00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:41.280
to 2150 just to give it a little further
depth and this is then from 0 to 6

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:41.290
depth and this is then from 0 to 6
 

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.889
depth and this is then from 0 to 6
degrees C above pre-industrial we're

00:09:43.889 --> 00:09:43.899
degrees C above pre-industrial we're
 

00:09:43.899 --> 00:09:47.909
degrees C above pre-industrial we're
already at about 0.8 0.9 so in and this

00:09:47.909 --> 00:09:47.919
already at about 0.8 0.9 so in and this
 

00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:50.699
already at about 0.8 0.9 so in and this
shows you different paths doing this on

00:09:50.699 --> 00:09:50.709
shows you different paths doing this on
 

00:09:50.709 --> 00:09:52.739
shows you different paths doing this on
the top path is if we do nothing and you

00:09:52.739 --> 00:09:52.749
the top path is if we do nothing and you
 

00:09:52.749 --> 00:09:54.479
the top path is if we do nothing and you
can see that just keeps climbing and

00:09:54.479 --> 00:09:54.489
can see that just keeps climbing and
 

00:09:54.489 --> 00:09:58.169
can see that just keeps climbing and
it's it's pretty pretty substantial by

00:09:58.169 --> 00:09:58.179
it's it's pretty pretty substantial by
 

00:09:58.179 --> 00:10:01.679
it's it's pretty pretty substantial by
the 20 120 150 and then there are other

00:10:01.679 --> 00:10:01.689
the 20 120 150 and then there are other
 

00:10:01.689 --> 00:10:05.329
the 20 120 150 and then there are other
paths there's one that have say economic

00:10:05.329 --> 00:10:05.339
paths there's one that have say economic
 

00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:07.799
paths there's one that have say economic
cost-benefit path where you balance

00:10:07.799 --> 00:10:07.809
cost-benefit path where you balance
 

00:10:07.809 --> 00:10:10.470
cost-benefit path where you balance
costs and benefits and then there's this

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:10.480
costs and benefits and then there's this
 

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.059
costs and benefits and then there's this
green one where you limit it to two

00:10:12.059 --> 00:10:12.069
green one where you limit it to two
 

00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:14.220
green one where you limit it to two
degrees C and then some of the other

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:14.230
degrees C and then some of the other
 

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.609
degrees C and then some of the other
ones are where you limited say two

00:10:17.609 --> 00:10:17.619
ones are where you limited say two
 

00:10:17.619 --> 00:10:19.650
ones are where you limited say two
degrees C with the 200-year averaging

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:19.660
degrees C with the 200-year averaging
 

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.949
degrees C with the 200-year averaging
two degrees C with a 100 year averaging

00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:22.959
two degrees C with a 100 year averaging
 

00:10:22.959 --> 00:10:25.289
two degrees C with a 100 year averaging
or one and a half degrees with the one

00:10:25.289 --> 00:10:25.299
or one and a half degrees with the one
 

00:10:25.299 --> 00:10:27.509
or one and a half degrees with the one
your 100 your averaging they all look

00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519
your 100 your averaging they all look
 

00:10:27.519 --> 00:10:30.179
your 100 your averaging they all look
pretty much this so if you go out and

00:10:30.179 --> 00:10:30.189
pretty much this so if you go out and
 

00:10:30.189 --> 00:10:32.100
pretty much this so if you go out and
you they actually don't look very

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:32.110
you they actually don't look very
 

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:33.569
you they actually don't look very
different for quite a while and then

00:10:33.569 --> 00:10:33.579
different for quite a while and then
 

00:10:33.579 --> 00:10:36.720
different for quite a while and then
they begin to diverge after 2050 or so

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:36.730
they begin to diverge after 2050 or so
 

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:38.909
they begin to diverge after 2050 or so
but they have very different paths but

00:10:38.909 --> 00:10:38.919
but they have very different paths but
 

00:10:38.919 --> 00:10:40.619
but they have very different paths but
the main thing I'll show you is actually

00:10:40.619 --> 00:10:40.629
the main thing I'll show you is actually
 

00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:43.079
the main thing I'll show you is actually
if you take steps now to implement these

00:10:43.079 --> 00:10:43.089
if you take steps now to implement these
 

00:10:43.089 --> 00:10:45.749
if you take steps now to implement these
you have quite different futures from

00:10:45.749 --> 00:10:45.759
you have quite different futures from
 

00:10:45.759 --> 00:10:47.579
you have quite different futures from
very very high temperatures on the one

00:10:47.579 --> 00:10:47.589
very very high temperatures on the one
 

00:10:47.589 --> 00:10:49.900
very very high temperatures on the one
hand to relatively low for the

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:49.910
hand to relatively low for the
 

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.800
hand to relatively low for the
for the temperature limiting paths the

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:53.810
for the temperature limiting paths the
 

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:56.170
for the temperature limiting paths the
next slide I want to show you it shows

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:56.180
next slide I want to show you it shows
 

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.950
next slide I want to show you it shows
you the of the economics of this so the

00:10:59.950 --> 00:10:59.960
you the of the economics of this so the
 

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:04.060
you the of the economics of this so the
Green Line the green bars show you and

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:04.070
Green Line the green bars show you and
 

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:08.410
Green Line the green bars show you and
don't worry too much about the the the

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:08.420
don't worry too much about the the the
 

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.910
don't worry too much about the the the
units here on the left they're their

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920
units here on the left they're their
 

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.610
units here on the left they're their
present values but but they're just the

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:12.620
present values but but they're just the
 

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:14.440
present values but but they're just the
bars or what I want to emphasize on so

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:14.450
bars or what I want to emphasize on so
 

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.900
bars or what I want to emphasize on so
you can see the damages from doing

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:16.910
you can see the damages from doing
 

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.760
you can see the damages from doing
nothing to the optimal to the

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:18.770
nothing to the optimal to the
 

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:21.190
nothing to the optimal to the
temperature limiting and the damages

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200
temperature limiting and the damages
 

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.810
temperature limiting and the damages
obviously as you limit temperature

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:22.820
obviously as you limit temperature
 

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.130
obviously as you limit temperature
increase the damages are going to go

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:24.140
increase the damages are going to go
 

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.230
increase the damages are going to go
down from from left to right and these

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240
down from from left to right and these
 

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.270
down from from left to right and these
are increasingly stringent policies from

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:28.280
are increasingly stringent policies from
 

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.380
are increasingly stringent policies from
left to right increasingly ambitious

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:29.390
left to right increasingly ambitious
 

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:33.310
left to right increasingly ambitious
policies and then so the damages go down

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:33.320
policies and then so the damages go down
 

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.050
policies and then so the damages go down
but then what are the costs well they're

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:35.060
but then what are the costs well they're
 

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.310
but then what are the costs well they're
not not much cost if you don't do

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320
not not much cost if you don't do
 

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.520
not not much cost if you don't do
anything but as you become increasingly

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:39.530
anything but as you become increasingly
 

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:43.570
anything but as you become increasingly
ambitious the cross rise and so you

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:43.580
ambitious the cross rise and so you
 

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.550
ambitious the cross rise and so you
wanted what economics says well how are

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:45.560
wanted what economics says well how are
 

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.320
wanted what economics says well how are
you going to balance these and if you if

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:47.330
you going to balance these and if you if
 

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:51.370
you going to balance these and if you if
you were if your manukan see that the

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:51.380
you were if your manukan see that the
 

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.680
you were if your manukan see that the
extremes you have a lot of damages and

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:53.690
extremes you have a lot of damages and
 

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:55.270
extremes you have a lot of damages and
no cost at one extreme and a lot of

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:55.280
no cost at one extreme and a lot of
 

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.040
no cost at one extreme and a lot of
costs and very little damages or the

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:57.050
costs and very little damages or the

other and somehow in between you can
 

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.870
other and somehow in between you can
balance the two and what you wanted to

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:01.880
balance the two and what you wanted to
 

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.700
balance the two and what you wanted to
think of in economics or in more

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:03.710
think of in economics or in more
 

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:05.650

generally is what's the best balance

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:05.660
generally is what's the best balance
 

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.540
generally is what's the best balance
between these two is that the optimal is

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:07.550
between these two is that the optimal is
 

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:09.820

it a two degree is a averaging period

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:09.830
it a two degree is a averaging period
 

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:11.830
it a two degree is a averaging period
what different averaging period so you

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:11.840
what different averaging period so you
 

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.600
what different averaging period so you
want to find some balance between the

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:13.610
want to find some balance between the
 

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:18.000
want to find some balance between the
costs and the benefits of the damages

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.010
 
 

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:29.230
 
now economics yep so economics points to

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:29.240
now economics yep so economics points to
 

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.260
now economics yep so economics points to
one inconvenient truth about climate

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:32.270

change policy and that is to be

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:33.650
change policy and that is to be
 

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:37.000
change policy and that is to be
effective the policies have to raise the

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:37.010
effective the policies have to raise the
 

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:41.310
effective the policies have to raise the
price of carbon or co2 and by doing that

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:41.320
price of carbon or co2 and by doing that
 

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.600

correct the externality of the

correct the externality of the
 

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:48.100
correct the externality of the
marketplace and so one of the I think

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:48.110
marketplace and so one of the I think
 

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.740

one of the insights of economics I feel

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:50.750
one of the insights of economics I feel
 

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:52.960
one of the insights of economics I feel
very strongly about is if you're going

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:52.970
very strongly about is if you're going
 

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:54.550
very strongly about is if you're going
to be effective you have to raise the

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560
to be effective you have to raise the
 

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.010
to be effective you have to raise the
price because putting a price on our

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:57.020
price because putting a price on our
 

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.780
price because putting a price on our
activities is the only way I mean we

00:12:58.780 --> 00:12:58.790

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:01.150

you're going to do that effectively is

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:14.940
you're going to do that effectively is
 

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:18.800
you're going to do that effectively is
to increase the price of carbon and I

idea of the social cost of carbon which
 

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.280
idea of the social cost of carbon which
is how much it costs to put a ton of

question is that the world carbon price

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:08.730
question is that the world carbon price
 

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.030
question is that the world carbon price
is nowhere near where anyone thinks it

essentially zero and I I'm not going to

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:25.650
essentially zero and I I'm not going to
 

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:28.070

go through the various proofs of that

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:28.080
go through the various proofs of that
 

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.800
go through the various proofs of that
but I want to talk about what why that's

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:30.810
but I want to talk about what why that's
 

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:34.100
but I want to talk about what why that's
a problem and what we might do about it

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:34.110
a problem and what we might do about it
 

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:40.700
a problem and what we might do about it
enough so as I think about this the the

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:40.710
enough so as I think about this the the
 

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:46.360
enough so as I think about this the the
read the problem here is the that these

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:46.370
read the problem here is the that these
 

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:49.640
read the problem here is the that these
treaties have been ineffective in

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:49.650
treaties have been ineffective in
 

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:51.200
treaties have been ineffective in
limiting carbon emissions I'll just show

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:51.210
limiting carbon emissions I'll just show
 

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:54.520
limiting carbon emissions I'll just show
actually I'll show you one graph here

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:54.530
 
 

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:57.280
 
which is the trend in global emissions

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:57.290
which is the trend in global emissions
 

00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:02.930
which is the trend in global emissions
from 1970 to 2017 policies have been

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:02.940
from 1970 to 2017 policies have been
 

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.060
from 1970 to 2017 policies have been
really ineffective in dealing with

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:05.070
really ineffective in dealing with
 

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:07.819
really ineffective in dealing with
climate change and the reason is because

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:07.829
climate change and the reason is because
 

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:11.180
climate change and the reason is because
of free riding and freeriding is where

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:11.190
of free riding and freeriding is where
 

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:13.730
of free riding and freeriding is where
you receive the benefit of collective

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:13.740
you receive the benefit of collective
 

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.280
you receive the benefit of collective
activity collective action without

activity collective action without
 

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:19.010
activity collective action without
paying the cost without contributing and

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:19.020
paying the cost without contributing and
 

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:22.000
paying the cost without contributing and
the case of international climate policy

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:22.010
the case of international climate policy
 

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:24.829
the case of international climate policy
what it means is you you get the

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:24.839
what it means is you you get the
 

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:26.060
what it means is you you get the
reduction in down

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:26.070
reduction in down
 

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:27.830
reduction in down
due to people's efforts but you don't

00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:27.840
due to people's efforts but you don't
 

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:32.360
due to people's efforts but you don't
have to do any costly steps at home and

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:32.370
have to do any costly steps at home and
 

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:35.960
have to do any costly steps at home and
so I'll just talk that's the free rider

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:35.970
so I'll just talk that's the free rider
 

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:39.250
so I'll just talk that's the free rider

called a climate Club and want to talk

00:17:59.150 --> 00:17:59.160
called a climate Club and want to talk
 

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.200
called a climate Club and want to talk
about that in my last three minutes so

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:03.210
about that in my last three minutes so
 

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:04.970
about that in my last three minutes so
what is the idea of a climate club the

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:04.980
what is the idea of a climate club the
 

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:08.090
what is the idea of a climate club the
idea that nations can overcome the

where you you know what clubs are we're
all in clubs of various kinds but

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520
all in clubs of various kinds but
 

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.160

remember there's the club of NATO which
 

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:31.580
remember there's the club of NATO which
you're not a member but the Sweden is

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:31.590
you're not a member but the Sweden is
 

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:33.710
you're not a member but the Sweden is
not a member but is a beneficiary

there's the club of the World Trade

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:35.250
there's the club of the World Trade
 

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:36.380
there's the club of the World Trade
Organization of which we're all

Organization of which we're all
 

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:39.350
Organization of which we're all
beneficiaries and the idea for club here

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360
beneficiaries and the idea for club here
 

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.210
beneficiaries and the idea for club here
is to change the way we think of

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:41.220
is to change the way we think of
 

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.890
is to change the way we think of
international agreements which are

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:42.900
international agreements which are
 

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.620
international agreements which are
essentially voluntary for climate to

make them ones where you you not only

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:48.630
make them ones where you you not only
 

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.770
make them ones where you you not only
benefit but you pay and for the example

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:51.780
benefit but you pay and for the example
 

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:57.470
benefit but you pay and for the example
that I'll suggest is an international

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480
that I'll suggest is an international
 

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.780
that I'll suggest is an international
climate Club to overcome free-riding is

00:18:59.780 --> 00:18:59.790
climate Club to overcome free-riding is
 

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:02.570
climate Club to overcome free-riding is
the idea is that you would have club

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:02.580
the idea is that you would have club
 

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:04.880
the idea is that you would have club
played ooze through abatement but

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:04.890
played ooze through abatement but
 

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:08.210
played ooze through abatement but
members but non-members are penalized by

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:08.220
members but non-members are penalized by
 

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:11.200
members but non-members are penalized by
having tariffs on their imports into the

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:11.210
having tariffs on their imports into the
 

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:15.800
having tariffs on their imports into the
club region and so let's say you set a

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:15.810
club region and so let's say you set a
 

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:21.920
club region and so let's say you set a
target carbon price of $50 a ton then

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:21.930
target carbon price of $50 a ton then
 

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.140
target carbon price of $50 a ton then
nations would have their domestic price

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:24.150
nations would have their domestic price
 

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:26.030
nations would have their domestic price
through whatever mechanism they would

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:26.040
through whatever mechanism they would
 

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.420
through whatever mechanism they would
choose at $50 a ton but if you weren't a

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:29.430
choose at $50 a ton but if you weren't a
 

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:30.680
choose at $50 a ton but if you weren't a
participant then you would have a

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:30.690
participant then you would have a
 

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:34.130
participant then you would have a
penalty attack a penalty tariff into the

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:34.140
penalty attack a penalty tariff into the
 

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.750
penalty attack a penalty tariff into the
club region so the dues or abatement

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.760
club region so the dues or abatement
 

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:43.420
club region so the dues or abatement
and penalties are the tariff and I'll

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:43.430
and penalties are the tariff and I'll
 

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.340
and penalties are the tariff and I'll
just show you a very simple example this

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:45.350
just show you a very simple example this
 

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.800
just show you a very simple example this
is from my presidential address to the

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:47.810
is from my presidential address to the
 

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:50.170
is from my presidential address to the
American Economic Association and it's a

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:50.180
American Economic Association and it's a
 

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.870
American Economic Association and it's a
very simple idea here the bars from left

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880
very simple idea here the bars from left
 

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.490
very simple idea here the bars from left
to right are the tariff rates of a club

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:56.500
to right are the tariff rates of a club
 

00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:00.070
to right are the tariff rates of a club
there are 15 regions in this and the

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080
there are 15 regions in this and the
 

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.300
there are 15 regions in this and the
height of the bar is how many

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:01.310
height of the bar is how many
 

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:03.940
height of the bar is how many
participants there are as a function of

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:03.950
participants there are as a function of
 

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.550
participants there are as a function of
each tariff level and the first tariff

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:06.560
each tariff level and the first tariff
 

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.890
each tariff level and the first tariff
level is zero and that's the basic

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:08.900
level is zero and that's the basic
 

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.330
level is zero and that's the basic
structure where there's no penalty to

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:10.340
structure where there's no penalty to
 

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.580
structure where there's no penalty to
non participation and they're no

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:12.590
non participation and they're no
 

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:15.310
non participation and they're no
participants but in this simple example

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:15.320
participants but in this simple example
 

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.340
participants but in this simple example
for a $50 tonne as the tariff rates gets

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:18.350
for a $50 tonne as the tariff rates gets
 

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.470
for a $50 tonne as the tariff rates gets
up to three four five percent you see

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480
up to three four five percent you see
 

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:25.000
up to three four five percent you see
more and more nations participate and

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:25.010
more and more nations participate and
 

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:26.890
more and more nations participate and
then is high enough all nations

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.160
driven by a process of more discoveries
leading to the production of more food

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:21.170
leading to the production of more food
 

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:24.890
leading to the production of more food
which led to more people who in turn

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:24.900
which led to more people who in turn
 

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.099
which led to more people who in turn
developed more and more discoveries and

00:45:27.099 --> 00:45:27.109
developed more and more discoveries and
 

00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:30.230
developed more and more discoveries and
so there was this explosive process of

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240
so there was this explosive process of
 

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:33.200
so there was this explosive process of
growth that was in the population that

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:33.210
growth that was in the population that
 

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:35.029
growth that was in the population that
was proceeding at a rate that was

00:45:35.029 --> 00:45:35.039
was proceeding at a rate that was
 

00:45:35.039 --> 00:45:36.980
was proceeding at a rate that was
growing exponentially so this is not

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:36.990
growing exponentially so this is not
 

00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:38.870
growing exponentially so this is not
exponential growth this is exponential

00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880
exponential growth this is exponential
 

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:42.140
exponential growth this is exponential
growth in the rate of exponential growth

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:42.150
growth in the rate of exponential growth
 

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:45.440
growth in the rate of exponential growth

this type of progress in who we are is

this type of progress in who we are is
even more important than the material

for example we live in cities with
