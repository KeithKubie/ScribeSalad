You've almost finished the jQuery course.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.870
Nicely done. Now that you've had some time to practice some common

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.810
jQuery methods, take a moment to reflect on why most of the Web uses jQuery.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.848
Is it because of jQuery's fast selection, its cross-browser compatibility,

00:00:18.848 --> 00:00:23.650
its easy DOM manipulation, faster page loads?

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.860
Is it because it makes me happy, or some other reason?
