00:00:00.694 --> 00:00:04.791
- So for what value of c, or values of c,

00:00:04.791 --> 00:00:07.987
is x minus five?

00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:10.198
Let me write it this way.

00:00:10.198 --> 00:00:15.198
For what c is x minus five a factor

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.878
of p of x?

00:00:24.878 --> 00:00:26.480
I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.943
and try to work through it.

00:00:27.943 --> 00:00:29.568
That p is actually a lower case p.

00:00:29.568 --> 00:00:31.878
P of x.

00:00:31.878 --> 00:00:35.941
All right, so I'm assuming
you have attempted this.

00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:38.357
We just have to realize,
okay, if x minus five

00:00:38.357 --> 00:00:40.562
is a factor of p of x,
that means you could

00:00:40.562 --> 00:00:44.915
write p of x, let me do
this in that green color,

00:00:44.915 --> 00:00:48.863
that means you could write p of x as being

00:00:48.863 --> 00:00:53.863
equal to x minus five
times some other business,

00:00:55.596 --> 00:00:57.662
times some other polynomial.

00:00:57.662 --> 00:01:01.342
So times some other polynomial.

00:01:01.342 --> 00:01:04.178
I don't know, let's just
call it g of x maybe,

00:01:04.178 --> 00:01:08.394
g of x, and this would be
a 2nd degree polynomial.

00:01:08.394 --> 00:01:11.052
So what would p of five have to be?

00:01:11.052 --> 00:01:12.805
Well p of five would have to zero.

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:15.092
Five would have to be a
root of this polynomial.

00:01:15.092 --> 00:01:16.427
You see it right over here.

00:01:16.427 --> 00:01:19.988
If you replace this with the five,

00:01:20.158 --> 00:01:21.910
then this is going to be a five,

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:22.955
and this is going to be a five.

00:01:22.955 --> 00:01:24.719
It doesn't matter what g of five is.

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:26.425
This is going to be zero.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.520
So if x minus five is a factor,

00:01:37.422 --> 00:01:42.422
if and only if p of five is equal to zero.

00:01:46.723 --> 00:01:48.802
You could say that five is a root

00:01:48.802 --> 00:01:50.984
of the polynomial p.

00:01:50.984 --> 00:01:54.070
P of five is equal to zero.

00:01:54.084 --> 00:01:57.079
So let's just set p of five equal to zero

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.644
and then try to solve for c.

00:01:58.947 --> 00:02:00.688
All right, so we're going to get five

00:02:00.688 --> 00:02:01.774
to the 3rd power.

00:02:01.774 --> 00:02:04.176
So this right over here, five
to the 3rd, so p of five.

00:02:04.944 --> 00:02:06.998
P, let me just write it down, p of five

00:02:06.998 --> 00:02:10.480
is equal to five to the 3rd is 125

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.572
plus two times five squared.

00:02:13.572 --> 00:02:16.660
So that's two times 25, plus 50,

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.320
plus c times five,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.060
plus five c plus 10.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.034
That needs to be equal to zero.

00:02:23.034 --> 00:02:28.034
Now let's see, if we were
to add 125 to 50 to 10,

00:02:30.596 --> 00:02:33.277
we are going to get 175, 185.

00:02:33.277 --> 00:02:38.277
So we get 185 plus five
c is equal to zero.

00:02:40.486 --> 00:02:42.448
Subtract 185 from both sides,

00:02:42.448 --> 00:02:46.261
you get five c is equal to -185,

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:53.369
or c is equal to -185 over five,

00:02:54.081 --> 00:02:56.345
which is going to be, let's see,

00:02:56.345 --> 00:03:01.278
it's -185 over five, which is equal to,

00:03:01.278 --> 00:03:05.320
let's see, five goes into 180,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.345
let's see, it goes into, well it's five,

00:03:07.345 --> 00:03:09.121
let's see, it's going to be 30.

00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:12.523
Five times 30 is 150.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.422
Then we'll have another 35 to go,

00:03:16.422 --> 00:03:19.038
so it's going to be 37, -37.

00:03:19.038 --> 00:03:19.750
Is that right?

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.447
Five times 30 is 150,
five times seven is 35,

00:03:23.447 --> 00:03:25.743
yep, -37.

00:03:26.113 --> 00:03:26.843
And we're done.

00:03:26.843 --> 00:03:29.362
If this was x to the 3rd plus 2 x squared

00:03:29.362 --> 00:03:33.507
minus 37 x plus 10, then x minus five

00:03:33.507 --> 00:03:36.047
would be a factor of this polynomial.
