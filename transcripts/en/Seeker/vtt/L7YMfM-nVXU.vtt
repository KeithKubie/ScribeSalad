00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.690
EXPLOSIVE SCIENCE NEWS!

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:03.860
ORGASMS ARE GOOD FOR YOU!

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:10.300
I know, it's really exciting, but there's
a rub to this study.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:16.129
Hey gang, thanks for watching DNews I'm Trace!

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.619
Sex and alcohol go together like french fries
and mayo.

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.939
Depending on who you are, you don't necessarily
WANT them together, but it totally happens.

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.679
Both alcohol and sex make people happy, and
both make people feel closer to others, but

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.609
one of them is lying...

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.800
Both alcohol and sex help people talk to each
other.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.089
Sometimes, a stiff drink makes it easier to
face a tough discussion, and sometimes sex

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:41.510
makes that discussion seem less insurmountable.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.610
A new study in Communication Monographs examined
how alcohol and orgasms encourage people to

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.859
talk and share intimate details about themselves.

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.670
It comes down to the chemicals and what they
do to the brain.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.670
Orgasms are gooooood.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.500
They are, just.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.500
Yes.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.930
Orgasm releases chemicals like oxytocin, human
growth hormone, serotonin, dopamine, vasopressin,

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.500
norepinephrine and others.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.200
These chemicals help you look younger, focus,
and live longer, they boost your immune system,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.299
help you bond with your partner and, of course,
make you feel good.

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.321
When you're drunk, your brain releases endorphins
and dopamine which also make you feel good

00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:22.549
-- same as an orgasm -- but, because alcohol
is a depressant, it doesn't make you feel

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:23.650
good in the long run.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.159
As you drink, alcohol causes the suppression
of the natural neuro-excitatory chemical glutamate

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.890
and boosts gamma-Aminobutyric acid or GABA
which is like Xanax or Valium and sedates

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.890
the brain.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.649
Basically, alcohol is a depressant that makes
you feel good... at first.

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:45.010
After a little while, the depressants win
out and your brain is left sad and inhibited.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.740
After sex is when partners are most likely
to talk intimately and bond.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.350
However, these two paths lead to VERY different
results.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.020
Orgasm's BFF oxytocin, is called the "love
hormone" or the "trust hormone," and, according

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.960
to the new research, the pillowtalk occurring
after an orgasm is positive and causes bonding.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.090
Sharing those intimate details will maintain
a shallow release of hormones too, keeping

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.070
you both feeling good and increasing trust
and bonding even more!

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.280
Add in some alcohol though, and you're in
for a strange cocktail of brain chemicals.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.740
When alcohol and orgasms cross paths, people
still feel that need to share intimate stories

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.080
about their lives, but instead of being positive,
their intimate details consist of less important

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.390
information, and are less positive.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.780
On top of that, "people who drink more alcohol,"
said the study's co-author, "perceive fewer

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.970
benefits to disclosing information to their
partners."

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.910
And if a drunk person fails to have an orgasm,
the negative feelings are compounded!

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.030
At the end of the day, drunk sex can be fun
-- wear a condom -- but though the stimulants

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.620
of orgasm feel as though they're counteracting
the depressants of alcohol, they're not.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.250
Partners who want to truly bond with their
partners, science says, should have sober

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.250
pillowtalk.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.250
It's the best.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.380

This week we talked about military advisors
and what they ACTUALLY do, the problems with

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.440
child immigration, the differences between
Sunni and Shia Muslims and tons of other super

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.070
interesting deep looks into the news of the
day.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.220
