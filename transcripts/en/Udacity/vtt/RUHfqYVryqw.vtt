00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.266
And we're back at the Udacity Sense Olympics. Andy, can you give us an overview

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
of what's been going on?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. So, we've had four events so far. And in this first event, we found that

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.066
our contestants could only detect a difference in weight of about 3%. In the

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
second, our contestants identified the five primary flavors. And in these last

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.866
two events, we discovered or pushed the limits of the thresholds of human

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
hearing. What we learn is that humans can really hear between 20 and 20,000 Hz

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
and that the quietest sound we can hear is about 0 dB.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, Andy, somethings been bothering me. How exactly does hearing work?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.266
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What do you mean by that? That's a pretty big question.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.866
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, okay, so I know sound vibrates the air but once those vibrations get into

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.466
my ear, how do I perceive that sound?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.533
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's, that's a really good question. And actually, the transduction of a

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.266
sound wave to a perceived sound is a pretty complicated process.
