00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.280
Why was Disney so obsessed with turning people into bears?

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.800
They did it in Brother Bear, which didn't do so well.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.320
They did it in Brother Bear 2, which as far as I know didn't do so well.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.780
Even Pixar did in Brave, which also didn't do so well!

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.480
Did one of the Disney higher-ups just want to be a bear?

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.200
Well, whatever the reason, we have this direct to DVD sequel that, big shock, is not very good.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.920
If you saw my review of the first one, you know I like everything in the beginning, everything in the end,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.540
and think the middle was really dumb.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.340
I guess that's better than this one seeing how it's... mostly dumb.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.280
And pointless.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.080
And forced.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.960
And uncomfortable.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.860
And... oh, let's get to it.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.320
A young woman is about to marry a young man in this arranged marriage.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.360
But God literally splits them apart because, apparently, they weren't meant for each other.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.220
Or at least, the sassy medicine woman, played by Wanda Sykes,

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.620
says that long ago, she gave her heart to someone else when they were little kids.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.700
Well, of course, that little kid was our main character from the last one, who's a bear now.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.840
Thus, the sassy, magic Wanda Sykes gives her the speech of the bear.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.200
Oh, after getting mixed up with some other wacky animals.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.200
[trumpets like an elephant]

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.460
Ha ha.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.360
So now she can talk with the bear, and they have to work together to burn this amulet.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.780
Of course, they do nothing but bicker, and argue, and act like they don't like each other, and

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.460
where is this going?

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.400
Surely they're gonna hate each other throughout the whole thing right?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.500
Uh oh.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.760
The sassy little cub from the last one--

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.780
wait there sure is a lot of sass in these movies

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.760
--hates the fact that he might be falling in love with her.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.280
So he tries to jeopardise the relationship.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.740
But uH OH

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.140
The two moose also want to fall in love with these two lady moose!

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.900
Moossess? What's the plural? I don't care it's a dumb movie.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.040
Will they be able to show them how to win over the ladies,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.800
while also acting coooool at the same time?

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.340
Uh oh oh, wait a minute,

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.740
they're not acting cool, they should just learn to be themselves.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.020
And follow their heart.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.840
And all sorts of other clichés you've heard a million times

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.000
but doesn't add ANYTHING new to it.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.040
That's all it is.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.060
It's just clichés from kids movies, romantic comedies, bland adventure tales,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.940
with nothing charming or fresh thrown on top of it.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.320
You're just watching these clichés play out, and nothing else.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.580
Clichés are fine-- we need them once in a while

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.780
but if you're not gonna add anything or give a unique spin on it,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.580
it's just

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.660
clichés, and nothing else.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.160
The world they inhabit doesn't even make sense.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.300
Like, our bride-to-be knows that the main character was turned into a bear,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.920
yet at the end, the cub goes into the village, and they're like

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.300
"Oh no, they'll kill him!"

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.820
Why would they kill him?

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.600
Don't they know that he's a guy that was turned into a bear?

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.700
And even when he goes in there, they're all trying to hunt him down and kill him, and she's like,

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.920
"No, no no!"

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.560
But wait don't they KNOW?

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.420
And on top of that,

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.580
there's a BEAR WEDDING at the end,

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.280
where these all these people and all these animals on both sides and--

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.180
CLEARLY THEY KNOW!

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.400
Why were they hunting each other a day ago??

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.320
I'd be like, "Screw you guys, I'm not going to your wedding!"

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.320
"Bunch of a-holes."

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.720
Alright, so, yeah, this movie's pretty stupid, but is there anything good to it?

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.940
Well, I guess, oddly enough, a couple of things.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.700
One, there's no Phil Collins. Good start.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.920
Two, this is probably the best looking out of the Disney sequels I've seen so far.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.060
Not only does the animation pretty much look identical to the first film,

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.500
but the backgrounds are gorgeous.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.260
Look at those brush strokes, look at how thick they are.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.380
They stand out, but they also blend together just right.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.800
And they really help the characters in the foreground stick out

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.840
while, again, also kind of blending together.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.980
On top of that, it also kind of feels the most cinematic.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.660
It's paced well, and it's acted well, and it's animated well, and it looks great.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.640
Really, the biggest problem is just the writing.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.340
But, yeah, that's a really big problem.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.260
It's just characters acting like they know what to do,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.520
and then it turns out they don't know what to do,

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.060
and then they throw in some catch phrases, and

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.140
look, the moose says "eh" like Canadians do,

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.280
because, get it? They're from Canada.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.620
It's just generic.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.580
And dumb.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.180
And doesn't add up

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.220
I guess I can't say it's the worst,

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.680
because we have movies like Mulan II and Beauty and the Beast Three and such.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.500
To me, those are MUCH more offesnsive.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.860
This is just... stupid.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.340
And, once again, not deserving of this great animation and this wonderful background work.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.900
I dunno, if you're a fan of the first one, maybe you'll like this one?

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.280
But it's kinda hard for me to find people that are even fans of the first one.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.300
They're just kind of forgotten Disney movies that, for some reason, they threw a lot of effort into,

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.880
just... not the best writing.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.840
Not the worst, but definitely pretty bad.
