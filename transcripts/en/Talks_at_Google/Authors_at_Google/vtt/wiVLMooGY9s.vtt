CLIFF: So gathering in a room
full of people, many of whom

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.880
are strangers,
it's something that

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.280
feels uncomfortable
to a lot of us.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.460
Now Susan RoAne is here to
help fix that challenge.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.790
She's here to speak about
her landmark book-- currently

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.320
celebrating its 25th
year of publication--

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.700
"How to Work a Room."

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.180
It's sold over 1.2 million
copies in over 13 countries.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.540
And even though much of
our daily communication

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.900
involves technology, whether
it's in the workplace

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.300
or at a wedding or
at a fundraiser,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.380
we still need this bit of
face to face interaction.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.540
And that's what
Susan brings along.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.200
Now, the book has gotten a wide
variety of press and acclaim,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.850
so she's shared information
about the book in various news

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.570
outlets.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.320
It's gotten some really
great endorsements

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.540
from people such as Guy
Kawasaki and Daniel Pink.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.760
And Susan is a
professional speaker.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.160
And her clients range throughout
the industry, anywhere

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.540
from Coca Cola and
United Healthcare

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.590
to the United States
Air Force, some

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.620
of the folks down
at Apple or Oracle,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.990
or on her current favorite,
which is Hershey's Chocolate.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.250
Now, on a personal
note, Susan did graduate

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.550
from the University of Illinois,
as I did and many of us

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.540
here in the audience.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.120
So it's always great to bring
another bit of the Illini love

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.970
home here to Mountain View.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.990
And so without further
ado, please join me

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.040
in welcoming back to Authors
at Google, the keynote speaker,

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.344
bestselling author, and the
mingling maven, Susan RoAne.

00:01:29.344 --> 00:01:29.844
Thank you.

00:01:29.844 --> 00:01:33.874
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:33.874 --> 00:01:35.290
SUSAN ROANE: Well,
you heard Cliff

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.331
say that I've been written
up in a lot of places.

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:41.940
And this book is celebrating
its silver anniversary.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.010
Someone asked me, why
would you write it again?

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.920
This is the fourth iteration.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.550
And I said the last issue
that came out was 2007.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.010
I wrote it in 2006.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.570
And it's not that
people have changed.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.017
In fact, people still
want to be comfortable.

00:01:58.017 --> 00:01:59.350
They want to have conversations.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.400
We want to have fun.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.770
We want to feel appreciated.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.230
We want to feel listened to.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.100
We want to feel that
we're important.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.380
But what's changed
is technology.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.170
When I first wrote "How to
Work a Room." the research

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.310
at Stanford's research clinic
by Doctor Phillip Zimbardo,

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.000
he found that 80% of American
adults self-identify as shy.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.230
That's a huge portion.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.600
By the time the third
iteration came out

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.620
in 2000, that jumped to 93%.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.540
They asked Doctor Zimbardo, what
do you attribute that big jump?

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.210
That's huge.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.630
13% more people are
self-identifying as shy.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.250
And he said one
word-- "Technology."

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.940
Can you imagine now, 14 years
later, how we're communicating?

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.316
How much technology
has changed us?

00:02:48.316 --> 00:02:49.440
But really, we're the same.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.990
It's just some of our
behaviors have changed.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.250
I also rewrote it because
some of the things

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.120
no longer applied.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.910
There are some terms
that would make no sense.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.660
And there were things
I needed to add in.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.040
So there's a brand new chapter
called "New Rooms to Work."

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.190
And even though I had written
about LinkedIn and Facebook,

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.010
we now have this new
room called Twitter.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.392
And then there's Instagram,
and then there's Google+.

00:03:15.392 --> 00:03:17.560
So I had to include
that in the book.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.180
And by the way, if anyone
wants to give me an additional

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.530
tutorial on Google+,
see me after the class.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.630
But I had to do that.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.400
Also, I'm originally
from Chicago,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.850
which is why I went to Illinois.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.430
And I had to delete things
of people who were dead

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.850
and-- if you'll forgive me--
people who were dead to me.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.160
I took them out of the book.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.060
And I added in a chapter
called-- because I,

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.380
again it's with the puns--
a whole chapter called

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.180
"Roominations," but I
spelled it R-O-O-M--

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.990
little tidbits to get you
through any event in any room.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.850
But writing a book
is interesting.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.900
By the way, writing
a book doesn't

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.100
mean you dress up like this.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.500
It's, for me, on a
dining room table

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.610
open twice the size with
the congratulatory chocolate

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:12.880
at my left hand.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.450
That's how that worked.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.430
And I've been asked
how I write my books.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.120
What program do you use?

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.560
Here's the program--
hand, number two pencil

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.130
with good erasers,
and I didn't even

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.370
write on the back on
yellow legal paper,

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.270
because that would be a
waste to this former teacher.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.880
I write my books on
the back of used paper.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.540
They call it recycling.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.530
And someone once said,
well, that's cheap of you.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.660
But I really thought it
was very forward thinking.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.890
It doesn't matter
how we write a book,

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.500
it matters that we write
a book, and that we just

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.140
pick up whatever tool we use.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.800
"How to Work a Room" first
came out 25 years ago.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.600
I'm a former school teacher
in San Francisco and Chicago.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.270
I was so excited,
because the "Wall Street

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.330
Journal" reviewed my book.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.830
I was excited until
I read what it said.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.350
So let me quote.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.160
I found out later
this review was

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.980
written by actually one of
my heroes, David Brooks, who

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.760
now writes for the
New York Times.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.960
He thought he was
being satirical.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.010
I didn't know that.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.250
It broke my heart.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.530
Here's what he wrote.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:33.770
"At last, the perfect how-to
book for shallow people."

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:34.792
I was really upset.

00:05:34.792 --> 00:05:37.250
And then a gentleman who worked
for the Chamber of Commerce

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.320
in San Francisco said
to me, you know nothing

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.961
about marketing, Susan.

00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:41.460
I don't?

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.647
He said, shallow
people, don't you

00:05:43.647 --> 00:05:49.410
know that's a market of 40 to 50
million potential book buyers?

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.230
And by the way,
because all of you

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.420
are going to get your
Google special price book,

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.100
I know that the people who
bought "How to Work a Room"

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.390
aren't shallow.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.880
Based on the work of Doctor
Bernardo Carducci and Doctor

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.210
Zimbardo, who
specialize in shyness,

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.445
people bought the book
because we are shy.

00:06:10.445 --> 00:06:12.820
And it doesn't mean we're shy
at work when we know people

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.778
and see them every day.

00:06:13.778 --> 00:06:16.180
We might be shy if we're
invited to a party.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.410
I went to a wedding two
weeks ago in San Francisco,

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.140
and I only knew the
bride and the groom.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.070
The were busy.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.070
They didn't have
time to talk to me.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.890
I had to make sure that
I introduced myself

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.660
to people, talked
to them, et cetera.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.800
Because that's on me.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.700
Though there was,
at one point, I

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.560
thought to myself,
oh my goodness.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.270
What did I write on page 230?

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.040
It might be helpful.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.610
But working a room is work.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.090
And you heard that I am
a professional speaker.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.920
I speak about this all the time.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.470
I actually just
came from Hollywood

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.010
where I spoke about how to
work a room for a leadership

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.510
conference for a global company.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:03.420
But right before my
speech, I went over

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.390
to Universal City Walk,
because I actually

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:11.270
wanted to the see King Kong
hanging from the rafters.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.120
And I took a picture of it.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.120
But as I got off the
little shuttle bus,

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.570
I saw a man and a
woman walking this way.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.410
I was walking into
the City Walk.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.410
Strangers next to me, and
the guy looked familiar.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.580
And I did a double take.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.910
And then I said to these
guys that I didn't know,

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.510
that looks like
Sugar Ray Leonard.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.160
The guy said to
me, well, that is.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.550
And in a split second, I
had to make a decision.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.770
Was I going to
continue, or was I

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.500
going to go over and
meet Sugar Ray Leonard?

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.051
And I thought, this is a once
in a lifetime opportunity.

00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:51.300
Have any of you had that
happen, where you see someone

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.925
and you know if you
don't say anything,

00:07:52.925 --> 00:07:54.780
you'll never have
another opportunity?

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.250
I decided to take it.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.295
Because guess what?

00:07:57.295 --> 00:07:59.850
How do I not if I
wrote this book?

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:01.370
Who should listen to me?

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.340
So I went over and
I stood and waited

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.750
while a gentleman who was a
big fight fan talked to him.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.200
And then I stood in the
corner, and here's what he did.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.340
The celebrity, this man
of great acclaim, saw me,

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:20.300
and he walked over to me,
big smile on his face.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.380
I knew he was the
champ, because guess

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.107
what it said on his
t-shirt-- "champ."

00:08:26.107 --> 00:08:28.315
I'm thinking I'm going to
get one that says "author,"

00:08:28.315 --> 00:08:30.570
and on the back say
"professional speaker."

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.309
I thought it was
good advertising.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:35.390
Smile on his face,
and I got so giddy.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.840
I said to him, I'm so excited.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.860
Could you please
make my heart flutter

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.350
and let me take
a picture of you?

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:47.720
And Sugar Ray Leonard said no,
with a big smile, and said,

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.110
we have to take a
picture together.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.080
Be still my heart.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:01.930
With a smile on his face,
so friendly, so welcoming.

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.120
You know, I think when you're
a big enough celebrity,

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.630
you know how to behave.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.270
And I wish he could give
lessons to the rest of them that

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.140
end up on TMZ.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.610
By the way, I took
that tour the next day.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.280
But Sugar Ray Leonard did this.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.750
And as I was backing away
saying oh thank you so much,

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.610
I'm so excited, I
did say to him--

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:26.910
and got permission-- I said I'm
here to speak to a conference.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:30.450
And I said, I wrote "How to
Work a Room"-- shameless plug,

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:31.820
got that in to the champ.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.980
And I said, would
it be OK with you

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.540
if I tell the story how we met?

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.180
And he said, absolutely.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.240
And I was beginning to
walk away because I didn't

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.490
want to hog his time--
which, by the way,

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:44.940
when you meet someone
who is of that celebrity,

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.040
whether it's Larry
or Sergei or whoever,

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.500
you don't want to
hog their time.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.850
But you want to make
sure you talk to them.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.470
He said, wait a minute.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:58.220
Let's see if the
pictures turned out.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.590
How nice.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:00.710
How thoughtful.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:02.310
How kind.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.980
And they did.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.860
Of course, went
right up on Facebook.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:05.641
Tweeted about it.

00:10:05.641 --> 00:10:07.390
Found there were a
whole lot of fight fans

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.040
that retweeted my tweet.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.800
But what I knew is he
was there because he

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.750
was doing a fundraiser
to fight diabetes.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.540
And for me, I wanted to tweet
that because my mom had that

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.450
as well.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.810
So really, that's the story.

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.920
But that's not the
reason I'm telling you.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.650
A couple of years
ago, I was having

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:29.980
dinner with a friend in Novato,
and a gentleman was at the bar.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.200
We had forgotten to have
the waitress take a picture.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.770
By the way, now that we all
have cameras on our phones,

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:38.580
we all want to take pictures.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.164
So I saw this
gentleman at the bar.

00:10:40.164 --> 00:10:41.330
There were only two of them.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.300
It was a rainy night in Marin.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.640
And I said to my
friend, oh, I think

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.840
we can ask this gentleman
to take our picture.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.070
He had a big welcoming smile.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.700
I went over with
my camera and said,

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.930
would you please take a
picture of my friend and me?

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.190
And he started to laugh.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:57.770
Of course.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.220
He took the picture.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.520
We walked out.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.640
We are in the lobby,
and my friend said,

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.710
I think that was Chris
Robinson from Black Crow.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:09.077
You mean I just asked Chris--?

00:11:09.077 --> 00:11:10.160
No wonder he was laughing.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.040
He thought I was saying, can
I take a picture with you?

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.280
But I said, I think
I insulted him.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.230
I must go back and
apologize to Chris Robinson

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.320
and ask for a picture.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:28.010
And my friend said
to me, don't do that.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:32.390
You don't need to
talk to him again.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.320
Here's my lesson.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.050
Don't ever listen to
someone who tells you

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:42.870
what to do that doesn't have
your interest, your values,

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:48.120
your confidence, and your
desire to do something,

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.980
because they won't
be less comfortable.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:54.662
But you'll walk away feeling,
gosh, I should have done that.

00:11:54.662 --> 00:11:56.870
Have any of you done that,
where someone said to you,

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:57.670
don't do something?

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:59.128
You listen to them,
and you though,

00:11:59.128 --> 00:12:01.670
oh my goodness, that's the best.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:04.100
I'm never doing that again.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.019
I learned my lesson.

00:12:05.019 --> 00:12:06.810
And I wasn't going to
let that happen again

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:09.310
with Sugar Ray Leonard.

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.370
But working a room is work.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:15.010
In the book, I talk
about the road blocks

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:17.790
besides the shyness,
the remedies,

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:22.790
and we talk about the
strategies to make conversation.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:26.580
I'm the original
small talk fan I

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.790
know there are a lot of people
that say, I'm really important.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.960
I can't waste my
time on small talk.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.950
Let's say you're at an event.

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:34.970
You're at a conference.

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:36.060
You're at a Google event.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.650
You're at a fundraiser.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:42.800
And you're going to start
with war, famine, disease--

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.990
all really important topics,
not the best opening line.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:48.960
So really, talking
about the little things

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.510
is how we find out how we
have something in common.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:56.620
And you heard Cliff say that
I'm also a Fighting Illini.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.820
Here's how it happened.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.820
That picture, I was at an event.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.640
And Jeff Huber, who is
a University of Illinois

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.620
grad with Google Labs,
he was our speaker.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:13.810
And he brought Google Glass for
us to demonstrate and try on.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.680
You'll notice I'm
wearing the orange pair--

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.100
because after all, orange
is our Illinois color.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.240
So I decided to send
Cliff that picture.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.234
And I explained to him--
probably in more detail

00:13:25.234 --> 00:13:26.650
than he wanted to
know, but it was

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:30.700
significant-- saying why I was
wearing Google Glass, about

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.980
Jeff, I went to Illinois.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.650
I got back an email
from Cliff saying,

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:37.510
you aren't going
to believe this.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:41.640
I went to Illinois, and
I grew up in Champagne.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.180
You never know that little
bit of added detail,

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:49.600
that some people call small
talk, connects us to people.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.990
How many of you have a
favorite sports team?

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:57.770
OK, what is your
favorite sports team?

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:00.980
Your college football
team, which one is that?

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:01.950
USC Trojans.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:06.630
OK, I won't say that I was
there and Stanford fan here.

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.010
OK, I won't say that.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:09.410
Anyone else?

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:10.500
Favorite teams?

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.860
Yes?

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:15.020
The Calgary Flames,
the hockey team?

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.330
Yes, yes.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.350
Now really, did you
know him before?

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:24.240
Would you two please
turn around and look

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:29.410
at each-- we've got two
Calgary Flames teams.

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:32.350
Actually, I know the team
well because my cousin

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:37.870
lived in Calgary and was one
of the TV cameramen there.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.670
This is a little detail.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.210
This is the perfect
example of how

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:44.824
you find something in common.

00:14:44.824 --> 00:14:46.490
And I'm going to give
you the roadblock.

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:49.280
The first roadblock, I call
the mother's dire warnings.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.320
The first one is, don't
talk to strangers.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.170
How many of you heard
that growing up?

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:55.409
Don't talk to strangers.

00:14:55.409 --> 00:14:57.200
The rest of you who
didn't raise your hand,

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.408
your parents didn't love you.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:03.720
Don't talk to strangers,
that's sensible.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.070
That make sense.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:10.220
When you're here at this amazing
campus, nobody is a stranger.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.620
We should be able to smile and
just say hello to everyone.

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.290
When I was writing
my third book,

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.140
I was at Time Warner building.

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.010
And one of the
things that happened

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:23.495
was that my editor
said, you know,

00:15:23.495 --> 00:15:28.090
we really don't go into
elevators with certain people.

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:30.680
She said everybody
knows the receptionist.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.320
I said, really?

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.240
She says, oh yeah.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.210
When you see someone you
don't want to talk to

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:36.540
or you're kind of
afraid of the big boss,

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.150
you talk to the receptionist.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.180
The receptionist
knew more people

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:43.090
who worked for Time
Warner because people

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:47.920
were afraid of having a
conversation in an elevator

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.060
with someone that they didn't
know-- who, by the way,

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.070
might be someone who could
tell them about another job

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:56.950
that they might
be interested in.

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:58.650
So instead of don't
talk to strangers,

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:01.780
here's the remedy--
redefine a stranger.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:02.810
This is old school.

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:03.960
You're getting a handout.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.270
On the handout, it has
my contact information,

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:10.330
but it also has five
tips and a bonus

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.710
that you could share with
other people if you like,

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:15.160
and the link to the
infographic, which

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.070
is the step by
step of how to work

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:19.380
a room that's on my website.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:22.100
But instead of don't talk to
strangers, redefine a stranger.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.724
Everywhere you go,
you should think of,

00:16:23.724 --> 00:16:25.320
what do I have in
common with people?

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.990
Could be the Calgary Flames.

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:30.880
Anyone here like Chicago
style deep dish pizza?

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.760
Would you please
raise your hands?

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.210
We're going out afterwards
for deep dish pizza,

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:37.563
or we'll get the
cafeteria to make--

00:16:37.563 --> 00:16:41.740
you know, some big arguments
over thin crust and deep dish

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:42.460
pizza.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.690
And some people are going, well,
that's insignificant, silly

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:47.650
conversation.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:49.460
I'm from Chicago.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.710
When you talk thick,
deep dish pizza,

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:54.730
that's not insignificant.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:58.150
That's really important.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:01.380
Some people are laughing
because they know it's true.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:05.810
The second thing that stops
us is often we will hear,

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:07.430
gee, we should
only talk to people

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.640
that we've been
properly introduced to.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.940
Wouldn't you love to have
Cliff go with you everywhere?

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:14.440
And every time you
walk in a room,

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.579
he says those grate
things about you?

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:20.220
A few trumpets, we could
have gotten here at Google,

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.349
would've been nice
to herald the entry.

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:24.849
But really, we're on our own.

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:27.190
So I want to give
you the remedy.

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:28.925
The remedy is,
everywhere you go,

00:17:28.925 --> 00:17:31.300
before you go there-- and let
me ask you, how many of you

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:35.820
belong to other professional
groups off campus?

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.800
What do you belong to?

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.410
OK, so you belong to ACM, a
professional organization.

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:42.950
I saw a hand over here.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:49.550
Where do you-- oh, I
actually spoke for Cal CPA.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:55.150
So Cal CPA, Right it's northern
California society of CPAs.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.340
anyone else?

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.920
Generally, we do other things.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.870
Anyone's been to a party lately?

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:03.260
Nobody invites Googlers.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.780
Anyone been to a party?

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:08.280
Yes?

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.360
Where was your party?

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.630
Moved into a new neighborhood
and the neighbors

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.430
invited for barbecue.

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:21.300
It's so good to know that really
this idea of the welcome wagon

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:25.390
and making people feel welcome
and comfortable still exists.

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:27.330
Because look, when we
move into a neighborhood

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.850
and that feels good, when
we start a new project that

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:33.540
feels good, feeling welcomed.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:36.400
And that's what "How to
Work a Room" is about.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.170
It's about making
people feel welcomed,

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:44.590
making people feel important,
and extending ourselves.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:45.450
That's important.

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:47.410
In fact, watch this.

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:48.760
Oh hi, I'm Susan RoAne.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.520
It's so nice to meet you.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.304
SHANNON: Hi, I'm Shannon Lee.

00:18:52.304 --> 00:18:53.720
SUSAN ROANE: And
Shannon Lee-- did

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.530
you hear that
enthusiasm in her voice?

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.221
You should have seen this
big smile on her face.

00:18:58.221 --> 00:18:59.470
That's why I went over to her.

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:01.761
She's going, I'm never sitting
at the edge with someone

00:19:01.761 --> 00:19:04.190
with a microphone that can move.

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:06.630
When we go over to
someone and they

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:10.700
have a smile on their face,
that makes it easier to do.

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:17.130
But you'll notice what I did is
I leaned into the conversation.

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:20.020
Doctor David Schwartz in
"The Magic of Thinking Big"

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:22.860
found that leaders
and the people

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.160
we consider the big kahunas,
when they meet people, they

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.380
lean into the greeting.

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.870
And he said what he
found about these people

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:34.340
that we call our leaders
is that by doing that,

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.210
they welcome people.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:39.630
They do something called
they extend themselves

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:41.680
to other people.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.350
And what "How to Work
a Room" is about,

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.600
is extending yourself to people.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.470
And I will give
you a difference.

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:50.384
Instead of thinking, what can I
do to make myself comfortable?

00:19:50.384 --> 00:19:52.050
Some of you don't
have pens, some of you

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:53.650
have your computers
and smartphones,

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:55.770
and others are going
to memorize this

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:58.950
because the quiz is next week.

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:01.229
Instead of thinking about
making yourself comfortable,

00:20:01.229 --> 00:20:02.770
I'm going to give
you a different way

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.340
of looking at this.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:08.510
What can you do to make other
people comfortable with you?

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:11.130
When you try to make other
people comfortable with you,

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:13.860
you are actually
more comfortable

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.620
because they open up.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.510
And when they open
up, then you open up

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.270
because they're
responding to you.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:24.110
And what you have
is a conversation.

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:28.010
So lean in to your greetings.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:31.760
Don't talk to strangers,
redefine a stranger.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:36.100
Make sure that you know what
you have in common with people

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:36.950
before you go there.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:37.980
It's so easy.

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.780
We get to Google events.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.100
We get to learn about them.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.100
We get to know who's
going to be there.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.580
We can find out about people.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.710
We can go to LinkedIn.

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:47.360
We can go to their websites.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:51.760
There's almost no reason
to go anywhere not knowing

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.760
who's going to be
there, or not knowing

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.770
the generic person of
who's going to be there

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:59.295
and what you have
in common with them.

00:20:59.295 --> 00:21:00.670
But then there's
that other thing

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:03.800
that stops us, which we
would like that introduction.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:07.940
And I'm going to give you
three RoAne tips for what

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.270
a self introduction is like.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.930
They're a little different
than what you've heard.

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:14.760
In fact, I just sent
a tweet yesterday

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.030
that I send out periodically.

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:19.830
Your self introduction
is not an upchucking

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:21.950
of an elevator speech.

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:25.240
A self introduction
is a pleasantry.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.660
It's not 15 or 30 seconds.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:28.640
You're at an event.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:32.540
You have a beverage in one
hand and a significant dessert

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:36.260
in the other, which would
mean lots of chocolate.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:42.610
So what you do is,
instead of thinking, OK,

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:44.320
what am I going to say?

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:50.040
What you do is you do a seven
to nine second introduction.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.350
It's a pleasantry.

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:56.310
Nobody wants to hear 15 to
20 to 30 seconds about you

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:57.640
or what you do.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:58.897
It's a pleasantry.

00:21:58.897 --> 00:22:00.730
And you heard, it looks
and sounds -- oh hi,

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:03.810
I'm Susan RoAne, it's
so nice to meet you.

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:07.870
And it should look and
sound like it's nice.

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:09.550
This is the one
thing that I've kept

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:13.330
in the book all
iterations for 25 years

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:17.020
because it's so important that
people know that we really

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.800
need to feel
comfortable and make

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.080
other people
comfortable with us.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.510
Seven to nine seconds.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.490
But how I learned, the
reason why I wrote that is I

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:31.040
was reading this book to edit
it and to change and update it

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.540
for this version.

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:34.880
And I went, that's why
I've been telling people

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.060
seven to nine seconds.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:40.500
David Gibbons did
research on eye contact.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.400
And he found that
after nine seconds,

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.070
it's considered a glare.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:50.100
Thank goodness I read my book.

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.630
Now I can tell you
where that came from.

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:55.560
Seven to nine seconds,
it's a pleasantry.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.210
The second aspect of
your self introduction

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:03.220
anywhere is that it's
linked to the event.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:06.270
So any time you're
with other Googlers,

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.897
you have something that
you're going to link to.

00:23:08.897 --> 00:23:09.730
You're at a wedding.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.790
So I had to say
at the wedding, I

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:15.210
don't know if I'm on the bride's
side or the groom's side.

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:18.980
Because really, I could
have said, I'm Susan RoAne.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:23.390
I'm a fabulous keynote speaker
and a splendidly best selling

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:25.530
author-- all of which were true.

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:28.657
However, at a
wedding, nobody cares.

00:23:28.657 --> 00:23:30.365
They want to know, do
you know the bride?

00:23:30.365 --> 00:23:32.200
Do you know the groom?

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.390
How did you come to be here?

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:37.080
Because you have to
give people context.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.960
And that's what I try
to do in the book--

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:43.180
give everyone context for
whatever event they were at.

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.120
So I had to tell them
why I didn't know.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.730
And the reason is,
I knew the bride.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:49.200
I met the groom.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.890
But in one of those
small talk conversations,

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:54.940
he happened to mention
his uncle's name--

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:59.950
which was different from
his-- and my ears perked up.

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:03.760
And I said, any
relation to Doctor Al?

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.390
He goes, oh yeah.

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:07.990
That's my grandfather.

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:13.630
And I said to him,
my dad and your dad

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:16.230
and your grandfather
were dearest friends.

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:19.440
And my mom and dad would
fly out from Chicago

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:23.690
to visit your grandfather
and grandmother.

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:25.700
I didn't know what
side to sit on.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:29.072
But I embraced both of them.

00:24:29.072 --> 00:24:30.530
And why I tell you
this story, it's

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:33.520
always important to give people
a context for why you're there.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.270
They don't know.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:35.810
What should they
talk to you about?

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:38.810
But if you help them, it's
like the Jerry Maguire line--

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:44.600
"Help me help you." and
give people context.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:50.980
Another thing that
stops us, and that is we

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:56.310
were told that good things
come to those who wait.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:57.680
How many of you heard that?

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.138
Good things come
to those who wait.

00:24:59.138 --> 00:25:02.052
How many of you
are still waiting?

00:25:02.052 --> 00:25:02.950
AUDIENCE: For what?

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:04.533
SUSAN ROANE: For
what is the question.

00:25:04.533 --> 00:25:06.030
Good, for what.

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:07.300
We wait.

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.420
I want to give you
the RoAne version.

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:14.400
It's good things come
to those who initiate.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.470
Good things come to
those who initiate.

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:18.300
Whether you're going
over the person

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.400
first, whether you're
picking up the phone

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:24.620
first, whether you're sending
the first email or interoffice

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.595
note, good things come
to those who initiate.

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:35.070
Doctor Adele Scheele who
wrote "Skills for Success,"

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:38.980
in an article she wrote for
the original Success magazine

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:42.820
said that instead of acting
like a guest at events,

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:46.180
if you act like the
host, that helps

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.400
people be more
comfortable with you.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.670
Anyone know a good host?

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.900
OK, no one knows a good host.

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.052
Some of you are nodding.

00:25:56.052 --> 00:25:57.510
We're going to go
to this one then.

00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:59.510
Now we're going to get
you to practice your self

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:00.530
introductions.

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:03.800
And I want you to
think of how you're

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:08.900
going to introduce yourself to
people right here in this area

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:09.910
that you don't know.

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:12.570
I want you to turn around
and look around the room

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:14.550
and looked at
people say, gee, who

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:17.240
have I seen that I really
haven't met and talked to?

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:19.674
Because this is
your opportunity.

00:26:19.674 --> 00:26:21.090
You're not going
to get to escape,

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:24.040
because I'm going to
be surrounding you.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.370
But I did say in
"How to Work a Room"

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:29.440
that you can't work
a room on your tush.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:33.220
So you're going to have a chance
to practice the exact thing

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.560
that we wrote about in the
book that you came here

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.580
to hear about at the
bargain rate of $5

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:42.030
from Books Inc, a wonderful
independent bookstore,

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:45.730
and for the people Livestreaming
and watching this on YouTube,

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:48.290
please support your local
independent bookstores,

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:53.240
and certainly Books Inc. And if
you want to hear it on audio,

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.110
McMillan Audio can
get that for you.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:59.900
But what you want to do is
you want to meet people.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:01.734
So I want you to
look around again,

00:27:01.734 --> 00:27:02.900
see what you're going to do.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.740
Because I'm going to give
you about 3 and 1/2 minutes.

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:08.110
Don't look at me like that.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:09.834
This is an assignment.

00:27:09.834 --> 00:27:11.500
I'm going to give you
3 and 1/2 minutes,

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:15.690
and you're going to meet
three people that you haven't

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:18.100
met yet right here at Google.

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.760
How many of you are sitting next
to someone you already know?

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.240
Good thing I'm here.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.960
Good thing I'm here.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:29.910
All right, so think about
seven to nine seconds linked

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:32.600
to this event, which would
be Susan RoAne at Authors

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.720
at Google.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:40.310
And the third part of it is
the benefit of what you do.

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:42.530
I think it was my friend
Patricia Fripp said

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:45.260
that really, RoAne, don't
tell them to give their title.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:46.670
Give them the benefit.

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:48.400
How you know how
to give a benefit?

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.750
When I was writing
"What Do I Say Next?"

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.920
I saw a gentleman in the
coffee shop every day.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.670
And one day I said to
him, what do you do?

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:58.590
And he gave me the
perfect benefit state.

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:02.090
And he looked at me
totally deadpan and said,

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:03.965
I help rich people
sleep at night.

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:07.900
So I said to him, really?

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.920
You're a pharmacist?

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.510
And he wasn't.

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:13.350
He was a financial planner.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:15.070
But he gave me the benefit.

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:16.740
It allowed me to
ask the question.

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:18.920
Then we were connected.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:22.470
And because of that, we're
still in communication,

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:23.710
and it's been a while.

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:29.060
So on your mark, get
set, look around.

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:31.900
And the other part is you
can't work a room on your tush,

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:36.350
so rise and schmooze.

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:38.790
Pick your people.

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:40.150
You have 3 and 1/2 minutes.

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:43.940
[CHATTERING]

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.940
[WHISTLING]

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:05.190
I couldn't resist
my train whistle

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:07.860
that I actually bought in
the children's department

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:12.470
of the Chicago
Botanical Garden for $3.

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:14.890
And it worked, so there we go.

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:18.780
How many of you
met three people?

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:19.470
Great.

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:22.580
How many of you met
more than three people?

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:26.230
The Googler fast trackers,
thank you very much.

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:30.440
Did you notice that the
noise level was really high

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.110
when you met each other?

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:35.340
Did you hear how much
laughing was going on?

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.360
You really liked
meeting each other.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:42.500
How many of you met at least
one person you didn't know?

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:43.000
Great.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.230
And I saw a couple
people exchanging cards.

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:48.072
Did anyone else exchange cards?

00:29:48.072 --> 00:29:51.060
OK, really?

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:55.760
This is your lot in life
for the rest of your life.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.140
For those of the people
watching at Livestream,

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.290
I hope you met some people
in the room you're in,

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:02.920
and anyone who watches
this on YouTube.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:07.210
But those of you here,
everywhere you go,

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.040
whenever you see
a crowd, you are

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:13.300
destined to hear me on
your left shoulder going,

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.390
go over and talk to them.

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:17.120
Make them feel comfortable.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:24.790
You are officially
cursed-- but in a good way.

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:28.000
So the people who were
approached by other people,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.490
would you raise your hand?

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:34.230
Tell me, how did it
feel to be approached?

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:35.750
It feels welcoming.

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.180
Not you guess, you were right.

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.350
That was the right answer.

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:39.450
It feels welcoming.

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:40.530
What else?

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:45.600
How else did it feel when people
came over and talked to you?

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.756
Pardon me?

00:30:46.756 --> 00:30:48.430
AUDIENCE: Flattered.

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:50.090
SUSAN ROANE: Oh, flattered.

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:50.900
Thank you.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.850
Welcoming and flattered.

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:55.850
You know what,
anywhere we go where

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:59.220
we feel welcomed is special.

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:02.360
But when you go over to
someone, what you're saying

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.470
and why it makes
you feel flattered

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:07.520
is it's as if you're saying,
you look like someone

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:08.940
I ought to meet.

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.790
You look important.

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:12.780
You look smart.

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:16.280
You look like you have great
ideas I need to know about.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.260
It's flattering.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:21.220
I doubt that anyone
walks into a room

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:26.930
for any reason with the purpose
of standing alone and no

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:28.730
one talking to them.

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:30.670
I have spoken to CEOs.

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:34.540
I've spoken to actually
political lobbyists.

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.160
I've spoken to a variety
of groups of people.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:40.680
And I can tell you, nobody
walks in a room to stand alone.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:45.011
Because I don't care how their
celebrity is, what a big kahuna

00:31:45.011 --> 00:31:45.510
they are.

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:48.750
When someone is standing
by themself in the room,

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:51.870
their internal voice
is saying, oh my gosh.

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:52.860
I'm alone.

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.280
I must be a dork.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.050
That's what we all think.

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:58.340
So when you go over to
someone, it's welcoming.

00:31:58.340 --> 00:31:59.340
It's acknowledging.

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:01.770
It's flattering.

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:02.790
And you heard it here.

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:04.800
That's what people said.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:09.955
Now, those of you who were
the mingling mavens-- a term

00:32:09.955 --> 00:32:12.102
I trademarked, but I'll
share that with you.

00:32:12.102 --> 00:32:14.060
The mingling mavens,
would you raise your hand,

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:16.940
the people who went
over to other people?

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.070
Can you tell me what
they did that made it--

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:21.060
besides that I told you
you had to-- but could

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:26.800
you tell me what they did that
made it OK to go over to them?

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.270
Smiled.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:29.920
They smiled.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.890
People, if you have pen
or pencil or your laptops

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:36.220
or your tablets with
you, write that down.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.930
This is scientific genius.

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:40.810
They smiled.

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:44.260
And what else did they do that
made it OK to go over to them?

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.200
Eye contact.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:50.210
Of course, let's just say
someone sees a piece of lint

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:51.910
on their clothes.

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:55.077
Do you go over them and go,
it is so nice to meet you?

00:32:55.077 --> 00:32:55.931
No.

00:32:55.931 --> 00:32:59.500
The eye contact, when
you're looking at people,

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.630
they assume you're
interested in meeting them.

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:05.950
That smile and eye
contact are welcoming.

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:10.920
They allow people
to feel engaged.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.620
So if you take
away nothing else,

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:17.280
smile and give eye contact
in every room you're in.

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:20.180
And I understand there are
some things that are cultural.

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:21.930
Different cultures
have different thoughts

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:24.310
about smiling and eye--
well, not about smiling,

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:26.270
but certainly about eye contact.

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:29.810
But I'd like you to
embrace that for here.

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:32.470
"How to Work a Room" has been
published in 13 countries.

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:37.420
It's been a best seller in
Taiwan and China and Mongolia

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:39.050
and in Croatia.

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:40.480
I can't figure that one out yet.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.200
But it's cross cultural.

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.250
People want to know in other
countries, how do I fit in?

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:49.480
How do I make myself
comfortable at events?

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:55.120
I don't proclaim to have
every international etiquette.

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.960
You can get that
by going to Google

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.550
and finding out what
country you're at

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:01.630
and what those protocols are.

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:02.910
But you just did this.

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:07.430
You actually met people.

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:10.600
Did people make it easy
for you to talk to them?

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.659
Did anyone have an
interesting conversation

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:16.351
that they'd like
to share with us?

00:34:16.351 --> 00:34:17.226
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:24.300
SUSAN ROANE: How
interesting, that there

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:28.699
are new jobs and organizations
because things have changed,

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:30.730
a piece that you
might not have known

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:32.659
had you not talked to her.

00:34:32.659 --> 00:34:33.680
There are new titles.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.510
Things do change.

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:40.179
I'm not really good
about a lot of change.

00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:42.719
But I'll tell you, I've
celebrated an anniversary--

00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:47.510
I believe it was last month--
seven years with my own YouTube

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:49.469
channel.

00:34:49.469 --> 00:34:50.780
Seven years.

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:52.611
And then I went
back and I looked

00:34:52.611 --> 00:34:54.860
at some of the things that
were there seven years ago.

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.110
And I thought, I
remember when my hair

00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:59.860
was that color naturally.

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.570
It's kind of interesting.

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:04.550
Things have changed.

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:07.730
In a million years
did I ever think

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:14.750
that I would've embraced social
media and been a Twitterer.

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:17.290
In two months, I
celebrate-- I believe

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:21.082
it's my six year
anniversary with Twitter.

00:35:21.082 --> 00:35:23.540
You must be thinking, boy, she
doesn't have much of a life.

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.890
Her anniversaries are
with social media.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:28.350
But the reality is,
I've been tweeting.

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:30.980
I went and counted how
many tweets one day.

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:34.740
The other two days ago,
I hit my 7,000th tweet.

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:37.050
And you know what my tweet was?

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:40.370
"Now I know where
all that time went."

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:41.230
But I love it.

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:42.840
I did a tweet here.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.120
Whoever thought the
tidbits-- and I've

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.360
learned so many
things from Twitter.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.460
Here's another thing
about social media.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:52.750
I have a very good friend
I met because of a tweet.

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:53.960
And I wrote that in the book.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.490
I wrote our story.

00:35:55.490 --> 00:36:00.190
She put up-- no, Daniel
Pink retweeted her tweet

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:04.290
saying that his new
book was superb.

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:05.870
So I retweeted it.

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:07.980
Next thing I know, I
don't hear from Dan,

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:11.530
but I hear from Dori Clark,
who wrote "Reinventing You."

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:13.900
Thanks for retweeting my tweet.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.480
I saw that she was
writing a book,

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.420
and she wrote for
"Forbes" I wrote her back.

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:18.485
She wrote me back.

00:36:18.485 --> 00:36:19.860
I said, when your
book comes out,

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.950
let me know what I
can do to support it.

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:25.632
We considered
ourselves such friends

00:36:25.632 --> 00:36:27.090
that when I wrote
the book in June,

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:29.540
we had never even
had a conversation.

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:31.840
But because of Twitter
and then email,

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:34.040
we thought we were friends.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.650
Well, I've met her twice.

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:38.880
And I'm delighted to
say we are friends.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.440
Because next Thursday,
going out to dinner with her

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.570
when she comes here.

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:47.180
It's great to have social media.

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:49.010
It's great to have email.

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:51.270
But there is nothing
like what you just

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:55.390
did with face to face to
build the conversation

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:56.840
and build the connection.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:01.130
I'm going to stop and ask
you, what questions do

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:03.000
you have for me
that I can answer

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.310
that will make you
go away saying, boy,

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:07.650
was that worth an
hour of my time?

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:11.310
AUDIENCE: You see someone
a lot, a few times,

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:13.930
and you always want
to talk to the person.

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:17.560
But after a while, and you
haven't talked to that person.

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.800
You're kind of shy to approach.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.149
So what do you do
in that situation?

00:37:22.149 --> 00:37:23.190
SUSAN ROANE: What you do.

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:25.023
I think, doesn't that
happen to a lot of us?

00:37:25.023 --> 00:37:26.960
You keep it so
nobody says anything.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.060
Let's take the hint from
Doctor Adele Scheele

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:32.180
and say, initiate.

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:34.080
Don't wait.

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:37.279
Be that good host
that she talked about.

00:37:37.279 --> 00:37:38.070
Here's what you do.

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:40.278
The next time you see the
person, just say, you know?

00:37:40.278 --> 00:37:43.350
I just heard Susan RoAne talk
at one of our wonderful Google

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:43.961
benefits.

00:37:43.961 --> 00:37:45.210
She said I should talk to you.

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:46.150
I've seen you.

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:47.160
You look interesting.

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:47.800
Say something.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.560
Blame me.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.930
Susan RoAne made me do it.

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:53.790
But don't wait.

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:55.110
You have a great smile.

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:58.140
You're so approachable
and easy to respond to.

00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:59.300
Say something.

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.820
Because look, you're
asking me this.

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:03.600
That means that you regret
that you haven't said anything.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.280
No regrets.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.010
Here's the worst thing
that could happen.

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:10.100
The person's going--
because they're shy.

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:12.020
But give them a second chance.

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:13.640
Because you know,
we think people

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.780
back off because
they're not interested.

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:18.220
It could be their mind is
on a project they're doing.

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:22.380
Or maybe they have to move
and they're thinking about,

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:24.730
do I have to go to Craigslist
and look for an apartment?

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:26.310
So you promise me.

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:28.019
My email us on the
handout that you

00:38:28.019 --> 00:38:30.310
have in the back of the book
which you're going to buy.

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:32.765
Would you please
send me an email?

00:38:32.765 --> 00:38:37.210
Yeah, you know, I mean, it's
supporting a local bookstore.

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:39.300
Would you please
email me and let

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:40.760
me know what the response was?

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:41.450
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:43.580
SUSAN ROANE: Any
other questions?

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:44.530
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:48.520
My question is, how do you
break into a conversation that's

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:51.425
already ongoing when
you walk into a room?

00:38:51.425 --> 00:38:53.300
SUSAN ROANE: How many
of you had that happen?

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.133
You walk in a room and
everyone's in groups,

00:38:55.133 --> 00:38:58.060
and you want to walk out?

00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.410
All of us.

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:00.320
Here's what you do.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.200
In this section in
"How to Work a Room,"

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.190
I've kept this section.

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:05.800
I call it breaking and entering.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.010
So here's what you do.

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:09.430
You see, you walk into the room.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:12.540
Hint from shy people--
the research, and this

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:17.000
is social science research--
shy people almost never make

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.850
a grand entrance.

00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:22.540
They usually come to
an event no later than

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:25.950
15 minutes after it's
called, because they don't

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:27.720
want to see everyone in a group.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:30.190
So that's what
your new mantra is.

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:33.920
Get there on time, or only
15 minutes after it's called.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.290
Look around the room.

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:39.710
Pick the group that's
having the best time.

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:40.210
Why?

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:42.710
Because they'll be
easier to walk into.

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:47.020
Pick the upbeat group of at
least three but four people.

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:48.910
Because you can be
sure four people

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:51.790
aren't having an
intimate conversation.

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:53.820
And if they are,
that's the group

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:57.020
I'd like to be talking to,
because that would be fun.

00:39:57.020 --> 00:40:02.350
But what you do is you
stand in the periphery.

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:06.880
And when someone looks your
way, you say something just

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.520
about the conversation
they're having.

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.170
It's not the time to
change to your subject.

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:15.246
And then you can step in and
continue the conversation.

00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:16.870
But I had someone
who was from Toronto.

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:18.703
And my mother was from
Toronto, and she just

00:40:18.703 --> 00:40:21.710
thought Canadians are so much
more polite than we were.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:24.910
And then this woman said this
in my seminar in New York,

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:26.490
and I thought it was genius.

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:29.930
She said to me-- she always
had a big smile on her face.

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:33.680
She'd go to a room, pick that
group that was having the most

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:36.050
fun, and she'd stand
on the periphery.

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:41.120
And when someone would look
her way, what she did is,

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:47.450
she said-- big smile-- do
you mind if I join you?

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:48.940
What a brilliant idea.

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:54.460
She said nobody ever said, "No,
as a matter of fact, we do."

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:56.710
No one ever said that.

00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:59.000
And then she was part
of the conversation.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.700
But I'm going to make
this my Google get,

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.940
so here's what you do.

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:09.730
When you're at any
event-- social, business--

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:12.910
and you see someone with your
peripheral vision, which we all

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:16.830
have, that you know wants
to get in the group,

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:19.450
you be the mingling
maven, that great host.

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:23.160
Take one step back.

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:25.500
Because when you
take a step back,

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:29.560
you will have included the
person who's been excluded.

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:32.270
There's no reason to talk
about diversity and inclusion

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:34.880
if we don't step back
and include people.

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.640
Would people remember
the person that

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.010
makes them feel welcome
and comfortable?

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:40.200
I think so.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.020
So that would be how to get in.

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:44.010
Does that make sense?

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:44.850
Does that help?

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:46.620
And we have another question.

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:49.150
AUDIENCE: And since
you mentioned Croatia,

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:53.720
how do you approach somebody
who's from another culture?

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.950
Should you assume that you
know about his culture,

00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:59.470
if you know a few bits about it?

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:04.120
Or should you approach
him with a blank slate,

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:10.100
like completely trying
to be completely open?

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:12.470
SUSAN ROANE: You shouldn't
do what I just did.

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:13.620
But here's the one thing.

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:16.030
If you know a little
something about the culture

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:18.460
that you can make the
person more comfortable,

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:21.120
I say go ahead and
observe whatever

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:24.230
those cultural norms are.

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:26.230
But most people are forgiving.

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:29.390
I think if you show
interest and you're friendly

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:32.350
and you're open,
people don't assume

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:35.320
that you know everything
about their culture.

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:39.880
And how about this, here's a
great way to find out, is say,

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:41.170
I just wanted to meet you.

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:46.650
I didn't want to do anything
that was inappropriate.

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:48.440
I hope I haven't.

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.500
And ask them.

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:53.070
People will tell you, they're
happy to espouse that.

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:55.390
But I think the fact
that you approach people,

00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:57.420
don't let that stop you.

00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:00.260
Right in this room, we have
people from different cultures.

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:02.840
And you were all
talking up a storm.

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:05.250
Nothing stopped you from
talking to other people

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:07.070
in our little exercise, did it?

00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:08.950
So keep on doing that.

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:11.640
I always figure,
if we ask people,

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:14.640
that's the way we learn
about people's cultures is

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:16.932
we find out by asking.

00:43:16.932 --> 00:43:19.340
Does that makes sense to you?

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:20.080
Anyone else?

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:21.300
Oh yes, my new friend.

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.600
OK.

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:26.690
AUDIENCE: In one situation, I
was sitting in a shuttle bus

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:28.680
and trying to have a
conversation with somebody

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:29.880
that I don't know.

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:33.750
But he works in the same
company but had no interest

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:35.800
in having a
conversation with me.

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:36.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:40.870
And in fact, one time
he offered carpooling

00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:42.590
to go back to the
shuttle bus station.

00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:45.960
So we were sitting together
for about half an hour.

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.610
And I kept on asking
him questions.

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:50.420
He never asked me a
single question back.

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:55.470
So in a situation like this,
how could you overcome?

00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:57.820
SUSAN ROANE: OK.

00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.070
A couple of things.

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:03.760
Number one, that person might
really be completely shy.

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.360
That's one thing.

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:10.030
But I'm now going to put on
my judgmental hat and say,

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:12.340
and maybe that person
had no confidence,

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:15.730
but maybe that person was so
focused on what they're doing

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:18.434
that they really didn't--
they shut out people.

00:44:18.434 --> 00:44:20.600
There are people that say
that they're introverts so

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:23.020
that they really don't
want to talk to people.

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:26.350
I think when someone is
not interested at all,

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:28.150
they say that on an airplane.

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:31.060
There's some of us like to
talk and some of us don't.

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:33.740
Believe it or not, I'm one of
the people that don't talk.

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:34.970
And there's a reason.

00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:37.090
The speech therapist
says those of us

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:41.330
who speak for a living shouldn't
gulp in all that recycled air.

00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:42.810
It harms your vocal cords.

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:45.780
With that person, I
would try someone else.

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:48.690
That's where-- by the way,
when you're talking to someone

00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:52.180
and they're not interested
and you give it two and three

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:58.130
times, there are 100 other
people that are nice.

00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:00.500
I won't even say what I
would have said in Chicago,

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:02.130
other than we had
a really big lake,

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:03.800
and we bought
people cement shoes.

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.799
Just as a thought.

00:45:05.799 --> 00:45:07.090
I think you've done everything.

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:08.390
You have a great smile.

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:11.630
But after that, go
to the next person.

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:14.100
AUDIENCE: Question is
a little bit different.

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:18.640
How do you manage knowing a lot
of people and staying in touch?

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.500
Because I tend to meet
people from everywhere,

00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:22.300
all over the world.

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:23.950
I live in so many
different places.

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:26.880
And I generally like
a lot of those people.

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.129
But it gets sometimes
so difficult,

00:45:29.129 --> 00:45:31.170
and I feel like I'm having
an Alzheimer's and I'm

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:33.937
forgetting people's
names and faces.

00:45:33.937 --> 00:45:36.020
SUSAN ROANE: As long as
you don't forget your own,

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:38.440
you're OK.

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:39.660
I think that that happens.

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:41.380
This is why it's
beautiful that we

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:43.720
could have LinkedIn and
Facebook, et cetera,

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.540
because we can stay
in touch with people--

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:49.330
a little touch, a little
poke, a little tweet.

00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:51.140
But it really is about
staying in touch.

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:53.990
And here's the other thing--
it's an investment of time.

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:56.920
And it doesn't mean you stay in
touch with everyone every day,

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.782
but a little note
that just lets people

00:45:58.782 --> 00:45:59.990
know you're thinking of them.

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:02.040
And that's when we
know a lot of people

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:05.650
and we have this huge
network and we like people.

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:08.355
I would say, I'd
invest that time--

00:46:08.355 --> 00:46:09.980
and you could be
multitasking and doing

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:11.730
something else at
the same time--

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:15.980
to stay in touch with people
you really know and like.

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:17.855
Because in the long
haul, what you develop

00:46:17.855 --> 00:46:21.060
is a network of really
great people in your life

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:27.100
that you can count on
and who can count on you.

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:29.300
I think this is where
social networking is

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.719
a wonderful opportunity
of staying in touch.

00:46:31.719 --> 00:46:32.510
You know what I do?

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:34.640
And I don't even remember
who I gave my phone to.

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.760
When I go back and look
at my pictures-- oh,

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:40.090
he put it in his pocket.

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:43.400
Wait till he finds out that the
case is from Claire's and it's

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.600
bejeweled.

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:46.100
It's going to be
very interesting.

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:46.930
You know what I do?

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:48.770
I go back to the photos.

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:52.420
And I'll see a photo I took
with someone or of someone.

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:56.230
And I'll just quickly text
it to them or email and say,

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:57.420
I saw this photo.

00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:00.260
Was thinking of the
wonderful memory.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:02.962
And it's just a wonderful way
to stay in touch with people.

00:47:02.962 --> 00:47:04.920
But I'm going to give
you the hint from secrets

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:10.150
of savvy networking-- one by
you-- you can work a room.

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:11.380
You can engage.

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:12.540
You can connect.

00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:15.340
But if you don't follow up
and stay in touch with people,

00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:19.800
you don't have that network
of friends that you need.

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.840
Because the followup
is essential.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.830
The best traits of
savvy networkers,

00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:27.860
they follow up when they say
they're going to follow up

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:29.940
and do what they say
they're going to do.

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:31.720
You can invite
people on LinkedIn.

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:34.790
You can invite them on
whatever Google company board

00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:36.370
that you have.

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:37.950
But stay in touch with people.

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:39.210
Don't wait for them.

00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:43.070
Remember what I said, initiate.

00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:45.549
Be the person that
extends yourself.

00:47:45.549 --> 00:47:46.590
Because what do you want?

00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:48.640
Don't you all want
a network of people

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:52.190
that help you grow as you
move forward in your careers?

00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:53.890
That's how you get them.

00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:56.249
And then sometimes they'll
even cook you a meal.

00:47:56.249 --> 00:47:58.540
AUDIENCE: I think a lot of
times what's holding me back

00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:01.180
from the initiating a
conversation is I'm not sure

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:03.560
if I can end it smoothly.

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:05.290
As a matter of fact,
I think it's easier

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:08.740
to start a conversation
than to end it.

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:09.974
Do you have tricks?

00:48:09.974 --> 00:48:11.390
SUSAN ROANE: You
are on the money.

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:15.380
I'm going to give you one
of my books as a present.

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:19.310
That is the number one question
I've been asked, not 25 years,

00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:21.340
30 years that I've been
talking about this.

00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:23.275
And what he said
is, how do you end?

00:48:23.275 --> 00:48:26.890
And a lot of people don't start
because they don't want to end,

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:28.920
because we don't want to
hurt people's feelings

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:32.500
and we want a gracious
ending, right?

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:36.040
Three ways to end conversations.

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:38.510
It's also on my
website on my blog.

00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:40.750
But three ways to end
conversations-- and it's

00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:42.170
in the book.

00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:44.850
First way, when you've
had a great conversation

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:47.860
with someone, oh, it's
so nice to talk to you

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:51.640
about the 49ers and
their draft picks.

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:55.060
I just made that up, but that
is what I've been talking about.

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:56.800
Now notice.

00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:00.039
Shook hands, I didn't
necessarily lean in,

00:49:00.039 --> 00:49:01.830
but it was so nice to
talk to you about it.

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:04.670
And then I summarized
a little phrase

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:07.050
so he knows I was
listening and that I

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:08.950
was part of that conversation.

00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:12.070
So nice to talk to you about.

00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:14.210
And then what you
do is, if you want

00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:16.290
their card-- do we
still give out cards?

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:18.250
I saw them at Google.

00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:21.290
I had one guy on a plane said to
me, oh, I take people's cards,

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:23.110
take a picture,
and throw them out.

00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:25.560
Well, that makes me feel good.

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:27.330
You could have not told me that.

00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:29.790
But exchange cards.

00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:31.290
And what if you
want someone's card?

00:49:31.290 --> 00:49:33.430
Oh, do you have a card?

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:35.810
Now, I once asked that to a
gentleman who looked at me--

00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:38.585
I tell you-- totally
deadpan and said, yes.

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:45.380
OK, could I have one?

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:47.270
About 20 years later,
I said, tell me.

00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:49.970
Why did you just say yes
and not give me a card?

00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:55.630
Here was his answer--
you hadn't asked for one.

00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:57.130
Don't play card games.

00:49:57.130 --> 00:49:57.640
It's silly.

00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:59.910
That's a waste of time.

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:01.360
So ask for someone's card.

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.740
And then what if they
don't ask for yours?

00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:07.740
What you could say-- and this is
completely contrarian to those

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:10.820
who want to get to the
point-- don't save time.

00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:13.260
Say, may I offer
you one of mine?

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:15.230
May I please offer
you one of mine?

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:17.090
Well, why don't I
just give them a card?

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:20.550
Because there's something about
the manners and the etiquette

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:23.300
and showing that
you have manners

00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:26.110
that's really memorable.

00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:28.430
OK, then here's what I would do.

00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:33.460
I would then walk a quarter of
the room away to someone else.

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:34.660
(WHISPERING) Here's my book.

00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:39.214
No, to someone else
who is standing alone,

00:50:39.214 --> 00:50:41.380
because I know he doesn't
want to be standing alone,

00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:43.220
or to another group of people.

00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:46.070
But walking a quarter
of the room away

00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:48.570
is really important, because
that way you don't make someone

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:51.544
feel you've just turned
your back on them.

00:50:51.544 --> 00:50:53.210
That's where that
expression comes from.

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:54.550
Does that make sense?

00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:58.220
Another way that you
exit-- and by the way,

00:50:58.220 --> 00:50:59.340
that gives you the card.

00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:02.330
Then you can follow up later
and invite them to LinkedIn

00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:05.140
and connect and send an email.

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:07.450
I know that sounds antiquated,
but once in awhile,

00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:08.550
I even do that.

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:10.200
And how about this?

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:11.700
Sometimes if you
had a conversation

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:13.830
that you really want to
continue and you've both

00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:16.830
talked about
continuing it, here's

00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:19.520
a really interesting thought.

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:25.060
You can take out your
phones, get that phone app,

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:28.400
and call them.

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:31.920
That will really show
how different you are.

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:32.870
You pick up the phone.

00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:35.644
And by the way, those of you
who have the book, somewhere

00:51:35.644 --> 00:51:37.060
in the book-- and
I can't remember

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:41.090
where-- there is a
QR code and a URL.

00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:44.140
But if you run your phone
over it or you plug in the URL

00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:51.020
to your browser, you get a
special, online-only extra

00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:53.475
chapter that has to
do with the phone.

00:51:53.475 --> 00:51:55.100
And I wish I could
tell you which page,

00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:57.030
but I don't remember.

00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:59.744
Talk about not
remembering things.

00:51:59.744 --> 00:52:00.910
Oh, there's one on the back.

00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:01.920
That leads to a video.

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:05.477
But the one inside leads to
a special online chapter.

00:52:05.477 --> 00:52:07.560
Thank you, he pointed out
what I should have said.

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:11.320
I tried to make this book
in 25 years interactive.

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:13.170
So on the back,
there's a QR code.

00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:15.540
And when you run your
phone over it, what it does

00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:17.500
is up pops a video
of me saying what's

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:18.950
different and new in the book.

00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:21.670
So did that help
you, how to exit?

00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:23.720
Let's just say-- let me
give you another exit.

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:25.600
Let's say you had a
conversation with someone

00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:27.390
and it wasn't going anywhere.

00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:29.120
Here's what you do.

00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:31.120
Don't say, I've had a
great time talking to you,

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:32.640
because it hasn't
been a great time.

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:35.040
It's been like pulling
teeth, a little root canal.

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:38.950
So what you say to them is-- and
don't any of you say this to me

00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:44.520
later-- I hope you enjoy
the rest of the event.

00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:45.900
Big smile.

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:47.595
And you still walk a
quarter of the room

00:52:47.595 --> 00:52:50.230
away, because that person might
be thinking about something

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:54.430
else that happened at home,
and they're not responsive

00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:56.300
because they're distracted.

00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:59.560
But the next time you see
them, it might be wonderful.

00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:02.410
And then the third
one isn't really

00:53:02.410 --> 00:53:03.570
moving away from someone.

00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:06.602
The third one is, oh, I see Joe.

00:53:06.602 --> 00:53:07.310
Have you met him?

00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:08.480
Why don't you come on over?

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:10.400
It's called the bring along.

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.610
And then you're in a
group conversation.

00:53:12.610 --> 00:53:14.300
So you have three ways to exit.

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:16.110
Well, one question
I'm often asked

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:18.190
is, what do I do
if I forgot a name?

00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:21.930
Have any of you
encountered that?

00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:24.030
OK, here's what you do.

00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:27.040
I know that there are name
and memory specialists that

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:30.070
will tell you, much
like Doctor Seuss,

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:34.230
to put a cat in a vat
in a hat on their head.

00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:36.660
But what I would say is, when
you forgot someone's name

00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:40.620
and you know their face is
familiar, save some time

00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:44.730
and go over and say, it's
just been one of those days.

00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:46.120
I know your face.

00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:47.270
I know we've met.

00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:52.280
Could you help me out and
remind me of your name?

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.080
It's direct.

00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:54.760
Now here's what happens.

00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:57.940
Every person has
forgotten someone's name.

00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:01.780
If it's your sister or your
mother-in-law, not so cool.

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:04.230
But people have
forgotten people's names.

00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:06.840
And then they'll tell you
stories how they forgot a name.

00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:09.640
But if you say that
up front, that works.

00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:10.892
But here's another technique.

00:54:10.892 --> 00:54:12.350
And I learned this
from a gentleman

00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:15.265
who was the vice president
of the Harlem Globetrotters.

00:54:15.265 --> 00:54:17.640
Well, I knew he was the vice
president in the main office

00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:19.150
because he was 5'5.

00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:20.670
But he told me this.

00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:23.740
He said-- and I kept this in
the book 25 years-- he said,

00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:27.080
Susan, what you tell people
is when they go somewhere

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:30.580
and they see someone that
they recognize but they really

00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:33.540
don't remember a name,
he said, always-- even

00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:36.330
if you've seen that
person five times--

00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:38.980
always put your hand
out and say your name.

00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:40.880
Hi, I'm Susan RoAne.

00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:41.732
VINCE: Vince Lacey.

00:54:41.732 --> 00:54:42.440
SUSAN ROANE: Yes.

00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:44.523
He's just looking at me
smiling, going, oh my God.

00:54:44.523 --> 00:54:45.820
I'm not safe from her.

00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:48.890
OK, here's what Manny said.

00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:51.900
When you go over
and say your name,

00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:54.930
you can bet if you didn't
remember their name after six

00:54:54.930 --> 00:54:57.690
months, they have no
clue of your name either.

00:54:57.690 --> 00:55:00.640
But when you see your
name, 90% of the time,

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.290
people will respond in kind.

00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:04.330
Then you both know
each other and reminded

00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:05.630
each other of your names.

00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:08.160
And then you're
having a conversation.

00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:12.740
Does that help you
around remembering names?

00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:14.810
And then just tell the truth.

00:55:14.810 --> 00:55:16.660
I'm going to have
any more questions,

00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:19.300
and then I'm going to close.

00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:19.800
Any more?

00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:21.130
Who has the microphone?

00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:21.940
Oh, you do.

00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:23.049
Any questions, Cliff?

00:55:23.049 --> 00:55:25.090
CLIFF: I think we're set
a questions for now, so.

00:55:25.090 --> 00:55:26.790
SUSAN ROANE: OK.

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:29.170
Working a room is work.

00:55:29.170 --> 00:55:31.180
I've had people say-- and
I'm going to stay here

00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:32.280
so that I sign the book.

00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:36.152
I once was signing a book,
and I was writing a sentence.

00:55:36.152 --> 00:55:37.860
And the guy looked at
me and say, really?

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:40.444
You write a whole
lot for an autograph.

00:55:40.444 --> 00:55:41.860
Because I don't
just sign my name.

00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:45.350
And I said, really,
the autograph was easy.

00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:49.200
Writing the book, really
hard, but well worth it.

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:53.570
Because I know it's served
people over a number of years

00:55:53.570 --> 00:55:56.870
and continues to serve
people, because I want you all

00:55:56.870 --> 00:56:01.030
to be able to walk into any
room and have a good time

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:02.354
and meet who you want to meet.

00:56:02.354 --> 00:56:04.770
And by the way, when you're
wearing anything from Google--

00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:08.490
I saw the Google girl power and
I've seen some Google shirts--

00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:11.270
it starts conversations.

00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:14.670
I have a shirt that
says, "Give me chocolate,

00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:17.300
and nobody will get hurt."

00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:19.470
It starts conversations.

00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:23.200
I'm good to end with something
that actually happened.

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.960
When "How to Work a
Room" first came out,

00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:27.400
I spoke for the
Commonwealth Club.

00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:33.510
It was absolutely an honor
for me, a former teacher.

00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:36.170
Two men were in the second row.

00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:37.540
But I went before the talk.

00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:39.750
I held the book, my
baby, under my arm

00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:42.420
and I-- what brought you here?

00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:45.045
It was so nice to see
you, thank you for coming.

00:56:45.045 --> 00:56:47.586
And then one of them looked at
me with the face, and he says,

00:56:47.586 --> 00:56:49.500
I just have a
question to ask you.

00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:51.390
This is before the talk.

00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:53.400
I knew it wasn't going
to be a good one.

00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:59.140
He said, how did you
take a 200 page book

00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:03.710
and think you're going
to give a 45 minute talk?

00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:06.540
Well, there's
something about humor--

00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:09.170
and I wrote about in the
book-- that I channeled

00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:12.750
my grandfather, who was known as
having a great sense of humor.

00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:15.490
And I was so lucky the
answer came to me then

00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:19.110
that might have happened an
hour later while I hit my head.

00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:20.350
And I looked at the guy.

00:57:20.350 --> 00:57:22.599
And I said, the only way you
can handle someone that's

00:57:22.599 --> 00:57:24.760
sounding so negative
is with humor.

00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:27.710
And I said to him, you
think that was tough?

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:32.920
I took a 45 minute talk and
turned it into a 200 page book.

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:35.920
And now you have the
300 page version.

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:38.030
And it's the silver anniversary.

00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:41.430
And I am so delighted
to be here at Google.

00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:43.430
I can't thank Cliff enough.

00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:45.710
We now have a whole
new room of-- I've

00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:47.740
anointed you the
mingling mavens.

00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:48.880
You have my email.

00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:51.910
Any questions that come up
that I haven't answered,

00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:54.900
feel free to let me know.

00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:57.800
And I promise you an answer.

00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:02.440
So thank you very much, and
I hope you'll tell every one.

00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:07.360
And I'm available, and I'll
keep on Googling, you guys.

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:08.610
Thank you so much.

00:58:08.610 --> 00:58:09.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:09.810 --> 00:58:13.460
Thank you, thank you.
