sister in and made her take at 23 me DNA

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590
sister in and made her take at 23 me DNA
 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.099
sister in and made her take at 23 me DNA
tests so we can know for sure if we are

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109
tests so we can know for sure if we are
 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.950
tests so we can know for sure if we are
actually related if I'm adopted and if

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960
actually related if I'm adopted and if
 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.410

I'm not how similar our ancestry is

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420
I'm not how similar our ancestry is
 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.090
I'm not how similar our ancestry is
given that we look pretty different

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.100
 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.180
all right so we are both together we've

all right so we are both together we've
 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.630
all right so we are both together we've
both taken the 23 meat kit how are you

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640
both taken the 23 meat kit how are you
 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.670
both taken the 23 meat kit how are you
feeling Jim oh I'm so excited

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680
feeling Jim oh I'm so excited

that kind of shows a breakdown of what I

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130
that kind of shows a breakdown of what I
 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.410
that kind of shows a breakdown of what I
am so I'm 63 percent European okay but

sense of my background and what I am I'm
 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:00.849
sense of my background and what I am I'm
nervous because I'm like I don't really

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:00.859
nervous because I'm like I don't really
 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:02.709
nervous because I'm like I don't really
know if it's an identical I don't know

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719
know if it's an identical I don't know
 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:19.690
know if it's an identical I don't know
I'm scared oh I see color I see lots of

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700
I'm scared oh I see color I see lots of
 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.720
I'm scared oh I see color I see lots of
colors oh my gosh

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730

thought that she was like almost

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470
thought that she was like almost

entirely of European descent this tells

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170
entirely of European descent this tells
 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.980
entirely of European descent this tells
us where your ancestors came from and

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990
us where your ancestors came from and
 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.160
us where your ancestors came from and
how long ago your mostly that is so cool

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170
how long ago your mostly that is so cool
 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.770
how long ago your mostly that is so cool
yeah so you can see like a British and

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780
yeah so you can see like a British and
 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.510
yeah so you can see like a British and
South Asian are like pretty recent

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520
South Asian are like pretty recent
 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.670
South Asian are like pretty recent
dressed you literally have family from

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680
dressed you literally have family from
 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.470
dressed you literally have family from
and still living in India and we

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480
and still living in India and we
 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.880
and still living in India and we
obviously probably have relatives still

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890
obviously probably have relatives still
 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.810
obviously probably have relatives still
in Britain and Europe to compare exactly

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820
in Britain and Europe to compare exactly
 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.080
in Britain and Europe to compare exactly
I have 62.2% European in me and you have

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090
I have 62.2% European in me and you have
 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.630
I have 62.2% European in me and you have
sixty 1.9% the fact that I'm more

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640
sixty 1.9% the fact that I'm more
 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.310
sixty 1.9% the fact that I'm more
European than Kim I wouldn't have

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320
European than Kim I wouldn't have
 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.900
European than Kim I wouldn't have
guessed that and I know that it's kind

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910
guessed that and I know that it's kind
 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.130
guessed that and I know that it's kind
of silly just a base it on the

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140
of silly just a base it on the
 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.110
of silly just a base it on the
assumption of like skin tone and we're

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120
assumption of like skin tone and we're
 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.730
assumption of like skin tone and we're
not that far apart and skin tone like

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740
not that far apart and skin tone like
 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.290
not that far apart and skin tone like
that was like definitely a big shock

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300
that was like definitely a big shock
 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.190
that was like definitely a big shock
then South Asian you are 21.2% and I'm

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200
then South Asian you are 21.2% and I'm
 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.810
then South Asian you are 21.2% and I'm
twenty three point five which seems like

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820
twenty three point five which seems like
 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.220
twenty three point five which seems like
pretty much the same and it's

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230
pretty much the same and it's
 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.570
pretty much the same and it's
interesting that we probably got those

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580
interesting that we probably got those
 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.670
interesting that we probably got those
same deems from when you tell people

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680
same deems from when you tell people
 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.130
same deems from when you tell people
that you are part Indian or South Asian

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140
that you are part Indian or South Asian
 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.690
that you are part Indian or South Asian
like did you tell people that did they

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700
like did you tell people that did they
 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.330
like did you tell people that did they
don't like yeah people do and there

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340
don't like yeah people do and there
 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.340
don't like yeah people do and there
sometimes people be like oh now I see

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350
sometimes people be like oh now I see
 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.610

you don't look Indian oh you're more
East Asian and Native American than a

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300
East Asian and Native American than a
 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.930
East Asian and Native American than a
Chinese I find I would never expect it

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940
Chinese I find I would never expect it
 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.480
Chinese I find I would never expect it
it is so crazy because I bet yeah like I

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490
it is so crazy because I bet yeah like I
 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.910
it is so crazy because I bet yeah like I
think people like could guess nut could

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920
think people like could guess nut could
 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.680
think people like could guess nut could
guess it for me but I don't think anyone

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690
guess it for me but I don't think anyone
 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.970
