00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.450
So the current state of gene patenting, thanks to the decision on

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.060
June 2013, I think it was June 13th 2013, on the Myriad

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.374
case is that human genetic

00:00:15.374 --> 00:00:20.540
code is not patentable. However, code that

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.590
is synthesized. From, like if you, I cannot

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.780
say, I patent that mutation you have because I discovered it.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.990
However, if you synthesize that DNA, think it's called cDNA.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.190
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. That is patentable. Because that is

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.220
a product of human innovation. So a lot

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.390
of the debate over the Myriad case and

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.690
the patenting of genes has really been about

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.570
the purpose of patents in the United

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.920
States. And, you know, this whole history of

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.830
intellectual protection in the United States which is

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.000
super fun stuff that probably doesn't need to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.570
be done in depth in a genetics course. But the purpose of the patent code is to

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.414
protect the fruits of human innovation. Yet if you have worked on something and

00:01:16.414 --> 00:01:19.161
you have created something, you are entitled to

00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:21.372
control it and profit off of that for a,

00:01:21.372 --> 00:01:23.918
you know, protected period of time which has

00:01:23.918 --> 00:01:28.267
changed, of course, throughout patent protection history. But you're

00:01:28.267 --> 00:01:30.724
entitled to exclusively profit off of that for

00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:32.551
a period of time as a reward for your

00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:34.693
labor in bringing this new thing into the

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:42.670
world. So patenting of natural materials, has actually been.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.720
There's a pretty extensive case law. That this was not something that

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.840
you could do. Because you can't just you know, discover a mold. Scoop it out and

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.980
say, I patent this. I get to use this mold alone. A lot of

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.110
people were arguing that genes, the discovery

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.920
of a genetic mutation, took so much effort and took so much ingenuity to

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.690
isolate and to interpret this information, that that made it patentable.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.340
And there actual you know, Myriad's patents were not the first to be issued.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.758
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:21.758 --> 00:02:24.257
&gt;&gt; Myriad isr eally just the

00:02:24.257 --> 00:02:29.910
worst behaved patenter of human genetic information.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.310
&gt;&gt; They didn't make any friends.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.250
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.470
&gt;&gt; And even since the Supreme Court

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.590
decision it seems that they're still going after people. I know that there

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.707
are companies that You know we're trying to run with the supreme court decision.

00:02:40.707 --> 00:02:41.176
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:02:41.176 --> 00:02:42.851
&gt;&gt; And Myriad is still suing them.

00:02:42.851 --> 00:02:46.769
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah there's plenty of cleanup work left to be done.

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:47.769
&gt;&gt;

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:47.519
[LAUGH]

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.319
&gt;&gt; but yea, over the course of this litigation a lot

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.767
of people were arguing. Instead of invalidating patents like this. Or

00:02:52.767 --> 00:02:57.752
instead of having this compulsory licensing system. Was another idea that

00:02:57.752 --> 00:03:02.860
is, it's, you know, common to further scientific innovation by licensing.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.050
&gt;&gt; Mm hmm.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.600
&gt;&gt; Your patent, licensing your discovery. And

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.630
the whole problem with Myriad's holding of

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.360
these patents that led to all these lawsuits is they didn't grant any licenses,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.150
which was putting a choke hold on

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.980
research. And of course an individual's ability

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.260
to access a diagnostic test to determine

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.140
whether or not they had these mutations.
