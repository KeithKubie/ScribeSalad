[Narrator] The histogram filter's biggest disadvantage is it scales exponentially,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and the reason is any grid that is defined over k dimensions

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
will end up having exponentially many grid cells in the number of dimensions,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
which is really unfortunate because

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
we can't really represent high dimensional grids really well.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So, it works really well for low dimensional problems

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
like 3 dimensional robot localization problems.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The kalman filter in contrast, under certain assumptions,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
is quadratic.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
All we represented was a vector, the mean, and the covariance matrix,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and the covariance matrix is quadratic.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And it turns out all the computation, if your measurements space is a fixed size,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
ends up to be quadratic without a proof here.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So, you just have to take it by faith,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but the queer thing is this is a much more efficient method.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So, if you have a 15, 20 dimensional state space,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
the kalman filters will be more efficient than the histogram filters.
