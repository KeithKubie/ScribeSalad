00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.900
To make the notation actually come
out relatively cleanly [LAUGH],

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.310
to minimize the number of subscripts
that I am going to mess up, we're

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.020
going to introduce a notation called
operator notation, functional notation.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.520
And we're going to introduce
a particular, a Bellman operator.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.780
So Bellman operator is
going to be a mapping,

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.790
a transformation,
from value functions to value functions.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.860
You give me a Q function, the Bellman
operator will give you back, possibly,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.030
a different Q function.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.620
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.070
it's a function from Q
functions to Q functions.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.850
&gt;&gt; Does this operator have to have any
particularly interesting properties?

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.434
&gt;&gt; We're going to prove that
it has some properties, but

00:00:36.434 --> 00:00:37.412
first let's define what it is.

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:38.039
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:38.735
&gt;&gt; Boom!

00:00:38.735 --> 00:00:39.570
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.634
&gt;&gt; So here's how we're going to
define this Bellman operator B.

00:00:41.634 --> 00:00:45.828
We're going to give it a Q function,
and the new thing that we get out,

00:00:45.828 --> 00:00:50.405
this B applied to Q, has the property
that at state action pair (S,a).

00:00:50.405 --> 00:00:54.683
It's equal to the immediate reward
plus the discounted expected value of

00:00:54.683 --> 00:00:59.030
the next state, where we look up the
value of the next state using whichever

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.500
Q function we were given
as input to the operator.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.430
So, Q goes in, BQ comes out.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.030
BQ is a new value function,
a new Q function.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.540
Do you think you get that?

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.410
&gt;&gt; I think I do.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.889
I guess, I don't know why
we're going through this yet.

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:15.151
&gt;&gt; Oh, I'm going to tell
you that quite yet, but

00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:17.918
I just want to make sure that
you get it by quizzing you.

00:01:17.918 --> 00:01:18.418
&gt;&gt; No!
