00:00:13.976 --> 00:00:16.056
&gt;&gt;Maria: Eighty percent of
our kids come on a school bus.

00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:21.106
Average I guess travel
time one way is 40 minutes.

00:00:22.156 --> 00:00:26.316
So they have to have that commitment
to say, "Yeah, I'm going to be

00:00:26.316 --> 00:00:28.346
at the bus stop at six
o'clock in the morning."

00:00:28.696 --> 00:00:31.386
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students are drawn
from all over Los Angeles

00:00:31.496 --> 00:00:34.316
to Bravo Medical Magnet High School.

00:00:34.476 --> 00:00:38.566
Named after an East Los Angeles
physician, Bravo is a medicine

00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.066
and health career themed school.

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.716
&gt;&gt;Joe: So that will help
to protect her ears.

00:00:41.786 --> 00:00:44.716
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The curriculum
exposes every student to aspects

00:00:44.716 --> 00:00:48.216
of the medical field and
offers more focused studies

00:00:48.416 --> 00:00:50.496
in small academies within the school.

00:00:51.496 --> 00:00:54.636
Bravo also offers outstanding
dance and music programs.

00:00:56.836 --> 00:00:58.296
&gt;&gt;Teacher: One, two,
three, four, five, six--

00:00:58.296 --> 00:00:59.666
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Clubs and athletics.

00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:00.426
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Paso numero uno.

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:01.916
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Parental support groups.

00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:04.696
And partnerships with
local institutions

00:01:04.696 --> 00:01:06.216
like the USC Medical Center.

00:01:06.546 --> 00:01:08.376
&gt;&gt;Joe: So when do the
nerves stimulate?

00:01:08.376 --> 00:01:12.846
Do they stimulate at the same time
that the hormone does, or not?

00:01:13.136 --> 00:01:16.066
&gt;&gt;Maria: We are probably about 85
percent free and reduced lunch.

00:01:16.286 --> 00:01:19.976
So our kids are not
middle class kids.

00:01:20.486 --> 00:01:26.576
But I believe that when you have
high expectations and you have

00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:31.156
that support system that will help
students that are having difficulty,

00:01:31.196 --> 00:01:34.316
when you believe in them and they
feel that you believe in them,

00:01:34.456 --> 00:01:37.856
they will do anything
you ask of them.

00:01:38.186 --> 00:01:40.586
&gt;&gt;Dea: So this electrode is going
to be measuring your brainwaves.

00:01:40.586 --> 00:01:41.986
So I'm going to put one
electrode on your forehead,

00:01:41.986 --> 00:01:44.446
and one electrode on your ear.

00:01:44.446 --> 00:01:48.986
&gt;&gt;Joe: A major focus of the class is
to have the students become curious

00:01:49.376 --> 00:01:53.776
that they raise their own questions
that are focused around physiology.

00:01:53.886 --> 00:01:55.686
&gt;&gt;Dea: I came up with a
hypothesis that people

00:01:55.686 --> 00:01:58.956
who play video games more might
actually have a lower stress level

00:01:59.106 --> 00:02:00.036
than people who didn't.

00:02:00.916 --> 00:02:04.916
So I started asking people, "Do you
consider yourself a gamer or not?"

00:02:04.946 --> 00:02:06.456
And then I would test them.

00:02:06.596 --> 00:02:09.666
&gt;&gt;Joe: And then also having
the technology to be able

00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:14.286
to measure biopotentials or
blood pressure or vital signs.

00:02:14.286 --> 00:02:17.146
&gt;&gt;Joe: Exercise can
actually reduce stress.

00:02:17.776 --> 00:02:18.086
&gt;&gt;Dea: Right.

00:02:18.486 --> 00:02:19.496
&gt;&gt;Joe: How could that work?

00:02:19.656 --> 00:02:22.156
&gt;&gt;Dea: That's something I still
want to test, because I still think

00:02:22.156 --> 00:02:24.426
that athletes will have
a lower stress level,

00:02:24.516 --> 00:02:26.436
just because they have an
output for that stress.

00:02:27.576 --> 00:02:29.926
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Some Bravo students
continue their education

00:02:29.926 --> 00:02:33.676
in the afternoon by walking three
blocks from the high school to one

00:02:33.676 --> 00:02:36.576
of the most prestigious
medical centers in the country.

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:38.286
&gt;&gt;Maria: We have a
terrific partnership

00:02:38.336 --> 00:02:40.316
with the University of
Southern California.

00:02:41.606 --> 00:02:45.426
With the ROP program, the students
work at the hospitals that are owned

00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:48.196
by USC in a variety
of different areas.

00:02:48.796 --> 00:02:50.826
&gt;&gt;Student: And where
is she going today?

00:02:51.356 --> 00:02:53.566
&gt;&gt;Maria: We know that not every
student that comes here is going

00:02:53.566 --> 00:02:55.876
to be a doctor, going
to go to medical school.

00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:59.316
But it helps them see that it's
not just the doctors that make

00:02:59.316 --> 00:03:01.276
that whole health medical
world happen.

00:03:02.136 --> 00:03:04.916
&gt;&gt;Narrator: A select group of
students in Bravo's science,

00:03:04.946 --> 00:03:08.696
technology, and research program, and
the Engineering for Health Academy,

00:03:09.036 --> 00:03:12.426
work in research labs on
the USC medical campus.

00:03:12.676 --> 00:03:14.906
&gt;&gt;Nouri: These experiments
are really very high-level,

00:03:14.976 --> 00:03:16.296
sophisticated experiments.

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:18.386
Just the same experiments
that the post docs

00:03:18.386 --> 00:03:19.816
and graduate students are doing.

00:03:19.906 --> 00:03:22.736
So the high school students are
really-- this is fantastic for them.

00:03:22.866 --> 00:03:25.716
They can do very cool stuff.

00:03:25.716 --> 00:03:26.026
&gt;&gt;Hey Harvey.

00:03:26.226 --> 00:03:26.356
&gt;&gt;Student: Hey.

00:03:27.186 --> 00:03:28.716
&gt;&gt;What are you working on?

00:03:28.716 --> 00:03:30.466
&gt;&gt;Student: Right now,
I'm just trying to smooth

00:03:30.466 --> 00:03:32.406
out the output of this circuit.

00:03:33.126 --> 00:03:34.536
&gt;&gt;Mark: We actually have curricula

00:03:34.966 --> 00:03:38.596
that we've instituted
towards biomedical engineering

00:03:38.596 --> 00:03:43.616
and engineering in life
sciences which goes hand in glove

00:03:43.616 --> 00:03:46.436
with the experimental
experience in the lab.

00:03:46.586 --> 00:03:48.916
Education has to be
much more hands on.

00:03:49.376 --> 00:03:52.976
We can't continue to just
educate students in silos

00:03:53.286 --> 00:03:58.286
and not integrate technologies in
this case into medical applications.

00:03:58.476 --> 00:04:01.436
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The way that the course is
designed, it's a two period, right?

00:04:01.436 --> 00:04:01.706
&gt;&gt;Student: Mm-hm.

00:04:01.856 --> 00:04:05.226
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And the first semester,
you learn medical terminology.

00:04:05.486 --> 00:04:08.596
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Many students
entering Bravo are classified

00:04:08.596 --> 00:04:10.476
as at-risk academically.

00:04:10.536 --> 00:04:13.196
So the school offers a
range of support services

00:04:13.196 --> 00:04:14.796
for students and their parents.

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:17.516
&gt;&gt;Maria: Twice a month, the
parents meet with the counselors.

00:04:17.516 --> 00:04:20.256
The counselors provide workshops
for them, and then they sit

00:04:20.256 --> 00:04:25.256
with their child and they teach
them how to read their report card,

00:04:25.786 --> 00:04:28.476
how to call the teacher, how to
have a parent-teacher conference.

00:04:28.986 --> 00:04:32.196
So really helping parents
and kids better communicate.

00:04:32.366 --> 00:04:36.086
And helping the parents to know which
questions they should be asking.

00:04:37.356 --> 00:04:40.886
&gt;&gt;Narrator: There are also homework
help programs monitored by some

00:04:40.886 --> 00:04:43.856
of the many Bravo alumni
who return to the school

00:04:43.856 --> 00:04:45.866
to help the next wave of students.

00:04:46.156 --> 00:04:48.026
&gt;&gt;Rolando: I do want to see
a lot of these kids succeed.

00:04:48.026 --> 00:04:51.066
And I can see, you know, why
some of the teachers try so hard

00:04:51.066 --> 00:04:52.066
with many of the students.

00:04:52.966 --> 00:04:55.366
The more you know them, the
more you really want them

00:04:55.366 --> 00:04:56.576
to grow for themselves.

00:04:56.576 --> 00:04:57.796
&gt;&gt;Rolando: In this one, what
do you think we're looking for?

00:04:57.986 --> 00:04:58.236
&gt;&gt;Student: N.

00:04:58.596 --> 00:04:59.386
&gt;&gt;Rolando: N, all right.

00:04:59.736 --> 00:05:02.536
&gt;&gt;Marsela: Definitely
Bravo gave me so much.

00:05:02.776 --> 00:05:06.266
It got me really prepared for
college, and I didn't think

00:05:06.296 --> 00:05:07.276
that back when I was here.

00:05:07.276 --> 00:05:08.926
I was like, "Oh my God,
I have to read how much?

00:05:08.926 --> 00:05:09.726
I have to do this?

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:10.766
I have to write this essay?"

00:05:11.156 --> 00:05:13.946
Then when I got to college, I'm
like, the first couple of classes,

00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:15.476
like, "Oh, this is a breeze."

00:05:15.476 --> 00:05:18.026
You know, I read-- like, yeah,
I read this in high school.

00:05:18.606 --> 00:05:23.306
And I really wanted to come back
and give some of that to the kids.

00:05:23.626 --> 00:05:25.976
&gt;&gt;Maria: Don't let anyone,
especially yourself,

00:05:26.336 --> 00:05:27.736
say this is something I can't do.

00:05:28.216 --> 00:05:30.706
&gt;&gt;Maria: I'm not a person
that supports the status quo,

00:05:31.086 --> 00:05:33.606
because usually status quo means it's

00:05:33.606 --> 00:05:35.406
about the adults and
not about the kids.

00:05:35.706 --> 00:05:38.966
And when it's about kids,
you see the results.

00:05:39.546 --> 00:05:40.746
It's not easy, sometimes.

00:05:41.376 --> 00:05:43.126
But it's the work that we have to do.

00:05:43.126 --> 00:05:45.156
&gt;&gt;Maria: All right,
guys, have a great day.

00:05:46.466 --> 00:05:46.976
&gt;&gt;Student: Thank you.

00:05:47.126 --> 00:05:49.216
