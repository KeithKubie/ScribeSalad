00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.270 position:67%
Carlos Brody:
Oh, I've been a geek from a very early age.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.050
Carlos Brody:
When I was, I think, about 12
my parents, for my birthday,

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.930 position:64%
Carlos Brody:
they bought me a programmable calculator.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.840 position:72%
Carlos Brody:
And they hid it away, waiting for my birthday.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.260 position:81%
Carlos Brody:
But I found out that they bought it, and I found out

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:15.850
Carlos Brody:
where it was.


00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.640 position:89%
Carlos Brody:
And so at night, when they were asleep, I would crawl out

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.430
Carlos Brody:
of bed, and go to the closet
where they'd hidden it away,

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.910
Carlos Brody:
and open it, and play with
it, and learn to program.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.570 position:61%
Carlos Brody:
That's when I first learned to program.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.110
Carlos Brody:
And then of course, I'd wrap
it back up and put it back

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.990
Carlos Brody:
away, so that they wouldn't know
that I'd been doing this.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.620
Carlos Brody:
And then when it came to
learning about the brain, it

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.160
Carlos Brody:
was like it turned out to
be the most incredible,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.380
Carlos Brody:
complicated, huge programmable
calculator ever.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.660
Carlos Brody:
So it's the same problem,
except it's so much more

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.070
Carlos Brody:
interesting and complicated.


00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.850 position:69%
Carlos Brody:
I think a lot of neuroscientists get into it

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.760
Carlos Brody:
because it's us.


00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.530
Carlos Brody:
It's really about trying to
understand what makes us tick.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.610
Carlos Brody:
There's 10 billion neurons
in a typical human brain.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.390 position:59%
Carlos Brody:
Each of those, on average, connects to

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.680
Carlos Brody:
about a thousand others.


00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.790
Carlos Brody:
So that's 10 to the 14 synapses,
10 to the 14 connections.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.870
Carlos Brody:
We always say, "That's more stars
than there are in the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.930
Carlos Brody:
known universe."

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.330
Carlos Brody:
One of the reasons that I chose
to come to Princeton was

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.160
Carlos Brody:
because so many of my heroes
are here at Princeton.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.340
Carlos Brody:
For example, John Hopfield.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.620 position:61%
Carlos Brody:
I credit John with being the person who

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.030
Carlos Brody:
taught me how to think.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.420
Carlos Brody:
David Tank, who has developed
some of the most advanced

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.120
Carlos Brody:
technologies that we use to
study the brain, and is still

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.930
Carlos Brody:
doing so in a very exciting way.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.930
Carlos Brody:
And I knew, of course, that the
students were excellent.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.980 position:75%
Carlos Brody:
That was one of the things that brought me here.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.680
Carlos Brody:
It was a delight how intelligent
and how motivated

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.790
Carlos Brody:
and how serious about the work
a lot of the students can be.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.190
Carlos Brody:
Because the brain is so crazily
complicated, and

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.320
Carlos Brody:
because it works at so many
levels, you can start studying

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.110
Carlos Brody:
the brain at the level of a
single neuron or you can study

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.510 position:64%
Carlos Brody:
it at the level of a few tens of neurons.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.860
Carlos Brody:
Or you can study it at the level
of thousands of neurons.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.480
Carlos Brody:
Or you can study it at the level
of behavior, in billions

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.660
Carlos Brody:
of neurons.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.610
Carlos Brody:
Those are many different ways
to look at it, and require

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.300
Carlos Brody:
many different ways of thinking.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.240
Carlos Brody:
Some of them require molecular
biology, some of them require

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.960
Carlos Brody:
psychology, some of them require
computer science.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.720 position:66%
Carlos Brody:
The brain, because of its nature, requires

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.870
Carlos Brody:
interdisciplinary cross-level
thinking to make the advances

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.190
Carlos Brody:
beyond what we know now.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.640 position:69%
Carlos Brody:
It's about exchanging ideas, no matter which

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.030
Carlos Brody:
department you're in.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.000
Carlos Brody:
And that has been a big part of
what promotes neuroscience

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.830
Carlos Brody:
here at Princeton, and what
makes me think, "Oh, we're

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.740
Carlos Brody:
really going to do something
special here."

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.730
Carlos Brody:
Understanding how the brain
works will have impact on

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.930
Carlos Brody:
philosophy, will have impact
on engineering, will have

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.020
Carlos Brody:
impact on health.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.490
Carlos Brody:
And here at Princeton, we're on
the cusp of producing those

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.060
Carlos Brody:
interdisciplinary links right now.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.180
Carlos Brody:
The best part about being here?

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.790 position:77%
Carlos Brody:
The stellar intellects that you're surrounded by.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.560
Carlos Brody:
The challenge that that provides.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.500
Carlos Brody:
There are a lot of people here
who are smarter than I am.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.750
Carlos Brody:
That's where I want to be.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:12.320
