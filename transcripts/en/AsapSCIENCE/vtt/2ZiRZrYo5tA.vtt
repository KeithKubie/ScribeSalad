00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.010
To be the best athlete, musician, or even
gamer, you have to train relentlessly. But

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.430
to what degree does natural talent come into
play? Are some of us just born with a better

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.490
chance to be the best at what we do?

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.039
To study this question in sports, scientists
have tried subjecting untrained individuals

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.449
to identical exercise regimes, to see if the
same amount of training would lead to varying

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.269
results. Not so surprisingly, different individuals
saw different improvement - some improved

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.320
in leaps and bounds while others seemed stagnant.
But interestingly, individuals who were related

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.590
by blood saw similar improvements, indicating
that their genetics played a role in their

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.620
athletic potential. If your parent or sibling
saw incredible results from training, so would

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.720
you. These individuals are considered 'high
responders' to training.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.030
After statistical analysis of endurance, it
was determined that 50% of athletic improvement

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.040
was linked to genetics. In other words, great
athletes are born with great genes.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.050
With time, scientists have been able to isolate
particular sets of genes which they believe

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.970
are responsible for these traits. High responders
have them and experience significant improvement,

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.380
regardless of how fit they are to start. On
the other hand, if your genes deem you a 'low

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.469
responder' for endurance training, cross-country
skiing may not be for you.

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:20.380
But even before training, scientists noticed
something else; individuals all had different

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.520
baseline endurance levels as well. Without
any training, some individuals were simply

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.140
more fit than others. It turns out, a different
set of genes give some people a higher baseline.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.960
In the case of endurance, these genes can
code for larger volumes of blood, which are

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.460
generally only seen in trained athletes.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.810
So, you can have a high baseline or high trainability
- or both! And it's likely that our greatest

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.659
athletes train as hard as they can, on top
of having some great genetics. It seems that

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.090
talent is trainable, under the right circumstances.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.000
So have you got what it takes to be an Olympic
athlete? Science says, you'll never know until

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.400
you try.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.400
Don't forget: we have a new video out every day of the Olympics.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.400
Can't wait? Our amazing partners at the CBC already have five of the videos up now for you to binge on.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.400
Just head to cbc.ca/olympics/ScienceSays to watch them before anyone else. Link in the description.
