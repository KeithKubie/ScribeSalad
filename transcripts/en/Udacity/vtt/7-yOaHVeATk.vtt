00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer I want to see is 7 and not 6.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The reason why I want to see 7 is it takes 6 steps to go on the shortest path to the goal--

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But in this cell over here I have to turn to the left side.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
That turn also costs me a unit of 1.

00:00:19.000 --> 09:59:59.000
That's in total 6 straight motions and 1 turn, gives me 7.
