1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is radio lab, the podcast.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,640
Ladies and gentlemen, we are here
for a historic confrontation.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,910
And on today's podcast we'll
start with a little comeback.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,190
I want to tell you about an
event Robert and I did recently.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,320
Right here in Wny sees new green space.

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,240
We built a little boxing ring with ropes
and everything. We asked IRA glass,

7
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:22,890
who you're hearing to
be our boxing referee,

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,660
about 250 people showed up and Robert
and I decided to go head to head federal

9
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:32,661
once and for all the debate
radio versus television,

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,080
which is superior.

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,770
Hmm. So let's get started on

12
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,503
in this corner,

13
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,230
Robert, the crusher bro Edge

14
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:50,280
[inaudible].

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,940
I got to wear Silk Luxembourg

16
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,580
in the opposite corner.

17
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:01,040
The one the only Chad Boom Abbott, right

18
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,380
[inaudible]

19
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,940
and I got to where they're very stylish.

20
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:11,680
Red Boxing trunks with a hook in
real boxing. So here's how it went.

21
00:01:11,681 --> 00:01:14,800
When you went five rounds, the rules
were pretty simple. I play something.

22
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,810
Then Robert would play something

23
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,400
thing and then Ira and the audience would
judge round. One question topic was,

24
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,250
which is better at pictures, radio

25
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,980
or television? We'll just jump to the
results just to give you a taste of all.

26
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,400
Alright. Television is the winner.

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,233
Good.

28
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,750
Brown too. Which medium
is better at emotions?

29
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,520
Is it radio

30
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:42,960
[inaudible]

31
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,220
or is it television?

32
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,020
Oh,

33
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,511
still have to do rounds.

34
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:53,360
We were tied and so really just to
speed things up here we went three more

35
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:56,930
rounds or not thread. Three various
questions and when we got to round five,

36
00:01:56,931 --> 00:02:01,430
which was on the question of which
is more fun, radio or TV? Well,

37
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:03,980
here's what happened. I declared
television in the winter.

38
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,910
No,

39
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,950
what's that riot? Do you want to have a
recount? We can do a recap. I want to,

40
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,460
I want, I want them to riot.

41
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,290
[inaudible]

42
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,450
you're familiar with the
concept of a sore loser.

43
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,820
Radio doesn't have to win. How much more
dignity is there to this whole event?

44
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,840
We were in a radio station, IRA, we
have to wait. We can't wait to hear.

45
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:28,980
We can't win anywhere.

46
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,693
[inaudible]

47
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,310
all right, I'll take
a poll again. No radio

48
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,580
[inaudible].

49
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,260
I suddenly realized why they don't do
recounts in elections and television.

50
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,770
You guys are saying

51
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,100
hi. It was a draw.

52
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,260
It was a draw. Everybody won
that night. You had no radio. No,

53
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,170
I still refused to believe.
So then we decided, well,

54
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:12,160
okay so we took off our robes in our
glove and then we sat down and say,

55
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:15,430
well let's just put it all together
here. Like there are rules for making TV,

56
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:20,290
there are rules for making radio and
how are they different? And IRA began

57
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,270
all the rules of what we do on the radio,

58
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,360
especially on our show where the stories
have narrative motion where there's

59
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:32,540
characters in motion and
there's a conflict that
announces itself pretty quickly

60
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,080
and the people have to be treated.

61
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:36,650
Somebody has to be pretty
charming and you can relate to,

62
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:41,120
it's like our show on the radio
pretends to be a show where where,

63
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,800
where we're documenting everyday life,

64
00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:46,430
but when not actually what we're doing
is we're getting sort of regular people

65
00:03:46,431 --> 00:03:47,450
who are in really,

66
00:03:47,451 --> 00:03:51,620
really unusual and interesting situations
that would be worth putting on the

67
00:03:51,621 --> 00:03:52,454
radio.

68
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,840
And the thing that having pictures let
us do was to actually eliminate the need

69
00:03:58,191 --> 00:04:00,830
for a surprising pot line.

70
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,090
And Co let us just have moments
that we knew would be dramatic.

71
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:08,420
Like a guy's kid comes home from the army,

72
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,270
comes home from Iraq and you know,

73
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:14,300
like we had specific moments we were
going out to shoot but they didn't have to

74
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:16,490
surprise in exactly the same way.

75
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:21,490
And really a lot of the thing is kind
of staring at people and in a way that

76
00:04:21,831 --> 00:04:24,800
just is just anti radio
like it was, is just,

77
00:04:24,801 --> 00:04:27,740
is that an entire hour that just
been very difficult to do on radio.

78
00:04:27,741 --> 00:04:31,280
A lot of what we did on TV, I
think you could have done on radio,

79
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,720
there's like a hugeness to the
radio to the intimacy of the radio.

80
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:38,510
Like when you're in the actual um,

81
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,550
credit little hospital room and a not
so fancy hospital in Washington state.

82
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:48,790
And it's a real guy and his sort of semi
photogenic mom and he's like a little

83
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:52,310
bit of a stiff and she, I
dunno, like and then the,

84
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,690
and then they performed the
scene and you see them really,

85
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,040
they're not iconic, weird way.
Like, like something about the,

86
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:05,280
the specifics of staring at them and of
that room and you recognize kind of the

87
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:08,570
whole, the hospital tray. It
just plays really differently.

88
00:05:08,571 --> 00:05:12,360
Whereas on radio it would
be weirdly a mythic.

89
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,480
If you think about that piece,

90
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,300
that piece that you played with
where it's the dad and the kid,

91
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,940
there's something really epic about it.

92
00:05:19,941 --> 00:05:24,941
Like it's intimate and it's epic because
he like with his deep voice and her and

93
00:05:25,761 --> 00:05:30,761
her sort of symbolic like
kidness become iconic

94
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,140
Irish talking about a piece which had
an unfairly cute daughter up in that.

95
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,890
Why don't we just play it for the father
with a really deep voice. This was an,

96
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,570
I think if we played it in round two,

97
00:05:42,571 --> 00:05:47,571
this is from John Biewen at first it's
physical like any great love those eyes,

98
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,700
those hands, those thighs

99
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,153
really.

100
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,343
[inaudible]

101
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,290
[inaudible].

102
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,030
Hey Harper, what's a kitty cat? Say

103
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,940
the weight of them on your
lap. Climbing on your head.

104
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,990
Nobody writes pop songs
about that. Touch that field.

105
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,223
Sure.

106
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,990
What you're going to [inaudible]
I'm going to listen to you,

107
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,640
but riding around inside that little body,

108
00:06:39,641 --> 00:06:43,840
there's this person
over here, budding mind.

109
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,180
He'll do anything to touch

110
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,610
my craft.

111
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:56,200
So this small body becomes the
source of your biggest fears.

112
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,720
The child to flesh is
vulnerable. So you are too.

113
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,600
I do, but my favorite part of that

114
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,810
hearing you all look wonderful in our,

115
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,620
in your outfits. This is sad.

116
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:22,540
I can't wait to learn what all of
you want to be when you grow up.

117
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,720
Can I have some milk?
How old are you now girl?

118
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,613
Come on.

119
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,343
[inaudible]

120
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,990
[inaudible] I'm scared,

121
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,770
but you have to let go. Let her go.

122
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:48,660
Little by little she said that Kayla
said something mean about me. She said,

123
00:07:48,661 --> 00:07:51,210
dad, it's okay. Was that way too,

124
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,690
in that way in which her
body was never for you.

125
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,430
Next message. Hi Daddy. It's Harper. Um,

126
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,610
we're going to be out like on a
Ga. Oh girl. After gay down. Um,

127
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,410
just call me on my cell phone. Like
if anything happened or anything,

128
00:08:07,411 --> 00:08:09,180
I'll call you whenever
I come home. Okay, bye.

129
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,693
[inaudible].

130
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,590
So girl, how old are you going
to be your next birthday? 13.

131
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:30,620
And have you and your mom
talked about, you know,

132
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,900
the talk? Yeah. Do you think
you and I should have the talk?

133
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,490
No, no, no. Good.

134
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,640
So that was a piece called scared from
John [inaudible] and thanks to him and to

135
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,020
Harper Bun and to the third coast audio
festival. And now back to the event.

136
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,040
I think one of the deep
differences is when you watch the,

137
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,920
it is an act of staring. So you're,

138
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,780
you're in a chair or standing and you're
looking across a space at a box with a

139
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:06,390
square, and then the square
has some images and you,

140
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,690
your options are to look
away or to look at it.

141
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,470
You also know that between
you and [inaudible], there
could be lots of business.

142
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,980
Someone could come by, a cat
could go by, a child could go buy,

143
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,450
a dog could go by, or if something could
catch your eye and you'd Click it away.

144
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,880
So there is a stare in TV in the radio.

145
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,980
Often people either clamp something on
either ear or if they don't do that and

146
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:36,660
they're just listening to the
radio, there is a, um, there is uh,

147
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:42,140
an intimate kind of sharing
where if the radio is describing,

148
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,260
the person listening starts to paint in
voluntarily just because they helplessly

149
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,840
picture the words you're saying
and the painting in your head,

150
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,560
first of all belongs to
you. And it's not a stare.

151
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,290
It's actually very unlike a stare.

152
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,340
And there's more when you are
coauthoring, which is what you're doing,

153
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,920
the story you're being told,

154
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,610
there is more room in there
for that story in a way.

155
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,010
But when you stare,

156
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,660
you do get to see things that you wouldn't
know that you wouldn't find yourself,

157
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:19,920
that you couldn't imagine.

158
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,910
But there is a coolness to the stare
and a warmness to the radio that just

159
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:30,870
travels. And they were very
advantages and disadvantages to both.

160
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,130
And I see, I the other,
the, the, like I, I'd

161
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,140
see all that and felt all that
when we were making TV. Like the,

162
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,550
the other thing that always struck me
as a huge difference is that to get an

163
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:43,020
emotional moment on TV,

164
00:10:43,021 --> 00:10:45,090
like we could make an emotional
moment and just like you said,

165
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:48,960
you have people's faces and
they communicate so much
and communicate just as

166
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:53,550
much as the voice does. Um, but
to make an emotional moment on TV,

167
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:58,551
it's almost like we would have to like
erect a scaffolding for it to happen and

168
00:10:58,681 --> 00:11:02,040
build to the moment and they'd have
to be like fast action, fast action,

169
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,510
fast action, cutting, cutting, cutting.

170
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:08,370
And then we'd have to slow it down so you
could feel the slowness and then there

171
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:13,140
could be slower sorts of emotion and
feeling and the music would change it.

172
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:16,440
It was sort of like a much
bigger orchestration job, um,

173
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:20,340
in the way it had to be photographed
and handled. Whereas on radio,

174
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:26,020
it has such emotion as the
default position like it
because it's the thing that

175
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:31,470
it's going to do when it's not even
trying to do anything is communicate a lot

176
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:35,590
of feeling and a lot of
intimacy. You know, like we,

177
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,570
we can send that anybody with a tape
recorder and if they can talk to somebody,

178
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:43,650
they'll get that and the sound of the
person's voice will carry out this

179
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:48,480
feeling. And, and that seemed to be
just in a, just an a a huge difference.

180
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,440
And then people were more able to open
up on the radio to work with sort of an

181
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:55,810
answer or thing when it isn't like a
camera crew on lights and like, you know,

182
00:11:55,811 --> 00:11:59,990
we were shooting very pretty. So there's
a lot of people and um, versus a bit,

183
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,560
by the time we finished a
second season, they were,

184
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,240
when we started our first
season, I thought, well,

185
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:06,940
we'll get the same percentage of
people who open up on radio and TV.

186
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,600
But by the time we got to the
end of the second season, uh,

187
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,420
Lisa and Nancy and the other producers
when they really wanted to get down with

188
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:13,691
people,

189
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,840
we would film part of the interview and
then they would just tape part of the,

190
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,030
they just take the person off and they
were taped part of the interview just

191
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,880
with a tape recorder. Just them. Yeah.

192
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,220
And then we would use that part in the
part where you see pictures of other

193
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:26,410
stuff and, and yeah.

194
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:29,170
So we totally tricked it out to get the
kinds of quotes that we wanted because

195
00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:33,070
we weren't getting the quotes we wanted
while the camera was rolling. Sometimes.

196
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:38,080
Let me ask you both the questions
since you both have done radio and TV,

197
00:12:38,081 --> 00:12:40,960
in many cases, the same
story on radio and TV. Um,

198
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:46,110
how has the experience of doing radio
being or being behind the camera different

199
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,690
than being behind the
microphone? Cause I have this,

200
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:50,860
I always sort of joke with him.

201
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:55,420
I have this experience every time
I see him on TV, it tweaks me.

202
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,290
It's weird because I'm like,
who is that guy? He's not,

203
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,680
he's not the the Robert that I know from
the studio cause he's the Robert in the

204
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,930
studio and the Robert like in this ring.

205
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,990
And I love the fact that we're having
this quiet chat in a boxing ring.

206
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,480
He's kind of like this oversize
outsized emotional duties. Like,

207
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:18,250
like just huge gestures. But on TV
it's all like, he keeps it small.

208
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,780
He kind of, he kind of brings it in.

209
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,440
And there's something about the scale
that it's really interesting to me when

210
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:27,160
you see somebody do both, you know,
I mean, do you wonder what I wonder.

211
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,073
You always said

212
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,150
yes. He says when they're, you
know, he just says it's so little,

213
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:35,290
you're so tight. You're so you learn,

214
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:40,030
here's the thing. The camera
goes and looks right at you.

215
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,240
And so if you were to give
a big Cheshire cat grin,

216
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:47,500
if you were to make a broad gesture
in the box, it's just too big.

217
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,670
So you just learned somewhere
along the line that, um,

218
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,910
that you, you do scale
it down because you're,

219
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,360
you're so big in this virtual space,

220
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,310
but you're bigger and the
radio, cause I always say,

221
00:14:00,311 --> 00:14:01,870
I tell people like when you're
performing on the radio,

222
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:05,350
it's like you're in front of a camera
and the camera's always on close up and

223
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:09,860
like use your inside voice,
you know, kind of, you,

224
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,440
you had to get the desk thing. Well that
was just in the first season. I mean,

225
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,420
well, the concede of it was we couldn't
figure out how to put me on TV. Like,

226
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,410
like, where should I be or should I
even be, should you ever see me at all?

227
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:24,970
And then it seemed kind of kind of,
um, artsy that you would never see me.

228
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,833
You know what I mean?

229
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,360
My favorite version of the different ways
that you would see me would be that I

230
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:33,340
would walk into each story at the end,
like Rod Serling and go man in a woman,

231
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:38,920
you know, but I felt like I
could perform that too. Um,

232
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:42,820
but was it a scale thing? Where was it
that you needed to feel somehow? No, no.

233
00:14:42,821 --> 00:14:45,790
We put, we did the desk cause we just
thought like after trying to run a week,

234
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,120
we shot all sorts of different
things as little tests and, and,

235
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:52,670
and all of them trying to run away
from conventions of a host on TV.

236
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,250
But truthfully, like everything's
been done. If you're a host on TV,

237
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,860
like you know your own
real desk that's been done,

238
00:14:57,861 --> 00:14:59,540
you in a card just talking to the camera,

239
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,100
you're walking down the
street with the subject.

240
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:04,910
You just like every sort of casual
and non casual version has been done.

241
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,150
And so we thought, well let's instead
of running away from the convention,

242
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,680
so let's run towards them. What's,

243
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:14,210
take the corniest convention and let's
do the desk and the suit and the mug and

244
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:18,590
like a microphone and let's like have a
build one of those desks that only exist

245
00:15:18,591 --> 00:15:22,610
on television that doesn't exist in
nature. That's like those shiny desks.

246
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:27,350
And um, and then let's put it outside.
Let's just put it somewhere random.

247
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,910
We had never, I had never seen the,

248
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,520
there's apparently a Monte python
thing where they were the anchor man is

249
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:34,670
outside. I didn't know that you see
even that had been done. But um,

250
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,440
so we would just take it to incredibly,

251
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:39,560
like the idea is like one day it's in a
factory for and the next day it's by a

252
00:15:39,561 --> 00:15:44,290
nuclear power station and you know, and
so that was the idea. It was just let's,

253
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,940
let's make something big in
photographic, but why, why,

254
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,660
why the trouble you said you couldn't
figure out how to be on TV because like

255
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:56,180
this American life like to identify it
has like weirdly just it's imprinting a

256
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,260
kind of intimacy and
very many people I know.

257
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,780
And it's something weirdly anti intimate
about the image that we ended up making

258
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:06,080
with me in it. And in the
second season because of that.

259
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,540
Instead of shooting it that way, we took,

260
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,280
we bought a lot of flip camera for $149
at best buy and we shot all the things

261
00:16:13,281 --> 00:16:16,190
of me with that and we just go on the
subway and I would just shoot myself

262
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,650
talking to the camera and saying
my thing. What about [inaudible]

263
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,500
audience?

264
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,500
I sent that the the radio audience is
a completely different audience in a

265
00:16:25,991 --> 00:16:30,130
consistently different mood than the
television audience do you think?

266
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,091
I mean I do.

267
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:34,700
I different like as in different people
or different when there are different

268
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,141
people,

269
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:38,710
but commercial television tends to get a
slightly older group and radio at least

270
00:16:38,711 --> 00:16:41,920
this radio, the Miss American
life and radio does this.

271
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,620
It gets a bit of a younger
audience, but beyond that,

272
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:49,650
I think the radio audience gets
the impression that they know,

273
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:55,630
you know you and the TV
audience because of the staring,

274
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:00,700
they will respect you. They'll do yo,
so you want TV thing that is there,

275
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,080
they'll notice you.

276
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,980
They don't presume to begin or
have a conversation with you.

277
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,220
Whereas on the radio, they presume
to have a conversation with,

278
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,080
you're saying from your experience
being an MPR and being on ABC,

279
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,130
you know where we see it actually we
sort of see the flip side of that is when

280
00:17:17,131 --> 00:17:21,480
we take over Terry Gross a
spot, uh, Fridays at three,

281
00:17:21,481 --> 00:17:25,790
which we do a couple of times a year,
you would not believe the vitriol,

282
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,420
the venomous flow of hatred as if we
have kidnapped Terry literally kidnapped

283
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:36,780
her and taken and locked her into the
closet there. Terry grows, you know,

284
00:17:36,781 --> 00:17:41,210
so it's, it's, it's a rerun show.
They've heard it already. It

285
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,860
doesn't matter. It's part of their
routine on Fridays at three. What do I do?

286
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,100
I do her. And who were these
two people and what are they

287
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,460
doing? No, no, they don't
listen to it. They just like,

288
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,943
they bite it.

289
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:00,600
I had to say that the biggest thing I've
ever done on TV was just two weeks ago.

290
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:04,140
And that is that I appeared on the
Khobar Rapport and I'd been on,

291
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:08,430
I'd been on the daily show, had been
on Letterman. I'd been on, um, on, uh,

292
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:09,660
Conan.

293
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,010
But there's something about people's
relationship to Steve and Kobe are where

294
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,900
like complete strangers walk up to me on
the street and caught me on the street

295
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:22,280
and like a lot of them and it's
like, Hey, saw you on Colbert.

296
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:25,440
They feel like they feel like it
was us against him or something.

297
00:18:25,441 --> 00:18:27,500
I can name such a like they'll like, like,

298
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:31,050
like they just want me to know like they
watch Cole Bear and they were with me,

299
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:31,991
you know, and,

300
00:18:31,991 --> 00:18:35,410
and it was a cute because you survived
Cobra or with you because they,

301
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:40,200
you're part of the cold beer club both
like I survived it. They're like, hey,

302
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,690
you did okay sort of
with go bear, you know,

303
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,310
like very much just like it was like I
was in a boxing match with Steven Coe

304
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,250
bear and, and they, they
appreciated it and, and,

305
00:18:50,251 --> 00:18:54,210
and they want to tell me about it like
in a way that I've found really Gulf way.

306
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:58,750
The maths may be our last question
is, is, is the glamour question. Um,

307
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,970
there has been for years associated
with being on TV. There's this sense of,

308
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,160
Ooh, wow. Kind of thing.

309
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,520
And then radio was sort of a other thing
you could do if you were in a car or

310
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:15,720
cutting carrots. And I, I get the sense
that that's actually switched a bit.

311
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:20,700
So Steve Cobe bear could
almost have, has a relief.

312
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,960
I don't know why I say this,

313
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:26,000
it's Steve called Berra who does
wonderful sight gags and you know,

314
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:30,780
but there is something about that show
even more than the other one that does

315
00:19:30,781 --> 00:19:32,460
seem like,

316
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:37,580
I don't know why it seems like
the best radio that I hear

317
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,940
people have such a personal relationship
with him in a way that, that,

318
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,610
I dunno. I mean I feel that way
about a handful of shows, you know,

319
00:19:45,611 --> 00:19:47,680
I feel that way about,
about the draw, you know,

320
00:19:47,681 --> 00:19:50,230
I felt that way about Friday
night lights, you know,

321
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,050
greatest show on television
except for the second season,

322
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,680
except for the one thing, the second
season was a downer. Low water. I mean,

323
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,530
I mean, they're good. They're good.
I mean, I guess I'm saying like, I,

324
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,280
you know, I feel that about other things
in television besides Stephen Colbert.

325
00:20:03,281 --> 00:20:06,130
I think that's the bond you feel
with any show that you really love.

326
00:20:06,131 --> 00:20:06,964
You feel like you're,

327
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:12,170
I was in the subway and I saw an inspector
from the wire that Millie mean guy,

328
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:17,360
um, who, um, the Polish guy who
wants to buy the, uh, yeah, yeah,

329
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:21,060
I'll try to, I saw of the actor
who plays val check and I, I,

330
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:24,510
he was sitting there and I was holding
the pole and I thought, I just,

331
00:20:24,511 --> 00:20:28,340
I guess I'll honor him by my quiet
gaze. I won't say anything, you know,

332
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,970
and my heart was beating and everything.

333
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,620
I was thinking I was going to tell my
wife to get you eyes on this. Uh, and um,

334
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,840
but I didn't.

335
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,040
Okay.

336
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,810
If I'd seen Steven Cole bear or if I
didn't know you and saw you or you,

337
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,833
I think

338
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,870
he says with the state, find it
more approachable. I think I'd find,

339
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:54,220
I think I might dare, I might say, oh, hi.

340
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,650
Or something like that. Yeah,
it's true. Well that's good to,

341
00:20:56,651 --> 00:20:59,970
on the radio if you're performing it
right, you're exactly human size. Like,

342
00:20:59,971 --> 00:21:02,800
like if you're on the radio, if you're
doing it correctly, I think you are,

343
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:06,130
there's a one to one scale. Just you
said really though that it was myth,

344
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:11,110
mythic and epic too though that moment
in that story. Yeah, no, I, you know,

345
00:21:11,111 --> 00:21:12,760
that's true. I guess it's a contradiction.

346
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,370
[inaudible] I, you know, I
think one of the things that,

347
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,810
that this American life did was they
made true stories feel like fairy tales.

348
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,730
Like every, and it has
to do with the music.

349
00:21:24,731 --> 00:21:28,660
It has to do with the way they're
constructed and with the surprise and the

350
00:21:28,661 --> 00:21:33,280
characters that you meet, it's, it feels
like a, it feels like a fairy tale.

351
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:36,280
It feels like, like you're
entering me on TV and on radio.

352
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:41,230
I mean mostly on the radio. I'm thinking
straight, early, early, you know,

353
00:21:41,231 --> 00:21:44,410
just that show coming out of
everything else that was at that time.

354
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,710
Suddenly these characters did
seem large. They seemed like, um,

355
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:53,200
sort of epic and huge and, but
yet sort of like in the bed,

356
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:54,070
embedded in their breasts,

357
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:57,610
the same sort of desires and fascinations
and fears that the rest of us had.

358
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,460
So that was new for me to hear that.
So I don't know. I mean there the,

359
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:06,040
it gets confusing when you
use the techniques of fiction
storytelling techniques

360
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:11,041
of movie making with true stories you
can invest true reality with a sense of

361
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:17,350
largeness and a sense of sweep that that
you would only expect to see like in a

362
00:22:17,351 --> 00:22:20,620
movie theater. That's kind of
the cool thing about it I think.

363
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:25,750
And then there's the wire.
Thank you all for coming.

364
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,673
Thanks for coming up.

365
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,580
[inaudible] want to thank
Carrie Hellman for helping.

366
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:40,090
Definitely want to think of green space
people from making it very cool space

367
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,870
available. Green space means the
part of the building at WDC. Yeah,

368
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,890
we have live events which is where that
just was inaugurated that very week.

369
00:22:47,891 --> 00:22:49,990
So I was already logged your roll out.

370
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:54,490
Maybe do one of those and also to
the hungry marching band because um,

371
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,730
they made a lot of big loud
noise. Easy. Yes. Thanks.

372
00:22:57,731 --> 00:23:00,610
And also we want to thank the people
that help make radio lab possible.

373
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:04,930
That would be number one. This is just
Lone Alpha p Sloan Foundation number two,

374
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:10,100
Mr Corporation for public broadcasting
and number three Mr National Science.

375
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,350
Yes, that a foundation. Then I'm
Jad Abumrad I Robert College.

376
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,010
Thanks for listening.
