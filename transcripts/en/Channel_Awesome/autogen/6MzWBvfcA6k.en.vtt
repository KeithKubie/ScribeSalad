00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:07.900 align:start position:0%
because like that that six months six
 

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.930 align:start position:0%
because like that that six months six
months<00:11:07.990><c> ahead</c><00:11:08.290><c> it's</c><00:11:08.920><c> established</c><00:11:09.520><c> that</c><00:11:09.610><c> coast</c>

is no longer the director of shield and
 

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
is no longer the director of shield and
obviously<00:11:13.240><c> they've</c><00:11:13.420><c> grown</c><00:11:13.690><c> since</c><00:11:13.990><c> then</c><00:11:14.200><c> and</c>

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:14.610 align:start position:0%
obviously they've grown since then and
 

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:31.470 align:start position:0%
obviously they've grown since then and
basically<00:11:29.730><c> but</c><00:11:30.730><c> yeah</c><00:11:30.910><c> I</c><00:11:30.940><c> didn't</c><00:11:31.180><c> really</c><00:11:31.360><c> like</c>
