00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.480
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Hi there.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.530
I am Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.580
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And I'm Dan Galpin.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.560
And once again, we are here with another Friday
Games Review.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.270
This is again a selection from your choices
from the moderator page.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.270
This is the top five nominated games for us
to look at this week.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:33.760
With us is also Alex over here who is acting
as producer and he's also going to be helping

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.910
us with the reviews.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.910
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.910
Here, let's scooch over.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:37.910
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's a good idea.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:38.910
So, you know, Ian...

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.910
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.030
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...what are we drinking today?

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.239
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, you know, a lot of people
were asking me are you still going to drink

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.589
because you're having a, you know, this show
is so much later.

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:49.589
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Exactly.

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:50.659
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And I'm like, "Dude, lunchtime."

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:51.659
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:52.659
This is even better.

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:58.140
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But I will say this I pulled
what we call, you know, our team pulling a

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.140
Galpin.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.140
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.859
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Last night--I was up all night
doing something that wasn't actually all that

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:04.859
useful.

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:06.190
I was, you know, I was actually making that
intro video that you just saw.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.210
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: But isn't that intro video awesome?

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.341
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I love it but...

00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:09.740
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It is certainly worthy of my name
[INDISTINCT]

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely but...

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.380
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, I'm totally pleased to be so
in any way.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.729
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, because Dan will do this
to be like, you know, God, I was up 14 hours

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.480
straight last night and I made this, you know,
model of The Great Wall of China for my dental

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.529
fillings and it didn't actually...

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:26.219
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That was an amazing model [INDISTINCT]
I mean.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:27.840
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.479
So, the upshot is...

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:30.989
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...we're both tired...

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:31.989
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yes.

00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:33.899
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...because I pulled the Galpin,
he is a Galpin.

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:34.899
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:35.899
Exactly.

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:37.929
&gt;&gt; Ni-LEWIS: But that's--we're not going to
let that stop us.

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:38.929
It's noon.

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:39.929
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:43.820
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And that means a lunchtime beer
but I will say this because I pulled a Galpin,

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.519
I was unable to pull a Lewis--a Ni-Lewis...

00:01:47.519 --> 00:01:48.519
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:51.550
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...and stop by some awesome liquor
store for beer so, I had to pull what's in

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.550
the fridge.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.399
Fortunately, we had a pretty good selection.

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:01.319
From my--what I consider my adopted hometown
of Renton, Washington.

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:02.849
We have Redhook ESB.

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:04.049
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.049
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Great brewery.

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.049
We've both been there.

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.049
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.060
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Not at the same time although
we did eat at The Herbfarm right next door.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.070
They have a wonderful patio and you just sit
out there next to the brewery...

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.070
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.319
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...eat some broths, drink some
ESB and life is good.

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.840
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's what we need to bring actually
is some broths onto the show to go with the

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.840
beer.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.770
And that would just make the show that much
better.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.770
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's right bro--broth.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:30.970
So, we're drinking ESB.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.890
Now I brought a [INDISTINCT] for Daniel Pham
our engineer just in case.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:36.890
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.870
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But I have something super special
for...

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:39.870
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Ooh.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.129
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: There you go.

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.129
&gt;&gt; Hey, guys.

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:43.129
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Hey.

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:44.129
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Hey.

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.129
Nice.

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:46.779
I have something super special for producer
Alex.

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:47.779
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Ooh.

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:52.090
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Because Alex didn't get to go
to Mobile World Congress this year.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.810
So, I brought him back a taste of Barcelona.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:56.810
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:57.810
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's right.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.950
Estrella Damm.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.120
&gt;&gt; GAPIN: Damm.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.010
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: The Damm stands for damn, Estrella
again?

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.010
Seriously?

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.930
You guys don't serve anything else in this
town?

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:07.930
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:08.930
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Pretty much.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.930
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All righty.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:10.930
Let's take a look...

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:11.930
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Is that [INDISTINCT], right?

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:12.930
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's right.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:13.930
Okay.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.400
Well, now we've wasted a lot of time and the
haters are going to hate on us so, let's get

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.400
right to it.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.400
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: All right.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.430
So, the first game we're going to look at
and here yeah, we have our exciting intro

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.430
graphics here.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.430
And I could hit it one more.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.430
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, no.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.430
Really?

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.430
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.430
Yeah, and...

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.430
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.430
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That one.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.430
There you go.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.430
Oh, all right.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.430
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.430
All right.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.430
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: All right.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.430
So, the first game we're going to be looking
at is Agent Shooter.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.829
And actually go to the next slide so that
we can take a look at Agent Shooter's--there

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:39.829
we are.

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:40.829
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.719
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, Agent The Shooter lets you
know from the beginning that it's ad-supported

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:47.159
just in case you were wondering whether or
not it was free or paid or not.

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.510
It's right there in the title.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.859
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It also lets you know quite clearly
from the feature graphic that this is done

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:56.359
but like one dude who has GIMP.

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:57.739
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.159
Someone who's knows how to use the filters
and now they're Photoshop or GIMP but it certainly

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.159
looks like GIMP to me.

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:05.219
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:09.389
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And, yeah, but that being said,
it's actually quite a lot of fun to play I

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:10.389
think.

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:11.389
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It really is.

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.920
You know, I felt like this is just the kind
of game that Android needed.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.920
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.920
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's a shooter game.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.920
It's...

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.920
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.920
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's basically like a...

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.920
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: A shooting gallery game.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.000
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, yeah, it's a shooting gallery
like Are 51 or something, right?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.270
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You're just going through and
the multi-touch makes it really cool.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.520
You can actually multi-touch different targets.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.450
But it's completely unrealistic...

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.911
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I figure I just have...

00:04:29.911 --> 00:04:30.911
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...I think.

00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:33.510
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I think I have just five guns in
my hand actually is what I look at it.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.510
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That makes sense.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.510
One for each finger.

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.510
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, one--I'm--exactly.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.510
I'm a shooting alien, that's what I am.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.510
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:39.510
Your fist has five guns.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.510
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's right.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.510
Exactly.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.510
Exactly.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.510
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Nice.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.510
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Well, that's a Galpin.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.910
So, we have here the title screen of Agent
Shooter and, you know, there's really not

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.290
much to say about this other than my God,
there's a lot of stuff on here and where is

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.290
it?

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.290
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Where's the images?

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.310
Are we waiting for the images to load?

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.310
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It felt like I...

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.310
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Surprising enough, yeah, yeah.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.560
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I actually said you're looking
at it for about two seconds thinking this--no,

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.560
this is it.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.560
Okay.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.830
Well, there you go.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.220
But that being said, you know, you can get
right into the game here.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.500
And now you see I've unlocked episode one
which shows you how much I've actually managed

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.930
to play on this tablet.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.910
But let's go start this.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.160
And again, the game itself is really, you
know, from a--it's not really designed for

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.630
a tablet, let's just be honest here in terms
of graphical fidelity.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.010
But as I said, it's actually fun to play and,
you know, I usually play with two fingers.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.450
But it's actually almost like, you know, being,
you know, two guns.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.060
It's somewhat realistic and other than I could
never shoot this well.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.560
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, I actually feel like the
graphics on here totally remind me of Area

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.320
51 and this is like that, you know, state
of the art for arcade machines in the late

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.830
'90s sort of graphics.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.330
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.600
And, you know, it is actually--it is actually
really fun, you know.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.600
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It doesn't give a lot.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.540
You can see that you got the accelerometer
going, you've got the ad at the bottom.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.900
It's all pretty unobtrusive.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.040
Now it, you know, on a tablet, I was going
say that is really, really small.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.040
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.120
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, it's really, really nice and
you get a new high score.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.770
It asks your name all the time.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.160
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Fair enough.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.650
Now one thing that I noticed immediately about
this game is that they do allow you to shoot

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:15.740
multiple things at once.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.139
So, you tap multiple targets.

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:18.139
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:21.130
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But there is one problem and
it's tough to tell on the video because as

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.130
you know...

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.130
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.470
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...the man won't let us play
sound from these games but if you did hear

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.970
sound from it, you would notice immediately
that it clips really badly.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:31.970
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.460
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: They've cranked up the audio
for each individual gunshot and that means

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.640
that playing multiple shots at the same time
is sure to clip.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.720
This is tough especially if you're just trying
to crank out an Android game quickly.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.140
You're probably using SoundPool.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.640
That would be my choice for this type of game.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.640
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Sure, yeah, absolutely.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.300
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: The problem is you've got to
do one of two things.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:56.220
You either have to make sure that your volumes
are normalize so that none of your sounds

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.330
are going to clip even if play five or six
over the top of each other or you need to

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.140
go the extra mile and add some effects.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.180
I mean the thing that you need for this--this
is what we use in broadcastings, what we use

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.030
in music, what programs to use is something
called the compressor limiter.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:16.240
It's a very, very easy thing to make mathematically.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.090
I actually wrote an article in Game Programming
Gems 8, I think...

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.090
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.950
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...on the compressor limiter
that I wrote for Halo 3.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:32.990
We actually cranked that thing and used it
for a radio effect but what you want to do

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:39.830
is get it so--the high parts of the sound
just kind of roll off...

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:40.830
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:45.830
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...so, that you don't ever blow
your eardrums out or in this case, blow this

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.720
blow the speakers because you're clipping
so hard.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.770
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, and I think it's a, you know,
you can control attenuation in SoundPool.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:52.770
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.450
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, that's, you know, and that's
the other way to do it is you can, you know,

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:58.380
given the fact that you have it, you know
a maximum of the sounds that you're going

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.380
to be playing at once.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.380
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.990
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It's a little tricky because SoundPool
actually doesn't give you any knowledge that

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.950
your sound is really playing and necessarily.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:10.150
So, you do--it is a little bit tricky but
I think that the easier thing to do is to

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:14.860
try to lower the sound volume a little and
or, you know, you could go the extra mile

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.690
and actually write your own mix or with effect
process or you can do it.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, but at the very least,
you know, do what you used to do when we didn't

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:25.140
have good computers to play games on and write
yourself a fake compressor.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:29.759
So, basically what you're trying to do is
based on how many sounds you've played...

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:30.759
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:34.520
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...within a certain period of
time, just drop the volume down.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.620
You drop it down a certain amount for each
sound and then you let it come back up slowly,

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:46.760
you know, just write a little, you know, windowed
average engine to do that.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.069
So, but the main thing is, you know, make
sure especially if you're going to be playing

00:08:51.069 --> 00:08:52.149
a lot of sounds, you know...

00:08:52.149 --> 00:08:53.149
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:08:53.149 --> 00:08:55.329
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...this would have been very
easy to test and surprising to me that the

00:08:55.329 --> 00:08:57.239
developer let it shift and just stay.

00:08:57.239 --> 00:09:01.610
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Well, you know, again this is a--this
game is--it's really cool.

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:04.569
It's clearly one guy and, clearly, you know,
that was not his priority with sound effects

00:09:04.569 --> 00:09:05.569
I mean.

00:09:05.569 --> 00:09:06.569
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's true.

00:09:06.569 --> 00:09:07.569
That's true.

00:09:07.569 --> 00:09:10.040
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: But the image is really fun and,
you know, again there's just a lot of UI stuff

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.180
here.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.380
You know, it's hard to tell how much this
is tablet specifics and I only got to play

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.589
this on the tablet.

00:09:14.589 --> 00:09:21.050
Yeah, one thing that's interesting is that
it's actually sort of a wizard that goes on

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:26.990
as you're going through the levels and it
is a little bit jarring given the kind of

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.120
composition of different elements that we
see here on the screen at once.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.529
We have one like some Android elements, some
Bitmaps, some sort of Bitmap creations of

00:09:34.529 --> 00:09:39.839
similar Android elements and, you know, it
does feel like there's--at this point it will

00:09:39.839 --> 00:09:43.950
make sense to actually bring in a designer
and have them take a look at all of these

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.959
intro screens because the game itself is really,
really fun and you don't want someone to go

00:09:47.959 --> 00:09:51.810
through at the first screen of the game be
"Wow, this feels really amateurish.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.600
We should, you know, I'm not interested."

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.519
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, you just have to ask yourself
a question "Are you selling to the public

00:09:57.519 --> 00:09:59.389
or are you selling to like your friends and
family."

00:09:59.389 --> 00:10:02.019
Because your mom doesn't really care, right?

00:10:02.019 --> 00:10:04.020
But anyone who doesn't know you...

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.020
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.139
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...that--well, yeah, your mom
sure but we all know.

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:08.139
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:10:08.139 --> 00:10:09.310
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: …digs that.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:13.959
The problem is anyone that just downloads
this game, and remember they probably downloaded

00:10:13.959 --> 00:10:15.790
several games.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:17.839
They're probably looking for a good game.

00:10:17.839 --> 00:10:22.709
They're probably going to give you a few seconds
to prove yourself and unless they're really

00:10:22.709 --> 00:10:28.350
looking for this specific game, they're probably
going to be a little turned off by the presentation,

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.600
the production values.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.269
Especially when there's a lot of games out
there that are just as free as this one and

00:10:34.269 --> 00:10:37.009
are just as fun as this one that have better
production values.

00:10:37.009 --> 00:10:38.089
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, I know.

00:10:38.089 --> 00:10:41.800
And another minor thing, you know, I would
love to see, you know, the Hallow theme at

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.800
least turned on.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.800
You know, it's good.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.779
You actually--guys, you actually are, you
know, don't have the compatibilities and,

00:10:47.779 --> 00:10:50.490
you know, all that kind of stuff on there,
but it's always kind of sad when you're on

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.930
a tablet these days and you're seeing all
those, you know, Gingerbread theme, you know,

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:54.930
sitting on there.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:55.930
So...

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:56.930
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's true.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:57.930
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's all right.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:58.930
And they're not so easy to do.

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:04.089
Just buy in and going in and actually making
sure you're targeting the most recent [INDISTINCT]

00:11:04.089 --> 00:11:09.550
levels and just triggering the Hallow theme
for in this case, you want dark.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:10.550
But which is the default I believe.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:14.820
But that's pretty much it, you know, and I'm
not going to go into kind of great detail

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:15.820
here but...

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:16.820
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:17.820
No.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.820
It's a fun game.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:19.820
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:20.820
It really was.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:21.820
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: The mechanics--I don't know why
there aren't more games like this.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:22.820
This is a lot of fun.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:23.820
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:24.820
And actually...

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:25.820
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:26.820
Let's go ahead and move on.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.040
&gt;&gt; Before you do, YouTube would like to know
what you guys thought of the music for that

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.040
game.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:34.269
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, the truth is that we played
it with the sound off.

00:11:34.269 --> 00:11:35.269
Except for the--wait.

00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:36.269
No.

00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:37.269
That makes no sense.

00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:38.269
We didn't play it with sound off.

00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:39.269
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:40.779
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: We played it with--I don't know.

00:11:40.779 --> 00:11:41.919
The guns were clipping really hard.

00:11:41.919 --> 00:11:42.919
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:11:42.919 --> 00:11:43.999
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, I don't remember music.

00:11:43.999 --> 00:11:44.999
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:11:44.999 --> 00:11:45.999
There was music.

00:11:45.999 --> 00:11:47.160
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Was there music?

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.440
&gt;&gt; I assume there was.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.440
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Okay.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.970
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Look at this.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:55.819
I love this--it's like just beautiful demonstration
of exactly where me and Dan are.

00:11:55.819 --> 00:11:56.819
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:11:56.819 --> 00:11:57.819
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: At 12:00 PM.

00:11:57.819 --> 00:11:58.819
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:58.819 --> 00:12:00.339
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: By 2:00, we're rolling.

00:12:00.339 --> 00:12:01.339
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's right.

00:12:01.339 --> 00:12:04.120
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right now though, we're like
[makes sound] yeah.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.120
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: [makes sound].

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.120
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.120
All right.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.120
Come on.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.120
Come on.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.120
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: All right.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.120
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Head in the game, dude.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.120
Head in the game.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.120
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: All right.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.120
So we're going to go next to Sliceween.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.120
&gt;&gt; NI_LEWIS: Sliceween.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.120
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: All right.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.470
I'm just going to go...

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:18.470
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Just--yeah.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:19.470
Just a little early for Halloween.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:20.839
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It is just a little early, but
you know...

00:12:20.839 --> 00:12:21.839
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's right.

00:12:21.839 --> 00:12:22.839
It's almost October.

00:12:22.839 --> 00:12:23.839
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: This game actually has...

00:12:23.839 --> 00:12:24.839
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know...

00:12:24.839 --> 00:12:25.839
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...amazing production values on
here, on the [INDISTINCT]

00:12:25.839 --> 00:12:27.069
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It is pretty good.

00:12:27.069 --> 00:12:28.069
Yeah.

00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:29.069
It's a nice game.

00:12:29.069 --> 00:12:32.999
I know, this is one of those games that I
think it was being kind of the Adobe Illustrator

00:12:32.999 --> 00:12:34.839
game where the...

00:12:34.839 --> 00:12:36.069
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:40.829
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...graphics--it's like obviously
somebody made the graphics that has real talent.

00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:45.129
You know, the gothic graphic designer, but
then they made like one frame.

00:12:45.129 --> 00:12:48.920
You know, there's no actual animation, there's
just a bunch of [INDISTINCT] transformations.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:49.920
&gt;&gt;GALPIN: Yes.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.920
Yeah.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.800
Well, you know, clearly they--and this is--again,
this is--certainly if you have the choice

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.649
between having really, really awesome, you
know, a single really awesome frame and none

00:12:59.649 --> 00:13:00.769
of it, this is the way to go.

00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:01.769
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely, that's true.

00:13:01.769 --> 00:13:05.740
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: But it is what differentiates it
from some of the other physics games out there

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:06.740
that have been really, really successful.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:07.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.209
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I'm like--and, you know, right
now, the bar's pretty high in physics games.

00:13:10.209 --> 00:13:11.209
People have a lot of choices.

00:13:11.209 --> 00:13:12.870
There's been a lot of really successful games.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:13.870
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:16.410
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And so, you know, again, great
presentation, but, you know, the kind of the

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:17.490
bar has to be up here.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:18.490
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:22.879
And as far as upping the bar I--well, you
can see with the game play.

00:13:22.879 --> 00:13:26.240
I didn't feel like it had a significant amount
to offer.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.629
I mean I feel this is exactly like heaven
and hell.

00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:30.629
Wow.

00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:31.629
Really?

00:13:31.629 --> 00:13:33.059
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: But--yeah.

00:13:33.059 --> 00:13:34.779
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:13:34.779 --> 00:13:39.870
And so basically the idea is, you're going
to slice through one or more pieces of, I

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:40.910
don't know, wood I guess.

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:41.910
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:45.629
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And that's going to make your
bat roll around until he falls into the haunted

00:13:45.629 --> 00:13:46.629
house.

00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:47.629
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Right.

00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:50.369
And you have to get--both get the bat into
the haunted house and you have to, you know,

00:13:50.369 --> 00:13:51.959
collect as many pumpkins as possible.

00:13:51.959 --> 00:13:52.959
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:13:52.959 --> 00:13:58.260
And like I'm saying this--we saw a game last
year, it was called Hellrider or Angels and

00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.260
Demons or...

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.260
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Something like that.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.260
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Something like that.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.899
One of those Dan Brown type titles.

00:14:02.899 --> 00:14:08.610
And it was exactly this game, but it had like
an extra twist because there were angels that

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:12.230
behave the way the bat does and then there
were demons that did something completely

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:15.430
different that escapes me at the moment.

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.870
So, nothing wrong with the game playing, it
was certainly fun.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:22.220
It just doesn't really bring anything new
and as you can see the amount of animation

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.440
is really low.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:29.590
So, you're not really tempted to identify
with this bat or fall in love with the bat

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:34.399
or think of them the way that you would, let's
say as, you know...

00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:38.499
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Well, you know, and again, a lot
of times these games have actually gone through

00:14:38.499 --> 00:14:42.610
a whole bunch of phases of, you know, modification
with characters and part of the reason that

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:45.699
they modify as well as characters is people
actually connect with those characters, and

00:14:45.699 --> 00:14:48.189
a lot of people identify with those characters
strangely enough.

00:14:48.189 --> 00:14:52.750
Even what you're doing is flinging those characters
into a brick wall, you're still somehow identifying

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:53.750
those characters and...

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:54.750
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:55.750
Absolutely.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:56.750
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And so, you know what, that's always
nice to.

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.269
And yeah, I think that is kind of what the
game is missing is animation.

00:14:59.269 --> 00:15:00.619
But--because the game is otherwise quite good.

00:15:00.619 --> 00:15:01.679
This is another thing.

00:15:01.679 --> 00:15:03.550
You know, this dialogue is cool, wanted.

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:05.369
I'd love to see it be a Hallow dialogue into.

00:15:05.369 --> 00:15:06.369
I'd love it.

00:15:06.369 --> 00:15:10.019
I love to see it actually, you know, in this
case, be a theme dialogue.

00:15:10.019 --> 00:15:11.850
It makes sense to have these things kind of
themed around the game.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:12.850
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, you know...

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.089
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: You can see with all the other
presentation [INDISTINCT]

00:15:14.089 --> 00:15:15.676
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, you know what--we were
just talking--Rachel and I were just talking

00:15:15.676 --> 00:15:22.339
about this last hour in the app review that
there are some apps where you can tell that

00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:26.089
they had a great designer and then you can
also tell that they ran out of time before

00:15:26.089 --> 00:15:27.089
they shipped.

00:15:27.089 --> 00:15:30.839
And you can just map out exactly where they
ran out of time.

00:15:30.839 --> 00:15:35.480
Now, in this case, I'm not sure if it's running
out of time or just not caring about it.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.949
Obviously the main screens all look great.

00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:39.949
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:43.439
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, why that random dialogue
popping up?

00:15:43.439 --> 00:15:44.890
That just looks ugly.

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:45.890
I don't know.

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:47.029
I can't explain that.

00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:48.300
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That was bad.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.300
Totally.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.300
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yes.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.300
It was.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.300
You suck at this game.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.300
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I totally do.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.300
I totally do.

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.869
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, fun game; could be better.

00:15:56.869 --> 00:16:03.909
I think that there's other games out there
that are equally good and maybe more interesting.

00:16:03.909 --> 00:16:07.879
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: But, you know, it's certainly--it's
also interesting to get a Halloween themed

00:16:07.879 --> 00:16:10.699
game and, you know, at this time of year,
but I think it's one of those things, you

00:16:10.699 --> 00:16:13.561
know, the team is always looking for strange
things to have around Halloween.

00:16:13.561 --> 00:16:16.670
I think that might resonate with, you know,
the team, you never know when in terms of

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:17.670
when you're looking at stuff.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:21.569
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I wouldn't be surprised if Google
Play featured this game.

00:16:21.569 --> 00:16:22.569
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:16:22.569 --> 00:16:24.649
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's history because it's--there's
certainly nothing wrong with it.

00:16:24.649 --> 00:16:28.180
I mean, if you're going to ask me, "Are you
going to spend your hard earned dollars on

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.180
this?"

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:33.250
Well, no, but I guess all I'm really spending
is my hard earned time.

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:37.110
Still no, but I could see that some people
would.

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:42.519
Now, speaking of featuring it, they do have
a reasonable good feature graphic...

00:16:42.519 --> 00:16:43.519
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:16:43.519 --> 00:16:44.519
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...in the sense that it's legible.

00:16:44.519 --> 00:16:48.720
And when you make that thing very, very small,
you will still be able to read the word "Sliceween."

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.899
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:16:49.899 --> 00:16:52.019
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's a little crowded, honestly.

00:16:52.019 --> 00:16:53.019
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:16:53.019 --> 00:16:57.309
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know, got the moon, you got
the haunted house, got the, you know, that

00:16:57.309 --> 00:17:01.489
haunted house stuff isn't really going to
come through, those pumpkins in the bottom

00:17:01.489 --> 00:17:06.280
are--I mean why are they even there, you know,
this is one of those things where...

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.120
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:10.959
In terms of the features, I think that you're
certainly going to see the bigger pumpkin

00:17:10.959 --> 00:17:11.959
on the bottom.

00:17:11.959 --> 00:17:12.959
You know, it's okay.

00:17:12.959 --> 00:17:16.110
You know, I think the bats are just really
quick noise at the top, I agree, but it looks

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:17.110
good on the [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, and you're going to have

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:21.799
a really hard time seeing that that's even
a bat because if you look at contrast between

00:17:21.799 --> 00:17:25.279
the black bat wings and the red sky, it's...

00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:26.760
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It's a little bit too low, yeah.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:27.760
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.580
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It should definitely go with--you
look at the kind of bottom of the red sky

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:33.169
that you have here in the game, you can switch
back to it--to the tablet for a second.

00:17:33.169 --> 00:17:34.169
Actually you can.

00:17:34.169 --> 00:17:35.169
It's a good question though.

00:17:35.169 --> 00:17:36.169
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: No.

00:17:36.169 --> 00:17:37.169
I can now.

00:17:37.169 --> 00:17:38.169
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: You can, yeah.

00:17:38.169 --> 00:17:39.680
So you look--if you look, you see there's
this very bright orange sky at the bottom.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.390
That'd actually be kind of a better color
to be against the back of the bat.

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:43.480
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.480
It's tough.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.480
Let me...

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.480
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: In terms of [INDISTINCT] graphic.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:51.530
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: The main thing is that when you're
selling this game to people, you first need

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:56.830
to sell it to our merchandising team and that's
very, very important.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:01.059
Because if they see something, if they're
like, "Well, if we put this in store window,

00:18:01.059 --> 00:18:02.059
it's not going to sell."

00:18:02.059 --> 00:18:03.059
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:18:03.059 --> 00:18:04.210
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Then they're going to back off.

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:11.650
And this is--you know, there's nothing exactly
wrong with it, but it could use a once over

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:17.460
by someone who knows how to put together an
ad as opposed to just like a collage of game

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.460
elements.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.460
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.460
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.240
So, I think that's about it for Sliceween
right now.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.240
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.639
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You can always revisit it later
if we don't run out of time.

00:18:26.639 --> 00:18:27.690
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's right.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:32.250
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, I think we're going to look
at Candy Racer next.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:43.030
Now Candy Racer is a much better example of
a feature graphic in some ways and maybe not

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.370
quite as good in other ways.

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:52.020
The--you know, it's got one clean graphic
that makes the game look fun.

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:53.020
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yes.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:56.870
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Arguably more fun that it actually
is.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:01.520
The Candy Racer logo is beautiful and big.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.550
It needs to be a little bit bigger.

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:03.550
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:06.250
It could be a little bit bigger and it--you
know, and it's great having the developers'

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:09.820
names there, but they're not going to read
it all, but that might be okay if they don't

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.720
read it all on the phone.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.720
I mean they know it's...

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.720
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.720
It's--that's not a huge deal.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.000
I mean it's not--it's not important information
in the sense that it would be a make break

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
for your buying decision.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Now, they're not feel to read free.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.091
If you do want to--you know, that's probably
the biggest thing, if you do want free to

00:19:24.091 --> 00:19:27.210
be an important element when they're, you
know, when it gets featured on the phone,

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:31.029
you know then that would definitely be something
you'd want to--you'd want to, you know, highlight

00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:34.890
a little bit more or just get rid off and
make it--you know, it will be very clear the

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:35.890
user said it's free, it's okay.

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:39.350
It's kind of a--it's a good question because
I'd--you know, making it clear to users that

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:42.690
it's free probably is going to improve the
chance to actually click on it, but I don't--I

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:43.690
don't know.

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:44.690
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's quite true.

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:47.970
Although in general, we do tend to feature
the paid version anyway, but, yeah.

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.630
So Candy Racer is--nothing wrong with this
game.

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:51.960
It's a good game.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.750
Like you said the title screen is great.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:20:01.830
I can't say enough about this, you know, you
can see that someone took a long time just

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:04.390
thinking, "What is fun about this game?

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:09.980
What is--what is the experience that I want
people to think they're having with this game?"

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:13.510
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Well, and, you know, actually the
one thing I really love the trail that's actually

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:16.200
shown behind the car and I kind of wish that
was a game element.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.200
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.490
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And then you start going fast you
could see like a little trail speed up behind

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:20.490
the car.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:21.490
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:22.490
That would be--Well, you kind of do.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:23.490
I mean there's a little particle system there.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:24.570
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: There is.

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:26.690
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: This is not, woah.

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:27.690
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I know how to deal.

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:28.690
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:29.690
But I think I maybe I have to stop tapping
on it?

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:30.690
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You have to.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:31.690
You can't tap when you're going uphill.

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:32.690
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Right.

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.779
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Little tip from producer Alex.

00:20:34.779 --> 00:20:36.759
He's a pro at Candy Racer.

00:20:36.759 --> 00:20:37.759
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:20:37.759 --> 00:20:39.620
They technically tell you this in little splash
screen...

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:42.559
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: They do.
&gt;&gt; ...at the beginning of the level but I

00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:43.559
saw the thing.

00:20:43.559 --> 00:20:44.940
It says tap to go fast and skip right passed
it.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:45.940
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:46.940
&gt;&gt; And then...

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:47.940
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's always a danger.

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:48.940
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:49.940
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:50.940
&gt;&gt; And then it actually took me three or four
tries on the second level to figure out why

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.399
it couldn't execute the loop perfectly.

00:20:53.399 --> 00:20:54.830
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:58.380
&gt;&gt; Because I was pressing down when it was
going up and then the car always flop over.

00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.380
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yup.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.420
That's exactly who does [INDISTINCT] all the
time.

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:06.149
The game is, you know, you've got a pretty
good level of challenge to it and, you know,

00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:07.470
I think the presentation is good.

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:11.580
I mean, this is actually, you know, example
of really doing a lot of things right.

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:16.000
It does play audio on the lock screen which
a little unfortunate.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.520
And it's a definitely something to look at.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:22.370
That's really, really easy to fix by looking
at whether or not your window is currently

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:23.370
active.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:28.309
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: The other thing that I just want
to mention is when you're designing games

00:21:28.309 --> 00:21:29.720
for a mobile environment.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:35.350
You have to remember that you'll very frequently
get played in environments that are not at

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:38.500
all optimal.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:44.639
And this game in particular suffers from that
because some of its screens have extremely

00:21:44.639 --> 00:21:45.940
low contrast.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:49.980
You can see this on this screen with all of
the white lettering.

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:55.049
It's very, very difficult to read if you're
at all in sunlight or if you have poor lighting

00:21:55.049 --> 00:21:59.419
conditions at all and maybe think about doing
a little bit more contrast from those.

00:21:59.419 --> 00:22:00.419
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:22:00.419 --> 00:22:04.010
It's--if the drop shadow was maybe a little
bit stronger it will be able easier to read.

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:06.990
There's also a little bit of resolution going
on here too at the screen.

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:09.750
It's just the tiny bit and too low for this
device.

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:10.750
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:11.750
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And it's noticeable.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:15.130
Another thing that we're seeing here which
is--which is interesting is, you know, I don't

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:16.649
know if we unplug it whether we see that.

00:22:16.649 --> 00:22:20.549
But there is actually letter boxing on the
right-hand side of the screen here.

00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:23.810
Which is kind of unfortunate because I don't
really see any reason why there--what the

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:24.810
needs to be there.

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:25.810
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: No.

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:28.000
It's not the kind of game that needs to be
a letter boxed at all.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
And so...

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And it's...

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...I was surprised.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.090
Let me--let me unplug the HDMI so we could
just, you know, lose the feed here.

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:34.250
I just want to see...

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:35.250
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:36.250
Okay.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:37.250
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...unplug.

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:38.250
Yeah.

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:39.250
Still somewhat letter box.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:40.250
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:41.250
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It's just letter box.

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:42.250
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:43.250
You don't get more letter box, yeah.

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:44.250
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, you know, that's what I thought.

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:45.250
So...

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:46.250
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:47.250
This is--this one other thing is really frustrating
because when you see a game like this you

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:51.389
know that what happened is they authored it
some random resolution as probably...

00:22:51.389 --> 00:22:52.389
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:22:52.389 --> 00:22:53.389
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...you know, from a different
flat form.

00:22:53.389 --> 00:22:54.389
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: No.

00:22:54.389 --> 00:22:55.389
This is...

00:22:55.389 --> 00:22:56.389
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:22:56.389 --> 00:22:57.389
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: This was--this was an AndEngine
game.

00:22:57.389 --> 00:22:58.389
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's an AndEngine Game.

00:22:58.389 --> 00:22:59.389
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:59.389 --> 00:23:00.389
It's just--it's just not typically right now.

00:23:00.389 --> 00:23:01.389
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, in that case there's no
excuse, whatsoever.

00:23:01.389 --> 00:23:02.389
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Exactly.

00:23:02.389 --> 00:23:03.389
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:23:03.389 --> 00:23:04.389
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I see.

00:23:04.389 --> 00:23:05.389
That's what I say.

00:23:05.389 --> 00:23:06.760
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: The other--no, I want to talk
about game play for just a second.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.769
And sort of revisit what you're saying about
the trail, right?

00:23:09.769 --> 00:23:18.520
So, I'm thinking to myself, why is it that
Alex, Dan and I all had exactly the same experience

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.720
which is we were like pushing on that thing
to trying get it up the hill.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.720
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:28.580
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And I think a lot of it is because
all of the feedback is when you tap on these

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:33.160
things sparks shoot [INDISTINCT] is out of
time to end and that's--to me that says go

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.519
faster.

00:23:35.519 --> 00:23:39.409
Other games have dealt with this differently
like, you know, we look at the monster truck

00:23:39.409 --> 00:23:45.500
game last week and its controls were more
center around tilting forward and back.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:49.840
And maybe having the car, you know, tilt forward
and back or something would make more sense.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:52.179
Like, "Oh, if I'm tilting into the hill its
going be slower.

00:23:52.179 --> 00:23:53.179
I don't know."

00:23:53.179 --> 00:23:54.179
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:23:54.179 --> 00:23:58.210
I think we were all subscribing in the mental
model of pushing down implies pushing down

00:23:58.210 --> 00:23:59.210
on gas.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:00.210
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:05.409
&gt;&gt; And what it actually was pushing down exert
some sort of force of gravity on the car.

00:24:05.409 --> 00:24:09.620
You can especially tell if the car is mid-air
and you push down on the screen and the car

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.309
like starts dropping even though it's in mid-air.

00:24:11.309 --> 00:24:12.309
So...

00:24:12.309 --> 00:24:14.299
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.
&gt;&gt; ...it some sort of gravitational constant

00:24:14.299 --> 00:24:16.969
thing which is not especially intuitive.

00:24:16.969 --> 00:24:17.969
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:24:17.969 --> 00:24:18.969
And it...

00:24:18.969 --> 00:24:20.900
&gt;&gt; But it is for interesting game play mechanic
once you understand this.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:21.900
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: See, that's the thing.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.100
I think the mechanic is fine.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:30.500
I think the issue is since it is non-intuitive
you have to give your players a little bit

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:35.570
more in the way of hints or explanations.

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:40.169
You know, maybe if it's a gravitational constant,
why not put a rocket on the car and pointing

00:24:40.169 --> 00:24:42.710
into the air and fire that thing every time
you push down.

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:50.419
I mean, something that will make it obvious
that I'm getting a, you know, a G-force out

00:24:50.419 --> 00:24:54.380
of this thing rather than a rotational force
on the wheels.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.380
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:58.279
I think--I think even some indicator would
be really useful too like I mean...

00:24:58.279 --> 00:24:59.279
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:24:59.279 --> 00:25:01.809
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...you kind of make it clear that
what you're doing is actually manipulating

00:25:01.809 --> 00:25:02.809
gravity because that is pretty...

00:25:02.809 --> 00:25:03.809
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:25:03.809 --> 00:25:04.809
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...close.

00:25:04.809 --> 00:25:05.809
The closest thing I can see in what you guys
are doing.

00:25:05.809 --> 00:25:07.030
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, and especially when you
think about other games of this type, you

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:08.030
know.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:10.990
For instance, one of the things that you want
to do in a lot of games is let off the gas

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:15.620
if you're--if you find yourself catching air
up a hill.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:18.000
In this game, it's exactly the opposite.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.070
If you're catching air up a hill you want
to tap so you can fall back down to the--to

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:25.789
the hill and catch those stars.

00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:27.950
So, it is a good mechanic.

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:28.950
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:29.950
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It is fun.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:30.950
It's a fun game.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:31.950
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:33.509
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But it's frustrating to learn.

00:25:33.509 --> 00:25:39.260
And I think it could be less frustrating if
there were a little bit more acknowledgement

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:40.440
that this is none-intuitive mechanic.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.440
There's...

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.440
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.850
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...something in there to give
you intuition about what's going on.

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:45.850
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:46.850
And the game is very hard.

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:47.850
I will definitely say that, you know..

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:48.850
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:51.130
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...like even just getting making
progress to level is actually so much challenging.

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:55.690
I would probably take a slight tone down of
the challenge to get through to level and

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:59.409
really focus people on getting all of the
stars.

00:25:59.409 --> 00:26:00.409
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:26:00.409 --> 00:26:03.120
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Because I'm getting the Candies.

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.060
Because that--I think that's actually one
of the secrets to Angry Birds' success.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:09.009
It's actually relatively easy to make through
out of the levels.

00:26:09.009 --> 00:26:10.659
I mean don't get stuck very often.

00:26:10.659 --> 00:26:11.659
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:26:11.659 --> 00:26:13.750
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: But then there--then there was
that extra challenge for the more hardcore

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:16.859
gamer of actually going through and trying
to gold star every level.

00:26:16.859 --> 00:26:17.859
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know, I think...

00:26:17.859 --> 00:26:21.190
&gt;&gt; Well, I didn't--I didn't notice this the
first time through but the stars are actually

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:22.299
points their time.

00:26:22.299 --> 00:26:23.730
So, you get a second for every star you get.

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:24.730
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:27.340
&gt;&gt; Which makes for an interesting mechanic
because your scored on how much time you have

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.760
when you get to the end of the level.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:29.760
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Right, right.

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.839
&gt;&gt; Which you then as the player have to balance
between how fast that you shoot through.

00:26:33.839 --> 00:26:35.940
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.
&gt;&gt; ...and how much care you take in like dropping

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:40.070
down and click the stars versus just catching
air and trying to, you know, skip [INDISTINCT]

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:41.070
an entirely.

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:42.070
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:44.029
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, I think what Dan is saying
is, you know, that's fine.

00:26:44.029 --> 00:26:45.100
It's good mechanic.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.100
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.880
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But there's more replay.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:55.049
People will play a level more often to three
star it than they will to pass it.

00:26:55.049 --> 00:26:57.409
If they just get stuck and can't pass the
level.

00:26:57.409 --> 00:26:58.409
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:26:58.409 --> 00:27:00.279
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Then they may stop playing the
game all together.

00:27:00.279 --> 00:27:02.289
But if they can't three star the level...

00:27:02.289 --> 00:27:03.289
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:27:03.289 --> 00:27:04.289
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...hey, you know.

00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:08.040
I've had some levels where I go back 20, 30
times until I've gotten all the score I could

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.040
possibly get.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.040
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.919
&gt;&gt; But there is bronze, silver and gold for
the level depending on how much time you have

00:27:12.919 --> 00:27:13.919
left.

00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:14.919
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:27:14.919 --> 00:27:17.350
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: At the bronze is actually--I think
it will be a little easier to get to the bronze

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:18.350
level.

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:19.350
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:20.350
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That will be my--that will be my
feedback.

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:21.350
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:23.529
My advice would be, you know, the bronze are
way, you know, there's some level where it's

00:27:23.529 --> 00:27:28.210
like, "Yey, you got to the end finally."

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:35.539
And that, you know, give people away to get
to the next level without actually getting

00:27:35.539 --> 00:27:38.390
to the target you see that for bronze, silver
and gold.

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:39.390
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: All right.

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:43.489
So, let's go to the next game which is GSN
Casino.

00:27:43.489 --> 00:27:44.690
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:49.639
So, GSN Casino is a slot machine game.

00:27:49.639 --> 00:27:51.289
We love slot machine games.

00:27:51.289 --> 00:27:53.840
We cannot get enough of them.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:54.940
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:28:01.269
You know, it's--the truth is that slot machines
are very, very easy games to write a basic

00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:04.490
version of it and there hard game that actually
balance well.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:05.490
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's right.

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:07.170
They're also very, very popular.

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:08.270
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:09.970
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: They just--they don't really
hit our demographic.

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:10.970
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:12.070
Our meeting in my demographic.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:13.070
Not...

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:14.070
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Or...

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.070
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...our meeting Google Play.

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:16.070
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:17.070
Right, right.

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:18.070
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Google plays...

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:19.070
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: No, no.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:20.070
Google Play, yeah, yeah.

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:22.240
Now, it's just tough because there isn't anyone
that works in Google that likes slot machine

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.240
games.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.240
I don't know why.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:28.010
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I'm sure there's someone that works
here but no one that I know.

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:29.470
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Because we're not retired.

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:30.470
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's possible.

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:32.149
And it is more than just a slot machine game.

00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:33.149
Let's be fair.

00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:37.100
There's, you know, there are--there's video
bingo and video poker as well, but it basically

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.059
a video casino simulation.

00:28:39.059 --> 00:28:40.370
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: See.

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:41.799
This I don't understand.

00:28:41.799 --> 00:28:46.110
It is--under what circumstances would you
play this?

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:50.650
Because, you know, I can see going to Vegas
and dropping a little bit on the slot.

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:53.700
But when you're doing that you at least get
free drinks, right?

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:57.399
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: But we're already getting free
drinks for playing the game right now.

00:28:57.399 --> 00:28:58.850
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's true.

00:28:58.850 --> 00:28:59.850
That's why.

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:01.639
&gt;&gt; So, you're saying that we should hook this
up to a [INDISTINCT]

00:29:01.639 --> 00:29:02.639
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:29:02.639 --> 00:29:03.639
That would make a much better.

00:29:03.639 --> 00:29:04.639
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:29:04.639 --> 00:29:08.900
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, in any event I'm going to...

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:09.900
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:11.179
So, at least you've got some variety, right?

00:29:11.179 --> 00:29:12.179
Yeah.

00:29:12.179 --> 00:29:16.009
And that's actually been my complaint about
a lot of slot games is it feels like a slot

00:29:16.009 --> 00:29:22.120
games will build an engine and then just reskin
it over and over and over again.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:26.919
Whereas in a real casino, of course you get
some of that certainly.

00:29:26.919 --> 00:29:31.090
There's a ton of slot machines that are just
reskins of each other but the games that are

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:36.100
actually making money are the ones that have
some sort of hook to them.

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.269
That's different from other slot games.

00:29:38.269 --> 00:29:40.830
And they do try to at least design things
differently.

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:47.520
If it's exact same like 21 line combo, you
know, lines going everywhere, you know, you

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:52.359
can play coins in different ways but the patterns
are all exactly the same that like this, right?

00:29:52.359 --> 00:29:53.359
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:29:53.359 --> 00:29:57.700
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know, I've seen a lot of
games where all they--all they would do is

00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:02.669
take something like this and change out the
background art and call it a new game.

00:30:02.669 --> 00:30:03.899
And that's no fun at all.

00:30:03.899 --> 00:30:04.899
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:30:04.899 --> 00:30:08.090
I think, you know, for slot machines, I think
that the--I--what I really want to see is

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:09.950
someone taking it to the next level.

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:14.419
Doing things you can't do in Vegas or you
won't--that people won't do in Vegas for various

00:30:14.419 --> 00:30:17.570
reasons and actually going, you know, kind
of going...

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:19.749
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Like holding up the casino and
stealing thing--you're...

00:30:19.749 --> 00:30:20.870
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Well, you know, that would be entertaining,
actually.

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:21.870
I wouldn't mind...

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:22.870
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...counting cards.

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:26.299
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I wouldn't mine a whole 3D FPS,
you know, built in to the casino game, but,

00:30:26.299 --> 00:30:30.759
you know, but, you know, more than, you know,
in terms of, like, these bonuses, like ,you

00:30:30.759 --> 00:30:34.970
can really spend time on them because this
isn't just a game.

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:37.710
We are trying to steal as much money from
people as possible.

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:40.409
Yours is a game we're you're actually trying
to entertain at the same time.

00:30:40.409 --> 00:30:41.409
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:30:41.409 --> 00:30:42.590
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, you can really take things
to the next level.

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:43.590
You don't have to worry.

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:46.649
Well, the bonus round takes 30 seconds, that's
30 seconds where the machine is in use.

00:30:46.649 --> 00:30:49.640
You can say, "That should take three minutes
to get to the bonus round."

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.220
And you do a lot of things if it's interesting.

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:55.059
You're not also as concerned about payouts,
you know, in a casino, you know, and these

00:30:55.059 --> 00:30:57.759
games are usually paying out like at 95%,
you know.

00:30:57.759 --> 00:31:01.149
So you're going to--because you want people
to continue participating and playing, you

00:31:01.149 --> 00:31:04.519
know, buying in occasionally but feeling that
they are getting value by comparison because

00:31:04.519 --> 00:31:05.519
they're going to...

00:31:05.519 --> 00:31:07.219
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You could payout a hundred and
ten percent if you wanted to.

00:31:07.219 --> 00:31:09.740
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: You could but then you might have
no one--then you would most likely not have

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:12.620
anyone buying anything unless you would be
monetizing ads only.

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:16.809
So, most of the time, you know, these are
monetizing the same way casinos do in the

00:31:16.809 --> 00:31:21.559
sense that you are, you know, ultimately buying
tokens here, you know, eventually I will run

00:31:21.559 --> 00:31:26.590
out of [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Buying tokens then running out

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:27.590
them, you know.

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:29.539
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So--but, you know, it's a decent
game I would like to--that I just want...

00:31:29.539 --> 00:31:30.539
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But it is cool.

00:31:30.539 --> 00:31:33.690
I mean--and actually, this game is really,
really god example of what I'm talking which

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:39.840
is, you know, you've got like the Cannon Barrage
that comes up and all these little things

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:44.690
that make this feel like a different game
than the next game or the game after that,

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:45.690
you know...

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:46.690
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:49.710
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...it's not just a bunch of different
artwork that you pulled off of like Shutterstock.

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:50.710
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:54.110
I mean the one thing I would say about this
is that they're--the--like the resolution

00:31:54.110 --> 00:32:00.049
is good but it's still noticeably blurry on
this tablet especially the text, you know,

00:32:00.049 --> 00:32:03.861
and so--and my general--my general feeling
is--actually the backgrounds here are fine

00:32:03.861 --> 00:32:07.530
but I would--when you see, like, Jolly Roger
and Cannon Barrage, you can really, really

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:10.990
see some filtering going on there.

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:13.149
And it just makes your eyes try to focus on
it.

00:32:13.149 --> 00:32:18.270
It's also kind of weird because it's a graphic
but the kerning on Roger just kind of irks

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:19.731
me when I look at it.

00:32:19.731 --> 00:32:24.150
It's like the R looks like it's--it's several
pixels farther away than the rest of the characters.

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:28.130
And if you're going to go through and you're
going to--going to do artwork for your text,

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:32.679
it's just--make it look really good because
right now it looks like a combination of blurry

00:32:32.679 --> 00:32:34.590
and a little bit, you know...

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:36.119
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You--you're such a font geek.

00:32:36.119 --> 00:32:37.789
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I am such a font geek.

00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:38.789
It's true.

00:32:38.789 --> 00:32:44.789
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But, yeah, it is just a darn
shame to have, you know, a bad resolution

00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:50.410
on a tablet like this because let's face it,
tablet games are, you know, games on tablets

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:56.179
are far more popular than games on phones
and this Asus Transformer Prime is now the

00:32:56.179 --> 00:32:58.410
low end of tablet resolution.

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:02.260
There's very few tablets that have a lower
resolution than this.

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:03.260
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:09.720
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, if you can't do a 720p set
of artwork, you may just want to skip tablets

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.720
altogether.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.759
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I mean, I actually, you know, it's
funny because it depends on the game.

00:33:12.759 --> 00:33:15.600
Like this game actually looks much better.

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:16.600
And again...

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.169
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...it's making use of more--it's
making use of more fonts and it doesn't have

00:33:20.169 --> 00:33:23.630
text that's rendered outside the font other
than, I think, this gem bonus one over here.

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:27.620
And, you know, it makes--it makes--it makes
a really big difference, you know, the game

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:31.860
feels much more like it's actually designed
for this resolution or so, you know..

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:32.860
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:33.860
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...whenever possible, use outlined
fonts.

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:39.559
I think that's just basically become the--that's
basically become the kind of gold standard

00:33:39.559 --> 00:33:40.559
here.

00:33:40.559 --> 00:33:43.190
So--and it looks like, you know, again, what
I'm excited of which I haven't gotten to in

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:49.059
this--in a lot of these games is actually
getting to the--is getting to the bonus round.

00:33:49.059 --> 00:33:53.659
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: See, I have to [INDISTINCT] I
think that those outlined fonts over the top

00:33:53.659 --> 00:33:55.970
of those oysters look terrible.

00:33:55.970 --> 00:34:00.740
I think that--I mean they're legible for some
definition of legible but...

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:01.740
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:02.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...they just look pasted on.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:03.750
I meant they don't like they're part of the
artwork at all.

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:04.750
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Oh, no, no.

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:05.750
I know that.

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:08.070
I didn't say the art design is actually--is
actually good for that.

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:11.069
I mean that's--you still have to design around
the fact that you have outlined fonts there.

00:34:11.069 --> 00:34:12.069
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:15.570
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: You know, I think that's--I would
totally agree with you, you know, in that

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:19.270
sense but at least I'm not like--my eye--I'm
not squinting trying to see them and my eyes

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:21.359
are not drawn to them and trying to focus
on them which is really the key.

00:34:21.359 --> 00:34:25.900
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, you know what I've seen done
that would actually be really effective in

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:29.839
a game like this is do all of your graphics
in something like SPG.

00:34:29.839 --> 00:34:30.839
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:34:30.839 --> 00:34:31.839
Yeah.

00:34:31.839 --> 00:34:32.839
That's cool.

00:34:32.839 --> 00:34:34.950
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And it's good for the SPG renders,
it worked great on a--on android.

00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:37.990
You remember Bouncy Mouse did that?

00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.990
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.990
Absolutely.

00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:42.929
I absolutely--what, you know, and it's actually
the code that was used inside of Androidify

00:34:42.929 --> 00:34:44.329
and it's actually available in open source.

00:34:44.329 --> 00:34:45.329
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:34:45.329 --> 00:34:48.860
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And it's a really nice SPG to Android
canvas render essentially.

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:49.860
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:54.379
So, you can take your Illustrator files or
whatever and import them instead of rasterizing

00:34:54.379 --> 00:34:56.659
them and importing them as bitmaps.

00:34:56.659 --> 00:35:01.980
You import them as SPG which is usually a
much smaller format and is going to render

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:04.140
beautifully at almost any resolution.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:07.390
And especially as screens get denser, that
becomes very, very important.

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:08.390
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:10.420
I know it's a good--it's a great way of keeping
the game size small.

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:13.901
And you have to be careful, obviously, because
it's very, very easy to create really, really

00:35:13.901 --> 00:35:15.480
large SPG files too, you know...

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.480
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:20.609
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...if you use certain effects like
as you start using lots of gradients, you're

00:35:20.609 --> 00:35:21.609
like, "No.

00:35:21.609 --> 00:35:23.180
Don't you--don't put the gradients in your
SPG files."

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:27.980
Actually, render those separately because
it's--a lot of SPG exporters will just, you

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:31.630
know, throw in tons and tons and tons of geometry
into the SPG.

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:33.430
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, like everything else, there's
no magic bullet.

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:37.839
But I think this could really benefit from
the vectorize especially since, you know,

00:35:37.839 --> 00:35:40.260
it's a sort of thing you draw at once and
then you're done.

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.260
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:44.390
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know, you can--you could
rasterize for this particular resolution and

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:45.869
then cache it if you want it to.

00:35:45.869 --> 00:35:50.890
So, it's not like you're spending a huge amount
of CPU to make it look nice.

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:53.860
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Now, you know, now--other things
that's interesting about this, it actually

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:56.980
has a swipe mechanic there which is kind of
nice, very obvious.

00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:57.980
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:58.980
I like these screens.

00:35:58.980 --> 00:35:59.980
They look good.

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:00.980
They're, you know, they're big...

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:01.980
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:06.349
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...but, you know, as I get older
and frailer, I don't mind that much.

00:36:06.349 --> 00:36:07.349
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:09.980
Well, I think--and I think that's really target
the audience we're talking about here.

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:13.240
You know, it's a somewhat older audience,
you know, we find that younger people are

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:16.329
tend to play this lots less and very, very
much like in the casinos.

00:36:16.329 --> 00:36:17.440
It is--it is an older audience.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.440
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:20.420
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, it makes sense to make sure
everything's really, really legible, very,

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:22.599
very much in your face, how the...

00:36:22.599 --> 00:36:24.130
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Big touch targets.

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:27.319
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Big touch targets, yeah, I mean
this is--this is--this is a nice design.

00:36:27.319 --> 00:36:33.470
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Also, you know, this is a good--we
talk a lot with Android about poor use of

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:34.470
gradients.

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:35.470
This is a good use of gradients.

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:36.470
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:37.470
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: These buttons look good.

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:38.470
They don't look bubbly.

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:41.680
They don't look eye--like you're over using
the gradient effect.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:47.710
You just got a slight little effect on those
so that they don't, like, completely flat

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:51.039
and that--I think that's appropriate in the
game style.

00:36:51.039 --> 00:36:52.039
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:36:52.039 --> 00:36:55.030
And it really does feel like you've been--if
you've been to, you know, Vegas and seen the

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:58.650
way the casinos market these games, you know,
it does really feel like there's a lot of

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:02.780
commonality between this and the way the casinos
are actually marketing the games in Vegas.

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:06.500
So, you know, I say, you know, this is a really
nice job.

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:10.650
I see there's no reason, to be honest, why
they wouldn't feature this, other then there's

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:12.930
so many games alike and the competition is
fierce.

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:14.150
You know, if you're going to make a...

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:15.150
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:19.849
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...slots game, be prepared to really
have to spend to drive people to it because

00:37:19.849 --> 00:37:22.270
there's just so much competition in this area.

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:23.349
There are so many good games.

00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:24.349
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:27.390
Well--and of course you're competing with
some really large social network players.

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:28.390
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:29.390
Big contender.

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:30.830
And including GSN, GSN is not a small player
either.

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:34.829
So, you know, let's, you know, this is--if
you're in the spades and then I, you know,

00:37:34.829 --> 00:37:38.380
by all means, and you're interested in making
slot games, make awesome slot games because

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:42.750
it's--and not--and be prepared to not just
make an awesome slot game but be prepared

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:44.799
to spend a lot of money to drive people to
it because...

00:37:44.799 --> 00:37:45.799
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:37:45.799 --> 00:37:48.472
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...because it's, you know, this
is one of those times where, you know, you

00:37:48.472 --> 00:37:51.260
know the game model, the station model's really
straightforward and...

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:52.260
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:55.380
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...you know, there's a lot of--there's
a lot of people here that would love to be

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:56.380
playing--get in your mind by slots.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.380
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:58.380
These games are not hard to program.

00:37:58.380 --> 00:37:59.380
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yes.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:00.970
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: They need a lot of art but programming
and us [INDISTINCT]

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:02.319
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And design.

00:38:02.319 --> 00:38:03.589
There's a lot of design makers into this...

00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:04.589
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:38:04.589 --> 00:38:06.400
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...to make it--to make it, you
know, so it does do all those things and...

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.400
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.619
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...hats off to those people but
it's not a technical issue.

00:38:09.619 --> 00:38:10.619
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:38:10.619 --> 00:38:13.930
Well, one of these days when I get sick of
being a good person, I'm totally going to

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:15.490
go Vegas and write slot machine code.

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:16.490
I hear they make a ton of money in a way.

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:17.490
So, let's get...

00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:19.130
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: There's no way going to happen.

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:24.520
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I have some friends out there
and they are good people out there.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:25.520
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.520
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: They're really good people.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:27.520
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Oh, absolutely.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.520
No, no, I'm...

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:29.520
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, some are.

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:31.330
The Dark Nebula is probably the most interesting
game.

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:32.400
I'm glad we saved it for last.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:38.559
It's a--it's a really interesting--now this
is one of those things--honestly, I'm always

00:38:38.559 --> 00:38:43.630
sad when I see this over 6,000,000 downloads
on iOS and 5,000 download on Android.

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:45.160
And why is that, Dan?

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:50.210
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I assume that it's because it just
hasn't gotten in front of a lot of people.

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:51.210
And that's, you know...

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:52.210
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:53.210
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...ultimately that's...

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:57.021
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, you know, I'm going to
say that's true but also, you know, this is

00:38:57.021 --> 00:39:01.609
really telling too because the first thing
you see on this page is Dark Nebula is finally

00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:02.890
available on Android.

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:05.691
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Well, that's also get, you know,
when you--when you bring out a game and you

00:39:05.691 --> 00:39:10.390
bring [INDISTINCT] out of excitement, you
know, at another platform and then, a year

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:13.530
later, two years later, you drag the game
over to Android.

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:14.530
Why?

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:17.990
It's, you know, you've kind of reduced the
ability to get any press out of, kind of,

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:19.069
the general press.

00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:24.500
And, you know, the game is really big on iOS,
you might end up seeing--getting some traction

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.569
that way but usually, it's actually sort of,
"All right.

00:39:27.569 --> 00:39:28.569
Well, it's here.

00:39:28.569 --> 00:39:29.569
Finally.

00:39:29.569 --> 00:39:30.569
Great."

00:39:30.569 --> 00:39:31.569
And it's been eclipsed by a bunch of other
games.

00:39:31.569 --> 00:39:32.569
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:39:32.569 --> 00:39:35.730
It's been eclipsed and usually your marketing
dollars are gone, et cetera.

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:42.770
Now, as far as their featured graphic though,
I--their icon says a lot about what the game

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:48.210
is like and except for the stupid rounded
corners which totally don't need to be there...

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:49.210
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yup.

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:50.210
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...I like it.

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:59.730
Their featured graphic is clean and legible,
but it tells me nothing beyond the name of

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:00.730
the game.

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:02.124
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I thought it was a space exploration
they way I saw it.

00:40:02.124 --> 00:40:03.124
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:40:03.124 --> 00:40:05.890
And then you hear Dark Nebula and you're like,
"Oh, I bet there's going to be like, some,

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:06.890
you know...

00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:07.970
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I want it--I want it [INDISTINCT]
spaceship.

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:09.672
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...a spaceship with some planets
and stuff, right?

00:40:09.672 --> 00:40:12.869
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And I want--and I want it like
exploration and yeah...

00:40:12.869 --> 00:40:13.869
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:40:13.869 --> 00:40:14.869
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: And that is not the game.

00:40:14.869 --> 00:40:19.470
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Basically, if you took this to
a design committee made up of like art school

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:25.151
seniors and say, "Hey, give me a design for
an ad for something called Dark Nebula."

00:40:25.151 --> 00:40:26.151
And they'd be like, "What?

00:40:26.151 --> 00:40:27.151
Is it a game?

00:40:27.151 --> 00:40:28.151
Is it a vodka?"

00:40:28.151 --> 00:40:29.151
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: We're not going to tell you anything
about it.

00:40:29.151 --> 00:40:30.151
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:40:30.151 --> 00:40:31.151
Just some Dark Nebula.

00:40:31.151 --> 00:40:32.151
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Just the Dark Nebula.

00:40:32.151 --> 00:40:33.151
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: This is what...

00:40:33.151 --> 00:40:34.151
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:40:34.151 --> 00:40:35.151
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...they would come up with.

00:40:35.151 --> 00:40:36.151
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, totally.

00:40:36.151 --> 00:40:37.151
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, I think, you know, you can
do better I think it's actually...

00:40:37.151 --> 00:40:38.151
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Stop that.

00:40:38.151 --> 00:40:39.151
Stop that.

00:40:39.151 --> 00:40:40.151
It is--that's a little less blurry though.

00:40:40.151 --> 00:40:41.151
To be honest [INDISTINCT] art students.

00:40:41.151 --> 00:40:42.590
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's--well, you never know because
sometimes art students get artsy.

00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:43.590
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's true.

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:46.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But the point is, it has nothing
to do with the actual game which is more of

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.709
a combination of pinball and Labyrinth.

00:40:48.709 --> 00:40:49.709
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:40:49.709 --> 00:40:51.690
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's a--you better take that
out actually.

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:52.690
I don't know.

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:54.510
Can you play the game with that?

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:55.510
It's a total [INDISTINCT].

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:56.510
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Sure.

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:58.890
I actually--I actually played it sideways
last time I played it.

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:02.089
So, we'll see whether I can actually play
it successfully.

00:41:02.089 --> 00:41:07.040
&gt;&gt; Ni-LEWIS: Dan will do anything to avoid
undocking the keyboard of his Asus Transformer

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.040
Prime.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.040
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It's true actually.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.470
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I'm not even sure why.

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:12.319
Why does he feel this way?

00:41:12.319 --> 00:41:15.390
What deep seated need does this satisfy?

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:18.540
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That's a very good question.

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:21.450
I think--I think we'll get to that in the
future episode.

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:22.450
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Excellent.

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:28.050
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, one thing you do you have to
hold in the correct orientation when you start

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:29.290
because that's when it calibrates itself.

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:30.290
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, yeah.

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:32.250
If you don't get calibrated you're screwed.

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:33.250
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:34.250
So, that's why how you [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, really?

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:35.250
That's how you calibrate it?

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:36.250
You like that calibration?

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:37.270
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I know.

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:40.520
I think actually it's one of those things
where it's probably better to tell you but

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:44.540
by the way really make sure to hold it in
the right orientation or otherwise you are

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:47.150
going to find that it's not going to be calibrated.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:48.150
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:52.250
This is one of those things where a little
bit of AI might go a along way just trying

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:54.590
to understand exactly what the player's trying
to do.

00:41:54.590 --> 00:42:01.710
Because, you know, in general the range of
tilt-sensor for--that's is useful for game

00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:02.710
play...

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:03.710
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Actually...

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:06.030
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...is going to be much smaller
than the actual range of the sensor.

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:12.520
So, if you start seeing that the user is going
off one side or the other what a really good

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:16.390
game it will do is just sort of adjust it
so that they can...

00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:20.220
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It's hard to see [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You kind of like--you kind of

00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:21.220
calibrate as you're going.

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:22.270
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I think, you know, it's funny.

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:27.400
I never actually tried playing this game with
the HDMI and I think it's not real happy about

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:32.520
the kind of jerky resizing that happens when
you--when you actually or have the HDMI plugged

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:33.520
in.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:34.810
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, yeah, and you accidentally
taking it out.

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:38.020
Do you want to put it on my Nexus 7 and put
the--put the [INDISTINCT] camera on?

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:39.020
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, you might want to [INDISTINCT]
the camera.

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:42.150
Let's just try this one more time to see if
I can actually get through.

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:46.849
So, one thing that's really great about this
game is actually the accelerometer controls

00:42:46.849 --> 00:42:47.849
are really precise.

00:42:47.849 --> 00:42:50.430
They do want you wanted to do, like honestly...

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:51.430
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:54.579
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...it actually feels really, really
good.

00:42:54.579 --> 00:42:57.630
And that's I think the most important thing
in this kind of a game is that you're going

00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:02.000
to use accelerometer controls and, you know,
I am not always a fan of accelerometer controls.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.350
I'd be the first one to say...

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:04.350
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:07.160
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...that it is actually messed up
quite a lot of really good games.

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:13.460
But in this game, you know, the game is entirely
designed around it which is why it works.

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:18.109
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, if you're using the new
API's that we shipped in--what was that?

00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:19.109
ICS?

00:43:19.109 --> 00:43:22.900
Then you can get really, really incredibly
good accelerometer.

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:27.000
If you don't use a new API's or if you're
on an older device then the accelerometer

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.200
is a little bit flaky.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:31.069
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Now, one thing I love about the
game play in this is that you actually have

00:43:31.069 --> 00:43:36.099
to--you see go and in order to open doors
you actually have to go over certain areas

00:43:36.099 --> 00:43:42.470
and it gives your, you know, character this--what
kind of red or green and force field.

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:46.420
SO I've got this red force field and now the
red force field allows me to get through that

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:49.049
wall, et cetera and so forth.

00:43:49.049 --> 00:43:51.881
So, there's a lot of really good elements
here in the game play that, you know, I really

00:43:51.881 --> 00:43:52.881
enjoyed.

00:43:52.881 --> 00:43:53.881
And, you know, I...

00:43:53.881 --> 00:43:54.881
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And it is cool.

00:43:54.881 --> 00:43:57.789
I mean, it feels--can you fall off the edge
there by the way or...

00:43:57.789 --> 00:43:58.789
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yes.

00:43:58.789 --> 00:43:59.789
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:43:59.789 --> 00:44:00.789
Yes.

00:44:00.789 --> 00:44:01.789
So, it's kind of get that marble madness thing
going on.

00:44:01.789 --> 00:44:02.789
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:44:02.789 --> 00:44:03.789
No.

00:44:03.789 --> 00:44:04.789
No.

00:44:04.789 --> 00:44:05.789
It's a really nice design for an [INDISTINCT]
based game.

00:44:05.789 --> 00:44:06.789
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:44:06.789 --> 00:44:08.329
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: You know, I love to see people
who are--you're doing an [INDISTINCT] base

00:44:08.329 --> 00:44:11.359
game actually going and saying, "No, we're
going to design around this input method and

00:44:11.359 --> 00:44:13.410
really try to do something cool."

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:16.290
That's always, you know, that's always better
than kind of throwing it into an existing

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:20.290
AIM design.

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:22.880
And so, you know, you know, thumbs up to the
designers.

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.730
Oh, yeah, look at that.

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:25.840
I just died.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:27.330
My shield it down.

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:28.810
I'm about to die.

00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:30.299
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But you're right.

00:44:30.299 --> 00:44:31.339
It is a fun game.

00:44:31.339 --> 00:44:37.869
There's a few--a few sprites seem a little
low res but that could just be the angle I'm

00:44:37.869 --> 00:44:38.869
holding it aside.

00:44:38.869 --> 00:44:42.480
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: No, it's definitely--it's definitely
gotten some minor resolution issues.

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:46.339
It's, you know, it looks like it's one resolution
step below what we have here...

00:44:46.339 --> 00:44:47.339
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Got you.

00:44:47.339 --> 00:44:48.339
Yeah, and that's...

00:44:48.339 --> 00:44:49.339
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...on the ASUS Transformer Prime.

00:44:49.339 --> 00:44:50.430
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: We have a YouTube question?

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:52.600
&gt;&gt; Let's see.

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:58.339
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You have been dedicated to reading
YouTube questions like a good producer right,

00:44:58.339 --> 00:44:59.339
Alex?

00:44:59.339 --> 00:45:02.140
&gt;&gt; There haven't been any comments in the
past several minutes.

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:03.300
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Really?

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:10.220
&gt;&gt; So, I think our time switch has injured
our viewership or people are just quiet today.

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:11.220
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's possible.

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:15.900
&gt;&gt; The last actual question was about the
music from the Agent Shooter game.

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:19.830
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: There you go.

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:20.830
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Wow.

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:21.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:23.420
My--the only problem I have with the UI for
this game for the tilting thing.

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:25.520
I think in general [INDISTINCT] works really
well.

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:29.720
The only problem I have with it is you get
to a point where in order to go forward and

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:32.700
you're tilting the screen away from you and
that makes actually...

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:33.700
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:34.700
&gt;&gt; ...it seem what you're doing difficult.

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:36.421
So, what you're doing is like, if it's like
this.

00:45:36.421 --> 00:45:37.421
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:45:37.421 --> 00:45:40.180
&gt;&gt; You end up going like this and you almost
have to sort of lean over and [INDISTINCT]

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:41.180
whatever it was you're doing.

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:42.180
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, I noticed that.

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:45.579
And despite what Dan was saying about calibration.

00:45:45.579 --> 00:45:49.619
If I hold it like this while the level is
starting it still wants to lie flat...

00:45:49.619 --> 00:45:50.619
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:45:50.619 --> 00:45:51.619
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...while I'm playing it.

00:45:51.619 --> 00:45:52.619
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:45:52.619 --> 00:45:53.619
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's not cool guys.

00:45:53.619 --> 00:45:54.619
&gt;&gt; Yeah, if there's...

00:45:54.619 --> 00:45:55.619
&gt;&gt; Ni-LEWIS: Totally not cool.

00:45:55.619 --> 00:45:58.930
&gt;&gt; If there was just a way to or to have it
calibrate for holding in front of you like

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:00.839
a 45 degree angle or something like that.

00:46:00.839 --> 00:46:04.720
So, you tilt it a little that you can still
see perfectly what's going on.

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:08.960
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Or if I had a specially built
table with like Leonardo Da Vinci [INDISTINCT]

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.160
and stuff coming out...

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.279
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: That would be so cool.

00:46:11.279 --> 00:46:12.279
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:46:12.279 --> 00:46:13.279
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I know--I would love...

00:46:13.279 --> 00:46:14.279
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT] pulling on ropes and stuff.

00:46:14.279 --> 00:46:15.279
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:46:15.279 --> 00:46:17.040
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I want to see--I want to see like
Labyrinth peripheral for this guy.

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.400
That would be awesome.

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.400
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.400
Right.

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:26.799
But as it stands, yeah, control is good but
could be a lot better if you would just let

00:46:26.799 --> 00:46:27.799
it...

00:46:27.799 --> 00:46:28.799
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, here's how you actually do
it.

00:46:28.799 --> 00:46:29.799
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:46:29.799 --> 00:46:30.799
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It's actually in the game.

00:46:30.799 --> 00:46:31.799
There's actually a calibration.

00:46:31.799 --> 00:46:32.799
You can calibrate...

00:46:32.799 --> 00:46:33.799
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:46:33.799 --> 00:46:34.799
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: ...it here or oh, you can--and
you can actually calibrate and during the

00:46:34.799 --> 00:46:35.799
game.

00:46:35.799 --> 00:46:38.220
This is what I hadn't noticed because it's
kind of hidden in there but you actually--you

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:40.630
actually recalibrate the game by pressing
the screen with two fingers.

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:41.630
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:42.630
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, there we are.

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:43.630
It's calibrated here.

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:44.630
Let's see how much more playable it is.

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:48.240
So, you know, again, may this be a question
of just being able to find this because obviously

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.940
neither--none of us found it.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:54.710
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, that's interesting because
it does a lot a better but it's also a lot

00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:56.390
more jerky for some reason.

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:57.390
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Really?

00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:58.390
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:59.390
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Hmm.

00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:00.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I don't understand that.

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:01.740
Yeah.

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:02.740
Well...

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:03.740
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Okay.

00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:04.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...it does help though.

00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:07.099
&gt;&gt; It's good that it's possible to recalibrate.

00:47:07.099 --> 00:47:12.830
But I would seriously consider the switching
your default over to someone holding it in

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:16.250
front of you either vertically or 45 degrees.

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:17.730
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:21.360
What is tricky like, you don't like honestly,
because of the design of the game maybe if

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.960
you calibrate it too far up it also becomes
really hard to play.

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:25.960
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:28.999
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, so, since it's obviously
very quick to calibrate it.

00:47:28.999 --> 00:47:29.999
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:47:29.999 --> 00:47:36.819
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: What I don't understand is why
wouldn't I just calibrate it every time--every

00:47:36.819 --> 00:47:37.819
time I start.

00:47:37.819 --> 00:47:38.819
Let's say...

00:47:38.819 --> 00:47:39.819
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I have...

00:47:39.819 --> 00:47:42.369
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, give it, you know, give it
a little count down, you know, you got three

00:47:42.369 --> 00:47:44.240
seconds and then you're going to go.

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:47.641
And the average player is going to put it
into the position where they don't want it

00:47:47.641 --> 00:47:48.641
to move.

00:47:48.641 --> 00:47:51.970
And the last thing you want to do is have
your balls start to move when you start.

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:54.490
So, I don't know.

00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:56.210
Maybe that's just me.

00:47:56.210 --> 00:48:01.770
But yeah, this accelerometer is not nearly
as, oh my goodness, it's--no, it's almost

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:05.390
unplayable when I calibrate it to a 45 degree
angle.

00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:06.660
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, it is--it really...

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:08.410
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But I don't understand why.

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:09.480
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: I'm not sure either.

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:10.480
There's a problem...

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:12.120
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, that would be really interesting
to find out.

00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:16.400
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, in any case, you know, we really
like Dark Nebula.

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:22.091
I think it's a, you know, it's a game that,
you know, that we all enjoyed playing and,

00:48:22.091 --> 00:48:25.859
you know, I think it's a little hard to play
when you have it plugged in HDMI and you're

00:48:25.859 --> 00:48:28.740
trying desperately to keep the HDMI from getting
pulled out.

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:29.740
But it...

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:30.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:31.740
So, if you have that problem.

00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:33.369
You might want to stir clear this one.

00:48:33.369 --> 00:48:34.869
But, other than that...

00:48:34.869 --> 00:48:38.240
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: But, you know, it's really, a really
thoroughly welcome track of game.

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:40.599
And I, you know, I honestly say this, I'm
looking forward to going through and getting

00:48:40.599 --> 00:48:42.360
higher and higher level in the game.

00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:43.870
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It is a really fun game.

00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:44.870
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:45.870
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I love it.

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:46.870
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: We know, I--and this is--I bought
this game.

00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:47.870
So, I know personally.

00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:48.870
So...

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:49.870
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Nice.

00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:50.870
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:51.870
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Isn't that because we made you?

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:52.870
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: It's true but I did.

00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:53.870
So, that's...

00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:54.890
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:55.890
Well...

00:48:55.890 --> 00:48:56.890
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: All right.

00:48:56.890 --> 00:48:59.440
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Redhook ESB, five great games.

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:00.490
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:03.440
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And we are out of here.

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:06.260
So, thanks a lot for watching The Friday Review.

00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:10.580
Remember, that next week we will once again
have an open topic.

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:11.580
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:17.800
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, go ahead and nominate whatever
you want just please, please, please put a

00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:18.800
link to it.

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.719
I'm talking to you, Dark Nebula guy.

00:49:20.719 --> 00:49:21.719
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Uh-hmm.

00:49:21.719 --> 00:49:28.619
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And give us your info so if we
get around to it and we're not too drunk and

00:49:28.619 --> 00:49:30.910
we're, you know, feeling good that day.

00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:33.390
We'll try and invite you onto a G+ hang out
at some point.

00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:34.390
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:36.359
It's great--it's great to have developers
when they come online and we can talk to them

00:49:36.359 --> 00:49:39.630
about the games and kind of get an idea of,
you know, why certain design decisions were

00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:40.630
made.

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:45.589
So, it's always great if you're available
at this time which is now 12:00 noon PST to

00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:49.290
actually go and join us live on the show.

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:54.520
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, we're going to go ahead and
keep it at noon PST for a week.

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.869
It looks like nobody watches at that time.

00:49:56.869 --> 00:49:58.920
We might switch, it's cool.

00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:00.160
Let us know.

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:05.220
Our only ask is that it needs to be some point
within shouting distance of working hours

00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:09.430
for us and preferably within drinking hours.

00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:10.430
So...

00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:11.430
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah.

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:12.430
9:00...

00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:13.430
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...nothing before 9:00 AM.

00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:14.860
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: Yeah, 9:00 in the morning is kind
of the cut.

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:17.280
I refuse to drink before 9:00 so...

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:18.280
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.270
Because at 9:00 we've only just stop drinking.

00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:23.280
We don't want to start again.

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:27.950
&gt;&gt; GALPIN: So, have a great weekend everyone
and definitely continue to vote on the moderator

00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:34.089
page and nominate your games and your favorite
games and let's see some great stuff for next

00:50:34.089 --> 00:50:35.089
week.

00:50:35.089 --> 00:50:36.089
Actually, it was--it was a really fun week.

00:50:36.089 --> 00:50:37.089
I hope there's a lot of really...

00:50:37.089 --> 00:50:38.089
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, there are some good stuff.

00:50:38.089 --> 00:50:41.170
I really like--I think the quality of submissions
has really gone up.

00:50:41.170 --> 00:50:42.980
So, we appreciate it.

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:46.099
Thanks for watching Happy Android play this
out.
