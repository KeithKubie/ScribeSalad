TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.260
and this is "The
Developer Show."

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.090
I'm standing here with Purnima
Kochikar, Director for Google

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.852
Play Apps and Games.

00:00:10.852 --> 00:00:12.060
Purnima, welcome to the show.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.680
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR:
Thank you, Timothy.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.600
Thanks for having me.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.790
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's
great to have you here.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.123
First, I'd like to learn a
little bit about your history

00:00:17.123 --> 00:00:19.510
and what brought
you to Google Play.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.330
I know that you used
to be VP at Nokia

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.414
for Developer Communities.

00:00:23.414 --> 00:00:25.496
What is it that you learned
about developers there

00:00:25.496 --> 00:00:26.770
that brought you to this role?

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.269
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: What I loved
about working with developers

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.571
is that they are
always optimistic.

00:00:31.571 --> 00:00:33.320
I don't think there's
any job in the world

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.445
that you're working with
more optimistic people who

00:00:35.445 --> 00:00:37.940
are trying to solve
amazing problems.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.880
Every day I talk to
people who are saying,

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.700
this is a new way of doing taxis
or a new way of doing education

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.290
or a new way of supplying food.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.780
So there's always a new
way, and that's exciting.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.890
The second thing, what
I love about developers,

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.970
is that they'll take the
technology or a platform

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.386
that you have built
and completely

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:55.350
use it in ways that you have
never imagined would happen.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.290
And so the two aspects
of it, the surprises

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.030
and the solutions, is what
makes me excited about working

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.760
with developers.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.759
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's
one of my favorite things

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:05.699
too is that working
with platforms, we

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:08.240
always kind of an idea of how
developers are going to use it.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.710
And then they always find
a way to surprise us,

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.070
especially with Google Play.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.800
Because that the
landscape is so huge,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.050
there's always something
every week where you're like,

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.686
that's amazing.

00:01:16.686 --> 00:01:18.310
And I never would
have thought of that.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.160
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: Yeah,
exactly, and so it's

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.740
amazing to be able to do this.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.830
Plus you realize that you're
actually making a difference

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.820
in people's lives,
both for the developer

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.380
as well as for the user.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.297
And so that helps too.

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:31.713
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's interesting
to talk about Google Play

00:01:31.713 --> 00:01:33.409
because developers
who build in Android

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:34.700
already know about Google Play.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.530
But sometimes I
wonder if they know

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.460
all of the kind of
nooks and crannies

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.290
and some of the best features.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.000
Do you have like maybe some
of your favorite lesser known

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.240
features of Google Play that
are great for app developers

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.130
and publishers?

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.680
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR:
Well, I don't know

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.221
whether it's a lesser
known features,

00:01:50.221 --> 00:01:52.220
but maybe we should
talk about the things

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.460
that people may not think about.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.900
Number one thing I believe
that people should really

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.310
think about is that
your users really

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.580
want your app to get better,
and you should tap into them.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.610
I think a lot of times
I hear developers say,

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.880
there's a really bad review.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.400
Can you make it go away?

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.270
And I'm like no, harness it.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.760
Your user really cares.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.140
So what can you do about it?

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.070
But they're also telling
you positive things.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.000
So on Google Play, one of the
things we've really focused on

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.460
is to how to get
developers to harness

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.670
all the intelligence of the
users to make better products.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.200
So everything from alpha beta
testing, to staged rollouts,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.720
and now we just introduced
A-B testing, which we

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.820
call store listing experiments.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.310
So harnessing the
intelligence of your users

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.070
who are your biggest
advocates and your users

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.580
to make apps better, I
think, is something people

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.330
don't use enough.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.580
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well, and
we just mentioned an article

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.230
on the show about
ratings and reviews

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.050
in the Google Play
developer console.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.330
And I think we've
done a lot of work

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.270
there to bring that intelligence
into a format that's actionable

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.320
and really like intelligible
at the same time.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.860
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: Absolutely,
one of the big things

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.760
developers told us is that we
love the fact that we can reply

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.470
to reviews and that we
could have a direct channel

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.100
of communication to our users.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.220
However, there are
so many reviews.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.980
How do I find the themes?

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.550
How do I know in areas
that I should focus on?

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.510
And what I find
interesting is that there

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.380
are folks who will view it as
something as a problem to fix,

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.740
but a lot of people are now
looking at the strengths

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.210
that they need to leverage.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.630
So they're looking
at it as a way

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.450
to measure community
sentiment management.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.870
So what we did is to say
how do we measure sentiment?

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.900
And the tools we
are talking about

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.030
allow developers to
use Google smarts

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.630
to understand all the
hidden gems in your ratings

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:40.354
and reviews.

00:03:40.354 --> 00:03:41.520
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's cool.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.700
Developers often ask me, and
I'm sure they ask you as well,

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.320
what's the secret?

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.710
And the coolest thing is you
actually recently published

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.770
a second version of "The Secrets
to App's Success on Google

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.630
Play," which you
should check out

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.820
and will be LinkedIn
the show notes.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.010
However, maybe you can
give us a highlight.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.950
What's one of your favorite
kind of insights from that book?

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.325
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR:
The first thing

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:04.410
we did was actually
put it out linearly.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.260
So the nice thing about the
book is that you can always just

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.430
jump in where you are at the
stage of what matters to you.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.680
So if you're in design, there
is a section for design.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.520
If you are in place
where building growth.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.610
there's a section for growth.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.026
If you're thinking about,
should I use ads for monetizing,

00:04:19.026 --> 00:04:20.300
there's a section for that.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.250
It goes not just about
Android and Play,

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.030
but also looks at other
Google technologies, like ads,

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.180
for example.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.520
So that's a huge plus.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.210
So the big insight I
would like to point there

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.510
is to really think about what
it means to be not constrained

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.100
by the market that you're in.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.320
Android is huge.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.150
it's around the world.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.550
And you could be
a global business,

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.990
no matter where you are.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.230
This book gives you
interesting ways

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.880
to tie from
everything from how do

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.570
you design for various
markets, how do you localize,

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:52.750
but also how do you price.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.185
So that I think is--

00:04:54.185 --> 00:04:55.040
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's
really inspiring.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.470
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: Yes,
I mean, think about it;

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.110
20 years ago, they would
have needed a new management

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.960
team to figure out how to
take a business global.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.710
Now you could do it
from your living room.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.010
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And sales
offices in multiple markets,

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.100
whereas, again--

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.480
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: Now you can.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.390
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's great.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.680
Thanks for joining me today.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.690
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: Thanks
for having me, Timothy.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:12.232
This was fun.

00:05:12.232 --> 00:05:14.440
TIMOTHY JORDAN: For more
information about everything

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.700
that we talked about, check
the show notes for links

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.550
and, of course,
subscribe to this channel

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.950
for more interviews like this.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.370
I'm Timothy Jordan, and
I'll see you next time.
