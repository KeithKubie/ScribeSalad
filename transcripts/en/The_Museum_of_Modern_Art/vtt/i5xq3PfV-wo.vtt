00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.420
Charlie: Oh.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.040
No.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.260
Not so much.

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.460
I was thinking… this is like too much.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.610
Leah: Too much draping?

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.610
Charlie: Mhmm.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.070
Leah: Yeah, I think we can’t do that.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:28.680
Charlie: Yeah, and I just wonder about a heavier
weight fabric so that it could hang but not

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.610
drape at the same time.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.210
Like canvas or something.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.070
Mack: This hangs pretty well.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.790
Charlie: I know.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.300
But it doesn’t do anything.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.860
I mean, it might as well be tight if you’re
doing that.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.860
I don’t know…

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.110
Aaron: You’re looking for some texture.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.400
Charlie: Maybe what I’m imagining doesn’t
exist in reality.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.400
I don’t know.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.329
I mean, the more I’ve thought about it I
think that just a simple…

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.990
Leah: …hanging but stiffer cloth?

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:06.200
Charlie: Hanging… a non-stretched cloth
that’s not… doesn’t look like it’s

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.200
supposed to be stretched.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.580
That’s sort of a tall order, I don’t know…

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.509
Leah: Yeah, I kind of have a vision of that
too.

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.829
Like a tarp, with grommets almost?

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:21.740
That you can imagine that you would suspend
with the grommets and it would feel like heavy?

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.600
Mack: Then we could hang it off the wall,
or we could hang it off the ceiling.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.600
Leah: Yeah.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.819
Charlie: Yeah, I mean so the issue is really
what should the scale be relative to the other

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:37.079
works, and then what…

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.819
I was thinking that the image would be smaller
than this in relation…

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:44.819
I don’t know.

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.329
Originally I thought it was kind of going
to be small, but maybe that’s wrong.

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.130
Leah: I think we should use space here.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.880
Partly because we’re going to have a bench
here.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.880
It’s captivating.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.099
The scale of the gull piece is big here.

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:00.569
I don’t think it should be small.

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.380
Charlie: The minute you put a moving image
up, you know, you want to give a lot of space

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.380
to the other things.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.380
Leah: I think that’s okay.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.661
Charlie: No, I think it’s fine too.

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:09.661
I just don’t want to…

00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:11.099
Leah: I know what you’re doing.

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.549
You’re being respectful.

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.490
But I think this feels good as you’re walking
in.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.739
And then if there’s a bench you’ll sit
there.

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.220
Charlie: And then the Brazos River is over
here?

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.019
Leah: Brazos Rivers is actually in this corner
here.

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.329
Is this the monitor you’re planning on using?

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.390
Mack: Well that’s one.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.430
We have another.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.400
Leah: I wonder if that feels like it’s maybe
one notch too big for that wall?

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.849
What do you think?

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.830
I mean, I can live with it if you think it’s
right.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.620
Mack: What’s the smaller option?

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.620
Like twenty inches?

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.239
Aaron: The smaller is like nineteen inches,
yes.

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.300
Leah: A lot smaller.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.450
Charlie: That would be too small.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.530
Leah: Yeah, okay.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.530
Stick with it then.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.879
Mack: What we can look at…

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:05.220
We can’t embed, but we can build something
white, you know we can make like a white fascia

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.609
for it that will cover it.

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:07.609
Charlie: Instead of the black?

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:08.609
That’s what we talked about.

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.270
Mack: Because I think part of why it’s so
big is all of that.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.340
And if that were white it would feel…

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.500
Leah: It would feel a little less big on the
wall.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.129
Mack: A little less giant…

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.670
And you want to be able to see it.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.260
Again, the bench is going to be kind of in
the middle…
