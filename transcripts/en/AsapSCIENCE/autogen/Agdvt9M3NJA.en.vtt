00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:03.480
 We have all witnessed the beauty of meteors, but have you ever thought about it? 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.000
 What happens when an asteroid enters the orbit of the Earth? 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.780
 Can we detect it in advance? And more importantly, can we stop it? I believe 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.740
 I have an answer, you know, the asteroid hits the earth. 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.020
 It’s a very serious thing, when I was in the second grade, Ms. McGonigal told us 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.580
 Ancient dinosaurs disappear because their brains are small 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.400
 May be like... 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.800
 My old boss. But even she knows that this is a very convincing theory. 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.039
 As a result, it turns out that in my lifetime, people discovered craters. 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:41.550
 In Hick Sulubo, Mexico. This crater is very big, how big is it? 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.899
 An asteroid hits the Earth as large (or some impactor hits the Earth) 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.899
 When you hit the earth, put a lot of things into the sky of the earth, its original diameter 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.329
 More than the Earth itself, so the earth is surrounded by hot rocks for a while 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.739
 It cooked everything, except for some animals that lived in the cave 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.449
 That is our ancestors, and finally evolved into us. Some serious accidents you may remember Valentine's Day 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.180
 year 2013 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.600
 Russia's Chelyabinsk air burst. 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.230
 If you are an asteroid, you are moving at 10 km/s or 20 km/s. 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.500
 And you hit the earth's atmosphere, the atmosphere is as hard as concrete 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.900
 You can't have other methods, it can only explode in the air. 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.700
 Therefore, these asteroids are serious, most of them 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.340
 They are all very small. If you are less than 10 meters in diameter, you will burn when you hit the Earth's atmosphere. 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.870
 Blue stripes, green stripes 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.990
 And white stripes, then humans will make a wish to you 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.790
 (I don't know how effective these wishes are, but people are doing this) 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:46.270
 anyway, 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.750
 If the volume of the asteroid starts to be larger, the diameter is up to 25 meters. 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.180
 45 meters, then you will have a meteor crater in Arizona. 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.890
 Huge thing 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.180
 This is like a city killer or a county killer. 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.740
 Then, when they reach 100 to 140 meters in diameter, you will encounter a national killer. 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.469
 When they are bigger, they will be the killers of the whole continent; when they become bigger again 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:12.590
 You will 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.870
 There is the demise of the entire different ancient species. 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.540
 So, if we find out that an asteroid is coming to us, how do we find it? 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.469
 "How do we find the asteroid that is moving toward us?" This is a very good question. 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:30.409
 You can use a telescope, some skilled people can use the camera to aim at the sky and 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.370
 Looking for fast moving objects 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.260
 Some objects that traverse the Earth's orbit. But we may not be able to find out 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.930
 100,000 of these things: 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.299
 The killers of these counties, the city's killers and the country's killers. 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.889
 So what we want to do is to build a spaceship called "Sentinel" 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:51.829
 As we said: "It's like looking for (dark black) charcoal briquettes in the dark." 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.689
 These things are hard to find. They are insignificant compared to the vast space 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.810
 But infrared light and heat will bounce off them, so what do you do - 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.120
 When you are a satellite, you are a measuring spaceship 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.719
 You will turn your back to the sun, then 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:13.099
 Looking outward from the orbit of Venus, try to find 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.739
 All these asteroids. Then when you find one, what do you do? Will you scream in a circle? 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.389
 Do not! Do not! Do not! We should deviate from the track, just 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:27.180
 A little bit, just a little bit is enough. Asteroids may advance at 10 km/s 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.419
 We want to change its speed 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:32.819
 About 2 mm / sec. 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.959
 So 10 kilometers, that is 10 times 1000 meters, that is 10,000 meters, 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.069
 One millimeter, which is one thousandth of a meter, 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.219
 So if you take one thousandth, you will be one thousand to ten thousand 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.019
 That is 100,000. You want to change the speed of one tenth of a million 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.109
 This is actually not very much 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.430
 But if you are an asteroid that is rushing to Earth 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.669
 And from 10,000 tons to 100,000 tons 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:06.779
 This does require a lot of force to change the speed of one-tenth of a million. 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:07.559
 Ok, then 

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:11.019
 How do we do it? The easiest way 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.340
 Is using a rocket, a big rocket, launched there. 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.940
 And hit it. Except because it is in space, it just happens (silence) like this happens 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.560
 Ok, this will change its speed a little bit. I will inform everyone now, 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.260
 In case it is not just a stone? If it is a pile of rocks 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.330
 Loosely combined by the original gravity? 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.470
 So if you hit them, they will only spread out, and you only get a rain of rocks 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.680
 This result is not good. So what about this? 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.990
 We will use a huge spaceship, this huge spaceship will go there 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.000
 Close to the asteroid 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.280
 Because it is close to it, then because of the mutual attraction 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.900
 You - the gravitation between the asteroid and me - the spaceship 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.670
 Will open a little asteroid 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.690
 Just a very small distance, or maybe it’s the same from the other side. 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.010
 This may work, but there are still problems 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.080
 We need a lot of fuel to supply for a few days, 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.600
 Weeks, months and years. 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.690
 If it stops running, you can't go out and fix it. 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.320
 So how about this -- laser? 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.830
 One group 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.160
 Solar powered laser 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.680
 Bombard the surface of an asteroid 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.720
 Years and months 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.960
 ZAP ZAP ZAP will make some asteroids, some rocks are evaporated 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.660
 Will produce a spurt, or generate momentum when something is ejected 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.250
 Just like rocket fuel, just like standing on a skateboard and trying 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.110
 Then a bowling ball... 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.610
 Doing so will 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.190
 The asteroid changes its speed. And you can put some lasers that can emit 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.660
 Spacecraft is sent to heaven 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.450
 If one of the spacecraft fails, you can use the other one. And you can 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.280
 Place them at different angles if the asteroid 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.540
 The shape is irregular (like this) 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.050
 You can shoot it on a smooth surface 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.420
 Then when there is a pit or depression, you turn it off 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.900
 Wait until the asteroid goes to the right side and reopen it. look, 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.570
 Just because it is unlikely, it doesn't mean it's not important 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.580
 You know, this can happen only once every few thousand years, but if it happens 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.110
 My watch (representative: when I live) 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.710
 It will say like the children: "It's bad." Well, we don’t want this to happen, we want 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.310
 Avoid this situation. 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.790
 Asteroids are a serious problem, but they are also exciting 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:47.260
 (Spacecraft noise) It is (silent) except that we are in space. 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.170
 Do you have a problem that needs to be solved? Then remember to subscribe to asapscience 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.850
 Follow us on Twitter and Facebook, this is what all kids are doing. 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.470
 If it is an asteroid, it may not be a problem in the burning (extremely solved), but 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.340
 An impactful problem, even 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.690
 Is an ablation problem
