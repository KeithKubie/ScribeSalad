00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.800
Hey what's up guys.
It's a new day and a new experiment.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.400
Now in a previous video,
you remember we took liquid nitrogen

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.100
and put them in water bottles
and made improvised nitrogen rockets.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.360
Apparently, some people figured out
you can do the same thing

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.100
using Coke and propane.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.100
So that's what we're doing today.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.500
Now in yesterday's video I showed you
how we could modify the nozzle

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.600
of one of these propane tanks
and extract liquid propane.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.000
And we went down to the store
and picked up twelve 500ml coke bottles

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.300
so we could mix them together
and watch the reaction.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.900
Now the funny thing about this experiment
is you don't actually have to use Coke.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.860
I'm just throwing it in because videos
with Coke seem to get more views.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.600
Let me explain the process
of whats about to happen.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.360
We're going to open the valve
of this propane cylinder,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.800
turn it upside down in a glass
and collect liquid propane.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.040
Then we're going
to take the cap off our coke bottle

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.500
and pour out a bit
of the liquid until it's just

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.200
under the line of the label itself.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.700
From there, it's just a matter of pouring

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.720
in a bit of liquid propane
so it sits on top,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.400
and turning the bottle upside down.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.200
Hahaha. You ready?

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.600
Moment of truth.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.740
Whoops.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.600
Fail. Look at that. [laughs]

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.860
What the heck?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.400
That didn't work at all.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.740
Maybe we need more propane.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.100
Look at the top of the Coke there
when the propane hits it.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.300
It freezes and starts gumming up.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.000
It smells terrible.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.480
It seems to form a layer of ice here,

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.800
so I have no idea
if this is going to work,

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.500
but the idea is that we just turn it over.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.100
Hah! And look.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.000
It just spills out of everywhere.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.600
Look at that. It's just all icy,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.300
and nothing happened at all.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.040
Fail. what the heck. [laughs]

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.700
Ah! It's freezing my fingers.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.040
Whoo, frosty. Yeah!

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.920
Let's see if we can make this work.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.300
Ready?

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.700
Nothing.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.800
I'm starting to lose confidence
that this actually works.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.300
And those videos I saw...

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.400
I don't think they were using propane,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.200
but they could have been using butane.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.600
Huh.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.200
Let's try one more time just to be sure.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.300
If this doesn't work,
I don't know what will.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.320
Whoo.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.740
There you go.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.700
Oh boy.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.500
Haha, look at that.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.000
Put the fire out with the coke.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.000
I went through five bottles of propane
and a number of various experiments

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.800
and we didn't get any of them to work.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.900
So it kind of makes me wonder
in the videos I saw,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.800
maybe these guys were using butane
instead of propane?

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.700
Maybe that makes a difference,
I'm not sure.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.100
But based on my experiments today,

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.600
I don't think mixing propane
and Coke has any kind of reaction at all.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.500
The Coke just freezes,
that's really about it.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.220
Now I don't want to let you
go home empty-handed

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.600
so for one final experiment,

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.100
we're going to try filling up
this coke bottle

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.800
with liquid propane
and screwing the cap on tight.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.000
The question is,

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.700
is this thing going
to pressurize and explode?

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.500
Or will a Coke bottle actually be able
to contain liquid propane indefinitely?

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.000
Okay, I gotta put that down.
My fingers are freezing.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.200
Haha, look at that.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.200
Yeah, liquid propane can still
give you frostbite, guys.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.400
So frosty.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.500
So here we are, guys.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.500
We got this bottle half full of propane.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.600
You can see it rises above the label there.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.400
And the thing that I noticed
right off the bat,

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.400
is how light the propane feels.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.440
I mean, this bottle is halfway full

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.500
and it feels like there's
barely anything in it at all.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.100
That's super surprising to me.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.880
So let's go ahead and cap this thing off,
put it in a safe place

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.040
and see whether or not
this thing will explode.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.620
So quick update.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.600
I just put the cap on the bottle
and I can still squish it,

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.180
which means it's not super pressurized.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.300
And when I shake it, it's almost
like it contracts even more,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.600
like it squishes it even more.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.020
Now I imagine over time,
this will warm up, it will pressurize.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.800
In fact, we could probably
take a blowtorch to it

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.600
and warm it up a little bit quicker.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.600
And when this thing gets to the point 
where I can't push my thumb into it,

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.040
I'm just going to set it down, leave it, 
and we'll see uh...

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.140
see what happens.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.340
I'm just going to leave this right here.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.800
Check this out, guys.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.000
It's been about 20 minutes.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.600
We've had this thing
sitting out long enough

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.400
that the propane has warmed up
to outside temperature here

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.600
which today is
about 45 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.900
The bottle is pressurized
but it hasn't warped and it's still

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.300
to the point where I can push my thumb in
and move the plastic a little bit.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.000
So I don't think this is going to explode.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.600
It seems that, theoretically, we can store

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.800
liquid propane in a Coke bottle.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.600
Probably not the safest idea
but it looks like you actually can do it.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.500
Okay, durability test.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.200
And it stays intact.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.800
That looks pretty cool.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.600
So sweet, guys.
Looks like it's a viable idea.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.200
A Coke bottle will hold liquid propane.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.900
We've dropped this thing,
we've warmed it up and uh,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.360
I think now, it's time to kill it off.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.500
Let's see what happens
when I take the cap off.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.600
Look, it starts bubbling.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.800
[gas releasing rapidly]

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.600
Whoa, that's crazy.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.480
And it started cooling down again as well.
Did you just notice that?

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.640
Alright let's light it off
and dump it out.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.400
Whoo! Toasty.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.800
Check it out!

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.600
Nice big ball of fire.
That's very satisfying.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.100
Very satisfying, very cool.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.000
Look it warped my Coke bottle.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.700
So guys, I just turned off
our propane bottle,

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.000
so we can summarize here
for a minute what we've just learned.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.100
We started off with a purpose to see
if mixing propane and Coke together

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.900
would make an improvised bottle rocket.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.000
But what we found actually happens
is the propane freezes the Coke,

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.520
preventing any significant reaction 
from taking place.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.360
We tried a number of variations
of experiments

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.200
to see if we could get it to work,
but all of those attempts failed.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.140
Oh boy.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.300
Next, we tried filling up one
of the empty Coke bottles themselves

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.500
with liquid propane
and screwing the cap on tight

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.900
to see if we could get it to explode.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.100
But rather than exploding
it actually warmed up

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.900
to the outside air temperature
and became a crystal-clear liquid.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.600
Very beautiful
and apparently very stable as well.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.720
We tried drop testing the bottle
for durability

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.200
and found that it stayed intact.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.460
So we unscrewed the cap, lit off the gas,
and poured it on the concrete.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.960
Well that's it for this set
of experiments, guys.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.000
Thanks for joining me and I'll be looking
for you in the next video.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.200
Talk to you then.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.200
Wouldn't that be great
if it just exploded in my hand right now?
