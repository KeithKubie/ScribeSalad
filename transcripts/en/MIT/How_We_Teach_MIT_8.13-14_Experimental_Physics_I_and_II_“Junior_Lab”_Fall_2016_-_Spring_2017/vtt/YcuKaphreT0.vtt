GUNTHER ROLAND: So at the
beginning of each semester,

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.550
I ask the students, what have
you heard about Junior Lab.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.470
And what I find is
that some of them

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.970
have been worried about having
to take the class since they

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.690
joined MIT as freshmen
even before they declared

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.800
their majors.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.170
And characterization that
I've heard multiple times

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.450
is that junior lab
is a black hole that

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.180
swallows up all available time.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.530
And this reputation
was not I would

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.240
say completely undeserved.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.540
It is a very challenging class
and it is very time intensive,

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.690
and you really have to
be very judicious in how

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.546
you invest your effort.

00:00:44.546 --> 00:00:46.170
On the other hand,
many of the elements

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.150
that we have introduced
in the last few years,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.130
like the flipping the
classroom, like rearranging

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.900
a lot of the
curriculum, really were

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:01.380
meant to address this
worry, and to really

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.820
preserve and maybe even purify
the essence of the class

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.480
while removing some of the
elements that really caused

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.512
a lot of students stress.

00:01:11.512 --> 00:01:13.470
And I think the best way
to see what we've done

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.600
is to really come and try
for yourself and I think join

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.930
many students who've found it
in the end a time consuming

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.400
but extremely
rewarding experience.
