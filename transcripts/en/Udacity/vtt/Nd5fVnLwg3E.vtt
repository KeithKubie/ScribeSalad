00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.719
Okay, before things get too complicated, it's time we clear

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.080
up something that could cause use trouble later, and may

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.290
be causing some of you some stress, if you have

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.010
any experience with chromosomes before. This picture that you saw

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.000
earlier is, in fact, a real picture of human chromosomes

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.720
from a cell. Let's focus in on this pair of

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.870
chromosomes here. They sort of look like big Xs don't

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.600
they. I were to draw them in cartoon form, this is

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.860
how I would probably try to represent them. And although this is an accurate

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.660
representation of what you see here, in reality this type of chromosome is

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.660
called a duplicated chromosome. It's called a duplicated chromosome, because

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.650
each side of the X is actually identical to the other side.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.680
And we refer to each of these sides as chromatids. In fact,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.740
because they're so identical, we refer to them

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.530
as sister chromatids. This chromosome over here also

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.690
has sister chromatids. So we have one pair

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.120
of chromosomes, one pair of Xs, and they

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.850
each are composed of sister chromatids, which are

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.670
duplicated strands of each other. However, most of

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.060
the time, chromosomes look like this instead. They

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.160
don't look like an X. They're just one,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.330
linear molecule. We call this a non-duplicated chromosome. This is what the pair

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.820
typically looks like in a cell.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.260
Remember, linear chromosomes are just double-stranded DNA

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:36.600
in one really long molecule, wrapped up in histones proteins, into a higher

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.790
order structure that looks like the chromosome

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.700
we're used to seeing. But after duplication,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.420
the double-stranded DNA is now copied and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.130
now there are two copies, two double-stranded molecules

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.390
of DNA. And they're joined together in the middle here. And this is what makes

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.000
them look like these big Xs over

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.740
here. And because they're genetically identical We call

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.240
these sister chromatids here, within this X.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.760
That's what the sister chromatids are. But we

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.900
still call the linear non-duplicated chromosome a chromosome,

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.990
and we call the duplicated version with sister

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.970
chromatids a chromosome. It's still a chromosome structure.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.710
The reason most pictures you've seen of chromosomes

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.270
look like this is because this is when

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.420
they're most condensed and easy to see. As

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.040
you can imagine, DNA is like a big

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.910
loose string that's really long inside a cell, and

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.980
it's normally sort of loosey-goosey hanging out, but when a

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.390
cell divides, it has to organize and get everything together

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.980
and choreograph to separate And so it condenses into these

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.980
beautiful organized structures that make it easy for us to

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.870
see. So a scientist will wait until a cell gets

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.570
to this point, and then it opens the cell up

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.600
to see the chromosome. And because we're at this stage,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.130
after the DNA's been duplicated, they look Like this x structure.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.790
But they can also look like this non x or just linear structure. Now, I want

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.420
you to tell me. Of the following 4

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.210
groupings of chromosomes. Which of the following represents 4

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.310
chromosomes? Either duplicated or non duplicated. Pick which

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.380
ones represent 4 chromosomes. There can be multiple answers,

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.210
or there may not, so I want you to check all the boxes that you think apply.
