00:00:00.972 --> 00:00:02.916
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.350
- Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.170
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.780
I'm Dean here at the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study,

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.340
and I am delighted to welcome
you all this afternoon

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.640
to a lecture by renowned
philosopher and anthropologist,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.290
Bruno Latour.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.250
At Radcliffe, we are dedicated
to inquiry and investigation

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.840
that transcends
disciplinary boundaries,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.600
tackles important issues, and
shares advance work widely.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.930
We support innovative research
through our fellowship program,

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.520
our conferences, world class
collections at the Schlesinger

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.980
Library, and more.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.510
We take particular pleasure
in co-sponsoring this event

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.850
with the Mahindra
Humanities Center,

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.780
our partner in encouraging
boundary-crossing work.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.900
And I'm glad to see so
many friends and colleagues

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.870
from across and beyond
the university with us

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.580
this evening.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.850
A leading UK publication in
the field of higher education

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.790
recently found that Bruno Latour
was the 10th most cited author

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.330
in journal literature, racking
up more references than Karl

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.210
Marx or Martin Heidegger.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.840
Even more impressive than
the raw number of citations

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.700
is the range of disciplines
where scholars have cited him.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.640
The influence of
Latour's work is

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.050
felt across fields
as wide-ranging

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.400
as technology, the
history of science,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.710
politics, and art history.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.150
Let me give you some examples.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.240
Latour's studies of Louie
Pasteur and laboratories

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.620
have deepened our insight
into how science is practiced,

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.640
examining not just the data
of scientific knowledge,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.750
but the social processes by
which that data is understood

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.700
by both scientists
and laypeople.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.000
Latour is the key founder of
actor network theory, which

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.030
argues that in order to
understand our larger systems,

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.240
whether a city, or a
nation, or a planet,

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.590
we must examine
the relationships

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.639
between multiple entities.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.720
We must understand
the interactions

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.080
between different
people to be sure,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.980
but we must also understand
how people, plants, animals,

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.540
objects, and places
influence each other.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.220
Actor network theory
has left its mark

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.440
on fields ranging from ancient
history to public health.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.400
When applied to a field
like urban planning,

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.650
actor network theory
takes the structures

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.360
that shape human
interaction and thinking

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.260
and makes them visible.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.070
Latour's illuminating
multimedia essay,

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.000
"Paris the Invisible City"
inspects the city with just

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.850
such a lens, zooming down
to the level of street signs

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.610
and traffic lights to
uncover, as Latour puts it,

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.540
the Parises within Paris.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.060
Latour invites us to examine
our assumptions and frameworks

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.240
with rigor.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.150
He questions what it
means to be modern

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.070
and complicates the way
we categorize objects.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.930
Today, Latour will
speak to us on a topic

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.440
both urgent and colossal, how
do we make sense of ourselves

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.190
and our planet in an age
of rapid climate change?

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.930
President Obama calls planet
warming terrifying, not just

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.580
for what it means for
ocean acidity, ice

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.560
caps, and ecosystems,
but for, as he puts it,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.870
and I quote him, "the strains
on cultures, on civilizations,

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.180
on nations."

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.080
And that is why we
need Bruno Latour.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.510
We have heard over and over
about what climate change might

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.150
mean for our national security
or our foreign policy,

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.370
but we do not stop to think
often enough about its impact

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.700
on culture and society.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.050
We live in an age many have
called the Anthropocene,

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.230
meaning an era in
which humanity has

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.600
shaped the planet on
an unprecedented scale.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.040
How can we square our previous
notions of human agency

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.100
with the current reality
and probable future in which

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.960
human inflicted
damage to the planet

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.930
overwhelms human
capacity to solve

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.260
the problems we have created?

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.820
How will our previous ideas
about nature, religion,

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.920
and science hold up?

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.590
And how must we reassess them?

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.790
Those are exactly the
types of questions

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.840
that Bruno Latour can help
us ask and begin to answer.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.500
His new work, which we
will discuss tonight,

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.730
wrestles with
these timely issues

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.990
across the disciplines of
anthropology, science, history,

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.780
and political theory.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.900
Because Latour's
writings have always

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.460
sparked so many
important conversations,

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.950
we wanted to be sure that
this event tonight captured

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.210
that critical back and
forth of scholarly exchange.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.030
We have thus assembled an
impressive set of scholars

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.370
to discuss these
and other questions

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.950
today after Latour speaks.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.380
And we are delighted to
have Homi Bhabha here

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.650
to moderate that discussion.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.480
Homi is the Anne F. Rothenberg
Professor of the Humanities

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.230
and director of the Mahindra
Humanities Center at Harvard.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.870
He is the author of The
Location of Culture,

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.750
an editor of the
Nation and Narration,

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.830
among many other works.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.570
He is a distinguished
and probing voice

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.610
to lead a conversation about
sovereignty, globalization,

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.480
climate change, and
other global developments

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.190
with pressing significance.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.670
Here's how this
evening will work.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.180
After Bruno Latour
delivers his lecture,

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.520
he will join Homi along
with our Harvard colleagues,

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.120
Peter Galison and Diane Davis
on stage for a discussion.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.210
Peter is the Joseph Pelligrino
University Professor

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.990
of Physics and director
of the Collection

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.490
of Historical Scientific
Instruments at Harvard.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.220
Diane is the Charles Dyer Norton
Professor of Regional Planning

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.770
and Urbanism and chair of the
Department of Urban Planning

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.050
and Design at the Harvard
Graduate School of Design.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.420
So I'm very grateful to
Homi, Peter, and Diane

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.590
for joining us here today.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.100
So now, I ask you to
join me in welcoming

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.720
Bruno Latour to the stage.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.670
- Thank you very much for
the nice introduction.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.370
Thank you very much for
the citation by Obama.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.810
It's always nice to me.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.170
And also, in spite of
what Obama says, yesterday

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.000
in the debate between
Clinton and Trump,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.390
not once a good question
was about the climate.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:59.530
Clinton made just a very
brief allusion to the problem.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.240
So this is why I wanted to start
with this image I took when

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.520
coming here for
the plane, which is

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.900
a quite extraordinary
icepack screen in a sort

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.160
of quasi Muench-like way
coming from the plane

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.100
to remind you of what I'm
going to talk to you today,

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.460
which is not very nice.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.830
But as the dean said,
it's a way of trying

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.590
to re-articulate
many of the questions

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.580
inside the culture, which
is certainly impacted

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.580
by this big new problem for
which it's true that we are not

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.300
terribly well prepared.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.930
And Homi proposed as a title to
have all of these dotted lines,

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.190
because what I want to do is
to distinguish as much as I

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.980
can both different concepts.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.150
You need to know how I am
approaching this question.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.110
I'm coming from three
different angles,

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.550
because I think
three are necessary.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:50.970
One of them is speculative.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.290
This is a series of lectures
I gave at the Gifford Lectures

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.680
in Edinburgh a few years ago,
which is soon in English, which

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.850
is basically a study
according to Gifford's

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:04.060
principle in natural religion.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.220
And I thought it
was a good topic

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.560
to try to see what Gaia means.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.560
I mention that in a minute.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.850
Then there is also, since I'm
an historian and sociologists

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:16.940
of science, an empirical study.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.630
I'm studying a set of
scientists in basically

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.030
what could be
called geomorphology

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:28.480
or geobiomorphology, which I
will talk about in a minute.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.850
But also, even though I would
have less time for that, trying

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:37.470
to use art as a way to gain
some sort of sensitivity

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:40.760
to the question given that
one other thing we lack

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.000
to understand the
politics of the climate

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.050
is also the equipment, the
sort of sensitivity equipment,

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.000
which only art can provide.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.960
So one word on the
empirical part before I

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.650
get to the more complicated
section of his lecture.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:01.530
I'm studying people who
are calling themselves

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.840
critical zone
observatory network.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.600
It's a set of people, NSF
is financing some of them

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.700
in the US, and there are
many in China and in Europe,

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:16.810
who are trying basically to
equip watersheds most often

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.400
with as much
equipment as possible

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.220
to make sure that we
begin to understand what

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.510
the critical zone is for them.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:27.450
It is the top of the canopy
to the deep rock behind, which

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:32.060
is basically all of
life form and to try

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:36.800
to gain some sort of precise
knowledge, which in fact, we

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.810
discovered, and I
discovered studying them.

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:41.930
We don't have about
complex reaction

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.580
of weathering the soil, the
transformation of the soil,

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.740
and all of the
other entities which

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:51.610
are summarized very nicely
in this beautiful drawing

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.230
by Paul Duvingeaud.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.140
And what I'm interested
in is especially

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.800
to try to understand how these
different groups of scientists

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.000
spread around the world build
what you could call feedback

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.480
loops to make us the
science first, but then also

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.280
the general public
around this watershed

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.870
sensitive to the
effect of the action

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.360
on the space in which we are.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.044
In fact, we realize, and I
realize [INAUDIBLE] scientists.

00:10:19.044 --> 00:10:20.460
But it's extremely
difficult to be

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.280
sensitive to what
happened to the land,

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.410
and to the territory,
and the soil we inhabit.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:28.850
So this is a nice example.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.950
This is one of the
observatories [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:36.090
in the top of a
mountain in California.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:38.420
And there is almost
no connection

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.040
strangely enough between
the observatory, which

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.620
is on the top of the mountain.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.230
It is green and somewhat
wet, not this year,

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:46.590
but it used to be wet.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:48.700
And then you have a
Central Valley completely

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.100
flat, completely polluted,
a completely different

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.610
environment where you have a
main agrobusiness of the United

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:56.630
States, as you know.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:00.060
But the connection between the
two, the input in the Sierra

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.920
and the output in the
water is so deficient

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.580
that actually people pump their
fields out against one another

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.020
until there would
be no water left,

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.240
at least if a drought goes on.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.610
So I'm interested in a
way a group of scientists

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:16.870
are trying to build
the instrumentation

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:22.190
to render sensitive the
presence and the lack of water

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:26.370
in the top with what the
scientists, and engineers,

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.730
and agrobusinesses
do in the bottom.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.490
As you see in the bottom
left, bottom right, sorry,

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:34.510
these are some of
the immense pumps,

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:37.410
which actually have no meters,
which is an interesting case.

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.320
There is no meter in California.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.260
So you can use as much
water as you wish.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.920
So the building of those
loops if you imagine

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.380
the whole ignorance in which
we are about the reaction

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.780
not only of the
Earth in general,

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:53.100
but every one of
these set ups, is

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.180
as if we had to build
some haptic device

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.070
to render sensitive
to our action, which

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:04.180
is of course the whole problem
of ecological in general.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:08.160
Now, what is interesting is that
the critical zone observatory

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.250
can take a slightly
larger meaning.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.610
To mean and hear the
word critical in the sort

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.480
of technical sense means
the fragile and far

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.350
from equilibrium very
thin layers inside which

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:22.710
everything in life exists.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:26.560
This is a quote
by Tim Lenton, one

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.530
of the student of Jim Lovelock.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.820
"For many Earth
systems scientists,

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.780
the planet Earth
is really comprised

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.790
of two systems, the
surface system that

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:40.370
supports life and the great bulk
of the inner Earth underneath.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:44.050
It is a thin layer of the system
at the surface of the Earth,

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.310
and it's remarkable
property that

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.370
is the subject of my work"
and the work of the Earth

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.210
scientist.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:53.200
Now, this is quite
interesting to try to imagine

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.230
how these thin layers exist.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.140
And I'm being
completely obsessed

00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:02.390
by the difference between the
vision we have of the group

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:05.850
and the vision we have of
this thin layer when we follow

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:10.760
the work of these
geoscientists and what

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.070
those I call, somewhat
affectionately,

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:14.850
critical zoneists.

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:17.540
And this is actually
fairly difficult.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.610
This is why it's always
interesting to relate also

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:23.910
to the artist, and this
is part of a project

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.920
that I have with
geoscientist and artist

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.920
to try to represent, to give a
feeling for what it is to think

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.840
of the Earth as thin layers.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.410
They sometimes talk about the
skin given some of the varnish,

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.490
not the whole
nature, but something

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:41.230
which is much smaller, much
more fragile, and much thinner.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:44.970
And here the artist,
Alexandra Arenes

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:48.490
tried to use cadmium
layers of trees

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:50.590
were trying to imagine
what it could be.

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:52.720
But it's, of course,
very difficult to think

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:58.210
of these thin layers
in any sensible way.

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:01.512
I cannot resist showing you
this little work of art by Sarah

00:14:01.512 --> 00:14:05.890
Sze, which I've seen
a week ago in New.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:08.610
York.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:12.780
It was an amazing piece
where there is precisely

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.680
no clear geometry,
but you are still

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.790
surrounded by the
multiplicity of entity which

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:23.860
she has assembled to describe
as complex and difficult a way

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:28.290
what it is to be in
this critical zone.

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:31.240
But sorry, this
is my own camera.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:36.400
I'm trying to get a peek at this
work, which is not yet shown.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.940
And I propose to code it
since the work is still

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.930
entitled critical
zone, because it's

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:43.330
too beautiful to be not used.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:49.300
OK, so the reason why this
work by the geoscientists

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.370
seemed to me so
interesting is because it

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:56.140
reopened a sort of
critical leverage

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.500
against the notion of a globe.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.770
The global is actually
something we immediately

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:02.437
associate with the
ecological question,

00:15:02.437 --> 00:15:04.520
and it's killing us,
basically, because every time

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.200
you have a global, and you have
to absorb the idea that it's

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.870
a global phenomenon,
and people make

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.650
these big gestures
with their hand,

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:13.590
yes, OK, but that's the
size of a pumpkin, right?

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:15.180
I mean it's not much bigger.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.200
And in fact, we are
always lost in this globe,

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.280
and we don't know
how to handle it.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.880
So there's a very
clear sense in which

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.830
we need to feel
something else and have

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:29.480
another imagination or another
mythological imagination,

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.540
and also scientific, to
try to capture something

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:36.121
which has been criticized
so excellently by Peter

00:15:36.121 --> 00:15:36.620
Sloterdijk.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.400
Of course, in the Whole Earth
Catalog, which is now many,

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.810
many years ago, we were
supposed to be all unified

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.880
by this notion of a
blue planet, right?

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.050
The image of a blue planet.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:49.660
Every book about ecology
says since the blue planet,

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.640
we know we are in the same
place, and we are all united.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.360
And politics is now a
sort of unanimous activity

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.590
as we all know.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.460
And it has been a
complete failure.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:01.240
The more we get into
ecological questions,

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.960
the more dispute and
strife increases.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.270
So the idea that we
are united by the globe

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.650
is actually a misreading
of the blue planet.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.120
And of course, the image
is also a misreading

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.310
of the blue planet conceived
as a critical zone,

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:17.320
because it sees far apart
and from the outside,

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:21.260
and we are inside the layers,
and we see it laterally,

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:22.190
so to speak.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.210
So there is nothing
more wrong, in a way,

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:26.570
than the image of a blue planet.

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:30.300
And it's also associated, as
Peter Sloterdijk has shown

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.830
in the second volume of his
work on the globe, [INAUDIBLE],

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:35.680
sorry, that's the
second tome, me

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.210
is called Globe with
too many globes.

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:39.720
There is the Roman Empire.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.970
There are large numbers of
religious images associating

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:47.620
the [INAUDIBLE] with the
power and the domination

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.550
of a Christian God.

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.030
And of course, there
are many other types

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.860
of globes which are
layered on top of this one.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.970
So whenever we have
the globe as a sort

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:04.579
of very powerful metaphor, we
are sort of squashed, as Atlas

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:08.050
and literally
flattened by the weight

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:10.980
of this huge globe, which
is supposed to be taken out.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.530
Even with the notion
of Anthropocene

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:14.900
the dean mentioned,
that's precisely

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.410
from the agent of
history able to live

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:20.119
at the time of the Anthropocene
does not really exist.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:24.079
It's not a [INAUDIBLE],
all of little human

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:27.369
that were here in this
room and 8 billion others.

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:31.120
So there is a real problem
of, how could I say,

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.050
imaginary metaphysic,
if you want,

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:37.110
how to describe
agency at the time

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:41.400
so that the globe doesn't
crush us, so to speak.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.580
And there's another
question with global,

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.560
which I find extremely
disturbing is

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.540
that globalization-- the
word global in globalization

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.820
means to entirely
different elements.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.060
One of them is,
of course, a sort

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.150
of very classic, very
traditional, and in a way,

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:59.980
quite beautiful cartographic
principle, which

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:05.110
registers with a very simple
principle of longitude

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.000
and latitude, as
many differences as

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.920
possible, as the whole of
geography has been able to do.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.140
It's map differences.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.880
And the more differences
are multiplied

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:18.360
even because they are registered
with a very simple idiom.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.500
But globalization also means
exactly the opposite, which

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.630
is the extension of the very
tiny provincial small numbers

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:30.750
of settled cliches, so to speak,
extended to the whole planet.

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:33.590
So you never know when people
are against globalization,

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:36.550
if they are against the
globalization conceived

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.875
according to the
cartographic globe,

00:18:38.875 --> 00:18:41.420
or if they are actually doing
something entirely different,

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.070
which is resisting,
maybe some good reason,

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:47.780
the extension of the
cliched, standardized, very

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.850
simple provincial definition
of what it is a human, how

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:53.950
to calculate selfishness,
for instance, self-interest,

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:59.050
and how to establish the
calculation of a common life,

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:02.160
which means that actually
one of the questions

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.680
why the notion of globalization
is so diverse, if you want,

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.790
when we are right now
in the press always

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:12.670
talking about people who
are voting strangely,

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:16.640
because they are left down or
left over by globalization.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.740
Which one?

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.480
Is globalization an extension
of the numbers of difference

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.470
which register or
simplification and, in a way,

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:25.990
an impoverishment
of a difference.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:27.720
And I think it's
a serious point.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.540
But the second difficulty
with the global

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.450
is of course to understand
the life forms, which

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:37.275
are themselves composing this
very thin critical zone with,

00:19:37.275 --> 00:19:40.960
as we know, from Jim Lovelock's
work and many others of system

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.960
scientists is actually
resisted and made

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:47.870
to be a critical zone by the
exchangers and overlapping

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:52.760
of all the entities, which are
composing the life form-- which

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.310
are composing the
critical zone, sorry.

00:19:55.310 --> 00:20:00.300
So this is what I call the Gaia
problem, which of course, Gaia

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.950
is a very complex
set of metaphors.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:07.650
It's difficult
and old mythology.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:09.130
And it's not sure
that Lovelock was

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:12.150
right in using this
old mythological term.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:15.000
But I think it's
very interesting

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.770
to have precisely in
the hands of Lovelock,

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:24.240
speaking of early Lovelock,
because now, he is a bit old.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:29.730
We will all be at the end-- not
to say senile, to be polite.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:33.440
But what is interesting is that
precisely a mythical figure,

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:37.850
and a scientific figure, and
a disputed figure, and also

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:41.430
a source of strange
religious cults as well.

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:43.501
I'm not that much
interested in the cult part,

00:20:43.501 --> 00:20:45.750
but I'm very interested in
the link between metallurgy

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:47.520
and science, because
exactly what we need,

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.080
which is a sort of set of
concepts which allows us

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:55.430
to gain the grasp on the
non-global and yet overlapping

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:58.000
and connected set
of entities that

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.410
is a great innovation for
me of Lovelock and friends

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:07.340
and very important
contributor Lynn Margulis.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:11.890
And I wrote a paper
in Culture and Society

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:14.630
against, to give you an idea
of the difficulty of what

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:19.450
I call the Gaia problem,
of a book by a Earth system

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:24.400
scientist called
Toby Tyrrell, who

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:29.410
makes a scientific critique
of Gaia, of Lovelock,

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:34.990
by using precisely a globalist
model of what the Earth is

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:35.860
like.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.545
And it's a small
technical point,

00:21:37.545 --> 00:21:38.920
but I think it's
important to see

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.220
the extent of which
the notion of globe

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:46.410
makes us unable to have
the political agency

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:49.280
necessary to handle the
ecological crisis, a very

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.540
small, but very
interesting example.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:55.240
So Tyrrell is actually
reusing in his book,

00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:00.290
Against Lovelock, a completely
traditional metaphor, which has

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:01.950
nothing scientific about it.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:07.070
It's as old as the fable of the
members [INAUDIBLE] of which

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:08.680
there are many versions.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:12.520
And he says when
Lovelock talks about Gaia

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:16.780
is actually supposing that
there is a super organism, which

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:20.710
is called Gaia, which as a
sort of providential character

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:25.250
and is governing the
life forms under it.

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:28.400
And the whole strangeness
of the argument

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.710
is that it's actually a
fable from political science

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:33.820
and political scientists
know it very well,

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:37.170
imported into Earth system
science to criticize,

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:40.370
in this case, Lovelock,
which never said that.

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:42.490
So it's a series of
misunderstandings,

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:44.780
which I find extremely
enlightening,

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:48.080
because it comes precisely for
someone who says I'm giving

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.090
a scientific critique
of a mythical argument,

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:52.640
which has been
made by Lovelock ,

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:55.630
as if Lovelock had actually
imagined that there was life

00:22:55.630 --> 00:23:00.814
and that life was actually
leading the life forms,

00:23:00.814 --> 00:23:02.980
which is, of course, often
associated with his name,

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:03.938
but he never said that.

00:23:03.938 --> 00:23:05.660
Let me read just two
quotes. "Lovelock

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.670
suggests that life has
had a hand on the tiller

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:10.250
of environmental control."

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:12.750
I love his expression
of a tiller, which

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:16.590
is of course literally
a cybernetics metaphor

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:20.010
and which proposes that there is
super order, which is actually

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:23.810
adjusting, like a
thermostat, the life form.

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:27.200
"And intervention of life in
the regulation of the planet

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:31.220
has been such as to promote
stability and keep condition

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.340
favorable to life," which
is quite extraordinary,

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:38.570
as if you had something further
on top of all the overlapping

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:42.370
entity, which could
super state, if you want,

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:46.380
with a state metaphor, imposed
by biologists or Earth systems

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.510
scientists, to criticize
someone who never said that.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.430
"A well-regulated
planet could hardly

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.330
be blamed for being buffeted
about by the vagaries

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:56.550
of celestial mechanics
and collision

00:23:56.550 --> 00:24:00.110
and can even be congratulated
for its multiple recoveries

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:03.169
from the terrible devastation
of extraterrestrial impact."

00:24:03.169 --> 00:24:04.960
And here you see that
the figure of a state

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.940
is actually a divine figure
coming straight from religion.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.910
That's why it's always
complicated to talk

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:13.160
about the science of
ecology, because you never

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.780
know if you're talking about
science, theology, politics,

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.580
and if it's not the metaphor
of a state, which is actually

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:22.410
sneaked in everywhere when we do
have a pumpkin jesters of let's

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:23.740
think globally.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:27.400
So this is why we have to be
careful of pumpkins in general.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:33.296
Philosophically, and I'm
also interested in this part,

00:24:33.296 --> 00:24:36.330
of course, in my own
work on actual network

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:40.480
theory is that the very
notion that ecology is made

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.820
of parts and a whole,
which has been,

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:47.240
of course, a bane of
the notion of ecosystem,

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.637
is actually something which
is largely an artifact,

00:24:50.637 --> 00:24:52.470
I mean, in the literal
sense of an artifact.

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:54.760
It's actually a
technical metaphor,

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.180
which is used to understand
biological forms.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:01.750
But biological forms are
not made of parts and whole.

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.260
They are actually
overlapping entities.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.330
And those overlapping
entities are actually

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:08.347
not well understood if
you say it was part,

00:25:08.347 --> 00:25:09.930
and then you have
all the little part,

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:12.460
and then you have something
which is not in any of a part,

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:15.660
but of which is superior to
all of them, a sort of plan,

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:20.300
and we are about 1 centimeter
from a divine intervention

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:20.990
here.

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:22.970
And again, it's an
artist who's very

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:26.790
good at showing that, Damian
Ortega, because he showed

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:30.666
in an ironic way that, in
fact, even for cars, it

00:25:30.666 --> 00:25:33.120
is a Volkswagen
Beetle, even for cars,

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.180
you never have actually
part and whole.

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.420
I had the pleasure of
writing a whole book

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.470
on a subway, automated
subway on his question,

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:43.220
because the very
way in which you

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:45.890
invent if you are an
engineer and invent

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:47.770
a highly complex
technical process

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:50.110
is you actually
always need to have

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:52.980
the interconnection and the
overlapping of the parts.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.150
It's only when the
technology is actually

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:57.900
ready to be discarded
that you can extract

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:01.010
the part from the
activity of the engineers

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:03.720
as Simondon has so well shown.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.960
So the key question is
that of overlapping entity.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.970
If we take the
Margulis-Lovelock seriously,

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:14.680
we have a very different
view of the parts and whole.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:18.080
We have entirely
selfish entities,

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.380
except they cannot decide
where the limit of the self is

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:25.740
and that the key invention of
Margulis at the small scale,

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:29.010
as you know, and
Lovelock the large scale,

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:32.440
which is that very definition
of a boundary of a self is

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.630
precisely [INAUDIBLE]
of life forms,

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:38.120
including boundaries of
a critical zone itself.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.570
So if that begins to give
you a handle of the question

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:45.670
I was interested in,
of the notion of globe.

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:48.550
And this is actually a
very interesting paper

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:51.770
by Scott Gilbert, who took
a title of one of my book,

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:55.600
but differently, and who wrote
a symbiotic view of life.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.230
We have never been
individuals and introduced

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:01.330
the notion of holobiont,
which is taking up

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:03.720
some part of biology
right now that always

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.900
with the same
question, if we are not

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:09.730
part and whole, but overlapping
entity, what becomes

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:12.020
of the great question
of sovereignty,

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:16.490
which has been imported from
political science and mythology

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:21.040
inside biology and which is
now resisted by biologists

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.116
like Gilbert and many
others to say, no, no, no,

00:27:23.116 --> 00:27:24.490
parts and whole
has nothing to do

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:28.710
with the way life
forms actually develop.

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:32.590
And that's where the question
of sovereignty at all scales

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:37.080
and for all entities began to
be really interesting for me.

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.850
And that's where
I was completely

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:42.880
stupefied reading the article
of Nature, the first time when

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:47.430
Nature is actually talking about
the notion of Anthropocene,

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:52.110
with, as you might know, a very
interesting date of 1610, which

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:56.640
is directly related to American
history and the ecocide

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.150
and the genocide of Indians.

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:02.880
But it's of a figure which I
want to mention for a minute.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.150
This is a very strange
figure, which is completely

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:08.781
made of overlapping entities,
which is, of course,

00:28:08.781 --> 00:28:10.280
I mean it's not a
great work of art.

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.494
But it's interesting to see.

00:28:11.494 --> 00:28:12.910
But it's made of
all these things,

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:16.026
because no one has any idea of
what the Anthropocene agent is.

00:28:16.026 --> 00:28:17.400
So if we put all
of them together

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.690
in a sort of blind giant made
of many different techniques

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:25.340
in which sort of walks
blindly on the stage.

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:28.630
And I could not
make the connection

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:32.170
with Hobbes's frontispiece
of the Leviathan,

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:33.810
except it's exactly
the same problem.

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:36.990
I mean, it's a set of problems
around the notion of how

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:40.110
do we assemble all those
different type of entity,

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:42.450
except in the case
of Hobbes's, it's

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:44.870
built an order and a
definition of state

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:48.090
and a relation between the
state of nature and the state.

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:50.750
But on the other side,
it's a complete mess.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:53.050
It's a mixture of
all sort of entity,

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:55.180
which absolutely nothing
to tempt whatever,

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:59.640
and who are simply overlapping
in the most chaotic way.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:03.970
So of course, if we wanted to
imagine what it is that a task,

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:10.980
the multidisciplinary task of
artists, political scientist,

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:13.370
et cetera, it would be
something like that,

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:18.830
which is to try to re-imagine
three centuries later what does

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:23.470
it mean to reorganize the whole
polity around the classical

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:27.690
question that Hobbes had
invented and designed

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:30.580
and ordered, so to
speak, in the middle,

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.570
not in of an ecological crisis,
but of something we cannot

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:36.780
ignore either, namely
the religious war.

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:40.550
What is the God,
Supremely authority,

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:43.020
which is supposed
to be leading us?

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.630
What is type of knowledge
we can't account for?

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:48.480
And here, of course, I
substituted the frontispiece

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.930
to use, the famous book by
Shapin and Schaffer, Leviathan

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:54.020
and the Air-Pump.

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.620
What is the type of
people we assemble?

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.200
This question of agency at
the time of the Anthropocene

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.765
is completely open.

00:30:00.765 --> 00:30:02.780
Who is the new agent of history?

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.135
What is the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:07.750
We learn the type of order and
the type of principle of law.

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:09.550
Is it a return of natural laws?

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:11.700
Something much more
stranger than that?

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:15.240
And, of course, the cosmos that
is the distribution of agency,

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.660
which is at the heart of all
the work of us many of you

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.460
probably do as well, which
is this extraordinary

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.750
redistribution of agency
now that we have become,

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:26.390
in part, forces of nature.

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:30.090
And as Oliver Morton said
in a nice recent book

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:34.820
on Planet Remade, he
said in the Anthropocene,

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:37.080
the anthropos is supposed
to be a force of nature.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.180
But the definition of
the force of nature

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.502
is that is beyond human power.

00:30:41.502 --> 00:30:42.960
So if this is the
sort of situation

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.760
in which we all find ourselves.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.100
But the task is that
any [INAUDIBLE] and also

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:54.480
of interest, as interesting at
the time of Hobbes' Leviathan.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.810
So this is why I wanted
to get into this argument

00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:03.410
with the nice dotted lines
that Homi has proposed

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:09.550
to me as a title, there is no
great surprise as why politics

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:13.920
is slightly disoriented,
because the notion of where

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:18.850
we are-- globe, nature,
Earth, critical zone is open.

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:22.610
When we are in the Anthropocene,
this is still undecided,

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:26.580
it's a great suspense that
geologists and stratigraphers

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:28.550
are keeping us in.

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:31.061
We said, we are not going to
decide before two more years,

00:31:31.061 --> 00:31:33.060
and then two more years
later, they say, no, no,

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.210
we are not going to decide
before two more years.

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:37.230
And here we are,
8 billion people

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:40.500
waiting to know which
zeitgeist we are in,

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:44.530
which is I think a very
unusual-- zeitgeist defined

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:45.390
by stratigraphers.

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:47.090
I think it's the
first time actually.

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:48.970
But we are lost.

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:50.220
We are disoriented.

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:54.550
So this is my little attempt
at trying to find another way

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:56.080
to orient ourselves.

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.610
And here, I think
one of the ways

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:02.600
to try to capture the difference
between the globe in all

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.410
these definitions and this Earth
understood as a critical zone

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:09.650
and not as nature, which
is too big a concept,

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:14.710
is to imagine a sort of diagram
triangulation like this one.

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:17.000
It seems to me that much
of a debate, including

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.230
in this election, and,
of course, my big example

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:22.980
is the terrible
event of a Brexit,

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.180
because I speak as
a European here,

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:29.060
is that people are agitating
between two poles which

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.870
have organized
politics for very long.

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:35.260
One of them is global
in all its definition.

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:37.460
We are supposed to
move to a global view,

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.890
and we are supposed
to be ascending

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:43.480
towards some sort of
universal horizon,

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:50.280
and somewhat, I don't know
how, many people begin to doubt

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:53.120
that the globe actually exists.

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.980
So what we see, and it's
very striking to see

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:58.182
that we see that here,
but we see it, of course,

00:32:58.182 --> 00:32:59.890
in Europe, everywhere,
in my own country,

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:02.400
in France, everybody
says, why, well,

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.130
if the globe is not
going to be there,

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:07.290
why don't we go back
to the land of old?

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:08.480
I call it the land of old.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.280
But of course, because it's
a complete imagination,

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.780
the France that
the National Front

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:15.110
want to imagine as normal
relation with anything

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:19.420
that Great Britain that
the Brexit want to gain.

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:22.090
I know now they found
the ultimate proof

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:23.690
that we are now
English again, which

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:28.130
is to have the royal
yacht being re-instituted.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:31.910
And you have a royal yacht,
they would think English again.

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:33.410
This is very strange.

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:36.740
But imagine what would
be America great again.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.530
It's, again, not
in this direction,

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:39.970
but probably something there.

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:42.040
Actually, Trump said it
exactly that yesterday,

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:45.480
that it was return, he
used the word return

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.040
to what America was.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.140
So we all are, of course,
organizing ourself

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:54.490
and establishing our position
of who is reactionary

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:57.110
and who is progressive
along this line.

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:59.890
But [INAUDIBLE] line has
no meaning if the two

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:03.495
poles attract the number
two and the number one

00:34:03.495 --> 00:34:06.000
are actually gone.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:06.750
And they are gone.

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:09.199
And this is what I think
is so interesting for me,

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:12.850
it belongs to the idea of a
climate conference in Paris,

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:16.270
is that when we had this
event, which was supposed

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:18.840
to be a great event,
actually it was 12 December

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:22.960
and not November, in
Paris, we had the COP 21st,

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.590
there was an amazing
diplomatic situation.

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:29.429
You had 189 nations
who had been asked

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:33.889
to make precise
projections of what

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:38.670
they will have as an
economy in 15 or 30 years.

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:41.150
So every nation wrote this.

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:43.429
I will do this, and I
will developed this way.

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:46.159
It was an innovation of
the French diplomacy.

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:48.880
So when you accumulate all
of these things together,

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.199
there is no planet
corresponding to this.

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:54.739
So it was very amusing
and very moving to see

00:34:54.739 --> 00:34:58.450
a diplomatic event
organized by United Nations

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:01.970
not looking at the common
rise of modernization

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:05.650
and the global, but realizing
that this horizon did not

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:10.160
exist, that there was no way
you could project and push

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:14.530
all of these 180 nation economic
project inside the closed

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:17.520
boundary and the
somewhat limited boundary

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.360
of the critical zone.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.020
So you had the
feeling, and here this

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:24.740
is the moment when we all
celebrate with great applaud,

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:26.650
and it's absolutely
normally to celebrate,

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:30.120
because it was a great
diplomatic success.

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.820
But what was also
moving is that you

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:35.990
saw some sort of new
authority, not a sovereign, not

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:38.230
a sovereign, but
something weighing

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:40.490
on the all the nations
for the first time

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:43.310
I think in modern
history in a way which

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:46.640
even the nuclear agreement
never actually had,

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.490
because it was not
all of a nation.

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:50.510
Here it was all of
a nation, feeling

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:53.960
the weight of an entity to
which, in some sort of way,

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:59.310
they bowed to, which is a very
interesting figure for what

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:02.330
I called Gaia, Gaia
as a simultaneously

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:06.220
scientific and now a
slightly more political body.

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.690
It's actually interesting
because Holland,

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:11.630
who is not known as
a great philosopher,

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:14.400
applauded and said,
viva la France!

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.171
Viva [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:16.171 --> 00:36:16.670
Sorry.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.840
Le Nations Unies!

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.250
Viva la planet!

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:24.400
How do you say viva?

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.530
Long live the planet, long
live the United Nations,

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:28.770
and long live France.

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:31.460
For France, the United
Nations is fairly normal,

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:34.270
because we are not supposed to
exist without being supported

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:35.660
by the planet.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:39.030
Long live the planet, as if
all these little men here

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:44.670
in Paris in [INAUDIBLE] where
by the applaud and actually

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:47.590
to hold the planet
alive a little further,

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:49.900
and that's true in
some sort of sense.

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:52.970
So it was a very moving moment
of political philosophy,

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:55.380
if I can say.

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:56.710
But what do we do now?

00:36:56.710 --> 00:37:00.230
How do we orient ourself if
we learn that the globe is

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:01.900
actually not there.

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:04.930
I often compare that to
as if we were in a plane.

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:06.990
We are in the plane
of modernization

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:09.850
going to the globe, and the
pilot says, well, I'm sorry.

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:13.290
But the globe is
not there anymore.

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:16.500
So the plane turns around and
goes back to the land of old,

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.100
because that's the
only one we know,

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:23.400
Brexit, Great Britain, France,
I mean, a small island where

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:25.900
of absolutely no
interest whatsoever

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:27.207
where it rains over time.

00:37:27.207 --> 00:37:29.790
And we go back there, but it has
disappeared, because the land

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:31.300
has disappeared as well.

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:32.970
So there's no way.

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:35.420
So the two utopias,
the two poles

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:37.740
on which we organize
our line, which

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.900
allows us to say this
one is reactionary,

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:43.320
this one is progressive,
have actually disappeared.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.920
And it's a very, I think,
a lot of the anxiety

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:49.320
and vacuousness of
present polities, I mean,

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.500
the loss of reason, of
course, but it's not

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:52.880
a question of populism.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.530
It's not a question of
people being backward

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:57.160
or not enlightened enough.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:01.250
It's yeah, really loss in
between these two attractors,

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:04.630
if I use the word,
which are themselves

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:07.620
known to be complete fiction.

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:10.260
So when people talk
about the passage

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:12.530
to a new era of
politics, which is

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:15.750
truth politics, or
post-truth politics,

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:19.300
when was politics truth
politics certainly not

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.150
in the idea that we
will all modernize

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:24.210
the planet with the same
horizon of the globe.

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:26.610
But there is a strange
feeling, which is everywhere,

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:29.242
if you read the literature
on how people react

00:38:29.242 --> 00:38:30.700
to the present
political situation,

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:33.510
but they have been
lied to in a way.

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:35.427
They have been betrayed.

00:38:35.427 --> 00:38:37.010
And it's true they
have been betrayed,

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:39.343
because they have been led
to transform their whole life

00:38:39.343 --> 00:38:42.310
to go to the globe, which
now people say, sorry,

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:43.650
this globe doesn't exist.

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:47.280
We would need, especially you
American people, five planets

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.740
to develop.

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:50.430
There is only one.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:53.870
So this is why it's interesting
to situate the third attractor

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:57.130
and to reorganize political
orientation including

00:38:57.130 --> 00:39:01.010
who is reactionary and who is
progressives, who is actually

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:03.610
late, and who is
advanced according

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:06.070
to this third attractor,
which I called

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:08.430
the Earth CZ to make
sure that you understand

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:09.700
that it's a layer.

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:13.780
It's very complex layers
of overlapping entity

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:17.100
of which we know in
effect fairly little,

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.760
but which is reorganizing
and allowing maybe

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:22.080
to land to another place.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.920
And this place is
very different.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:28.780
It's definition very different
in its political organization,

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:32.350
either from the globe or
from the old attractor

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:34.010
of the land of old.

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:36.890
It's new, of course, it's
completely reinvented

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:38.100
attractors.

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:41.190
So this is my interpretation
but, of course,

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:45.360
it's open for discussion
of the vacuity

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.870
and raucousness of politics now.

00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:52.440
It's a slightly more
charitable interpretation

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:55.030
than just lamenting
the decadence

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:56.950
of political argumentation.

00:39:56.950 --> 00:40:00.620
How do you want to act argue
about politics if there

00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:03.540
is no land, if there is
no territory, if there

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:07.190
is no soil about which all
of the issue of politics

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:08.970
are actually determined?

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:11.330
I did an exhibition
several years ago

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:15.210
about politics of things,
things politic, object-oriented

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:17.050
politics, and so on.

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:21.030
For that, you need issues, as
John Dewey very nicely said,

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:24.120
you need issues, driving
issues you need the land.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:25.060
You need the soil.

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:29.030
You need the precise definition
of where and when you are.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:32.116
But if you cannot tell people
where and when you are,

00:40:32.116 --> 00:40:33.740
it's not very surprising
they are lost.

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:36.830
And it's not very surprising
that whatever you say,

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:38.850
they think you are
actually lying.

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:40.350
So it is something
which has nothing

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:43.690
to do with people say
it's a loss of confidence

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:45.610
in expertise.

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:46.510
Yes, it might be.

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:49.650
But it is something more, I
think, existential than that

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:53.590
is that we are organizing
our political disputes, so

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:55.610
to speak, along a
line going from one

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:58.490
to two or from two to one
and accusing one another

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:00.890
to be globalist or reactionary.

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:05.270
But when the whole third
attractor is actually

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:07.450
weighing the whole
political definition,

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:10.090
except no one very
much talks about it,

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:14.310
and we talk nature and all sorts
of other things and interest

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:17.920
for nature, which
no one really gets

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.310
existentially interested in.

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:22.850
So I was very surprised and
interested by the debate

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:25.170
yesterday and the two other
debates, but especially

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:27.590
[INAUDIBLE], because
of the absence

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:30.190
of this third attractor,
which in spite

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:32.817
of the fact that, of course,
probably the millions of people

00:41:32.817 --> 00:41:35.150
who were watching will say,
wait a minute wait a minute,

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:38.660
the whole shift, we
are landing, and it

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:41.450
might be a hard landing on
a different planet, which

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:43.650
has a different
definition of a territory.

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:45.260
We are not sovereignty state.

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:46.990
And what was so
interesting in Paris,

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:49.610
it was not the
superposition of sort

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:52.244
of the typically
Westphalian state, which

00:41:52.244 --> 00:41:53.410
we were discussing in Paris.

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:55.410
They were all overlapping
because of the climate

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:56.570
question.

00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:59.730
And they were not talking
about some global power either.

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:02.770
They were not shifting precisely
in the path whole relation.

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:06.550
They were shifting out of the
sort of idea of a sovereignty

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:07.980
as a clear boundary.

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:11.060
And I think it's an
interesting, for me, at least,

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:12.020
very fascinating.

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:13.660
The actions of the
third attractor

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:15.740
is extremely interesting.

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:19.740
OK, so I will finish with an
example of this sort of thing

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:22.820
which mixes science, art,
and politics to give you

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:25.270
a little sense of
where I'm going

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:27.540
and maybe interested
some of you.

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:31.130
Before the COP in
Paris in December,

00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:33.160
we decided in my
school to organize

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.780
a simulation of
what, for many years,

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:37.460
I've called the
parliament of things.

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:42.210
But it is to organize a clear
dispute about the climate,

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:46.610
but organize under real
democratic principles.

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:49.970
And you see one example here is
that the kids were organizing

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:51.740
40 different delegations.

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.540
And some of the
delegations were actually

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:57.720
representing the [INAUDIBLE]
in a way which was actually

00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.770
interesting to watch.

00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:00.940
And to finish this
talk in time, I'll

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:03.210
give you just a few
minutes of the film, which

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:06.260
is sort of, I
would say, preview,

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:10.634
I think teasing--
teasing of an event.

- I'm pretty sure you agreed
to that earlier this morning,

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:13.110
because that line
hadn't changed.

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:13.790
Yeah.

- [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:15.770

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:18.424
But India was going to
agree to the agreement.

00:44:18.424 --> 00:44:19.340
I don't understand it.

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:29.120
- At the moment, we
are doing nothing, OK?

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.970
We are the generation
of climate change.

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:32.750
We will suffer it.

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:36.570
We have the responsibility to
act, not just us delegates,

00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:38.960
not just us functions,
but also as individuals.

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:41.696
I don't know what-- what
can we do about this?

[END PLAYBACK]

00:45:08.024 --> 00:45:09.440
- Though it was
just a simulation,

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:12.570
but it was quite interesting
for one technical point,

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:15.270
which some of you were here were
in government or constitutional

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:19.540
law would be interested is
that the very fact that you had

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:23.850
simultaneously state lobbies,
which were also present

00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:27.810
and non-human entities, the
former being of a nature,

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:32.771
represented by the voice of a
student organized in the same

00:45:32.771 --> 00:45:33.270
way.

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:38.080
Each delegation had five persons
representing each interest,

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.730
if you want, and sometimes
contradictory interests,

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:43.810
made an immense and
very interesting

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:46.380
difference in the way
the negotiation went on,

00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:47.890
because when the
nation state tried

00:45:47.890 --> 00:45:50.450
to organize themselves
and take a decision,

00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:54.530
for example, the ocean
was raising the and say,

00:45:54.530 --> 00:46:00.040
and then the president says,
ocean, two minutes, the United

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:04.340
States, two minutes, soil,
two minutes, oil industry,

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:05.280
two minutes.

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:08.980
The very fact that they were
all represented by the person,

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:12.290
to use the Hobbes expression,
the human speaking

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:14.660
in the name of interest,
changed completely

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:16.260
with where the
negotiation went on.

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:17.850
And it was a very
moving experience

00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:21.680
to see what is a complete
speculative idea, the ease

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:24.930
with which this principle
of representation

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:26.610
was actually possible.

00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:29.100
It was a great moment
for the kids, of course,

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:32.660
but it was a great moment
for me of basic research

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:35.630
if you accept or consider
basic research, the question we

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:37.930
are raising and have
raised in this talk, which

00:46:37.930 --> 00:46:42.420
are necessarily linking
speculative philosophy,

00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:43.730
science, and art.

00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:45.212
I thank you very much.

00:46:45.212 --> 00:46:46.700
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:56.230 --> 00:47:02.110
- Bruno, thank you very much
for a very stimulating, precise,

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:07.260
and yet, probing
discussion of the topic

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:10.970
that I asked you to speak
about and you so gallantly

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:14.310
spoke about it by leaving the
dots exactly where the dots are

00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:15.400
and not joining them.

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:20.090
So thank you for doing
that, because that actually

00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:25.600
increases our interest in
discussing the issue here.

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:29.620
Now, one of the
questions of agency

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:33.920
that I saw even right through
the-- right through your talk

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:39.220
was what you call describing
the modes of existence book

00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:41.420
as the notion of instauration.

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:43.870
You alone, and I like
that phrase very much,

00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:45.790
you alone have the
competence to do it,

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:48.230
but you don't know
quite how to do it.

00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:50.710
It is a fair problem
that you raise,

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:53.620
and I think that's an
extraordinarily important

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:55.100
issue, particularly
when you talk

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:58.630
about the whole notion of the
globalism aleatory problem,

00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:01.510
not as if it's
there or not there.

00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:05.680
Just before opening up, I just
wanted to say something in this

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:10.320
context, particularly in
relation to what you talked

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:13.030
about at the end, the
attractors, this first,

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:15.100
neither as you put
it, the neither/nor,

00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:17.910
what [? Le Conte ?]
called the [? vele ?],

00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:21.410
neither the Utopian or
neither the progressive nor

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:23.230
the regressive.

00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:28.790
In the absence of an actual
terror, an actual displace,

00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:34.530
I was wondering at that point
whether in fact terrorism

00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:39.620
has become this thing which
is either at once both totally

00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:43.670
utopic and yet totally
dystopic, life and death.

00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:45.530
You never know where
it's going to come.

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:50.040
It has a certain kind of viral
non-physicality about it.

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:52.920
And yet when it happens
in a particular place,

00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:55.070
then you know it
happened in that place.

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:56.870
And unfortunately,
the state always

00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:59.650
runs behind by
trying to then secure

00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:00.880
the airport or something.

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:02.810
And so it seemed
to me that there

00:49:02.810 --> 00:49:10.060
was an emerging third attractor,
which is the notion of terror,

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:12.990
which is the notion of
security, not just surveillance,

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:16.640
but go back to Hobbes or
more general phenomenological

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:20.490
existential notion of security.

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:24.050
And even with the ISIS,
as we heard yesterday,

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:28.220
I think this third attractor was
very much in the conversation

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:31.340
yesterday when that section
of the conversation, which

00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:33.960
they called, I think,
the hot spots or troubled

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:34.910
spots in the world.

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:35.640
- Conversation.

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.690
- Or dialogue.

00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:42.210
But this whole issue that you
described it is existential,

00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:46.020
and I just wondered whether
this whole instability

00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:49.460
of terror, not Westphalian even
though they wanted caliphate.

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:51.960
Individuals, you don't
know exactly where it's

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:54.960
coming from, when it will
appear, when it will not,

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:58.640
the contingency, whether
that is something

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:02.880
which overcomes the first
and second attractors,

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.930
this sort of polarization.

00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:07.530
It's another kind of
relationality between part

00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:10.016
and whole where the
problem of iteration--

00:50:10.016 --> 00:50:11.640
you never know when
it's going to come,

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:16.350
but it will come somewhere, some
place, not today, not tomorrow,

00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:18.802
in Amsterdam, maybe
not in New York.

00:50:18.802 --> 00:50:20.510
Anyway, I just thought
I would throw that

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:26.420
in as a response to that
very interesting final point.

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:31.780
But today, my role is not
to engage you directly,

00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:34.300
but to engage my
wonderful colleagues.

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:38.010
So let me ask Peter
and Diane to speak.

00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:40.470
And then if there
is a little time,

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:43.900
I can add a third attractor
somewhere in there.

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:52.510
- First, thank you, Bruno, for
a wonderful talk and a talk

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:54.990
that builds on a great
number of other works

00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:59.950
that you've been assembling
over the last years.

00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:04.310
And I think that one of the
remarkable features of what

00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:08.760
you've been after has been
to try to join rather,

00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:11.080
as the slide that you
showed early on indicates,

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:17.020
the artistic, the philosophical,
and the pragmatic attention

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:22.620
to the nature of scientific
and technical work.

00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:25.750
I'd like to just
point to three areas

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:29.150
where I think there's tremendous
interest in what you've

00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:29.650
been up to.

00:51:29.650 --> 00:51:32.770
The first is on the
local and the global.

00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:37.650
Much of your concern with
Gaia at a philosophical level

00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:39.700
has been as a
critique of the notion

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:43.510
that we can go in a simple
assembly, kit-like way

00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:47.360
from parts, add to
the glue of relations,

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:51.060
and come out with
some kind of whole

00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:54.120
and that this kind
of assembly kit

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:58.380
picture of the
nature of the world

00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:00.880
is getting us into
all sorts of trouble

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:07.460
with the environment broadly
conceived in the planetary,

00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:10.070
more particularly.

00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:13.310
In picture of the
Gaia, the Anthropocene

00:52:13.310 --> 00:52:18.530
has emphasized what makes the
fundamentality of the human

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:20.410
to the scientific
in the separation

00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:26.000
of the human local culture from
a universal picture of nature

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.000
particularly problematic.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.800
And I think that this
emphasis that you've

00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:40.160
put on getting at the ontology
of our approach to Gaia

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:44.690
is important, because in a
flipped version of Kundera's

00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:47.360
book, The Unbearable Lightness
of Being, there is in a way,

00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:49.430
I think you're pointing
to the unbearable weight

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:53.380
of metaphysics and
that we often impose

00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:56.990
in our metaphysics a picture
on the world that drives

00:52:56.990 --> 00:53:00.250
our politics, our science,
and our inability sometimes

00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:05.730
to understand nature
broadly conceived or Gaia.

00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:08.440
That is to say if we think
that the world is made up

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:12.360
of a kind of billiard-ball
Newtonian physics,

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:16.410
we're not going to understand
a great deal of why,

00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:18.480
for instance, we
need anthropology,

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:22.010
or the other human sciences,
or the arts in understanding

00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:24.160
our situation if we
see the Anthropocene as

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:28.480
fundamentally and inextricably
implicated and imbricated

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:32.460
with the human, then
in contrary to that,

00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:35.190
we have a better shot at
dealing with the world

00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:38.280
that we have and are
altering so fundamentally.

00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:41.870
This brings us to the second
point that I wanted to make

00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:45.290
and that is that the unbearable
weight of metaphysics

00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:51.270
seems to build often in
your writing on physics,

00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:55.160
or I should say at least,
Newtonian physics as the enemy.

00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:59.440
Physics becomes the
science that is not

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:03.040
attentive to the human
imbrication, that has a very

00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:06.820
primitive picture of causality.

00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:10.420
And this importation
of Newtonian physics

00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:14.560
into the social sciences and
the environmental sciences

00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:18.090
has all sorts of
mischievous effects.

00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:20.590
Now, even by calling
it Newtonian,

00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:23.350
there is a suggestion that
there is something else going on

00:54:23.350 --> 00:54:23.890
in physics.

00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:27.290
And I think the picture that
the social scientists often

00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:30.380
take from the physical
sciences anyway

00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:32.770
is highly reduced
and stripped down

00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:34.440
of much of what's interesting.

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:37.330
I mean, even back
in the time of 1915

00:54:37.330 --> 00:54:40.400
with Einstein's general
theory of relativity,

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:44.710
he said that matter
is not like actors

00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:48.080
on an empty stage in a
theater, that it preexisted

00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:50.930
their entrance, that in
fact, to use a phrase

00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:54.150
that I love of John Wheeler's,
that space tells objects

00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:55.040
where to go.

00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:57.630
And objects tell
space how to curve.

00:54:57.630 --> 00:55:01.640
And so there is no
in-the-beginning story

00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:05.430
about there being space out
of into which objects enter,

00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:10.130
nor is the world populated
in some first moment

00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:12.770
by objects that then make space.

00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:17.840
Space, and therefore relations
in its most fundamental way,

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:20.190
and objects enter together.

00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:21.810
It seems to me
this richer picture

00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:25.600
of is more amenable to
something that you're

00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:29.020
getting at metaphysically in
the relationship of objects,

00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:30.730
relations, parts, and wholes.

00:55:30.730 --> 00:55:34.130
Even this idea of scale, which
plays an important role in much

00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:38.610
of your thought in
contemporary physics going down

00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:41.770
to be the very small
often is fundamentally

00:55:41.770 --> 00:55:43.040
connected to the very big.

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:47.270
The biggest black hole,
15 billion times the mass

00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:50.450
of the sun, is actually
in some theoretical way

00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:54.730
identical to the mix
of quarks, and gluons,

00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:56.890
and you hit a couple
of protons together.

00:55:56.890 --> 00:55:58.570
And the fluid, and
the turbulence,

00:55:58.570 --> 00:56:00.290
and all that happens
at the micro-scale

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:04.660
actually is the same thing as
the turbulence of space-time

00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:05.970
around a black hole.

00:56:05.970 --> 00:56:07.490
Even one of the
things that Einstein

00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:10.710
hated about his own theory was
that it predicted black holes.

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:13.110
He didn't like that, because
black holes indicated

00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:15.420
the very limits of
that theory it's said

00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:20.410
at the center of a black hole
all of our laws come to naught.

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:23.360
Indeed, the singularity
there isn't even part

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:28.070
of the space and time which
we are trying to characterize.

00:56:28.070 --> 00:56:32.120
So there isn't the idea
that you've sometimes

00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:36.610
discussed about the big
as being the overlapping

00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:38.830
aspect of the
smalls, that we don't

00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:43.270
have such a simple assembly, but
rather even the idea of scale

00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:46.850
is something that depends on how
we're invoking it is something

00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:50.050
that I think, in
contemporary physics,

00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:56.020
has actually a productive analog
in that the big and the small,

00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:58.990
neither is prior that
the big is in the small

00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:03.440
and the small is in the
big in interesting ways.

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.250
The third and last
point I wanted to get at

00:57:06.250 --> 00:57:09.310
has to do with a long-time
theme of your work,

00:57:09.310 --> 00:57:12.260
which I find I'm
very sympathetic to,

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:15.580
and that is the relationship
of nature and culture, at least

00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:21.990
the idea of trying to get
around the continuous obsession

00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:27.150
with an opposition of nature
and culture, Phusis and Nomos.

00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:30.620
And among environmental
historians

00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:34.900
and among philosopher literary
theorists, Raymond Williams,

00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:40.769
or Cronin, the idea that--
for instance, Raymond Williams

00:57:40.769 --> 00:57:42.435
talks about the city
and the countryside

00:57:42.435 --> 00:57:45.410
and opposes their opposition,
another one of those

00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:48.620
terribly mischievous
ideas that has backed up

00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:52.330
a lot of right-wing
rhetoric of the countryside

00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:54.040
as the pure, the
authentic, and the prior

00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:59.390
in the city as the artifactual,
later development and rather

00:57:59.390 --> 00:58:01.790
to see these as
producing one another.

00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:07.700
I think that perhaps
this idea of thinking

00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:13.160
of nature and culture
together put me in mind

00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:16.420
to think one of the most famous
passages of William James

00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:19.530
where he's talking about truth.

00:58:19.530 --> 00:58:23.090
But if we were to swap
out his picture of truth

00:58:23.090 --> 00:58:26.410
for that of nature, perhaps
we could reread or misread

00:58:26.410 --> 00:58:29.360
that paragraph,
something like this.

00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:32.740
"The trail of the human serpent
is thus over everything.

00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:36.190
Nature independent, nature
that we find merely,

00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:39.010
nature no longer
malleable to human need,

00:58:39.010 --> 00:58:40.660
nature incorrigible.

00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:43.595
In a word, such nature exists,
indeed super-abundantly,

00:58:43.595 --> 00:58:45.530
or is supposed to exist.

00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:48.990
But then it means only the
dead heart of the living tree.

00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:51.520
And its being there means
only that nature also

00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:53.790
has its paleontology.

00:58:53.790 --> 00:58:56.870
Its prescription may
grow stiff with years

00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:59.870
of veteran service
petrified in men's regard

00:58:59.870 --> 00:59:01.670
by sheer antiquity."

00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:04.870
And that idea that we face
a nature that's constantly

00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:07.200
in motion, all the
interesting parts of nature

00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:09.990
are not stable, not
fixed, but something

00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:15.220
that we are modifying
sometimes for the great worse

00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:17.260
and sometimes for
the great better,

00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:20.700
but that these technical
lands, these technical oceans,

00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:25.340
these technical atmospheres
that we live in give us

00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:28.450
an implication in the
world that does indeed

00:59:28.450 --> 00:59:32.130
offer the possibility of
thinking politics in a very

00:59:32.130 --> 00:59:36.280
different way, one which not
only in anthropology, but also

00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:38.510
in our art work,
in our literature,

00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:41.910
in our environmental policies,
and environmental justice,

00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:50.330
puts us into a world that is
not stable, but unfolding.

00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:51.760
- Thank you, Peter, very much.

00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:55.840
And thank you so much for
stressing the issue of scale

00:59:55.840 --> 01:00:00.100
as being what I think
you call Bruno constantly

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:02.790
redistributive and folding.

01:00:02.790 --> 01:00:05.590
And I think that it's so
important, particularly

01:00:05.590 --> 01:00:08.220
when we talk about
globalization, because scale

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:09.180
is not about size.

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:11.470
It's about complexity
and interrelationships

01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:12.910
and iterability.

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:17.160
So that notion of enfolding that
you ended with, Peter, was I

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.020
think very provocative
and very useful.

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:20.230
Thank you very much.

01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:21.240
Diane.

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:23.870
- OK, maybe I'll pick up
on some of those issues.

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:26.840
It's a really great honor
to be here, a pleasure,

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:31.840
I'm very daunted to be on
this table here with you.

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:34.640
I guess I want to say that the
main issue for me that you're

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:37.450
addressing in your
presentation and the materials

01:00:37.450 --> 01:00:42.750
that you shared with us is the
question what is, or should,

01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:47.184
or could, be the politics
of the Anthropocene?

01:00:47.184 --> 01:00:48.600
And I think that's
a question that

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:52.380
needs to be pondered not just
in terms of individual actions,

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:55.140
but with respect to the
governance institutions that

01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:59.020
help enable our collective
future so in that sense,

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:05.440
I see today's talk as raising
the possibility of the fact

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:09.590
that we need to develop new
forms of sovereignty, that

01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:12.430
is new governance
regimes, in order

01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:16.570
to be able to connect the dots
between land, Earth, globe,

01:01:16.570 --> 01:01:18.030
and Gaia.

01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:21.424
Now, I know that already puts
me in a more optimistic camp

01:01:21.424 --> 01:01:23.340
than you, Bruno, because
the title of the talk

01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:25.620
was on not connecting the dots.

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:28.360
And I do agree that part of
the concern that you have

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:30.340
and that I share
derives from the view

01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:34.220
that current global governance
arrangements, something brought

01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:36.410
to life in the Paris
and Kigali agreements

01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:40.730
in the last couple weeks,
build upon and, in fact,

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:43.860
reify the nation state as
a primary starting point

01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:46.560
for sovereignty arrangements.

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:49.360
You thus are clearly arguing
that the embodied power

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:51.320
of the nation state
has enabled many

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:54.220
of the ecologically
destructive practices for which

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:56.800
new forms of global
government agreements

01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:00.440
are now being sought in
order to clean up the mess.

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:02.960
You also rightly argue
that when decisions

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:06.530
remain in the hands of nation
states, even those joining

01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:10.060
in global agglomeration, the
chances of truly addressing

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:13.370
the risks associated with the
ever-more-destructive march

01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:17.220
of modernity are
indeed quite limited.

01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:19.360
And we all here know of
the fraught debate that

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:22.660
has and will continue to
ensue in so-called modernized

01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:27.290
countries now lead discussions
about environmental regulations

01:02:27.290 --> 01:02:29.860
that keep their own
historical gains

01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:34.610
and the Earth's losses-- gains
come through colonization

01:02:34.610 --> 01:02:36.910
and imperialism, et cetera.

01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:39.520
They are kept in place even
as these same countries are

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.810
imposing high barriers to
other countries who are

01:02:41.810 --> 01:02:45.440
desperate to become modernized.

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:48.130
So but I want to suggest that
one way out of the conundrum,

01:02:48.130 --> 01:02:50.010
or maybe we can talk
about this hopefully,

01:02:50.010 --> 01:02:53.470
is to imagine an alternative
form of sovereignty that is not

01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:55.800
tied so directly
to the nation state

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:58.870
and that, in fact, recognizes
other territorialities

01:02:58.870 --> 01:03:02.280
of governance and
political practice,

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:05.460
particularly those smaller
than the nation as well as

01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:06.790
the globe.

01:03:06.790 --> 01:03:08.970
I put this possibility
on the table coming

01:03:08.970 --> 01:03:12.840
from my own experiences
in an urban design school

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.200
and as the author of a book
called Urban Leviathan.

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.692
So when you put Hobbes'
picture up there,

01:03:17.692 --> 01:03:19.990
you had me right there.

01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:22.720
And I teach classes about
urban governance that

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.810
encourage students
to think not only

01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:27.750
about the city as a site of
growing environmental risk,

01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:30.870
but also about the city as a
source or site of resilience

01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:33.960
in which new spatial
designs and even art

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:37.390
projects from the
microterritorial level

01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:41.380
of the building and the
street, to the city,

01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:45.870
to the macroterritorial scale
of the city and its hinterlands,

01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:48.220
can provide new
ways of confronting

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:51.850
contemporary
ecological challenges.

01:03:51.850 --> 01:03:53.880
Now, it's obvious the
changing conditions

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:57.110
at the scale of a city clearly
will not address all the risks

01:03:57.110 --> 01:03:59.390
to the Earth that
are hurtling us

01:03:59.390 --> 01:04:03.520
towards an unstable and
darker ecological future.

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:07.220
However, I would say that
activities undertaken in cities

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:11.360
have an overwhelming impact
on aggregate Earth conditions

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:14.710
unless they might serve as a
more productive starting point

01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:18.390
for new agreements that
could have global impact.

01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:20.530
Likewise, cities
themselves are connected

01:04:20.530 --> 01:04:24.430
through networks that
straddle the globe thus making

01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:26.710
it possible to have
two-way conversations

01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:28.870
about the local and the global.

01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:31.520
And actually, perhaps
most significantly for me

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:34.870
as a historical
urban sociologist,

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:37.630
there are historical, social,
and cultural differences

01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:40.340
associated with national
and state sovereignty

01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:43.560
that get in the way of
cross-national agreements.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:45.610
But the experience
of living in cities

01:04:45.610 --> 01:04:48.120
holds the promise
or the potential

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.420
to create elective
affinity among peoples

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:53.200
across many different
national contexts.

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:55.020
In that sense, the
urban experience

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:58.060
could provide a basis for
developing a common language

01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.970
about the embeddedness
of the human

01:04:59.970 --> 01:05:03.770
and the non-human experience
that remains elusive at larger

01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:05.880
territorial scales.

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:08.890
People can really
articulate and tangibly

01:05:08.890 --> 01:05:12.800
grasp what it means
to survive or thrive

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:16.180
ecologically or otherwise
at the level of the street

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:18.080
and at the level
of the city in ways

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.490
that they won't at other scales.

01:05:20.490 --> 01:05:23.790
As such, I would say that
the city is and should

01:05:23.790 --> 01:05:29.250
be considered the body politic
of Anthropocene, if you will,

01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:31.710
one that literally
unites bodies in politics

01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:34.620
around the grounded
experience of everyday life,

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:38.750
almost a throwback to
earlier pre-modern period

01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:42.680
before the advent of the
Westphalian national state,

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:46.930
scaled up the territoriality
as a political allegiance,

01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:49.590
and when it was
cities or city states

01:05:49.590 --> 01:05:52.020
were the nodes and
networks through which

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:56.660
the global economy and the
modern project emerged.

01:05:56.660 --> 01:06:00.190
So let me end my remarks
by recasting these,

01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:02.050
and they're your ideas
as well, I would say,

01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:06.220
they're very much inspired
by what you presented today,

01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:07.680
through the lens of sovereignty.

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:10.780
I want to come back to that very
critical and important concept

01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:13.760
that Bruno has put on the table.

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:16.860
I think it's obvious
that I want to think

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:19.710
more broadly about
sovereignty relying

01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:23.400
as much on the lens of scholars
like Benedict Anderson, who

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:26.150
defined nationalism, and
thus national sovereignty,

01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:30.210
as an imagined community,
emanating from citizens

01:06:30.210 --> 01:06:32.860
and their meaningful
connections to each other

01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:35.990
rather than seeing nationalism
as an ideology imposed

01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:39.940
by a national state in the
service of sovereign power.

01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:41.740
I also want us to
consider that there

01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:44.280
may exist alternative
territorial scales

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:47.470
of experience and
identity that can forge

01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:51.200
an imagined community, or an
alternative territorial form

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.440
of sovereignty, or even
overlapping sovereignties,

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:56.610
as one of your slides
mentioned the concept,

01:06:56.610 --> 01:06:59.840
capable of advancing
an ecological politics

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:02.170
for the future.

01:07:02.170 --> 01:07:05.920
Finally, I want to suggest that
in order to discover and reveal

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:09.780
these new imagined communities
and any new territorial

01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:12.290
forms of sovereignty
they might enable,

01:07:12.290 --> 01:07:15.120
we need to be more
creative in our documenting

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:18.320
and understanding of the
scales and modalities

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.860
of the actually
lived experienced,

01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:23.090
of the actually lived space.

01:07:23.090 --> 01:07:26.150
We must begin to understand
the phenomenology of how

01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:29.540
individuals might
collectively translate

01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:31.790
the experience of
local conditions

01:07:31.790 --> 01:07:36.170
into a larger ecological
ethos, which itself can serve

01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:40.130
as a basis for connecting
to the Earth and the globe,

01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:43.480
but do so through the
embrace of the local

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:46.640
as a site from which a new
politics of sovereignty

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:49.270
might emanate.

01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:52.660
- Diane, thank you very much,
again, the question of scale.

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:56.355
A scale comes up again
like the prominent theme

01:07:56.355 --> 01:07:59.820
of what you're talking,
the scale of forms,

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:01.860
smaller than the
nation, as you put it.

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:05.530
And you talk about the
city here as a form

01:08:05.530 --> 01:08:09.580
of alternative
sovereignty or contra

01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:11.230
sovereignty of some kind.

01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:18.450
It seems to me that really
the title comes alive here,

01:08:18.450 --> 01:08:22.750
because maybe the
city and its forms

01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:28.130
of non-imperial sovereignty,
or non-hegemonic sovereignty

01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:31.479
that you suggest, is
because the cities may

01:08:31.479 --> 01:08:34.620
be dots that are not connected.

01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:37.160
So they're connecting the dot.

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:39.189
The dot are the
cities, which are not

01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:44.290
connected in through the hole
in either part nor whole,

01:08:44.290 --> 01:08:47.319
but they are kind of
iterative networks

01:08:47.319 --> 01:08:49.710
of particular relationalities.

01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:53.220
So I think that you
certainly put on the table

01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:57.470
another way of
thinking of the city

01:08:57.470 --> 01:09:02.264
as a sort of connected
network and its agencies.

01:09:02.264 --> 01:09:03.680
I don't know whether
that actually

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:06.840
fits with Benedict
Anderson at all,

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:10.330
because he is so immersed
in the soup of the nation

01:09:10.330 --> 01:09:11.569
and its containment.

01:09:11.569 --> 01:09:13.109
He needs that containment.

01:09:13.109 --> 01:09:15.850
But thank you very much for
these provocative remarks.

01:09:15.850 --> 01:09:18.170
And now, we turn to Bruno.

01:09:18.170 --> 01:09:19.260
- What is my role now?

01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:21.720
- Now, your role, Bruno,
is to basically talk

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:24.580
a little, entertain us
with some responses,

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:26.859
and then we can open up.

01:09:26.859 --> 01:09:28.640
So your role is that
of the entertainer.

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:33.880
- I'm starting to be
bothered by this thing here.

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.791
- We admire it.

01:09:35.791 --> 01:09:37.540
- It's slightly
embarrassing. [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:40.826 --> 01:09:44.960
And it's watching at me without
too much, actually, pleasure.

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:45.930
- Look there.

01:09:45.930 --> 01:09:51.470
- OK, so I'll start with Diane.

01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:53.550
I think one of the
interesting things

01:09:53.550 --> 01:09:56.820
is to explore collectively the
notion of overlapping entities,

01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:59.687
because if they overlap,
actually in the simulation,

01:09:59.687 --> 01:10:01.270
the cities were very
important, and we

01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:04.206
presented as such, and
the network of cities,

01:10:04.206 --> 01:10:05.580
of course, an
ecological question

01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:09.110
is sometimes much more advanced
than many nation states.

01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:12.650
But it's still a problem of
scale, which is small and big.

01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:16.220
It doesn't capture overlapping--
and overlapping means

01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:20.178
that it's like a Hobbesian
argument for what

01:10:20.178 --> 01:10:23.590
is the ensemble, so to speak,
of representing ourselves

01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:26.460
plus all the
millions and billions

01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:30.780
of microbes and bacteria
composing something

01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:35.050
which has no clear boundaries,
which we call a human body.

01:10:35.050 --> 01:10:36.500
You talk about the body politic.

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.607
We don't know much
about what the body is.

01:10:38.607 --> 01:10:40.940
So that metaphor of the body
politic is a complex thing.

01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:42.420
But what is
interesting is the need

01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:45.920
to reinvent just at the
time when people would want

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:48.900
precisely to go back to
the notion of sovereignty,

01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:52.740
and that's connected to
the question of Homi, which

01:10:52.740 --> 01:11:01.340
is the border protection
arrives everywhere

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:05.161
just at the time of
ecological crisis

01:11:05.161 --> 01:11:06.660
where it nothing
in physics probably

01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:09.560
but it means nothing in
biology, and it means not much

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:10.780
in the future of politics.

01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:16.000
But we need to guarantee
what Peter Sloterdijk called

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.110
the immunological
condition of existence

01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:21.920
as well, because whenever we
talk about nature as Sloterdijk

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:25.880
says, nature is not a
place where we inhabit.

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:28.360
It's a place where
other things happen,

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:31.941
but certainly not life forms
in the concept of nature,

01:11:31.941 --> 01:11:32.440
of course.

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.850
So it's a very
complicated question here

01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:38.440
is how can we retain
the notion of protection

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:42.240
and multiply the type of
overlapping sovereignty.

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:45.130
I have one good example,
a small example,

01:11:45.130 --> 01:11:49.340
which is the election in
Holland where they have

01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:50.780
a double system of election.

01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:54.140
We elect the Congress
and parliamentary people,

01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:59.950
but they also elect the
[INAUDIBLE] or something

01:11:59.950 --> 01:12:04.600
like that, who is the
one representing water.

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:06.040
And actually, the
two authorities

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:09.560
have the same sort
of legitimacy.

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:11.020
And they occupy the same space.

01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:12.790
But one is for
humans, so to speak,

01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:14.320
and the other one is for water.

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.650
Water is fairly important,
as you know, in Holland.

01:12:16.650 --> 01:12:21.327
And it's a sort of necessary
thing to have these two powers,

01:12:21.327 --> 01:12:22.410
so to speak.

01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:25.030
But it's interesting
that on the same space,

01:12:25.030 --> 01:12:28.400
the overlapping is possible
and many, of course,

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:29.790
other innovations.

01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:32.660
The question is precisely
to avoid to say, well,

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:33.610
borders are finished.

01:12:33.610 --> 01:12:36.240
And we can never go to
the global and [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:39.320
sort of archaic
hillbilly people are

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:41.700
attached to the local scene.

01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:44.930
There is an immunological
principle in the boundaries.

01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:47.530
But it's not necessarily
linked with the notion

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:49.260
of border protection.

01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:51.660
Now, of course, it is
linked to the nation state.

01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:54.840
This is the European
problem, par excellence,

01:12:54.840 --> 01:13:00.290
and Europe had invented a very
subtle and complicated system

01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:03.240
of overlapping sovereignty
until the bloody Brits tried

01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:07.770
to get out of it, which is
amusing, because they are also

01:13:07.770 --> 01:13:12.120
the ones who invented the global
sort of regime of the globe.

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:15.070
So it's very telling that the
first country which really

01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:18.550
invented the global market is
also the one who suddenly says,

01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:24.240
let's go back to the queen
yacht, which is [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:27.610
And of course, I answered
Peter and completely agree.

01:13:27.610 --> 01:13:30.310
Actually, I'm not
interested in the way--

01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:33.370
am interested in a strange
way with some concept

01:13:33.370 --> 01:13:35.930
of political philosophy
have been transported

01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:38.850
into a plotted notion of
physics, which of course, has

01:13:38.850 --> 01:13:41.950
no relation whatsoever
with your practice

01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:45.610
and the multiplicity of
entity by physicists.

01:13:45.610 --> 01:13:47.580
But it become the
sort of-- when we

01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:51.080
talk about nature and
objects, we mostly

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:54.190
sort of use a mixture
of things which

01:13:54.190 --> 01:13:56.300
can be completely
badly understood

01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:59.680
Newtonian physics, but a
lot of political philosophy,

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:04.190
especially on the notion
of inertness of matter.

01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:06.890
And this inertness of matter,
which of course, historians,

01:14:06.890 --> 01:14:09.960
especially in your department,
have studied for a long time

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:13.390
is a much more complicated
history than that.

01:14:13.390 --> 01:14:18.070
But it is the, how could I say?

01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:22.230
The common ways in which
we understand nature.

01:14:22.230 --> 01:14:23.710
And I'm interested
in what you say,

01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:27.570
I mean, because of a terrorist.

01:14:27.570 --> 01:14:30.550
In my experience, it
is the French state,

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:32.880
and I think there is
some connection here

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:37.930
as Sloterdijk says again,
it's an autoimmune disease.

01:14:37.930 --> 01:14:43.410
And people are fed back on
police, and army, and borders

01:14:43.410 --> 01:14:47.159
as the simplest way to-- it's
sort of benediction, police

01:14:47.159 --> 01:14:49.600
and state.

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:52.420
We have no idea what politics
is, but police and state,

01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:53.110
that we know.

01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:58.550
It's the last thing which seems
like a state and authority.

01:14:58.550 --> 01:15:00.290
And in France,
it's exactly that.

01:15:00.290 --> 01:15:03.110
There is absolutely not
politics left except police.

01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:08.140
I mean, the police are actually
striking right now today.

01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:11.020
So maybe even that, [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:16.290
So the terrorist was a sort of
a gift of God, literally a gift

01:15:16.290 --> 01:15:19.490
of God for the remnant
of what the Westphalian

01:15:19.490 --> 01:15:21.940
state is supposed to be,
in some sort of sense.

01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:24.140
But it's not at all
the third attractor,

01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:26.660
because there is no-- I mean,
maybe I'm probably wrong,

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:28.840
but there is no
vast contribution

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:32.380
to the alternative
cosmology, as far as I

01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:34.102
can tell and a
complete indifference

01:15:34.102 --> 01:15:36.310
to the question of ecology,
if I am not wrong, right?

01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:37.640
- No, but it's a negative.

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:39.670
I'm saying, it's the negative.

01:15:39.670 --> 01:15:42.920
But in a way, you
never know where

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:44.620
the border is going to be.

01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:47.808
It's that the border is where
the terror act takes place.

01:15:47.808 --> 01:15:50.860
So the borders are
continually changing.

01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:52.630
So it's a negative of that.

01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:57.695
- The direct link there is with
the ecological crisis is with

01:15:57.695 --> 01:16:01.870
immigration, because here the
link is technically-- sorry,

01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:04.720
[INAUDIBLE] crossing boundaries.

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:07.880
And what do we do with the
crossing of boundaries,

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:11.340
the walls, is a
key question, which

01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:15.780
is the way in which
most people actually

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:20.630
get the shock of the ecological
crisis is now from migration.

01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:24.284
And that's where the
link is most interesting.

01:16:24.284 --> 01:16:24.784
Yes ?

01:16:26.230 --> 01:16:29.139
- I'm wondering, and I wanted to
ask you, Bruno, and also Peter,

01:16:29.139 --> 01:16:30.430
because this is your expertise.

01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:32.580
But I'm just
wondering whether it's

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:34.430
possible to take some
of these concepts

01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:38.020
that we've just been talking
about sovereignty, terror,

01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:43.190
violence, borders, and
use those to think more

01:16:43.190 --> 01:16:45.930
about the natural world
and if that is then

01:16:45.930 --> 01:16:48.000
becomes a discourse
that allows one

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.671
to move back and forth between
the human and the non-human

01:16:50.671 --> 01:16:51.170
in a way.

01:16:51.170 --> 01:16:52.890
I'm not an ecologist.

01:16:52.890 --> 01:16:55.820
But it seems to me that we
could think about plant life,

01:16:55.820 --> 01:17:00.230
or that again, the natural,
I'm getting beyond my pay grade

01:17:00.230 --> 01:17:02.690
here, but to think a
little more about using

01:17:02.690 --> 01:17:04.260
those same sets of concepts.

01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:08.300
Is there some sense
of what we might--

01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:12.230
the equivalent of a sovereignty
within the natural world?

01:17:12.230 --> 01:17:16.280
- Well, the problem I think
is we have too much commerce.

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:19.050
The truth of it is very
difficult. But as you know,

01:17:19.050 --> 01:17:21.370
sociology was for plants.

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:23.060
The Department of
Plant Sociology

01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:24.890
still exists in a dark place

01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:25.390
- Right.

01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:26.275
The organism.

01:17:26.275 --> 01:17:28.330
- --in Switzerland.

01:17:28.330 --> 01:17:30.280
But the problem is
precisely to try

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:32.070
to not connect
the dots, that is,

01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:36.455
not immediately think an
ecosystem is part and whole.

01:17:36.455 --> 01:17:40.230
The resistance, and this
is why it's very important

01:17:40.230 --> 01:17:41.980
to work with
scientists and people

01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:43.880
from humanity and
the social sciences,

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:46.120
because they can
help everyone to be

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:49.510
attentive to the speed at
which the metaphor jumps

01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:50.510
from one to the other.

01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:51.310
It's amazing.

01:17:51.310 --> 01:17:53.940
I was amazed by this
book by Tyrrell.

01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:56.310
I mean, he's a good
scientist, and what he says

01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:58.750
is factually very interesting.

01:17:58.750 --> 01:18:01.320
But he has absolutely
no hint that when

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:03.990
you talk about Gaia
as a tiller, it's

01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:09.090
a huge import of providential
and political thing

01:18:09.090 --> 01:18:11.460
which ruins this argument
and ruins the of course

01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:13.170
the accusations
against the other.

01:18:13.170 --> 01:18:17.450
So we have to be careful,
again, because when we mentioned

01:18:17.450 --> 01:18:19.590
the notion of the
ecological crisis,

01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:22.510
we are very easily lost
by the question of size.

01:18:22.510 --> 01:18:25.570
And the question of size has to
be studied in different ways.

01:18:25.570 --> 01:18:29.180
That's why overlapping entity,
the notion of small and big

01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:31.600
doesn't really work.

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:34.880
This is why the paper
I sent you, which

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:36.675
is a bit boring I'm afraid.

01:18:36.675 --> 01:18:37.550
I apologize for that.

01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:42.260
I tried to get into the
argument that Gabrielle Tarde is

01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:43.985
reintroducing the
notion of monad,

01:18:43.985 --> 01:18:45.610
because I think there
is something very

01:18:45.610 --> 01:18:49.180
interesting in the notion of
monad where precisely scale,

01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:51.780
it's not entity plus relation,
but it's something else

01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:52.890
which is at work.

01:18:52.890 --> 01:18:55.880
And one of my
interests in this field

01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:58.620
study I work with was as
scientists is precisely

01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:01.726
to see how far we can
go with them to find

01:19:01.726 --> 01:19:04.100
an alternative and especially,
of course, which is always

01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:09.250
the key, how to represent
visually these masses of data

01:19:09.250 --> 01:19:10.640
we have about this overlapping.

01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:13.070
I mean, it's a very
interesting case of cities,

01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:15.030
because if you begin
to represent a city,

01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:17.270
you actually, of course,
cover the whole-- I mean,

01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:20.240
if it's a big city, you cover
a large part of the world.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.840
And you don't cover.

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:22.829
You connect.

01:19:22.829 --> 01:19:24.495
And all of these
overlapping connections

01:19:24.495 --> 01:19:26.410
are actually very
difficult to visualize.

01:19:26.410 --> 01:19:29.860
And now, with big data, I
think it's a major thing

01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:33.030
to do which is how to find
alternative representation.

01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:36.240
And then once we are
equipped with the alternative

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:39.330
representation, we can begin
to think of sovereignty

01:19:39.330 --> 01:19:41.880
as something
different from the map

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:47.640
and a non-overlapping,
ex parte entity.

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:52.440
So it is a very rich combination
of exchange between biologists

01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:55.190
trying to get out of the
notion of the selfish gene,

01:19:55.190 --> 01:19:58.550
for instance, and
political scientists,

01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:59.844
and many other people.

01:19:59.844 --> 01:20:01.510
- I mean, one of the
things that strikes

01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:07.740
me is that many of our
considerations in your paper,

01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:10.660
your presentation, what I
Diane was talking about,

01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:13.060
some of my concerns have
been around individuation.

01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:15.040
What counts as an object?

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:20.210
And that, in many
fields, has lost

01:20:20.210 --> 01:20:22.060
the sense of an
eternal stability,

01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:24.930
that there is a
well-defined boundary

01:20:24.930 --> 01:20:27.050
interior versus exterior.

01:20:27.050 --> 01:20:30.740
I mean, in politics the
lowest possible position

01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:33.470
you could have would be to
say that you can solve this

01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:35.400
by building a wall,
as somebody said.

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:42.800
But that in fact, there are ways
in which our communities are

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:45.330
configured differently for
all of the different things

01:20:45.330 --> 01:20:46.020
that we do.

01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:47.900
The way we distribute
water is not the same

01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:49.960
as the way we deal
with electricity,

01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:51.090
the way we handle food.

01:20:51.090 --> 01:20:55.490
I mean, the connectivities,
the boundaries are constantly

01:20:55.490 --> 01:21:00.010
fluctuating even at a particular
time, let alone overtime.

01:21:00.010 --> 01:21:03.360
And even the objects,
the organs of our body.

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:04.902
We can see our heart is a pump.

01:21:04.902 --> 01:21:06.610
But now we know it's
much more than that.

01:21:06.610 --> 01:21:09.090
It has a biochemical function,
an electrical function,

01:21:09.090 --> 01:21:11.488
many other things,.

01:21:11.488 --> 01:21:17.480
Or the stomach, or hormones,
or any of our bodily systems

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:21.170
are not as localized as we
once wished to imagine them.

01:21:21.170 --> 01:21:24.390
And I think a lot of
the debates in ecology

01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:25.390
have that same function.

01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:29.170
It's like, what is
the relevant system?

01:21:29.170 --> 01:21:32.180
And that doesn't
have a unique answer,

01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:34.020
even at a particular time.

01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:37.480
It's not just that it used to
be local and now it's global.

01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:40.789
It's that it was always
all these different things.

01:21:40.789 --> 01:21:42.830
- I think you're completely
right that the notion

01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:46.290
of individuation is
a key thing, right?

01:21:46.290 --> 01:21:48.040
It's very interesting
to see that happened

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:53.040
in all sort of places, in ants,
as well as in cells, as well

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:55.680
as in nation states.

01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:00.150
- Permeability is what you talk
about in this paper very much.

01:22:00.150 --> 01:22:05.190
Can I just ask you, as
we have only a minute

01:22:05.190 --> 01:22:08.440
to go, when you talk about
the third attractor there,

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:10.900
you always give it--
you always also read it

01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:15.210
from an aesthetic point of
view, that the construction has

01:22:15.210 --> 01:22:16.310
to be beautiful.

01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:17.780
The construction has to be good.

01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:22.990
There's also there's
always that aesthetic idea,

01:22:22.990 --> 01:22:25.990
and I don't mean a aesthetisized
idea, but an aesthetic idea,

01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:30.620
an ethical idea, that is
part of your assumption

01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:32.780
about the way in
which things connect

01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:35.180
or the unfolding process.

01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:37.200
And as somebody
interested in aesthetics,

01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:42.540
I've always wondered about
it, the good construction,

01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:45.220
which you talk a lot
about in your book.

01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:51.890
- I did aesthetics as rendering
oneself sensitive to things.

01:22:51.890 --> 01:22:53.480
So for me, it would
be the aesthetic

01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:55.590
of science, which is the
instrument by which we

01:22:55.590 --> 01:22:59.710
begin to become sensitive
to, for example, a watershed.

01:22:59.710 --> 01:23:01.750
And there is the
aesthetic of politics,

01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:06.400
which is how do we hear the
voices, voices, so to speak,

01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:09.000
which is a rendering
sensitive to.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.940
And of course, there
is the aesthetic,

01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:13.900
which has been sort
of simplified or

01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:15.900
re-institutionalized
around the art,

01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:19.140
but of which the art are
not the only appropriator,

01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:23.540
nor the only maker,
which is very important.

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:26.010
And I'm always interested
in these three aesthetics

01:23:26.010 --> 01:23:31.850
together, because
as Peter just said,

01:23:31.850 --> 01:23:35.670
it's very difficult to get out
of the notion of boundaries,

01:23:35.670 --> 01:23:38.680
borders, and so on,
without complete invention

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:41.320
into some of them
come from [INAUDIBLE].

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:42.840
I mean, this
beautiful piece you--

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:45.920
I'm sorry for the horrible
view I gave of Sara Sze's work.

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:48.280
But I think it's an absolutely
magnificent example,

01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:52.050
and I immediately sent it to my
friend Joe scientist in Paris

01:23:52.050 --> 01:23:53.660
and said, this
lady was an artist.

01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:56.150
And so, at least three
or four of a point

01:23:56.150 --> 01:23:58.610
we are trying to source
in our representation

01:23:58.610 --> 01:24:01.150
of a critical zone, precisely
because of the multiplicity

01:24:01.150 --> 01:24:02.960
and the non-boundedness of it.

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:05.270
It's not bounded.

01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:06.340
Yet, you are in it.

01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:12.200
So she found my aesthetics,
a beautiful example

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:13.700
of something we are
struggling with,

01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:16.856
the scientists I'm working with.

01:24:16.856 --> 01:24:19.700
- And also artists and also
writers, because language

01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:20.480
is not bounded.

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:22.880
And we're always in
the middle of it.

01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:25.821
- Last week with Richard
Powers, the great novelist.

01:24:25.821 --> 01:24:27.820
I had the privilege of
spending a week with him,

01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:29.840
and he is writing a
book where the agent

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:33.320
and the main
characters as trees.

01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:34.660
Again, where are the trees?

01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:36.890
In the forest, classical
question, [INAUDIBLE].

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:42.490
One of his arguments
is that the bumper crop

01:24:42.490 --> 01:24:44.820
that we have today
of oaks coming here

01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:46.840
is actually
collective strategies

01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:51.312
of trees to find with their
competitors, so to speak.

01:24:51.312 --> 01:24:53.570
It's a very clever
trick of trees.

01:24:53.570 --> 01:24:54.436
I hope he is right.

01:24:54.436 --> 01:24:56.990
- Well, in these
Anthropocenic wars.

01:24:56.990 --> 01:25:00.600
Let's now turn to
some questions.

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:01.830
There's a mic.

01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:03.450
Please line up.

01:25:03.450 --> 01:25:08.030
We have 10 minutes
for questions.

01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:11.680
- It's a great honor
to hear you all talk,

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:14.050
not just you Professor
Latour, but all four of you.

01:25:14.050 --> 01:25:15.047
Thank you very much.

01:25:15.047 --> 01:25:16.380
My name is Jessica Gienow-Hecht.

01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:18.180
I hail from Berlin.

01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:20.950
I'll be your colleague
Professor Latour next semester

01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:23.220
for one term.

01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:26.630
I am afraid my question
is somewhat conventional.

01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:29.100
But what I wanted
to ask you is what

01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:32.510
do you do with the question
of power in your tale?

01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:34.500
I understand that
in your scheme,

01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:38.150
which is kind of a tripod,
you are urge us to pay more

01:25:38.150 --> 01:25:43.030
attention to the third
leg, the Earth, and yet,

01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:47.420
power so far has dictated that
most of us in our perception

01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:51.310
oscillate between the
palace and the globe,

01:25:51.310 --> 01:25:54.800
mostly because of questions of
power the nation state promises

01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:57.630
us, and that's its power to
solve the problems that we

01:25:57.630 --> 01:26:01.440
cannot solve ourselves, while
the globe exerts a power

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:02.610
of attraction.

01:26:02.610 --> 01:26:06.140
There might be potential in
terms of mobility or employment

01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:08.690
or whatever that may
make things possible

01:26:08.690 --> 01:26:10.160
that we don't have access to.

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:14.110
What is the power of the Earth
in order to make itself heard?

01:26:14.110 --> 01:26:16.340
You're appealing to our sense.

01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:19.590
- The power is attraction.

01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:21.905
It's a very interesting
question, because very sightly,

01:26:21.905 --> 01:26:27.650
there is something slightly
boring about the Earth,

01:26:27.650 --> 01:26:30.780
which is it doesn't-- it
has nothing spectacular.

01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:33.340
- Exactly, but how does the
Earth then brand itself?

01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:34.960
- Sorry?

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:37.190
- How does the Earth
brand itself in

01:26:37.190 --> 01:26:40.350
order to develop a power of
attraction, which in your tale,

01:26:40.350 --> 01:26:41.950
is what it has to do?

01:26:41.950 --> 01:26:42.880
- I don't know.

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:45.010
I mean, this is what
worries me a lot,

01:26:45.010 --> 01:26:47.190
because there was
something-- very something

01:26:47.190 --> 01:26:53.200
exciting about the globe,
very something nostalgically

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:57.350
exciting about going back, even
towards an imaginary community.

01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:59.990
And there is something
precisely, [INAUDIBLE]

01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:05.870
word, earthly,
mundane, down to land.

01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:07.860
And there is
nothing spectacular.

01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:11.590
And also, that's the work
on the critical zone.

01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:15.630
It's extraordinarily
localized and idiosyncratic,

01:27:15.630 --> 01:27:17.320
because precisely,
we have to relearn

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:22.202
the skills of as you
said, re-localizing

01:27:22.202 --> 01:27:23.160
many of these entities.

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:24.576
It is very, very
difficult to have

01:27:24.576 --> 01:27:26.524
a sort of generalized
concept, which

01:27:26.524 --> 01:27:27.940
is exactly the
opposite of what we

01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:29.667
mean when we go to the globe.

01:27:29.667 --> 01:27:31.250
So I have no I have
no answer to that.

01:27:31.250 --> 01:27:33.690
It's a very worrying question.

01:27:33.690 --> 01:27:36.230
We all have to turn to something
which is less spectacular.

01:27:36.230 --> 01:27:39.050
Now, I have another version
of the same argument, which

01:27:39.050 --> 01:27:43.590
is the opposite, which
is to say, in one way,

01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:48.070
it's as extraordinarily
interesting and progressive

01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:56.140
than the old question of the
16th century discovery of land,

01:27:56.140 --> 01:28:00.890
new land, new land which I
had been-- when we destroyed

01:28:00.890 --> 01:28:02.790
the inhabitants first.

01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:06.080
So it has something about
the Age of Discovery,

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:07.920
but it's not the
land in extension.

01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:10.507
It's not unfortunately
where we wiped out

01:28:10.507 --> 01:28:11.590
the people who were there.

01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:14.550
It's a land in intensity.

01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:19.450
And it has some sort
of the same fabulously

01:28:19.450 --> 01:28:24.690
interesting and troubling
meaning than the 16th century.

01:28:24.690 --> 01:28:26.950
I think there's lots of
reason why we associate now

01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:29.540
lots of things in music,
in art, in theater

01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:32.245
with the 16th century, because
there's something very similar.

01:28:32.245 --> 01:28:33.620
But of course,
it's not the land.

01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:37.430
It's not the discovery
of land res nullius.

01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:40.730
It's is the land where
we are all sharing

01:28:40.730 --> 01:28:42.661
the disappearance of the land.

01:28:42.661 --> 01:28:44.910
And this is a very interesting
element of anthropology

01:28:44.910 --> 01:28:47.500
now is that we learn
collectively what

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:51.790
it is to have a land under
your feet disappearing.

01:28:51.790 --> 01:28:56.570
Before, it was precisely the
tragic discovery of those

01:28:56.570 --> 01:29:00.190
we had-- the land of
whom we had occupied.

01:29:00.190 --> 01:29:02.770
But now, it's something
which everybody in a way--

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:05.420
it's a new universal
anthropology.

01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:09.360
So this is where power is.

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:10.820
- Thank you very much.

01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:13.230
My name is a Ester Giftechein
from the Anthropology

01:29:13.230 --> 01:29:14.240
Department.

01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:20.800
My question is so how could we
think about the attractor three

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:25.740
without the interruption of
the attractor one and two?

01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:31.080
What's your projection in that
regard, which the attractor

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:35.190
one and attractor two, which
happen to be handicapped

01:29:35.190 --> 01:29:37.820
and biased in times of
the hierarchies they

01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:41.860
have been posing on
us all this time?

01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:48.600
What kind of a culture would
you project as emerging

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:51.930
or would emerge in
the future in relation

01:29:51.930 --> 01:29:56.250
to networks and in relation
to what you defined

01:29:56.250 --> 01:29:59.570
as the attractor, what's your
concerns about that attractor

01:29:59.570 --> 01:30:00.610
three?

01:30:00.610 --> 01:30:01.120
Thank you.

01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:03.100
- Thank you.

01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:06.770
My definition of anthropology,
as you might know,

01:30:06.770 --> 01:30:10.760
is a diplomatic building,
diplomatic encounters,

01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:16.620
between basically conflicting
cosmologies, so to speak.

01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:18.890
So I'm fairly interested,
and your question

01:30:18.890 --> 01:30:21.540
is very interesting, because
what I'm trying to imagine

01:30:21.540 --> 01:30:27.213
is where instead of saying
globalization is gone

01:30:27.213 --> 01:30:30.830
or you should not try to
go back to the land of old,

01:30:30.830 --> 01:30:32.630
I think it's quite
interesting to see what

01:30:32.630 --> 01:30:36.360
other property to reopen the
discussion with those who

01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:40.700
are simultaneously repulsed
by the globe and attracted by

01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:41.200
[INAUDIBLE].

01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:42.900
What do they want?

01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:44.500
They want protection.

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:45.690
We all want protection.

01:30:45.690 --> 01:30:48.440
It's not something which is
wrong to want protection.

01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:50.930
But protections is not
ensured by the rich--

01:30:50.930 --> 01:30:53.985
in the case of Brexit,
again, I'm obsessed by that.

01:30:53.985 --> 01:30:55.860
If there is one thing
which is absolutely not

01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:57.276
protected to England
is to go back

01:30:57.276 --> 01:30:59.860
to their little, boring island.

01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:05.940
So but they want protection
is a sensible thing to ask.

01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:08.590
And the same thing with the
negotiation about the globe.

01:31:08.590 --> 01:31:11.550
There was something absolutely
crucial in the globe.

01:31:11.550 --> 01:31:13.050
It is a multiplicity
of differences.

01:31:13.050 --> 01:31:15.091
But if you [INAUDIBLE]
the globe is the extension

01:31:15.091 --> 01:31:20.530
of the same set of cliched
and standardize indifference,

01:31:20.530 --> 01:31:22.520
it's a big chance.

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:25.070
So what I'm trying to
imagine it is how can we

01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:28.900
build a political orientation,
the same thing which

01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:32.070
has been done in 19th century
with a social question?

01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:35.010
After all, we
invented with masses

01:31:35.010 --> 01:31:38.440
of people in the
social sciences,

01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:43.530
in activism, in religion, how
to handle the social question.

01:31:43.530 --> 01:31:45.560
The task now is
not more difficult,

01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:48.110
but it requires a
reorientation, because we

01:31:48.110 --> 01:31:51.610
have to deal precisely with
all this non-individualizing

01:31:51.610 --> 01:31:54.350
multiplicity, which we
share our existence.

01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:59.410
So that's what I mean by opening
a negotiation on this thing.

01:31:59.410 --> 01:32:03.810
- Two more quick
questions, thank you.

01:32:03.810 --> 01:32:07.600
- I'm Sam Smiley, artographer,
artist researcher, teacher.

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:10.580
So I am kind of triangulating.

01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:13.800
So my question which may
have been sort of addressed

01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:18.300
in last one is what about
the question of asymmetries

01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:19.910
within the network?

01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:20.810
- Asymmetries?

01:32:20.810 --> 01:32:23.300
- Within the network.

01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:23.930
- Sorry?

01:32:23.930 --> 01:32:27.104
- Asymmetries
within the network.

01:32:27.104 --> 01:32:27.770
- What about it?

01:32:27.770 --> 01:32:28.630
Do you like it?

01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:29.760
- What do I like?

01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:34.056
- Do you like asymmetrical
relations within networks?

01:32:34.056 --> 01:32:36.650
Like it, or dislike
it, or neither?

01:32:36.650 --> 01:32:38.860
- Neither.

01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:40.800
I mean, the asymmetry
of networks,

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:42.140
I'm not understanding.

01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:44.380
I mean, the asymmetry
is a different--

01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:46.460
it doesn't apply very
well to a network.

01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:47.970
But what do we mean, exactly?

01:32:47.970 --> 01:32:48.820
Can you develop?

01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:53.880
- Yeah, so within a
network, the power relations

01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:54.910
in between the objects.

01:32:58.442 --> 01:33:02.594
It could be about power,
asymmetric relations.

01:33:02.594 --> 01:33:04.260
- Always there are
asymmetric relations.

01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:06.400
What would be a
symmetrical relation?

01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:07.380
I don't understand.

01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:10.610
Where would it be a place
where there's no power?

01:33:10.610 --> 01:33:12.320
What would be a
non-powered relation.

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:14.640
I need to understand
your question.

01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:18.660
- I guess I'm making the
assumption that it was a power.

01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:21.580
It was that bringing
asymmetries out

01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:24.220
defines what you just described.

01:33:24.220 --> 01:33:26.130
- I'm not sure I understand.

01:33:26.130 --> 01:33:28.180
In all of this
question of ecology,

01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:30.100
we have to understand
we are at war.

01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:31.260
It's war.

01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:34.950
So the question of
power is everywhere.

01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:38.310
The pseudo controversy
about the climate,

01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:42.700
anthropic origin of climate,
is a declaration of war.

01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:44.820
The word negationist
has been used, I think,

01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:45.570
with good reason.

01:33:45.570 --> 01:33:46.528
It's a question of war.

01:33:46.528 --> 01:33:49.700
We don't want to live in
the country where you live.

01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:52.980
So the question of territory
and what we occupy a territory

01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:57.790
is completely suffused
with power everywhere.

01:33:57.790 --> 01:34:01.710
And the problem of this third
attractor is that, of course,

01:34:01.710 --> 01:34:04.670
it's slightly
boring, which is one

01:34:04.670 --> 01:34:06.990
of the prime sort of
statistic, as you say,

01:34:06.990 --> 01:34:10.590
and it's also an absolutely
major question of war

01:34:10.590 --> 01:34:12.150
and peace.

01:34:12.150 --> 01:34:17.394
So if this was behind your
question, yes, we are at war.

01:34:17.394 --> 01:34:19.060
- That's why I
emphasized the negativity

01:34:19.060 --> 01:34:20.670
of the third attractor.

01:34:20.670 --> 01:34:23.110
The last question.

01:34:23.110 --> 01:34:26.840
- Hi, I'm Fernando Rosenberg, a
teacher at Brandeis University.

01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:30.850
One notion that I haven't heard
in the discussion of the panel

01:34:30.850 --> 01:34:32.600
is the notion of rights.

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:34.370
And I want rights.

01:34:34.370 --> 01:34:37.100
And I wonder,
because the Bolivian

01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:41.660
and the Ecuadorian constitutions
recognize the rights of nature.

01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:43.350
And this is a very
problematic notion

01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:45.370
that has been widely discussed.

01:34:45.370 --> 01:34:47.810
But I wonder if
you see any future

01:34:47.810 --> 01:34:52.930
for a universal declaration
of non-human rights

01:34:52.930 --> 01:34:59.380
or post-human rights in which
what are the entities that

01:34:59.380 --> 01:35:01.260
to which these
rights are recognized

01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:03.600
is defined on a
case-by-case basis.

01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:07.609
- Well, I think here we
need a ritual to Pachamama.

01:35:07.609 --> 01:35:09.900
That would be the polite way
of answering the question.

01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:11.720
Let's have a ritual.

01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:15.310
And Pachamama, of course,
is a very interesting figure

01:35:15.310 --> 01:35:17.020
introduced into
the constitution.

01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:20.450
I think this constitutional
invention will multiply.

01:35:20.450 --> 01:35:26.680
But it's not us who attribute an
agency to Pachamama or to Gaia.

01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:29.810
It's Gaia which is coming
to us and requesting,

01:35:29.810 --> 01:35:32.750
and we bow to this
sort of not exactly

01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:35.584
authority or sovereignty, but
something which is certainly

01:35:35.584 --> 01:35:37.000
something, which
even in the Paris

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.180
was amazing in this sense.

01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:44.630
These people were not assembled
by the horizon of modernization

01:35:44.630 --> 01:35:45.900
and the global modernization.

01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:47.483
They were assembled
by something which

01:35:47.483 --> 01:35:51.190
were impacting on all of
them in a strange way.

01:35:51.190 --> 01:35:54.736
So in a way, we have
already these figures,

01:35:54.736 --> 01:35:58.210
which is not in
any constitution,

01:35:58.210 --> 01:36:01.800
but it is weighing
on us in a way.

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:04.270
And that's where I think
all of this invention where

01:36:04.270 --> 01:36:07.901
there is a declaration against
ecocide now working everywhere.

01:36:07.901 --> 01:36:09.400
There are people
in this country who

01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:11.670
have attacked their government
for not-- in Holland,

01:36:11.670 --> 01:36:15.900
I'm sorry, for not actually
protecting the environment.

01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:16.930
So this will multiply.

01:36:16.930 --> 01:36:19.820
Lawyers are rich
since the famous paper

01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:22.160
by Stone many, many years ago.

01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:24.770
The law is as often
very much in advance

01:36:24.770 --> 01:36:26.330
of many of the
philosophical concepts

01:36:26.330 --> 01:36:27.663
we used to talk about there.

01:36:29.710 --> 01:36:32.423
- Thank you very much,
and before calling

01:36:32.423 --> 01:36:35.080
to this who is
already here, I wanted

01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:37.800
to say that one of the issues
we have not talked enough about

01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:41.010
is the question of temporality
and the different temporalities

01:36:41.010 --> 01:36:42.080
in the work.

01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:44.930
But time always
runs up against us.

01:36:44.930 --> 01:36:45.750
[INAUDIBLE]

01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:48.050
- There'll be plenty
of time to talk

01:36:48.050 --> 01:36:51.900
at the reception
on a smaller scale.

01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:54.910
But I just want to ask
you to join me in thanking

01:36:54.910 --> 01:36:56.550
Bruno Latour and our panelists.

01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:57.550
[MUSIC  PLAYING]
