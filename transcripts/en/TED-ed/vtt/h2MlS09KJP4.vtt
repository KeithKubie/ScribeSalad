00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.939
85% of the matter in our universe
is a mystery.

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:15.159
We don't know what it's made of,
which is why we call it dark matter.

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:19.058
But we know it's out there because we
can observe its gravitational attraction

00:00:19.058 --> 00:00:22.499
on galaxies and other celestial objects.

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:24.848
We've yet to directly observe dark matter,

00:00:24.848 --> 00:00:28.330
but scientists theorize that we may
actually be able to create it

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.899
in the most powerful particle collider
in the world.

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:36.799
That's the 27 kilometer-long
Large Hadron Collider, or LHC,

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:38.520
in Geneva, Switzerland.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.040
So how would that work?

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.169
In the LHC, two proton beams
move in opposite directions

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:47.320
and are accelerated 
to near the speed of light.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.393
At four collision points, the beams cross
and protons smash into each other.

00:00:52.393 --> 00:00:56.692
Protons are made of much smaller
components called quarks and gluons

00:00:56.692 --> 00:01:01.001
In most ordinary collisions, the two
protons pass through each other

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:03.543
without any significant outcome.

00:01:03.543 --> 00:01:06.273
However, in about 
one in a million collisions,

00:01:06.273 --> 00:01:08.712
two components hit each other
so violently,

00:01:08.712 --> 00:01:11.911
that most of the collision energy
is set free

00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:14.434
producing thousands of new particles.

00:01:14.434 --> 00:01:17.413
It's only in these collisions that very
massive particles,

00:01:17.413 --> 00:01:21.323
like the theorized dark matter,
can be produced.

00:01:21.323 --> 00:01:23.993
The collision points 
are surrounded by detectors

00:01:23.993 --> 00:01:27.175
containing about 100 million sensors.

00:01:27.175 --> 00:01:29.295
Like huge three-dimensional cameras,

00:01:29.295 --> 00:01:31.665
they gather information 
on those new particles,

00:01:31.665 --> 00:01:33.073
including their trajectory,

00:01:33.073 --> 00:01:34.460
electrical charge,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.153
and energy.

00:01:36.153 --> 00:01:39.736
Once processed, the computers can depict
a collision as an image.

00:01:39.736 --> 00:01:42.945
Each line is the path 
of a different particle,

00:01:42.945 --> 00:01:46.155
and different types of particles
are color-coded.

00:01:46.155 --> 00:01:49.185
Data from the detectors 
allows scientists to determine

00:01:49.185 --> 00:01:51.186
what each of these particles is,

00:01:51.186 --> 00:01:53.936
things like photons and electrons.

00:01:53.936 --> 00:01:58.496
Now, the detectors take snapshots of about
a billion of these collisions per second

00:01:58.496 --> 00:02:02.416
to find signs of extremely rare
massive particles.

00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:03.745
To add to the difficulty,

00:02:03.745 --> 00:02:06.696
the particles we're looking for 
may be unstable

00:02:06.696 --> 00:02:11.817
and decay into more familiar particles
before reaching the sensors.

00:02:11.817 --> 00:02:14.118
Take, for example, the Higgs boson,

00:02:14.118 --> 00:02:18.498
a long-theorized particle that wasn't
observed until 2012.

00:02:18.498 --> 00:02:24.658
The odds of a given collision producing
a Higgs boson are about one in 10 billion,

00:02:24.658 --> 00:02:27.618
and it only lasts for 
a tiny fraction of a second

00:02:27.618 --> 00:02:29.539
before decaying.

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:33.638
But scientists developed theoretical 
models to tell them what to look for.

00:02:33.638 --> 00:02:38.109
For the Higgs, they thought it would
sometimes decay into two photons.

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.559
So they first examined only 
the high-energy events

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:43.568
that included two photons.

00:02:43.568 --> 00:02:45.440
But there's a problem here.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.720
There are innumerable 
particle interactions

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.180
that can produce two random photons.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.639
So how do you separate out the Higgs
from everything else?

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.880
The answer is mass.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.931
The information gathered by the detectors
allows the scientists to go a step back

00:03:00.931 --> 00:03:05.672
and determine the mass of whatever it was
that produced two photons.

00:03:05.672 --> 00:03:07.791
They put that mass value into a graph

00:03:07.791 --> 00:03:12.260
and then repeat the process
for all events with two photons.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.481
The vast majority of these events
are just random photon observations,

00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:20.102
what scientists call background events.

00:03:20.102 --> 00:03:24.032
But when a Higgs boson is produced
and decays into two photons,

00:03:24.032 --> 00:03:27.152
the mass always comes out to be the same.

00:03:27.152 --> 00:03:29.722
Therefore, the tell-tale sign
of the Higgs boson

00:03:29.722 --> 00:03:33.673
would be a little bump sitting on top
of the background.

00:03:33.673 --> 00:03:37.363
It takes billions of observations
before a bump like this can appear,

00:03:37.363 --> 00:03:39.774
and it's only considered 
a meaningful result

00:03:39.774 --> 00:03:44.113
if that bump becomes significantly 
higher than the background.

00:03:44.113 --> 00:03:46.094
In the case of the Higgs boson,

00:03:46.094 --> 00:03:49.883
the scientists at the LHC announced their
groundbreaking result

00:03:49.883 --> 00:03:52.975
when there was only 
a one in 3 million chance

00:03:52.975 --> 00:03:57.045
this bump could have 
appeared by a statistical fluke.

00:03:57.045 --> 00:03:58.875
So back to the dark matter.

00:03:58.875 --> 00:04:02.445
If the LHC's proton beams have enough
energy to produce it,

00:04:02.445 --> 00:04:06.906
that's probably an even rarer occurrence
than the Higgs boson.

00:04:06.906 --> 00:04:10.926
So it takes quadrillions of collisions
combined with theoretical models

00:04:10.926 --> 00:04:13.045
to even start to look.

00:04:13.045 --> 00:04:16.117
That's what the LHC is currently doing.

00:04:16.117 --> 00:04:17.886
By generating a mountain of data,

00:04:17.886 --> 00:04:20.966
we're hoping to find more tiny bumps
in graphs

00:04:20.966 --> 00:04:25.816
that will provide evidence for
yet unknown particles, like dark matter.

00:04:25.816 --> 00:04:28.287
Or maybe what we'll 
find won't be dark matter,

00:04:28.287 --> 00:04:29.475
but something else

00:04:29.475 --> 00:04:33.988
that would reshape our understanding 
of how the universe works entirely.

00:04:33.988 --> 00:04:35.999
That's part of the fun at this point.

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:38.426
We have no idea what we're
going to find.
