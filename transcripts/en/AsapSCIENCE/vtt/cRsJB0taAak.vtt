00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.700
The hallucination inducing drug ‘ayahuasca’
has been used for centuries by tribes in South

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.440
America during spiritual ceremonies. But as
it becomes more mainstream for those seeking

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.809
optic and auditory hallucinations, what exactly
is it, and how does it affect your body and

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:15.809
brain?

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.980
Ayahuasca is actually a combination of the
leaves of one plant (Psychotria viridis) and

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.010
the vines of another (Banisteriopsis caapi)
- neither of which have any hallucinogenic

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.640
power on their own. But the leaves do contain
DMT (N,N-Dimethyltryptamine), which is structurally

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.800
similar to your neurotransmitter serotonin
and to the chemical found in magic mushrooms!

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.940
The problem is, your gut enzymes normally
deactivate DMT before it’s absorbed into

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.430
your bloodstream; and this is where the vines
come in. They inhibit your gut enzymes from

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.740
working properly, and allow DMT to travel
within your blood and eventually cross the

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.990
blood-brain barrier.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.400
The effects of the drink usually hit around
half an hour after consumption, with hallucinations

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.420
peaking after one hour, and subsiding within
four to six hours. But these hallucinations

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.050
are reported to be different from drugs like
LSD and shrooms in that most people are fully

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.500
aware that they are visually hallucinating.
In addition, instead of ‘hearing voices’

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.360
the sounds heard are usually exacerbations
of the noises already occurring around them.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.140
And unlike those who consume LSD or shrooms
from a ‘good trip’, many who drink ayahuasca

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.720
are seeking to reconcile with their thoughts
and emotions, as well as past and present

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.280
traumatic events. Afterwards, most feel more
at ease with their thoughts, and more accepting

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.090
of their present situation.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.010
The Default Mode Network, is a distinct area
of the brain that if overactive is associated

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.810
with depression, anxiety and social phobia.
And fMRI brain scans show that ayahuasca causes

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.650
a significant decrease in activity within
the default mode network. This is usually

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.680
linked with a meditative state and explains
why for those seeking optic and auditory hallucinations,some

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.049
ayahuasca drinkers feel at peace with themselves,
and find a renewed sense of purpose after

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:49.049
a trip.

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.830
Additionally, DMT has been linked with proteins
that promote the maintenance of long-term

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.970
memory, neural plasticity and the regeneration
of new neurons. It can bind to specific receptors

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.760
found on mitochondria and endoplasmic reticula,
and may even have the potential to kill certain

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.950
cancerous cells. On top of this, alkaloids
from the vine have been shown to induce apoptosis

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.010
in mice melanoma cells and certain liver cancer
cells in humans. This is not to say that ayahuasca

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.690
is a replacement for radiation or chemotherapy,
but it may hold future possibilities for cancer

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.549
research. Interestingly, unlike other drugs
such as alcohol or cocaine, ayahuasca does

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.849
not seem to create a tolerance, so regular
drinkers aren’t required to drink more in

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.219
order to achieve the same effect experienced
the first time.

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:35.999
After consumption, drinkers usually suffer
violent retching, vomiting, and even diarrhea,

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:40.970
as the brew is extremely acidic, making an
upset stomach normal, even in experienced

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.900
drinkers. And there is a dark side of Ayahuasca
too - fatalities have been linked to its ingestion,

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.450
particularly among tourists, though the manner
of death is often undetermined. The increase

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.230
in popularity has also given rise to fake
shamans, unqualified to create the brew safely.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.810
Ultimately, the data is currently too sparse
to seriously consider ayahuasca recreationally

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.189
and more clinical trials are required to conclude
whether ayahuasca is safe.

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:25.589
and shows how common they actually are! You
can get a free 30 day trial at audible.com/asap
