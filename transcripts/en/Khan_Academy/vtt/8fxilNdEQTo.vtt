00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.220
I now want to introduce you to
the concept of leverage.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.690
And then in future videos, we'll
talk about this more in

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.030
terms of what leverage does
and when it's good

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.600
and when it's bad.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.190
We'll talk about it in a lot
of different contexts.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.690
Right now, I'll talk about
a little bit more in the

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.660
context of a bank.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.030
So let's say I start off my bank
again and I have 300 gold

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:27.355
pieces of equity and let's say
I use that for my building.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.530
That was 100 gold pieces.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.450
And then I have 200 gold pieces
that I just put into my

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.010
building just to start it off.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.890
Let's say I take a 100 gold
piece deposit, and of course I

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.970
have an offsetting checking
account that those people can

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.690
at any point use-- either to
write checks or at some point

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.700
they can come back and demand
their money back.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.235
Let's say I make out some loans
for different projects.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.920
Let's say 300 gold pieces loan
A-- and I do that just by

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.640
giving Person A or Entrepreneur
A or whoever took

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.060
this loan out a 300 gold
piece checking account.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.500
Let me just do one more loan.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.970
Let's say I make another
loan for 300.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.170
Loan B-- and I can give that.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.050
I could have also issued notes
and all of that, but let's say

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.300
I just give them a
checking account.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.730
And we have explored reserve
requirements and all that.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.290
Let's think a little
bit about leverage.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.660
And leverage is essentially, how
much assets do you control

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.520
with a certain amount
of equity?

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.930
So in our example right now,
what is our equity?

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.370
Our equity is equal to
300 gold pieces.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.290
Let me do it in a different
color just so the equity

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.360
stands out from the
liabilities.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.540
And how many assets are we
controlling with that 300 gold

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.750
pieces of equity?

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.020
So I have 300, 400,
700, 1,000.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:16.060
So, assets are equal to
1,000 gold pieces.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.200
So a lot of times people-- when
they talk about leverage,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.550
you might hear someone
say, 2:1 leverage.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.930
Well, that means the ratio
of the assets to

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.560
the equity is 2:1.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.040
In this case, the ratio of our
assets to equity-- so we have

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.790
assets to equity leverage, is
what people say-- in this

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.660
case, it's 1,000 to 300--
or what is it?

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.300
10:3.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.790
You seldom hear 10:3 leverage.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.830
You'll hear people talking in
terms of 10:1 or 2:1, or

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.600
something to one, but 10:3
is a fair leverage ratio.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.350
It tells you just how many
assets we're controlling with

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.600
a certain amount of equity.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.640
I guess a very good reason why
a bank wants to do this,

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.040
because if it's making more
money on its assets than it's

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.360
paying on its liabilities, in
theory, a bank will want to

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.540
take on as much leverage
as possible, right?

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.380
Because with this original 300
investment, every time it adds

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.900
some assets and some
liabilities, it's going to

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.600
make a difference.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.160
It's going to make the spread on
that money and so it wants

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.450
to keep doing that.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.040
But there's a downside to
leverage because what if the

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.730
bank-- what if some of these
loans aren't so good?

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.160
your What if some of these loans
just don't turn out to

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.960
be so good?

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.120
So leverage, when things are
good, when they go on the

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.650
upside, it kind of multiplies
how much money

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.200
you're going to make.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.860
But as you're going to see in
about a second, on the down

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.770
side, leverage also multiplies
the loss you would take.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:59.500
So in this situation, what
happens if I had a 30% loss--

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.090
let's say I have a 50% loss on
these loans that I made.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.190
In a world without leverage--
so if I didn't have all this

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.100
leverage, if I just had the
same amount of assets and

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.720
equity-- so in an example like
this where my assets are equal

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:18.339
to my equity-- if my assets go
down by 50%-- notice here I

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:19.110
have no liability.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:23.550
So this is all equity and
this is all assets.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.080
In this example, if my assets--
for whatever reason,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.160
I take a loss.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.370
If they go down by 50%, my new
balance sheet looks like this.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.480
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.880
My new balance you will look
like this-- 150 and 150.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.300
So my equity also went
down by 50%.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.690
I took a 50% loss because
maybe I made some bad

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:45.710
investments.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.890
But now that I have leverage,
what happens if the value of

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.170
my assets get written down
by-- at some point, I

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.690
determine that Loan B-- they're
probably not going to

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.520
pay up and Loan A maybe
won't pay up.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.140
So the value of my assets
go down by 50%.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.760
So I have 1,000 of assets-- so
essentially I'm writing down

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.730
my assets by 500.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:13.320
So let's say that I think Loan B
is only worth 50 and I think

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.920
that this is only worth 50--
because for whatever reason,

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.280
maybe I give these loans out to
build real estate or these

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.190
were loans to sub-prime
individuals.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.820
Who knows?

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.270
Whatever loans these were, they
just weren't good loans

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.800
and I realize I'm not going to
get 300 gold pieces back.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.010
I'm only going to get
50 gold pieces back.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.680
But in this situation,
what does my balance

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.200
sheet now look like?

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.060
Now that I had leverage, my
balance sheet looks like this.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:45.080
I have 100 in terms of
the building itself.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.445
Then I have 300 of
gold deposits.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.860
And then that first loan shrinks
to 50 only and then

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.390
that second loan
shrinks to 50.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.240
So now, what are my
total assets?

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.490
This is 50 and this is 50.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.040
So I have 100 plus 300 plus
250-- so it's 100.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.360
So I have 500 of assets,
which is

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.130
consistent with what I said.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.780
Our assets go down by
50% because I had

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.160
1,000 of assets before.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.950
And then what are
my liabilities?

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.310
Well, I owe this 300 checking
account, this 300 checking

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.100
account-- because he might have
written checks to other

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.440
people so it's not necessarily
the same person that I lent it

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.860
to initially.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:37.620
But I have-- let's see--
700 of liabilities.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.340
So notice, I now have negative
equity, right?

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.720
Because assets are equal to
liabilities plus equity.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.860
Well, if my assets are 500 and
my liabilities are 700, then

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:52.850
what is my equity?

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:57.060
Well, my equity's going
to be minus 200.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.700
So essentially I'm broke.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.670
This bank is out of business.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.040
And in this situation, there's
a very good reason for people

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.470
to want to get their
money back.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.620
There's a very good reason to
have a run on this bank

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.120
because frankly, even if you
gave this bank all the time in

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.540
the world, this bank is not
going to be able to

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.450
pay back its money.

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.880
Even if it were able to offload
these loans, it still

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.550
does not have enough money to
satisfy all of the demand

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.570
deposits or all of
the liabilities.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.023
And this situation is
called insolvency.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.020
Let me do that in
another color.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.700
And that just means you
don't have the money.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:36.450
You're not good for it.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.500
Remember, when we talked about
the reserve ratio, that dealt

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.080
with illiquidity.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.050
You wanted to make sure you
had enough gold left aside

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.320
that when people came and said,
I want my gold back,

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.830
that you had gold to
give it to them.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.420
But if by chance, people ask for
more gold than you had, it

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.550
doesn't mean you're
out of business.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.600
You just essentially have to
tell them, oh well, can you

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.340
wait a little while while I deal
with my assets and wait

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.750
for those loans to
get paid back?

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.290
You're still solvent.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:03.410
Insolvency is when you actually,
because of bad

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:07.090
investments, you actually end
up with less assets then do

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.330
have liabilities and then
there's nothing left over in

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.710
the equity column.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.360
And that's what leverage is a
measure of, because if you

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.320
have really high leverage, then
you-- notice, when we had

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.590
no leverage, you could take a
50% loss really easy, but now

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:23.040
that we had even 10:3 leverage,
even a 50% loss

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.490
wiped us out.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:28.330
And if you had 10:1 leverage,
then even a 10% loss would

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.040
wipe you out.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.280
So leverage really is a measure
of how much cushion do

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.580
you have to take losses
in the future.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.654
Anyway, before I run out of
time-- and in the next video,

00:08:36.654 --> 00:08:39.480
I'll actually talk about how
leverage is regulated within

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.190
banks, but just to give you
another measure of leverage--

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.560
because this measure I gave
you-- if someone says 10:3

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.420
leverage, it's assets to
equity-- another one that

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.950
people often use, often
in the investing

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:54.080
world, is debt to equity.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.910
But it's really a measure
of the same thing.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.210
Because if someone tells you
debt to equity, you can figure

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:01.130
out the assets to equity, but
in this case, the debt to

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:04.460
equity ratio before I took
any losses-- it was what?

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:09.920
My liabilities are-- this, you
can view that as debt because

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.310
I owe these people that
money-- is 700 and

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:13.410
my equity is 300.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:17.240
So it's 7:3 is my debt
to equity ratio.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.140
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
