00:00:00.204 --> 00:00:01.620
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.270
prove that the opposite
angles of a parallelogram

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.120
are congruent.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.790
So for example, we want to prove
that CAB is congruent to BDC,

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.940
so that that angle is
equal to that angle,

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.100
and that ABD, which
is this angle,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.470
is congruent to DCA, which
is this angle over here.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.160
And to do that, we
just have to realize

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.910
that we have some
parallel lines,

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.220
and we have some transversals.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.090
And the parallel lines
and the transversals

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.024
actually switch roles.

00:00:26.024 --> 00:00:28.440
So let's just continue these
so it looks a little bit more

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.461
like transversals
intersecting parallel lines.

00:00:33.461 --> 00:00:35.460
And really, you could
just pause it for yourself

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.930
and try to prove it, because
it really just comes out

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.670
of alternate interior angles
and corresponding angles

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.740
of transversals
intersecting parallel lines.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.184
So let's say that this
angle right over here--

00:00:47.184 --> 00:00:49.100
let me do it in a new
color since I've already

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.610
used that yellow.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.247
So let's start right
here with angle BDC.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.740
And I'm just going
to mark this up here.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.770
Angle BDC, right over here-- it
is an alternate interior angle

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.050
with this angle right over here.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.550
And actually, we could
extend this point over here.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.920
I could call this
point E, if I want.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.710
So I could say angle CDB
is congruent to angle

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:30.650
EBD by alternate
interior angles.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.720
This is a transversal.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.020
These two lines are parallel.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.680
AB or AE is parallel to CD.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.660
Fair enough.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.300
Now, if we kind of change
our thinking a little bit

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.380
and instead, we now view BD
and AC as the parallel lines

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.520
and now view AB as
the transversal,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.930
then we see that
angle EBD is going

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.170
to be congruent to
angle BAC, because they

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.435
are corresponding angles.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:10.560
So angle EBD is going to
be congruent to angle BAC,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.520
or I could say CAB.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.012
They are corresponding angles.

00:02:18.012 --> 00:02:19.970
And so if this angle is
congruent to that angle

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.230
and that angle is
congruent to that angle,

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.110
then they are congruent
to each other.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:30.380
So angle-- let me make sure
I get this right-- CDB,

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.540
or we could say BDC, is
congruent to angle CAB.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.012
So we've proven this first
part right over here.

00:02:39.012 --> 00:02:40.970
And then to prove that
these two are congruent,

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.500
we use the exact same logic.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.445
So first of all, we view
this as a transversal.

00:02:47.445 --> 00:02:51.800
We view AC as a
transversal of AB and CD.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.870
And let me go here and let
me create another point here.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.140
Let me call this point
F right over here.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.400
So we know that
angle ACD is going

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.360
to be congruent to
angle FAC because they

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.960
are alternate interior angles.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.115
And then we change our
thinking a little bit.

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:21.990
And we view AC and BD
as the parallel lines

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.020
and AB as a transversal.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:31.260
And then angle FAC is going
to be congruent to angle ABD,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.430
because they're
corresponding angles.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.390
Angle F to angle ABD, and
they are corresponding angles.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.630
So in the first time, we viewed
this as the transversal, AC

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.810
as a transversal of AB and
CD, which are parallel lines.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.770
Now AB is the transversal and BD
and AC are the parallel lines.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.666
And obviously, if this
is congruent to that,

00:03:54.666 --> 00:03:56.540
and that is congruent
to that, then these two

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.280
have to be congruent
to each other.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.030
So we see that if we have
opposite angles are congruent--

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.320
or if we have a
parallelogram, then

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.050
the opposite angles are
going to be congruent.
