00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.280
So we'll now build truth tables for conjunctions and disjunctions and

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.590
negations of sentences, so that we can find the truth of complex sentences

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.550
stated in logic. Now many of you probably are familiar with truth tables, and

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.310
if you are in fact familiar with truth tables, then you can skip this part and

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.852
go directly to implication elimination. If you're not familiar with this then

00:00:23.852 --> 00:00:28.084
please stay with me, but even so I'm going to go through this quite rapidly. So

00:00:28.084 --> 00:00:33.868
here is the truth table for A or B. If A is true, then B.

00:00:33.868 --> 00:00:39.930
If A is true and B is true, then A or B is true. If A is true and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.500
B is false, then A or B is still true, because A was true. If A is false and

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.354
B is true, then A or B is true, because B was true. One of them is true,

00:00:51.354 --> 00:00:56.550
makes this true. If A is false and B is false, than A or B is false.
