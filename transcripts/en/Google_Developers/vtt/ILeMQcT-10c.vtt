LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to "Coffee with a Googler."

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.150
Today I'm chatting
with Jen Person, who

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.250
has been the face of Cloud
Functions for Firebase

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.162
for some time.

00:00:06.162 --> 00:00:08.370
JEN PERSON: Hey, how's it
going, Firebase developers?

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.620
Install the Google
Cloud Storage module.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.940
Name is its path in storage.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.895
I'll log the event
and then return.

00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:16.590
LAURENCE MORONEY: Jen's here
today to talk about this

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.270
and also a couple of
nice big announcements

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.140
that she has for us.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.680
Welcome, Jen.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:22.950
JEN PERSON: Thanks.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:23.890
Happy to be here, Laurence.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:24.930
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
you've been working

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.138
Cloud Functions for Firebase.

00:00:26.138 --> 00:00:27.610
Can you tell us all about it?

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.318
JEN PERSON: Sure.

00:00:28.318 --> 00:00:30.840
So I have made some content
around Cloud Functions

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.460
for Firebase.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.070
It runs serverless
in the back end.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.264
And so that enables
you to run code

00:00:37.264 --> 00:00:39.180
that you wouldn't
necessarily want your client

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.530
to have access to.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.770
And prior to working on
Cloud Functions for Firebase,

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.380
I hadn't worked with that
kind of trigger before.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.460
And I really loved that
it was so easy to learn.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.040
So at first, I was like,
I thought, you know,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.410
a lot of this is stuff that
I could do myself already.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.400
An IOS developer.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.650
I could do a lot of
this from the client.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.560
But then I realized
that it was definitely

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.260
worthwhile to learn Cloud
Functions for Firebase,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.830
even though I wasn't that
familiar with JavaScript

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.050
before now.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.430
LAURENCE MORONEY: And one of
the magic things of Firebase

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.020
when we first launched,
it was like all this stuff

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.030
that you can do in the
client without having all

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.757
of these tiers and
managing these tiers,

00:01:16.757 --> 00:01:18.840
like for simple things
like data reads and writes.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.850
But we've learned over
time that, of course,

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.544
people still need to have
code running on the back end.

00:01:23.544 --> 00:01:24.210
JEN PERSON: Yes.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.000
That's true.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.160
We still need some things
running on the back end.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.370
But Firebase is still taking
a lot of that work out of it

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.870
for us.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.600
So it scales up and
down the service for you

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.934
so you don't have to worry
about managing that yourself.

00:01:35.934 --> 00:01:37.433
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And you don't have

00:01:37.433 --> 00:01:39.585
to worry about managing
specific servers, right?

00:01:39.585 --> 00:01:39.781
JEN PERSON: Right.

00:01:39.781 --> 00:01:40.380
Exactly.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.350
LAURENCE MORONEY:
FTP to this one

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.539
to deploy code and FTP to
that one to deploy code,

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:44.580
like in the bad old days.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.920
You just push it into the
Firebase and it does the rest.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.060
JEN PERSON: It just works.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.980
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
now Functions works off

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.540
a concept called triggers.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.070
Can you tell us a little bit
about that and what you think?

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.778
JEN PERSON: Sure.

00:01:54.778 --> 00:01:57.960
So a lot of times you're going
to run some code in response

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.420
to something that happened,
probably client-side,

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.540
or it could be something
like a write to the database

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.077
or adding something to storage,
authenticating a new user,

00:02:08.077 --> 00:02:09.660
maybe some sort of
important analytics

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.145
event, or maybe HTTP or Pub/Sub.

00:02:13.145 --> 00:02:15.270
Something that normally
happens in your app and you

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.700
want to run some snippet
of code every time.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.107
The code is triggered
based on that event.

00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:23.190
LAURENCE MORONEY: And that
was a perception change

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.310
that I had to make.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.064
And I didn't get
functions at first.

00:02:27.064 --> 00:02:28.480
And I watched some
of your videos,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.354
and then suddenly it
just dawned on me that--

00:02:30.354 --> 00:02:32.520
because to me, like, back-end
code would always be,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.320
I have to make a call, and
it would execute something.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.840
And I might have a Cron job
that does it occasionally,

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.980
or it's just something
to respond to users.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.070
But now it's like a field
in the database changes,

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.680
and the code will execute.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.300
Or an off-event happens
and code will execute.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.050
JEN PERSON: Right.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.110
LAURENCE MORONEY:
It's really cool.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.360
JEN PERSON: Yeah.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.380
And there are a lot of
great samples of this

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.520
on our GitHub Function Samples.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.280
And it's great to check it
out and try it for yourself,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.030
because if you're not
sure what it can do,

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.432
there are a lot of options
out there to try out.

00:02:58.432 --> 00:03:00.390
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
there's a code lab as well

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.540
for the friendly chats,
and some functions

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.980
have been added to that.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:05.966
Have you seen them?

00:03:05.966 --> 00:03:07.590
JEN PERSON: Yeah,
actually, and it also

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.950
uses machine learning as well.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.130
So you can really see
how Cloud Functions works

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.440
with all sorts of
other code that you'd

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.520
want to use in your apps.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.790
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.498
There's one really
neat function in there

00:03:16.498 --> 00:03:18.830
that like-- because friendly
chats for a chat room.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.600
And then sometimes people upload
bad pictures to chat rooms.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.700
And so what it does is
it uses a cloud function

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.090
to call our cloud services
to see if this content is

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.140
objectionable.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.120
And then if it is,
it blurs the image.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.200
JEN PERSON: Yeah.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.260
LAURENCE MORONEY: It's really--
that's one of my favorites.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.050
Whenever I demo, I
like to show that one.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.591
I show them the
blurred image and ask

00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:38.210
them to guess what it is.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.710
You'll have to watch some of
the videos to see for yourself.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.454
So Cloud Functions, you've been
doing a fabulous job on this.

00:03:43.454 --> 00:03:44.370
JEN PERSON: Thank you.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.120
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And you weren't even

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.740
a full-time Googler
when you were doing it.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.531
JEN PERSON: Guilty.

00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:48.379
Yes.

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:49.920
LAURENCE MORONEY:
I hope this doesn't

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.489
seen too much of an
empty compliment,

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.280
but I was really
surprised when I found out

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.360
that you'd become a
Googler, because I

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.704
thought you were one all along.

00:03:55.704 --> 00:03:56.620
JEN PERSON: Thank you.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.900
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Which is great.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.530
JEN PERSON: Yeah, I
had been a vendor.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.380
So working for
third-party at Google

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.830
for a little over a year.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.085
And actually, this is my second
day working as a Googler.

00:04:07.085 --> 00:04:08.460
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Always the joke

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.251
when somebody is on
their second day of job

00:04:10.251 --> 00:04:12.370
is like, you came back.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.080
So how's it been?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.260
How's the second full
day of work been?

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.760
JEN PERSON: It feels great.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.430
You know, it's such a
welcoming community anyway.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.160
I always felt like
I belonged as well.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.180
So in a lot of ways, it
feels like business as usual.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.150
But it's nice to have the title.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.380
LAURENCE MORONEY: It's good
that you mentioned community,

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.060
because you're going to
be doing some community

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.220
work in the coming months,
right, some conferences you're

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.784
speaking at.

00:04:32.784 --> 00:04:33.450
JEN PERSON: Yes.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.640
I'm going to a couple
of conferences soon.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.490
I'm going to Google Developer
Days Europe, which is

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.990
going to be in Krakow, Poland.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.948
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:04:40.948 --> 00:04:43.260
JEN PERSON: I'm going to be
doing a talk on app growth

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.035
and app quality.

00:04:44.035 --> 00:04:44.910
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.770
JEN PERSON: And yeah, I'd
love people to check it out.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.630
Showing some cool
Firebase features.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.370
It's got a great story.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.840
And I'm especially interested in
seeing other female developers

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.340
come out.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.570
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.860
JEN PERSON: I'd love to
communicate with them

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.130
and see what they're working on.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.690
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sure.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.189
It's been a tough time for women
recently in Silicon Valley.

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:02.959
So it's great to have women
up front speaking and women

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:05.250
talking about cutting-edge
stuff the way that you have.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.716
So if you're watching this video
and you're a woman in tech,

00:05:08.716 --> 00:05:10.590
please, please come
along to our conferences.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.196
You're very, very welcome.

00:05:12.196 --> 00:05:14.070
And we'd just be delighted
to have you there.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.890
And when we have folks like
Jennifer up front speaking,

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.267
hopefully it's--

00:05:18.267 --> 00:05:20.100
she's been an inspiration
to many of us here

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.960
and hopefully she
will be to you too.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.330
So as well as the
Poland one, you're

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.940
also going to be speaking
at the Firebase Summit.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.380
JEN PERSON: I am going to
be speaking at the Firebase

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.950
Summit.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.080
LAURENCE MORONEY: Can you give
us a hint on what it will be?

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.913
JEN PERSON: It's
definitely a favorite talk.

00:05:32.913 --> 00:05:34.060
People really enjoy it.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.310
LAURENCE MORONEY: No spoilers?

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.310
JEN PERSON: No spoilers.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.411
LAURENCE MORONEY: This is
like "Game of Thrones."

00:05:38.411 --> 00:05:38.910
OK.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.700
So this is going to be
end of October, right?

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.480
JEN PERSON: Yes.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.438
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:05:43.438 --> 00:05:45.246
So you're going to be there.

00:05:45.246 --> 00:05:47.120
The whole Firebase team
is going to be there.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.000
JEN PERSON: All of us
are going to be there.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.990
LAURENCE MORONEY: We're
going to do a bunch of talks.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.150
I'm not allowed to talk
about my talk either yet,

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.320
but we'll be there answering
questions on stage.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.995
And the whole thing's going
to be on video as well,

00:05:56.995 --> 00:05:57.620
which is great.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.700
