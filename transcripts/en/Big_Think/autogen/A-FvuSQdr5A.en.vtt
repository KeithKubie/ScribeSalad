but the Earth and Venus in many ways are
 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.510
but the Earth and Venus in many ways are
very similar they're about the same size

the only reason most of it gets

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770
the only reason most of it gets
 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.399
the only reason most of it gets
sequestered is because living creatures

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
sequestered is because living creatures
 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.300

provide these services for us so we are

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310
provide these services for us so we are
 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.020
provide these services for us so we are
a part and we're by and large and not

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
a part and we're by and large and not
 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.100
a part and we're by and large and not
terribly contributory part of this

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110

incredible planetary balance wheel that

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369
incredible planetary balance wheel that
 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.920
incredible planetary balance wheel that
works together to make earth not Venus

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930
works together to make earth not Venus
 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.920

so nature is incredibly important it

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930
so nature is incredibly important it
 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.850
so nature is incredibly important it
also happens to be incredibly beautiful

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860
also happens to be incredibly beautiful
 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.070
also happens to be incredibly beautiful
but I think we get confused it's not

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080
but I think we get confused it's not
 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.470
but I think we get confused it's not
important because it's beautiful

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480
important because it's beautiful
 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.320
important because it's beautiful
it's beautiful because it's important

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330
it's beautiful because it's important
 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.289
it's beautiful because it's important
the reason we like it is because in an

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299
the reason we like it is because in an
 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.809
the reason we like it is because in an
evolutionary sense it's what keeps us

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819
evolutionary sense it's what keeps us
 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.440
evolutionary sense it's what keeps us
alive we are hard-wired to respect and

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450
alive we are hard-wired to respect and
 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.780
alive we are hard-wired to respect and
love our parents because they keep us

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790
love our parents because they keep us
 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.300
love our parents because they keep us
alive and we are hard-wired to respect

alive and we are hard-wired to respect
 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.369
alive and we are hard-wired to respect
and love nature because nature keeps us

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379
and love nature because nature keeps us
 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.799
