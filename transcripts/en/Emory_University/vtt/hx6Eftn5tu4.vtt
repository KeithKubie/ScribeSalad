00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.940
The weird thing is: when I'm this close,
my whole point of reference becomes the

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.160
spinning aluminum and the painting, and so
at certain parts of feels like the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.180
rest of the room is spinning in the
opposite direction.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.560
My name is Dana Haugaard and I teach
Visual Arts

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.800
through the Art History Department at Emory University.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.560
So my main area of research is thinking about

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.980
how we exist with ourselves in spaces. So
I create installations in art that [try]

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.040
to focus your attention back to your
physical presence in a space.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.640
Some of the work is designed to just show yourself to yourself.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.220
Other work is kind of made to subvert your expectation

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.740
of the reflection. So either your reflection is reversed

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.500
or it is wildly stretched out, or in some of the works you even look at it

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.590
and you know it's a mirror, but your
reflection is denied because the mirrors

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.720
are at an angle. So you're not expecting
to see what you see.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.860
This body of work is--I call them paintings for lack of a
better word--but really they're kind of

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.460
very small installations. They're a
series of concentric circles painted on

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.220
mirrors that kind of incorporate you and
the environment into the work. And you're

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.660
kind of viewing yourself and the
environment through this filter of these

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.250
circle patterns that I've layered on to
the surface of the mirrors. I kind of

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.580
forget that I'm a physical presence in
space sometimes and I think a lot of us do.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.400
And to be confronted with an
experience of your physical presence in

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.100
space that is unexpected, kind of jarring
you back into the realization that you

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.780
are present, I think is a really
important thing to think about right now.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.280
With this large concave piece, I kind of
decided on a phrase to say and then kind of

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.060
repeated it over and kind of plotted
how the sound would travel through space

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.600
as I was saying it and then plotted it
onto

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.960
the mirrors.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.300
All of these kind of
mirrored paintings are kind of a very

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.520
laborious process, where it looks like it
could be printed or etched by a computer,

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.580
but it's all--they're all hand done line
work. You know, mask.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.560
Plot.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:23.560
Cut.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.900
Paint.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.160
This sculpture with the hula hoop, it's kind
of in the same series of these works

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.110
kind of thinking about memory and kind
of nostalgia. I spent so much time trying

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.860
to teach myself how to move in this
weird undulating way.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.040
And then, when I did it was great.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.340
It's like this weird,
useless task that you only really do to have fun.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.780
I've just installed a work at the Zuckerman Museum of Art at Kennesaw State University.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.520
And it really is about
kind of deconstructing and recontextualizing

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.190
memory and nostalgia. It's a video and
sound-based work where I ran a light

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.460
bulb out into the woods and put a very
sensitive microphone under it and taped it.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.170
I did it every night for two weeks.
And what I was recording were moths

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.260
flying to this light. And it didn't
record the sound of the moths and other

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.500
bugs, but it recorded kind of the air
displacement that their wings created.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.019
And a lot of the sound work I do isn't
really audible it's sensorial. I take

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.840
audio and convert it into physical
vibrations or sensation.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.720
So, in this installation the video is presented and
all of the audio is run through these

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:01.190
chairs that I made and all the audio of
the moths flying to this light kind of

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.940
create this full-body sensorial
experience as you're sitting in this

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.000
chair--where you know your presence in
this space is really anchored to your

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.380
physicality in the space.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.460
It's a it's a universal kind of memory I
think that people sit and kill time

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.530
staring at bugs hitting a light bulb. I
think everyone has probably done that at

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.280
some point in their lives, when their
phone's broken. But it's it's definitely

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.940
a constructed memory and so trying to
kind of highlight and show that this is...

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.460
it's an important memory, but it's not
real. And it's okay to feel comfort in

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.620
this, but you have to kind of go back into
reality when it's done.
