00:00:00.178 --> 00:00:01.638
- [Instructor] In the next
few videos, we're gonna do

00:00:01.638 --> 00:00:05.038
a very high-level overview
of ancient history.

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:08.038
We're literally going to try
to cover 3,000 years of history

00:00:08.038 --> 00:00:10.306
in a handful of videos.

00:00:10.306 --> 00:00:11.687
And we're going to focus on

00:00:11.687 --> 00:00:13.591
not all of the history in the world,

00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:15.718
and it's worth noting that
there's going to be history

00:00:15.718 --> 00:00:18.789
in North and South America
that we're not gonna talk about

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.675
in this video, history in
Africa or parts of Africa

00:00:21.675 --> 00:00:23.224
that we're not going to
talk about in this video,

00:00:23.224 --> 00:00:25.633
parts of Europe, parts of the Far East,

00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:28.193
but we're gonna focus
mainly on the Middle East.

00:00:28.193 --> 00:00:30.384
So, this yellow line, this is going to be

00:00:30.384 --> 00:00:34.473
the historical timeline for ancient Egypt.

00:00:34.473 --> 00:00:36.553
So, that is Egypt.

00:00:36.553 --> 00:00:40.206
We're talking about that
area right over there.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:42.422
This green timeline right over here,

00:00:42.422 --> 00:00:44.604
you could view this as Judea.

00:00:44.604 --> 00:00:47.127
We could also include,
we could include Judea,

00:00:47.127 --> 00:00:50.295
which is where modern-day
Israel, Palestine.

00:00:50.295 --> 00:00:51.508
If we're talking about Lebanon,

00:00:51.508 --> 00:00:53.526
then we could include
Phoenicia right over there.

00:00:53.526 --> 00:00:55.701
So, I'll just write Judea.

00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:57.099
Judea.

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:59.045
That's a little hard to read.

00:00:59.045 --> 00:00:59.878
Judea.

00:01:02.172 --> 00:01:04.625
This blue and red and
white line right over here,

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:07.151
this will be Mesopotamia.

00:01:07.151 --> 00:01:10.064
So, this will be Mesopotamia.

00:01:10.064 --> 00:01:12.254
We talk a little bit about
that in another video,

00:01:12.254 --> 00:01:15.989
the area between or around the
Tigris and Euphrates River,

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:19.942
mainly in modern-day Iraq,
that region right over there.

00:01:19.942 --> 00:01:24.838
So, if we say this is
Judea, this is Mesopotamia.

00:01:24.838 --> 00:01:28.564
And we will also touch a
little bit later on Persia,

00:01:28.564 --> 00:01:30.385
which is that area there.

00:01:30.385 --> 00:01:32.631
The ancient Greece.

00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:36.098
We're gonna talk a little bit
about Rome, about Carthage,

00:01:36.098 --> 00:01:39.388
and a little bit about the Indus Valley,

00:01:39.388 --> 00:01:41.926
the Indus Valley civilizations,

00:01:41.926 --> 00:01:45.248
which is in now modern-day Pakistan.

00:01:45.248 --> 00:01:47.335
So, with that geographic bearing,

00:01:47.335 --> 00:01:51.502
and this is a line for, I'll
call this the Indus Valley.

00:01:52.393 --> 00:01:55.560
Or Indus Valley, or I could say India.

00:01:56.678 --> 00:01:59.024
And, obviously, India's much more

00:01:59.024 --> 00:02:00.116
than just the Indus Valley.

00:02:00.116 --> 00:02:01.668
And even this line over
here, that's China,

00:02:01.668 --> 00:02:04.886
although I'm not gonna go much
into that into this video.

00:02:04.886 --> 00:02:08.053
So, let's start about 5,000 years ago.

00:02:09.208 --> 00:02:11.068
And there were already people

00:02:11.068 --> 00:02:12.755
in all of the regions that I talk about,

00:02:12.755 --> 00:02:14.024
but where I'm really highlighting

00:02:14.024 --> 00:02:17.791
is where you start to have
significant empires develop.

00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:21.002
And I'll start in Egypt,
where you have the Pharaoh,

00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:22.307
you have King Menes.

00:02:22.307 --> 00:02:24.667
He's able to unify Upper and Lower Egypt.

00:02:24.667 --> 00:02:26.229
And it's a little counter-intuitive;

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:29.182
Upper Egypt is actually
south of Lower Egypt,

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:32.028
and that's because the Nile
River forms further South

00:02:32.028 --> 00:02:34.045
and then it flows northward.

00:02:34.045 --> 00:02:38.024
And so, he's able to unify
Upper and Lower Egypt,

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:42.847
Upper's off the map here,
into the Egyptian civilization

00:02:42.847 --> 00:02:44.931
that we often associate
with ancient Egypt.

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:48.538
And it is a very, very, very
long-lived civilization.

00:02:48.538 --> 00:02:50.537
And this is right at around the same time

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:54.621
you have folks living in
Mesopotamia, you have the Akkadians.

00:02:54.621 --> 00:02:56.248
We're going into deep history now,

00:02:56.248 --> 00:02:58.370
so we don't know exactly what was going on

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.651
in the Indus Valley,

00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:01.430
but we believe that there
were people there as well,

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.603
and there were people
many, many other places.

00:03:03.603 --> 00:03:05.099
But now, let's fast-forward.

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.511
We're gonna go about 500 years.

00:03:07.511 --> 00:03:11.193
And we associate ancient
Egypt with the pyramids,

00:03:11.193 --> 00:03:13.658
and, relatively speaking,
the pyramids were built

00:03:13.658 --> 00:03:17.641
fairly early in the
history of ancient Egypt.

00:03:17.641 --> 00:03:20.224
They were built about 2500 BCE,

00:03:21.862 --> 00:03:25.779
or so we're talking about
4,500-4,600 years ago

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.029
was the time that,
especially the most famous,

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:31.992
the Great Pyramid of Giza was built.

00:03:31.992 --> 00:03:34.764
But now, let's fast-forward even more.

00:03:34.764 --> 00:03:37.266
And in this narrative
that I'm gonna talk about

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:40.223
in this video, I'm going to
introduce some characters

00:03:40.223 --> 00:03:41.577
from the Old Testament.

00:03:41.577 --> 00:03:43.268
And a lotta the stories
from the Old Testament,

00:03:43.268 --> 00:03:45.817
they have bases in
history, but some of them,

00:03:45.817 --> 00:03:47.802
the historical evidence isn't as clear.

00:03:47.802 --> 00:03:49.034
But I'm gonna include it

00:03:49.034 --> 00:03:52.852
because it's so much a
part of Judeo-Christian,

00:03:52.852 --> 00:03:56.594
Islamic, Western, and
not just Western culture

00:03:56.594 --> 00:03:58.440
that I think it gives us
an interesting bearing

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.867
and, frankly, a lotta the
stories from the Old Testament

00:04:00.867 --> 00:04:03.188
are just really fascinating stories.

00:04:03.188 --> 00:04:07.248
So now, let's fast-forward to 1700 BCE.

00:04:07.248 --> 00:04:10.033
And even though that seems like
a very, very long time ago,

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:12.798
and it was, it's nice to get our bearings.

00:04:12.798 --> 00:04:17.319
Because in 1700 BCE, and we're
gonna talk about Hammurabi,

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:22.145
who lived in, who ruled over
Babylon, the Babylonian Empire.

00:04:22.145 --> 00:04:25.562
So, Hammurabi right over here in Babylon,

00:04:27.848 --> 00:04:30.253
famous for the Code of Hammurabi.

00:04:30.253 --> 00:04:33.408
He codified a series of laws.

00:04:33.408 --> 00:04:38.265
We believe Abraham grew up at
around the same time in Ur.

00:04:38.265 --> 00:04:42.683
And Abraham, we believe
that he was coincident

00:04:42.683 --> 00:04:44.940
or maybe came a little bit after Hammurabi

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.285
because a lotta the Old Testament

00:04:46.285 --> 00:04:48.600
seems to at least be inspired

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.627
by some of what we see
in Hammurabi's Code.

00:04:51.627 --> 00:04:52.731
And it's worth noting that

00:04:52.731 --> 00:04:54.518
even though this seems
like a long time ago,

00:04:54.518 --> 00:04:58.207
around 1700 BCE, the time of Hammurabi,

00:04:58.207 --> 00:04:59.350
and it turns a little white here

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.149
'cause this is where the Babylonians

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:05.316
become one of the dominant
empires in Mesopotamia,

00:05:06.194 --> 00:05:07.541
even though it seems like a long time ago,

00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:09.848
it's worth noting that
in the time of Hammurabi

00:05:09.848 --> 00:05:12.140
and in the time of Abraham,

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.072
the pyramids were already close
to, what, 700-800 years old.

00:05:17.072 --> 00:05:19.454
So, they already would've
viewed the pyramids

00:05:19.454 --> 00:05:21.848
as a very, very old thing.

00:05:21.848 --> 00:05:25.721
But if we go with roughly the year 1700

00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:27.793
for about the time of Abraham,

00:05:27.793 --> 00:05:30.210
he goes to what becomes Judea

00:05:32.741 --> 00:05:35.991
and his tribe becomes established there

00:05:36.922 --> 00:05:39.208
and then ends up, that's
where I have this line

00:05:39.208 --> 00:05:41.875
going from Mesopotamia to Judea,

00:05:43.758 --> 00:05:46.595
and we kinda see the
established Judea here.

00:05:46.595 --> 00:05:48.005
And once again, they're
not the first people there.

00:05:48.005 --> 00:05:49.577
You had the Canaanites,
you had the Phoenicians,

00:05:49.577 --> 00:05:52.253
you had many other folks in this region,

00:05:52.253 --> 00:05:54.011
but this is interesting because it relates

00:05:54.011 --> 00:05:57.718
to the Old Testament that
many folks are familiar with.

00:05:57.718 --> 00:06:00.321
And then you have the Old,
so this is around 1700.

00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:01.154
Let me write this.

00:06:01.154 --> 00:06:02.571
This is 1700 BCE.

00:06:03.967 --> 00:06:07.052
And once again, I'll put approximately.

00:06:07.052 --> 00:06:08.861
And then you go a few hundred years

00:06:08.861 --> 00:06:11.991
and there isn't a lot of
historical basis here,

00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:15.143
but based on the Old
Testament, the story of Joseph,

00:06:15.143 --> 00:06:17.722
Joseph going to Egypt
and becoming the vizier

00:06:17.722 --> 00:06:20.565
for the Pharaoh and
then his family coming,

00:06:20.565 --> 00:06:22.749
Joseph, who is Abraham's grandson,

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:26.916
according to the Old Testament,
that story happens around,

00:06:28.717 --> 00:06:31.321
and once again, this is not
established well historically

00:06:31.321 --> 00:06:32.616
and I encourage you to look up

00:06:32.616 --> 00:06:34.570
and see if you can find evidence yourself

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.737
of when folks think this
is, but the best evidence,

00:06:39.654 --> 00:06:41.885
if this happened, the
best evidence I've seen

00:06:41.885 --> 00:06:46.245
is it's around 1500
BCE, the story of Joseph

00:06:46.245 --> 00:06:48.694
and the migration of the Jewish people,

00:06:48.694 --> 00:06:50.322
or a significant chunk
of the Jewish people,

00:06:50.322 --> 00:06:53.477
to Egypt, where they get enslaved.

00:06:53.477 --> 00:06:55.964
And that enslavement is from 1500,

00:06:55.964 --> 00:06:58.605
they get enslaved by the Pharaoh, 1500,

00:06:58.605 --> 00:07:00.772
to approximately 1200 BCE.

00:07:02.748 --> 00:07:04.389
And so, that story, you go all the way

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:08.556
from Abraham through Joseph,
this is in the Old Testament,

00:07:09.402 --> 00:07:11.401
this happens in Genesis,

00:07:11.401 --> 00:07:13.032
and then we get to the story of Moses,

00:07:13.032 --> 00:07:16.342
where he sets his people
free, the story of Exodus

00:07:16.342 --> 00:07:20.969
and the Jews are able
to go back to Jerusalem.

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:22.896
Moses leads them, parts the Red Sea,

00:07:22.896 --> 00:07:24.995
according to the Old Testament,

00:07:24.995 --> 00:07:28.076
and there established
the kingdom of Jerusalem

00:07:28.076 --> 00:07:29.483
where you have the famous kings,

00:07:29.483 --> 00:07:32.600
King Saul, then King
David, then King Solomon;

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.790
Solomon, who famous for
building the first temple.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.306
And now, since I'm already
close to the 10-minute mark,

00:07:39.306 --> 00:07:41.767
I'll leave you there,
because we've already covered

00:07:41.767 --> 00:07:44.414
about 2,000 years of history (laughs)

00:07:44.414 --> 00:07:45.825
in about eight minutes.

00:07:45.825 --> 00:07:50.767
In the next video, we're
gonna go from about 1,000 BCE

00:07:50.767 --> 00:07:54.350
to the Roman Empire
and the birth of Jesus.
