00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.920
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Good afternoon,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.420
and welcome to the
African/Middle East Division.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.820
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb,
Chief of the division,

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.050
and I'm happy to see you all here

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.190
for this very exciting
event with Kwame Dawes.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.030
Today's program is
the second this fall

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.980
in the ongoing Library
series entitled Conversations

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.410
with African Poets and Writers,
and the 25th in this unique series.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.540
In October, 2011, the
African Section

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.980 position:56%
of the African/Middle East Division,
in partnership with the Poetry

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.840
and Literature Center, headed by
Rob Casper; and the African Society

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.180
of the National Summit on Africa,
then headed by Bernadette Paolo,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.600
and now by Patricia Baine,
the present President;

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.680
and Ambassador Pamela Bridgewater,

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.550 position:56%
the Chairman of the Society launched
a new program in the Library

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.140
of Congress consisting
of conversations,

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.590 position:56%
interview with established and
emerging poets, short-story writers,

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.690
novelists, and playwrights of
continental and diasporic Africa.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.860 position:56%
The inspiration for that series came
from an earlier program organized

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.770
by the African Section
in November 2008

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.420
to celebrate the 50th anniversary

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.820
of Chinua Achebe's classic
"Things Fall Apart."

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.410
So here we are in 2016, and the
Conversations with African Poets

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.920
and writers is going strong.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.050
It is well-established and
has brought to the library,

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.110
and to our patrons and
readers, as to all those

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.280
who access the library's
webcasts around the world,

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.190
some of the best poets
and writers from Africa.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.870
The poets include Keorapetse
Kgositsile, the Poet Laureate

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:15.320
of South Africa; Susan Kiguli from
Uganda; Anna Mwalagho from Kenya;

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.260
Omekongo Dibanga from the
Democratic Republic of the Congo;

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.280
and Tijan Sallah from Gambia.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.340
We've also invited award-winning
writers like Amadou Kone

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.500
from the Cote d'Ivoire;
Igoni Barret from Nigeria;

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.250
Lemn Sissay from Ethiopia, who
then became the new Chancellor

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.950
of the University of Manchester.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.400
No connection, he was going to be
the Chancellor without our series,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.730
but anyway, I just
wanted to mention.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.380
And last week we hosted
Shenaz Patel,

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.130
the first Mauritian
writer in the series.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.650
There are too many to mention,
but we are partnering with others

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.000
to bring more of these exciting
writers and poets to the awareness

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.880
of the American and the
international public.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.730
But before we start the
program, I would like to say

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.020
that we are deeply honored to
have Kwame Dawes with us today.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.270
He has been described as the
busiest man in literature.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.140
So we are really privileged
to have him here,

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.990
an Emmy Award-winning poet,
actor, critic, musician,

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.870
editor, and so much more.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.830
Let me first introduce the
President and Executive Director

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.490
of our partner organization
the African Society

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.060
of the National Summit on
Africa, Patricia Baine,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.110
who will make some remarks
after which Robert Casper,

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.980
the head of the Poetry
and Literature Center,

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.210
who was behind inviting Kwame
Dawes, trying to convince him --

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.190
to bring him to come here.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.260
He will introduce Kwame Dawes.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.230
And then Dr. Angel Batiste,
Africa Area Specialist

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.440
in the African Section
of this division,

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.080
will conduct the interview.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.510
So Patricia.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.820
[ Applause ]

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.620
&gt;&gt; Patricia Baine: Good
morning again [applause].

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.920
I'm Patricia Baine.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.010
I'm President of the Africa Society
of the National Summit on Africa,

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.390
an organization that started
out as a grassroots organization

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.250
to engage Americans about
what they would like to see

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.970
and how they would
like to shape U.S.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.520
/Africa foreign policy.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.640
Today the Africa Society
is the premier organization

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.530
that engages Americans about Africa
and creates partnerships to inform

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.800
about the continent's peoples, its
cultures, and its contributions.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.040
And there's no better way to do
that than through a cultural lens,

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.220
because today we know
what influence culture has

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.040
on the perception of people.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.360
So today we're excited for another
iteration of our conversations

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.140
with African poets and writers,
with the African Section

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.960
of the Middle East and Africa
Division and the Poetry

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.290
and Literature Center of
the Library of Congress.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.590
Both of our organizations --

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.680 position:56%
all three of these organizations are
committed to providing a platform

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.680
for African literary figures.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:14.140
And it's our privilege today
to have Mr. Kwame Dawes.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.340 position:56%
I guess, if it's acceptable to call
him Ghanaian-Jamaican, I don't know.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.060
But you have a rich cultural
background that is only rivaled

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.950 position:56%
by your prolific artistic
expressions in literally everything,

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.840
poetry, novels, plays, film,
plus taking on a whole host

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.770
of social and cultural issues.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.210
We're honored to have
you today, and we're glad

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.660
that we have a good audience to
engage in this cultural exchange.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.610
And I will now ask Mr. Rob Casper,

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.510
head of the Poetry
and Literature Center.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.660
[ Applause ]

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.960
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Thank
you, Patricia.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.300
I was just remarking to Patricia
and to Mary-Jane how it feels

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.360
like a family gathering whenever
we come together for this series.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.540
It's thrilling to see the
great range of writers

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.360
from around the continent that
we've been able to feature here.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.670
And we're thrilled and delighted
to have Kwame Dawes here today.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.860
Before we begin that, let me ask
you to turn off your cellphones

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.600
and any other electronic devices
that you have that may interfere

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.430
with the recording of this event.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.410
Second, there's a Q-and-A
session, and if you participate

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.160
in the Q-and-A session,
you give us --

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.730
we ask that you gives us permission
for future use of this recording.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.500
We're recording it for webcast.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.640
Before I tell you about
Kwame and this program,

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.110
let me tell you a little bit about
the Poetry and Literature Center.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.140
We are home to the Poet

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.870

and Writers series events

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.450
As the two previous introductors
[sic] have said, we're thrilled

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.060 position:56%
and delighted, we're honored to
have Kwame Dawes here today to close

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.360
in the poetic arts of Africa.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.550
And I have to say on a personal
note that we've been working

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:54.810
on this series, the
other co-sponsors and I,

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.550
for many number of years.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:02.020
And it's so heartening to have
the opportunity to bring someone

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:06.270
who shares our commitment to
and vision of what literature

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.770
from the continent can do
for American audiences.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.510
So without further
ado, please join me

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:13.460 position:56%
in welcoming Kwame Dawes [applause].

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.270
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: So good afternoon.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.570
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:17.870
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: It's
good to be here.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:25.620 position:56%
It's a beautiful space, and I thank
Rob for initiating this conversation

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.940
that I hope will continue through a
series of collaborations and so on.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.730
We had a great dinner last night.

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:39.580 position:56%
And it is always good to find people
who value language and poetry.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:48.760
And as I've always said, poetry
is not the answer to everything.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.180
I think people who see poetry as
their religion are unfortunate.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:59.040
But there is a time
when a poem is needed.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.350
And when it's needed, it's
the only thing that's needed,

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:04.560
and it's the only thing
that will work.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.910
And I believe this sincerely,
and I believe this completely.

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:11.790
I also believe that
our art is a product

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:16.390
that generates this
remarkable thing called empathy.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.740
Not only generates it, but
it trains us in empathy.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:24.490
The truth is that all
acts of hatred, of racism,

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:28.800
of bigotry are predicated
fundamentally on a lack

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.290
of imagination and incapacity

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.170
to imagine what somebody
else is feeling.

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.360
That's the function of empathy.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:43.530 position:56%
It is possible to have that capacity
eroded, and in fact, destroyed,

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:48.000
and ultimately stopped in people
if they do not have the chance

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.160
to exercise this capacity
for empathy.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.140
And I think in the wisdom
of our millions of ancestors

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:59.070
over thousands, and thousands,
and millions of years,

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:02.770
we understood in our bodies that
the way to do so is through art,

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.550
through music, and
through the imagination.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:09.170
The more we kindle the imagination,
the greater our capacity

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:10.950
to hurt and damage each other.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.610
So this is my way of
saying it's good

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.240
that they pay me to write poems.

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.460
I'm saving the world.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:26.030
I'll just read a few poems, and I
look forward to the conversation

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:27.440
that we'll have in a minute.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.450
You know, my story is -- I
like to think it's interesting

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:37.280
because it's a challenging story.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.250
I was born in Ghana in West Africa.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.860
I grew up there until I
was about 10 years old,

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.960
and then eventually
we moved to Jamaica.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.260
So then I grew up also in Jamaica,
and then eventually left Jamaica

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.870
as a grown man to study in Canada.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:56.920
And then I've lived in
the U.S. since 1992.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.880
There's a way in which my
journey and the narrative

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:06.230 position:56%
of my journey is an echo of journeys
that those before me had made.

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:10.070
And here I talk about the
Middle Passage, that journey,

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:16.250
that forced journey that brought
Africans to the New World.

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:20.970
But even later than that, my own
grandfather, in about the turn

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:26.840
of the century, about 1905,
1906, decided to work --

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:32.960
to take on a gig with the
Colonial Office to go to Nigeria

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.720
to work there in Nigeria.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:41.230
And he went -- he worked in
Southern Nigeria in Warri.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:48.190
And there he littered the place
with a bunch of children, and --

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:51.920
including my father who was
born actually in Nigeria.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.780
So it turns out I'm
actually Nigerian,

00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:01.700
which is not something I say a
lot, but when it's necessary,

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.290
because you know, Nigerians
are very powerful people.

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.300
So when it's convenient
I make the association.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.780 position:56%
They're also annoying, so that's the
other reason why I struggle with it.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:14.100
But one can say the same thing
about -- decidedly about Jamaicans.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.400
Not Ghanaians.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.430
Ghanaians are always sweet.

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:23.510
So anyway, that journey was
interesting because in a sense,

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:27.450
he lived in Nigeria for about --
he and his family lived in Nigeria

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.360 position:56%
for about 15 years, almost 20 years.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.060
And then my father
did the same thing.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.920
Having been born in
Nigeria, he lived in Jamaica,

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:38.390
grew up in Jamaica, because
when he got to Jamaica

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:42.020
in 1928 he was just
about two years old.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:45.590
But then he went back to Ghana,
and that's how I came about,

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:48.580
because he married my
mother who is Ghanaian.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:49.880
And they had children.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.420
And he also lived in
Ghana for 15 years.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.850
This idea of migrations across --

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.710
that conversations
throughout this African --

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:03.100
Africa and its diaspora is
built into my body and my life.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:07.820
And so my whole work is about
speaking from a perspective

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.720
that recognizes an
entity called Africanness,

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:15.070
an entity that is Pan-African,
that is global,

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:17.520
that recognizes the
traces, and the dignity,

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.580
and the history of African people.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.570
And yet, it is comfortable
in the idea of movement,

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:24.780
and in the idea of migration.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.070
And so my work is about
making those connections.

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:28.610
It's not a crisis for me.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.050
It's not a conflict for me.

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:33.670
It is not a struggle
to understand myself.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:34.970
I get myself.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:36.370
I understand who I am.

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:39.760
I know, as Bob Marley says,
where I'm coming from.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.470 position:56%
So you know, I wouldn't have to ask
you, "Who the hell do I think I am?"

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.000
I know who I am.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.300
I'm a buffalo.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:52.490
I'm going to start singing.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:57.180
So my poetry reflects that, and
I'll read a few poems that do that.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:00.260
But I wanted to start with
a poem for Kofi Awoonor.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:07.150
Kofi Awoonor was a cousin,
related to my mother,

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.960
a dear friend of my father.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:16.890 position:56%
And when Kofi was killed in Kenya
several years ago during that attack

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:22.360 position:56%
at the mall in Nairobi, I was there.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.770
We were waiting for him to
come and do a reading, in fact,

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:29.980
because I had arranged for
him to come to Storymoja,

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.520
because we had just
published his book of poems,

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.210
his "New and Selected Poems."

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:39.170
So then we got the news
that he could not be found.

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:44.230 position:56%
And later on that night we found out
that he had died and been killed.

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:46.850
It's a painful recollection,
a painful memory,

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:52.170
because part of it was the sort of
struggle of knowing that I was --

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:56.020
you know, I had asked
him to come to Nairobi.

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:59.120
But I took great comfort, you know,

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.600
because I know the
family quite well,

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.180
in the fact that he
wanted to be there.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.060
And it was a chance
for me to see him again

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:07.050
and to actually show him
the cover of the book,

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:08.960
because the book hadn't
been printed --

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.840
that we showed him
the cover of the book.

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.970
And he was elated and
just felt good about it.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:17.980
But I -- so I like
to being my readings

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.540
with a poem dedicated to him.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.070
This is a little small poem --

00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:22.850
not a poem dedicated,
a poem that he wrote.

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:25.640
This is a small poem
called "Counting the Years,"

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.820
and it's by Kofi Awoonor.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:33.260 position:56%
"As usual, as in the earlier dreams,
I come to the whistling shores,

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.710
the voice of the high-domed
crab stilled.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:41.890
But a chorus remains of the
water creatures of earlier times,

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.970
of the birth time and
the dying time,

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:47.990
the pity when we resurrect
the travelers,

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:52.220
the anchorman on our singular
boat that will take us home."

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.770
Here's a poem called
"After Acceptance."

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.590
It's a poem for my father.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:09.430
"Then I read the monumental
legend of her love

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:11.700
and grasp her wrinkled hands."

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.620
It's a quote from one of his poems.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:20.460 position:56%
"You were a child there from two to
introverted 10, crafting your dreams

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.990
from tattered books teacher
Dawes crammed into his shelves.

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:26.660
Your brother was a knight,
and your sisters princesses,

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:30.450
and you write verse because
you longed for friends.

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.770
Curled in the cool underpart of
the creaking house on the hill,

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:38.370
you battled chickens for space to
sketch the worlds in your head.

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:39.790
We drove there together once.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:43.920
You, proud of the recollections
stirred, endeared each sharp bend

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.160
in the road with names
like Breadfruit Curve,

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.110
Star Apple Corner,
and Tamarind Arch.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.450
Your laughter was nervous
nearing the house,

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:57.190
the child in you drumming a rhythm
on the sweat-slick steering wheel.

00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:00.140
On the slack porch, you pointed
through breadfruit leaves

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.980 position:56%
to the faded line of the sea and sky

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.940
where Cuba wavered
in the midday haze.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.280
From there as a child
you learned of otherness,

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.830
worlds beyond the house
afloat in a sea of green.

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:15.340
From there your home became
a point from which to leap.

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:20.320
I walk the overgrown paths where,
fired with Arthurian legends,

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.600
you galloped, mad-child on
a wild, irreverent steed,

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.290
dizzy in the patchwork of
sunlight through the branches.

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:30.890
The thought of you as child
is real as the trees towering.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:34.200
And staring upward, I trace
your steps, avoiding the trunks

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:38.130 position:56%
by the pattern of leaves in the sky.

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:41.060
The child overwhelms
my straight-back logic,

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:45.240
and suddenly I am sprinting,
beating hoofbeats against my chest,

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.650
light blazing green on my face, my
shouts echoed in the tree trunks.

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:55.800
On the barbecue, dry
brown pimento beans roast.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.960
The ancient chair she
sat in is there

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:02.560
where a rotting orange tree
leans and sheds brittle leaves.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:07.200
The chair is light and fading,
sucked dry by sun and salt wind.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.850
I can see her, bandannaed there,

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:13.250
sharp calico against
the hill's gray,

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:17.970
her wrinkled hands outstretched,
trembling, her eyes glowing.

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:22.310
Maybe your ghosts hover
above the house a night,

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:25.110
but I came at daytime,
so I'm not sure.

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:29.730
But teachers, you taught me much
in the lesson of your silent ways.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:35.500
While there, I smelled ink, and
the dust sneezed is chalk dust.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.340
Your world was a noble one,
you cloud of holy witnesses

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:44.420
who sought new worlds to
replace the chain-link silences.

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:48.830
Daily Bible verses etched on
your brow, missionary zeal,

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.780
and gave strength to
your upright eyes.

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:54.650
Now you hover above
this house that crumbles

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:57.320
where the wood ticks termites.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.840
Maybe, grand ones, your
ghosts linger above the house,

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.800
meeting there, then
together swoop down,

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:07.100
one wind lifting a tattered
sheet's edge, one animation,

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:12.200
now a brilliant O, cooling
with a breath the sheen of toil

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:16.020
on some weary back, shifting
breadfruit leaves to a rustling

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:20.110
as eyes turn upward, smiling
at the cool, not at you,

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:22.870
not knowing that ghosts are wind.

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:25.040
You return morose,
having done your part

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:29.220
of touching the living before dawn
and getting little thanks for it.

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:32.570
You return to your tombs in which
you were sheltered from the swelter

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:39.100
of sun and the tramping of my
feet now in the gray and green.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:45.230
I praise the dream of Sturge Town
and the silent homecoming it was.

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:50.210
I praise the songs of the ghosts
sealed in my mind's chrysalis.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:54.280
I praise the constant leaves
spinning in the pure air.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:22:00.170 position:56%
I praise the hands that birthed you,
worn as they were, for they glowed,

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:05.160
stained red with first blood
spilled into this navel-string

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.830
where for years the ancient
red-barked trees have stood.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:13.630
I praise these things freed
by your wrinkled hands."

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:18.880
I'll read two more poems.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.190
That should do the trick.

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:23.850
This is a poem called
"African Postman."

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:31.020
Some years ago I was invited
by the BBC to write a piece

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:34.600
about Haile Selassie
to do a documentary.

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.930
It's actually for radio,
for BBC Four.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:41.650
And the idea was that I would do
a documentary about his period

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:44.480
in exile in Bath, England.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.510
So I was going to go
to Bath and, I guess,

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:50.150
talk to some people
at Bath, and so on.

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:53.550
And then I thought, "Well,
I should go to Ethiopia.

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:55.920
I mean, what's -- how do
you -- what's the point?

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.070
And you know, BBC is paying."

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:02.600
So I convinced them to pay
for me to go to Ethiopia.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.560
And I did, and it was one of the
most beautiful and powerful times.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:09.980
I got to talk to all kinds
of people who knew him.

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.860
And this is a poem
called "African Postman."

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.630
It's dedicated to a man
called Solomon Ephraim Woolfe.

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:16.930
I met him.

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:19.220
He was a Jamaican living
in Sheshemane.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:23.310
That, you know, 500 acres of
land that Selassie had ceded

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:27.750 position:56%
over to anybody from the diaspora
who wanted to go back to Ethiopia --

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:30.470
or go back to Africa to live.

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:34.300
And Solomon Woolfe was a Jamaican
who was one of those Rastas

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:37.040
that decided to take him up on it.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.710
And I asked him some questions,

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:41.500
and then came the most
troubling question, which was --

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:47.170
my question to him was how did
it feel when Haile Selassie died,

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:50.850
which is not a question
you ask a Rastafarian.

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:53.650
So "Africa Postman."

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:55.250
"Son, who is that?

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:57.640
Is the African Postman, Daddy.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.290
Burning Spear.

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:03.410
East from Addis Ababa then
south deep into the Rift Valley,

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:08.020
I can hear the horns trumpeting
over the flat-roofed acacia trees,

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:11.140
see the African women bend low
with wood heavy on their backs,

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:14.730
and the cows, goats, donkeys,
mules sheep, and horses snapped

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:19.860
into obedient herds by sprinting
children moving along the roadside.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:21.330
Life happens here.

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:24.300
I am travelling to the land I
have heard about, Sheshemane,

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:27.700
the green place, 500 acres
of Jah's benevolence.

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:31.510
And I know now that I long to
hear the rootsman tell me how,

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:34.740
despite rumors of his passing,
the natty keeps on riding,

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.230
keeps on standing in the
fields of praise to hold

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:39.920
onto the faith of roots people.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.600
Brother Solomon, you put the
name Ephraim on your head

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.500
and carry the face
of the true Rasta,

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:48.100
the face of an Ashanti warrior,
eyes deep under heavy lids,

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.380
and your skin tight as
leather, blacker than black.

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:54.540 position:56%
I have met you before on the streets
of Kingston, there where you trod

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.710
to the hiss and slander
of the heathen.

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:59.830
You, natty dread, gathering
the people's broken minds

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:01.250
into your calabash.

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:04.410
You carry it all, tell
them, "Return to the roots,

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:06.600
the healing shall take place."

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.240
You are Burning Spear's
voice in the fields of teff.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:13.280
You tell me of the prophecy of
Marcus, and I listen to you,

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.230
through the phlegm, through
the gruff of your voice.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.420
And suddenly when I ask you
about the passing of the Emperor,

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:22.900 position:56%
you rise up like a staff of
correction, your voice reaching back

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:26.740
to the mountains, your warrior
self, our yardman greatness,

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:31.120
and you speak a mystery of those
who have ears but won't hear,

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.020
and those who have
eyes and won't see.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.940
And I know that this dread
will one day stand in this soil

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:42.000
and find his feet growing roots,
that soon the earth will be darker

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.860
for the arrival of Solomon.

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:47.440
Oh, let the heathen rage,
let the doubters scoff,

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.860
let this Ghanaian youth whose eyes
have seen the face of Jesus Christ,

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.790
let him, too, sit and marvel
at the faith of the natty.

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:58.970
For this African postman has
forsaken father and mother,

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:02.660
and has come to stand
before His Imperial Majesty,

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:06.270
to call only him father, so that
the father might call him son,

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:09.470
and the world will carry
on its weary march.

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:12.700
And the ibises will swoop
in the Ethiopian dusk,

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:16.410
and the smoke will rise from the
wood fires, and the night will come

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:20.770
with the news that the
rootsman, after 400 years

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:24.040
of being told he's
homeless, has come home.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.190
Yes, Jah, has come home.

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:30.230
Sons and daughters of His
Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie,

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:35.340
Earth Rightful Ruler, without
any apology say, this is the time

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:38.760
when I, and I, and I, and
I should come home, yes,

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.700
Jah, oh, come a holy foe.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:49.050
Nah leggo, nah leggo, nah leggo."

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:56.490
Okay, so I'll end with
a poem called "Rope."

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.020
I was happy to see when I went

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:02.090
to the African American
Museum yesterday that --

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:06.690
you know, I was nervous
going in because I said --

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:08.420
I went to the theater
section, and I said,

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:12.070
"I they don't feature
[inaudible] and August Wilson,

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:14.500
I'm burning the place down."

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:18.280
And I was happy to see
that they recognized.

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.580
So those two are featured.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:23.390
August Wilson is the center of a
new collection of poems that comes

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:26.600
out this year from the
[inaudible] from me called,

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.970
"City of Bones, a Testament."

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:33.020
And this poem called "Rope" is a
response to August Wilson's work.

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.690
Some of the work I've done, the
academic work, the scholarly work,

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:40.950
is to talk about August Wilson's
engagements in African aesthetics,

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:42.630
the idea of diaspora,
the aesthetics,

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:45.610
but particularly the African
aesthetics in his work.

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:50.150
But his poems -- his plays are
remarkable, just an amazing thing.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:51.820
So this poem is called "Rope."

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:54.880
I usually read the last few
lines of the poem first,

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.750
and then I'll come
back and start again.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.840
So this is how the poem ends.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:03.090
"Someday a soul will
come out of the fields

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:07.570
to claim it, and then we will know.

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:10.290
Someday a soul will
come out of the fields

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:14.270
to claim it, and then we will know.

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:18.000
To hold our lives together on
the cart before the slow march

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.140
after midnight along
backroads, blind-driving,

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:24.570
the scent of the exhaust
making us drowsy,

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:28.780
every shadow in the fields a
threat of sorts, we use rope thick

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:32.860
as two thumbs side by side, pulling
hard on the knot to keep our parts

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:35.590
from falling by the wayside.

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:38.510
We have kept this rope supple
with oil, constant use,

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:42.020
never letting it stay
idle long enough to rot.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:45.410
It is hard to look at the coiled
silence of our strongest rope

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:47.890
and not think of what it has held,

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:51.210
the heavy grey-green battered
bucket knocking the stone sides

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.260
of the wall, top water
spilling back down,

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:58.370
this cherished substance
carrying our lives.

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:03.430
The mare, white and grey, plodding
across the wide open field at dusk,

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:07.750
her head heavy with labor, the
rope a caress against her cheek,

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:11.460
the way she turns toward
a gentle tug.

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:15.630
We hold the balance of
our need in this rope.

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:22.110
The dead weight of Junebug at
dawn, his skin still steaming,

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:26.010
his beautiful black skin
catching the morning light,

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:31.620 position:56%
tender among the leaves, how we
found him there, his neck stretched,

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.370
the wrapping of several
yards of taut rope

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:39.740
around the drooping branch, where
we found it, how we undid the knot,

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:43.090
let his body down into
our arms, then carried it

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:47.380
like a soldier's flag,
bearing it behind the cart,

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:50.490 position:56%
shaking along with his swollen body.

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:55.460
This ordinary rope, this
gift we cannot forget,

00:29:55.460 --> 00:30:00.510
this remembrance of
what we have lost.

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:04.540
Someday a soul will
come out of the fields

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:08.510 position:56%
to claim it, and then we will know."

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:10.510
Thank you.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:20.240
[ Applause ]

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.540
Thank you.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:22.840
&gt;&gt; Angel Batiste: Kwame,
I have a few questions.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.140
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: A few
questions, good.

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:28.940
&gt;&gt; Angel Batiste: And each
question has many parts.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:38.370
I'd like to start with asking
you wear many hats, actor,

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:42.490
writer, scholar, musician.

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:48.640
How did you come into writing?

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.200
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: So these days
I've been sort of rehearsing --

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.960
I've obviously answered
this question before,

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:57.180
and I realize sometimes
I lie in my answers.

00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:01.560
And then the lie becomes
sort of rigid as truth.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.740
We see a lot of that.

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:07.360
So these days I'm -- I've been
forced to re-examine my answers

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.760
to these questions so that I can
speak some truth in all of this.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:16.660
It turns out, though, that you
know, writing is a funny thing.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:17.960
There are two parts to it.

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:22.850
One is the motivation to do
it, to actually do the writing.

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:26.010
The other part is to
feel permission to do it,

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:28.020
the sense that it's okay to do it.

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:32.240
And I think some of the struggles
that most writers who are beginning

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.540
to write have is asking themselves,
"Do I have a right to do this?"

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:40.040
Or, "Do I have -- is it in
-- it doesn't make sense."

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:44.760
Wives and concerned family
members will say, "What?"

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.330
And they mean it, and
they are not wrong.

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:50.130
This may not necessarily
be the most --

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:54.480
the easiest way to eat
on a regular basis.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.330
So there are those two questions.

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:59.670
And the other question
is is it in the realm

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:03.110 position:56%
of possibility as a kind of reality?

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:08.090
So for the first one, I think it's
safe for me to say that I wrote

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:11.640
and I write because I read.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:16.820
So the business of
reading gave me pleasure.

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:21.950
And for some -- at some point I
became interested in replicating

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:25.150
that sensation, and I
discovered that the pleasures

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:28.060
of reading can be replicated
somehow in writing.

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:31.920
They are not equivalent,
but they are similar.

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:36.590
So we grew up in Ghana, and
my father was notoriously

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:39.510
against television in the '60s.

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:41.560
So we didn't have a television.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.000
People did, but we didn't.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.670
And he was adamant about that.

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:47.540
I just think he didn't
want to buy a TV,

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:51.420
but he had wonderful philosophical
reasons for not buying.

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:54.200
You know, it's market -- he was
a Marxist, so it's capitalist,

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:57.470
and it's just -- it will addle
your brain, and things like that.

00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:59.970
So -- but what he did
do is that he said,

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:01.880
"You can buy any book you want.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.410
And I don't -- I won't
quarrel with that."

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:08.510
And so -- and this meant comics
even, like you know, Marvel comics.

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:11.540
Anything that you read,
he said, "That's fine."

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:18.250
So we just bought comics
[laughter], and he paid for it.

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:19.550
That's great.

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:21.240
But -- so we did -- we realized

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.720
that our entertainment would
have to be through reading.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.360
And so that's what it was.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.350
And I think soon we as kids --
there were five of us growing up --

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:31.860
and I think we as kids began to
-- if we ran out of books to read,

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.700
we began to play around
at writing these books.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.640
We were not precocious
little bright kids.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.010
We just -- you know,
we -- you know, you go,

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:41.120
you bully some kids,
you beat them up.

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.350
And then you come home, you
don't have anything to do,

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:44.650
you don't have a book to read.

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:46.150
You say, "Hey, let's
make up some stories."

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:49.290
So it's that -- we were
-- that's what we did.

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:52.240
Now this doesn't mean all my
family does -- my family --

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.890
I'm the only one who is a writer.

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:56.210
So that's -- I think
-- but that sense

00:33:56.210 --> 00:34:00.230 position:56%
that I could replicate the sensation
and the pleasures of reading

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:02.810
through writing started
fairly early.

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:06.190
And the only other thing that I
think continues to be relevant

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:11.720
to my impulse to writing is
that when I was about 11, 12,

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:16.420
maybe about 13, I discovered
this thing called pen pals.

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:19.880
And in those days there were
these little teen magazines

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.170
that would come, and in
those teen magazines,

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:26.900 position:56%
at the back of them people from all
over the world would put their names

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:30.730
and their addresses, and you
could just write a letter to them,

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:34.570
and you know, you wait three --
well, you wait a month, really,

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:37.440
maybe a month and a half
-- it's not email --

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.560
and it will come back,
right, with a response.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.050
And I began to do a
lot of pen pal writing.

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:48.240 position:56%
And I became kind of drawn to it
because I think it's hard for people

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:50.500
who are younger to
understand that in a world

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:56.910 position:56%
in which there is no Internet,
there is no googling of information,

00:34:56.910 --> 00:34:59.720
I could become very quickly,

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:04.770
at least for the people I was
writing to, the premier authority

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:07.030
on everything -- not just me,

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:11.000
but everything Jamaican,
to be honest with you.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.360
I gain authority because if I
said I like Ackee and saltfish,

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.840
they couldn't google
Ackee and saltfish.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:22.520
So if I said Ackee tastes like
-- you know, like ice cream,

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.310
they just had to take
my word for it.

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:26.770
You understand what I mean.

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:29.140
But I was -- I became
enamored of this process.

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:30.940
And I wasn't trying to fake it.

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:36.340 position:56%
I was trying to -- I found it
exciting that I could bring somebody

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:39.150 position:56%
into my world and describe my world.

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:41.730
But I also was seduced by the fact

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:46.950
that in these letters I became
a protagonist, that I had power,

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:51.840
that I had a way to manage
narrative and manage experience.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:55.680
If I got beat up by somebody,
even in the returning of it,

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.380
even though I was the one beat up,

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:59.920
I became the heroic
figure in that narrative.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:03.430
And this I found deeply
seductive and very attractive.

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:09.420
And I can't say that that impulse
of writing for the pleasure

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:14.630
of making words happen for me, and
then writing with the knowledge

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:17.550
that somebody else is reading
it, and writing with the sense

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:22.240
that they will return back to me a
response to it, has ever changed.

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:27.900 position:56%
I think that desire, that
sensation still remains at the heart

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:32.020
of literally everything that I
do that's pertaining to writing,

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.690
to the theater arts, to
literature, and so on.

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:37.640 position:56%
So that's a sort of broader picture.

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:40.430
The step-by-step processes
would be a different thing.

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:44.980
But I think that's where the
impulse came from and has continued

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:49.510
until that -- so I'm not the guy
who says, "I write for myself."

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:52.200
I'm not that guy.

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.500
&gt;&gt; Angel Batiste: Okay.

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:54.850
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: I don't
understand that guy.

00:36:54.850 --> 00:37:01.050
I think that guy is
lying, frankly, so.

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:05.790
&gt;&gt; Angel Batiste: I'd like to go
to your work "Natural Mysticism."

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:12.970
In the work you construct the
concept the Reggae aesthetic.

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:16.320
What is the Reggae
aesthetic and how has

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.630
that influenced your
writings, your work?

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:22.110
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: Yeah,
so at some point --

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:24.160
you know, here's an
interesting story.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:29.400
Just recently I've been looking
at diaries I wrote in my 20s.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:33.850
And this is one of the beauties
of me saying, "I make up stories

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:37.470
and think they're true," because
when you read your diary you kind

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:39.420
of get the facts straightened
out after --

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:42.060
you know, it's been 30 years
since I've read some of them.

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:45.120
Well, I always thought
that I started to think

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:51.990 position:56%
about writing critically about
Reggae when I was a graduate student

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:57.010
in New Brunswick, which would have
been in the late '80s, '87, '88,

00:37:57.010 --> 00:38:02.740
'89, and that this was something
that I just had started to do then.

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:06.570
Well, I read a -- I was
reading a diary from 1982,

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:11.590
and in it I had found some music
-- some Reggae music, and again,

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:16.590
you have to understand at the
time if you didn't have the record

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:19.540
or the tape, you didn't
have the music.

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:22.200
You had to get the actual thing.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.370
And somebody had given me a
whole bunch of Bob Marley tapes.

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:27.050
Even though I grew up
listening to Bob Marley,

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:31.320
there were songs I didn't know that
he had done, which predated me.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:34.130
And I started to -- and I
wrote about it in the diary.

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:37.850
I started to do this analysis
of the lyrics and so on.

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:39.770
And then I said, "One
of these days I'm going

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:41.270
to write a book about Bob Marley."

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:45.450
This is what I wrote in 1982.

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:46.900
Just, you know, that comment.

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:50.040
And the book, "Bob Marley,
Lyrical Genius," which came

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:55.210
out in the 2000s, came from that
initial impulse, which it struck me

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:58.090
as like shocking that I was
thinking in those lines.

00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:00.970
But part of the reason is that when
I started to think about writing,

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:03.640
and when I started to think
of myself as a writer,

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.370
I wanted to understand
a kind of aesthetic

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:13.010
that resisted the inclination
toward a kind of slavish dependence

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:17.590
on Western ideologies, and Western
literature, and Western culture.

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:20.790
And a number of voices
began to help me to do that.

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:24.830
And one was Amiri Baraka
talking about Blues people.

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:27.120
The other was Karlamu Gya
Salaam [assumed spelling],

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.920
who has written brilliantly
about the Blues.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:31.180
And the other, of course,
was Langston Hughes writing

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:33.460
about the Blues in "Negro
Artist and the Racial Mountain."

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.330
I became fascinated
with their try --

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:40.510
attempt to create a
vernacular for black poetics.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:44.520
And I thought, "This is
confidence-building," because one

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:47.370
of the things that damages
you sometimes as a writer is

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:49.700
when you start asking
yourself, "Who am I?

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:51.000
And who are my people?

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.300
And where am I from?"

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:54.350 position:56%
And I mean that in a literary sense.

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:56.760
So I thought, "This is attractive,
and this is interesting."

00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:00.470
Then I watched Kamau Brathwaite,
who is a great Caribbean poet,

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:03.760
invoke jazz as a functioning
kind of aesthetic.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:07.940
And I realized that he wasn't
entirely happy with that invocation

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:11.150
because it was borrowing something
from African American culture,

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:15.010
which he felt okay with, but he
was also wrestling to see what

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:17.310 position:56%
in the Caribbean would speak to him.

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:21.540
So he began to develop this idea
of a kind of jazz aesthetic,

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:22.840
which I found very interesting.

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.530
And I started to read up on jazz.

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:25.830
And I thought, "This is cool.

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:28.090
You know, you have a
kind of folk aesthetic,

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:29.960
a kind of populist aesthetic

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.300
that you can then create
a poetics out of it."

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:37.170
And then I read Nicolas Guillen,
using sun music in Cuba to try

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:41.600
and explain the sort of Afrocentric
nature of his poetics, and so on.

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.680
And then, of course, I
started to look at Yeats.

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.020
And I thought, "Yeats
is interesting."

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:47.360
And I realized there's
a whole period

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.280
of Yeats' work which
is anti-British.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.550
By the way, it's just the British
that you had a problem with,

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:55.690
not anybody else, because
[inaudible] such a big influence.

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:58.580
You know, Derek Walcott, divided
and [inaudible] and all that.

00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:02.040
So say it's a big and
lasting influence.

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:05.670
And I found those things exciting,
so then I started to ask myself,

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:09.130
"What is the space --
what is the aesthetic

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:12.450
and emotional space
that I'm growing up in?"

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:16.890 position:56%
And I realized that Reggae music and
all that it meant in the late '60s

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:19.580
and early '70s was
defining who I was.

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:24.330 position:56%
And in fact, I began to see in poets
like Lorna Goodison, Mervyn Morris,

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:25.710
all these Jamaican poets,

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:28.410
a clear sense in which they
were being influenced by Reggae,

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:32.060 position:56%
without admitting it, without even
saying, "This is what has happened."

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.690
So that brought me to this
scholarly idea that I want

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:38.690 position:56%
to investigate whether there is such
a thing that one could construct

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:42.280
as a Reggae aesthetic through the
Aristotelian approach of saying,

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.270
"Let me look at the text
and see if I can see

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:48.780
in the text those aesthetic
lines that make sense."

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:52.360
And it began to hold
together very well for me.

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:56.080
And so the book, "Natural
Mysticism," became a way

00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:00.220
in which I began to look at
whether, in fact, this phenomenon

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:04.780 position:56%
of Reggae music with its antecedents
being, you know, Kumina and all

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:08.700
of these Afrocentric
music styles, was in fact,

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:11.420
shaping a poetics in the Caribbean.

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:14.630
And then I realized it was
also shaping my own poetics.

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:17.790
So the Reggae aesthetic
is not prescriptive.

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:19.090
It's descriptive.

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:21.410
It's actually saying,
"This is what has happened,

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:24.290
and I'm very interested
in seeing how it evolves"

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:26.430
And then recognizing
those elements in myself.

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:32.550 position:56%
But even as it's descriptive, it's
also incredibly confidence-endowing.

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:37.210
It makes you feel like you are
coming from a credible space

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:42.230
that comes out of this wonderful
complexity of cultures mixing

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:45.720
and creating something, as Kamau
Brathwaite says, torn and new.

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.930
So Africa makes senses
in the Caribbean.

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:52.320 position:56%
Africa makes sense in South Carolina
in the Gullah people and so on.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:54.800
All of that begins to
make sense and works

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:59.400
within this musical form called
Reggae in very complex ways.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:02.010
So I could -- this is one topic
I could go on and on forever

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:07.690
about because, of course, it
does go on and on forever, yeah.

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:11.450
&gt;&gt; Angel Batiste: I'd like
to ask one question in terms

00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:16.960
of this concept, is this an
extension, or does it extend

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.870
into the Pan-African aesthetic?

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:20.650
Or is there Pan-African aesthetic.

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:22.680
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: Yeah, it's
absolutely an extension.

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:26.770
So one of the interesting things
that I've been very fascinated

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:30.050
about is, for instance,
Rastafarianism.

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:34.880
Rastafarianism started, really,
we date it to 1938, right?

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.280
1936, '37, '38.

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.440
We can actually tell when
this new religion started.

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.340
But the thing is, so
we talk about Rasta

00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:44.390
as this new religion
that just starts.

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:48.700
And Rasta's fundamental premise
is that it looks to Africa --

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:52.820
it presumes an important
line, shared --

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:57.950
given to it by gesture by
somebody like Haile Selassie.

00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:59.480
Haile Selassie comes in and says --

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.510
you know, he takes the title
Conquering Lion of the Tribe

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:06.420
of Judah, takes the title that in
the -- in sort of the narrative --

00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:10.210
the mythic narrative that he
comes from the tribe of David,

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:12.530
he comes from the Queen
of Sheba, and so on.

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:14.690
And Rastas then say,
"Okay, here's this.

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:16.090
This is interesting.

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:20.850
So we then see Haile Selassie
as the returned messiah."

00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:26.180
So the Rastas then construct a
kind of belief system around that,

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:29.730
but it's a radical political belief
system, because what it's doing is

00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:33.580
that it's proposing
that God is black.

00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:36.370
This is problematic for
other people, but --

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:40.610
but the question then becomes,
"Well, why are you panicking?

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:44.220
I thought you said God -- doesn't
matter -- race doesn't matter?"

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:47.460 position:56%
But when suddenly God, the returned
messiah is black and kind of hanging

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:51.800
out in Ethiopia, this complicates
the conversation, right?

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:54.180
And it's not madness at all.

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:57.380
It's actually a profoundly
reasonable argument

00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:01.850
that proposes a discourse that says
those who have shown the capacity

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:06.540
to resist colonialism, resist
Babylon, resist the oppression

00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:09.340
of African people,
and look attractive

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:14.420 position:56%
and make sense ideologically as a
part of a functioning belief system.

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:16.960
So Rasta emerges as this entity.

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:18.950
And there's a long story
about how it develops.

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:21.040 position:56%
But sometimes the mistake we make is

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.940
that Rasta just fell
down out of the sky.

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:27.700
But if you look at the
antecedents of Rasta,

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:31.560
just think of the simple Negro
spiritual, "Go down Moses,

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:35.100
way down in Egypt land, tell
old Pharaoh let my people go."

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:40.130
Built into that narrative,
that song, is a reconstruction

00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:45.930
of Christianity, because
Moses is claiming to be --

00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:51.110
the black people -- he -- the black
people are the children of Israel.

00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:57.140
They're the chosen people, which
makes the white people not,

00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:01.370 position:56%
which is a radical kind of thinking.

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:07.860 position:56%
And that radical kind of thinking is
a creative invention that is there

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:12.960 position:56%
for resistance, as a way to resist
and a way to bring a moral authority

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:16.530
on the actions of those who
claim to have a kind of control

00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:18.210
and authority over that action.

00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:20.390
And I think there is
a way in which --

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:24.460
and the truth is, Jamaica's
resistance movements,

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:28.660
the Morant Bay rebellion and so on,
all were influenced by Baptists.

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:32.680
And those Baptists were
formed in the early 1800s

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:38.240
by African American ex-slaves who
escaped, and moved to Jamaica,

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:41.200
and started the Baptist
movement in Jamaica.

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:46.650
So this Rasta movement comes out --
this Africa is all the way through,

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:51.560
this notion that the
African Americans, and so on,

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.180
so forth, this is a myth.

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:56.350
So for me, that long
narrative begins

00:46:56.350 --> 00:47:00.740
to make sense in that cyclical way.

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:04.230
And so Reggae aesthetic
does have an antecedent.

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:10.000 position:56%
It has an antecedent that connects
with other movements that are trying

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.490
to reclaim a cultural identity

00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:15.630
and a cultural sensibility both
politically, ideologically,

00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:18.590
spiritually, in language, and
all these kinds of things.

00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:22.780
And I'm not even a Rasta.

00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:24.080
Do you understand?

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:25.380
But I own that.

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:29.210
I -- it's part of my
understanding of it, yeah.

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:30.510
&gt;&gt; Angel Batiste: Thank you.

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:34.680
Let's go on and talk a
bit about your new series,

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:40.560
"New Generation African Poets,"
which you edit with Chris Abani.

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:48.340 position:56%
You're featuring eight new, emerging
African poets in this series?

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.190
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: Well, the series
is an interesting project.

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:55.670
It's a proposal that we -- that I
came up with about three years ago.

00:47:55.670 --> 00:48:01.400
And the proposal was that for
10 years we will publish eight

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:06.440
to 10 chapbooks of African poets --

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:10.900
new generation, poets who have not
been published in book form before.

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:12.960
And we do that once a year.

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.380
So we are now -- next year
we bring on the fourth one.

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:16.740
So we do one every year.

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:19.350
So we started one three year ago.

00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:21.720
And so far we've been
doing it steadily, easily.

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:23.200
So this is the first one.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.750
This was a -- this
one had seven, right.

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:28.050
Okay, good.

00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:29.530
That -- you can see
them, the covers.

00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:32.320
And this is the third
one -- or the second one.

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:35.200
And I think we had -- I can't call.

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:37.260
This is probably eight in this one.

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:45.300
And then more recently,
we did this one.

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:47.190
So this is another eight.

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:49.120
So this is the one that
you are referring to.

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:51.740
And then next year's is
going to have 10 poets.

00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:54.620 position:56%
So it's going to vary in that sense.

00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:57.570
But these are new writers
who haven't been published,

00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:00.840
and we do a chapbook for
each one of them each year.

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:05.260
And the idea is that in 10 years'
time we would have published 90

00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:07.740
to 100 new poets from Africa.

00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:11.210
Of the first set -- that
is the first box set --

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:14.280
the first and second box
set, all but a couple

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:17.700 position:56%
of those poets have already either
have contracts for full-length book,

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:21.410
or they have full-length books
already published as a result

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:24.080
of the attention that
these works [inaudible].

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:26.490
Essentially we've decided
to use this mechanism

00:49:26.490 --> 00:49:29.270
to start changing the landscape
of publishing for African poets,

00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:32.940
and to make sure that African
poet will be published.

00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:34.380
And this sounds like a lot,

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:37.040
but Africa is a big
place, you know, and stuff.

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.390
It's a big continent.

00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:41.460
To do eight a year is like
scratching the surface.

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:44.400
I mean, you're barely -- we're
barely scratching the surface.

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:47.770
&gt;&gt; Angel Batiste: Is there a reason
that you chose the chapbook format?

00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:50.770
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: Yeah, so
we've decided to approach this

00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:53.800
on a multipronged way,
so we're doing chapbooks,

00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:57.850
but we're also doing a series
called "A Classic Series"

00:49:57.850 --> 00:50:02.020
by major African poets who have
been published already, and so on

00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:05.160
and so forth, who do not
have a collected poems

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:06.710
or a major new and selected poems.

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:09.640
And so we started with
Kofi Awoonor's book.

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:12.870
And that was a collected poems.

00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:17.510
And then we followed that up
with Gabriel Okara from Nigeria,

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:20.270
a major -- one of the
first major poets

00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:22.060
from Africa, who is still living.

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:25.210
And so we've done a
collected poems of his.

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:28.440
And then we are bringing out next
year Amate Alu's [assumed spelling]

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.790
collected poems.

00:50:29.790 --> 00:50:31.940
Amate published two
collections of poems,

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:35.490 position:56%
but had written multiple collections
of poems that were never published.

00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:37.330
So we did the work to
pull that together.

00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:39.400 position:56%
And so her book comes out next year.

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.700
And then each year it will be --

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.360
and then the following year
Keo Pitser [assumed spelling],

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:45.600
who has been here before, we'll be
publishing his new and selected.

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:48.110
So that's one series
that we do, one a year.

00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:51.550
And then we have a book prize
for the -- first book prize --

00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:54.200
full-length book prize for
African poets called the Sillerman

00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.500
Book Prize.

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:56.800
And we publish that volume.

00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.850
And then we have an
over-the-transom series where poets

00:50:59.850 --> 00:51:01.920
who may have published
before -- they're, you know,

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:04.370
established poets --
can send manuscripts in,

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:06.460
and we will, you know, publish it.

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:08.370
We'll arrange for them to
be published, and so on.

00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:12.740
So it's a multi-pronged
publishing sort of effort.

00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:14.810
Even though we -- when
I say we publish it,

00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:19.160
what we do is we broker the
publication of these books, yeah.

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:23.130
&gt;&gt; Angel Batiste: Now with this
new generation of African poets,

00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:26.600
what are some of the
themes, subjects?

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:30.620
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: Yeah, so I think
what we -- what I've tried to do --

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:33.830
they -- you know, I'm an
academic and a scholar.

00:51:33.830 --> 00:51:35.650
And my training is that way.

00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:38.290
And so my inclination is
to do that, is to say,

00:51:38.290 --> 00:51:40.000
"This is what is going on.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.090
Let me write a book about
that," and so on and so forth.

00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:46.650 position:56%
But I've had to sort of resist that
as an editor, to even think about it

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:50.580
in those terms, because I
want the work to emerge,

00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:52.310
and then to start speaking itself.

00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:54.770
But of course, for each
of the box sets we have

00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:56.070
to write an introduction.

00:51:56.070 --> 00:51:59.460 position:56%
So when I come to write the
introduction, I start to see themes.

00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:01.560
One of the most striking
themes that I'm seeing --

00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:06.690
first of all, the next boxed set
of the 10 poets, nine are women.

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:09.900
This is what has happened.

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:13.320 position:56%
And in my introduction -- the
introduction that Chris and I wrote,

00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:17.130
we kept returning to this idea
of the body, the female body,

00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:20.380
the African woman's body, the
way that the body is read the way

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:24.800
that the body is resistant, the
way that that body is trying

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:27.920
to understand itself
in a changing world.

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.350
And keep in mind that
these are poets

00:52:29.350 --> 00:52:31.220
from all different
countries in Africa.

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:32.610
Some are in the diaspora.

00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:34.030
Some are living in Sweden.

00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:35.330
Some are living in Britain.

00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:36.730
Some are living here in America.

00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:39.940
So they -- you see the
influence of migration.

00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:46.300
You see the influence of a global
sensibility, the communication

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:48.690
that the Internet has created.

00:52:48.690 --> 00:52:51.250
You see the influence
of them reading works

00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:53.220
from different places, and so on.

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:57.260
But what is consistent all the way
through is that they self-identify

00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:02.080
as African bodies that are
trying to negotiate what

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:04.360
that means in a global landscape.

00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:06.450
I think that is a consistent theme

00:53:06.450 --> 00:53:08.880
that we see running
through these works.

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:10.660
&gt;&gt; Angel Batiste: The
cover illustration on all

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:13.040
of these books are
absolutely beautiful.

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.990
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: Yeah, you know
the story behind these, right?

00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:19.160
So what we decided to do, for
every box set we get one artist.

00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:23.380
We get a major African artist,
and we ask them to supply art

00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:24.680
for each one of the covers.

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:28.030
So it's a single artist
for each of these box sets.

00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:30.940
So this is a wonderful
Nigerian artist who --

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:33.280
so all the covers are
from his artwork.

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:35.080
And we have a lot of
Nigerian artists.

00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:37.080
The first one is a Nigerian artist.

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:42.850
And then this year,
[inaudible] you know,

00:53:42.850 --> 00:53:48.200
Elizabeth Alexander's husband --
late husband, who is from Somalia,

00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:53.080
or [inaudible] originally,
he's -- she gave us his work.

00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:54.970
So that is featured on
the cover, and so on.

00:53:54.970 --> 00:53:59.430
So we try to create a gallery
of African art for the covers.

00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:03.270
And I just think that's cool.

00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:06.790
I don't know about you, but
I think that's really cool.

00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:08.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Angel Batiste: They're beautiful.

00:54:08.090 --> 00:54:09.420
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: Right, and
they give it to us free.

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:10.720
We don't have to pay for it.

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.020
That's generosity.

00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:14.620
Now we should, but we
can't afford to pay for it.

00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:16.300
So they -- yeah.

00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:20.380 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Angel Batiste: My next question
-- and it might be a bit repetitive.

00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:21.680
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: That's okay.

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:23.070
&gt;&gt; Angel Batiste: But
in terms of as Editor

00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:26.520
of the African Poetry Book Fund,

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:29.820
what is really the history
of the organization?

00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:33.540
What are some of the long-term
goals of the organization?

00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:37.040
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: Yeah, so the
African Poetry Book Fund begins

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:44.580
through a series of circumstances
that have to do with recognizing

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:48.980 position:56%
and absence, a gap in thinking, that
something has to be done about it.

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:54.440
Chris Abani and I were touring
in Africa for the -- there's a --

00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:59.360
Poetry Africa is a wonderful
festival that happens every year,

00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:02.650
and they brought us there
to tour Southern Africa.

00:55:02.650 --> 00:55:05.050
So we were visiting a few places.

00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:06.990
And we were struck by
a couple of things.

00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:10.260
One is there are so many
wonderful poets who were performing

00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:13.850
and doing good work, but they
hadn't opportunity to publish.

00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:17.220
We also saw a lot of work that
needed mentoring, needed editing,

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:20.840
needed some clear attention,
and they were not getting it.

00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:24.310 position:56%
And we started to make relationships
with poets to meet them,

00:55:24.310 --> 00:55:27.360
talk to them about it, and
to talk about opportunities.

00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:31.400
Many of them were publishing, but
didn't know where to send works

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:33.560
to journals and things like that.

00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:37.600
They were rightly concerned that if
they sent it to American journals,

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.650
they would just be dismissed,
and not understood, and so on.

00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:42.780
So we started to talk
with them about that.

00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:45.130
So then eventually in our
conversations we thought,

00:55:45.130 --> 00:55:49.480
"Why don't we find a way to
start publishing these works?

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:51.620
And to arrange to publish
these works?"

00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:55.620
Now I have a history of
creating opportunities

00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:57.970
for the publication of work.

00:55:57.970 --> 00:56:01.040
In South Carolina, for
many years the University

00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:03.930
of South Carolina Press decided
not to publish poetry again

00:56:03.930 --> 00:56:08.230
after starting the James Dickey
series, which didn't go well.

00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:10.830
And so they decided against it.

00:56:10.830 --> 00:56:12.470
So I approached them,
and I wanted to --

00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:16.220 position:56%
I started an organization called
the South Carolina Poetry Initiative

00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:19.320
to do -- to publish work and
to promote the work of poetry

00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:21.660
in South Carolina for everybody.

00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:22.960
And I approached them, and I said,

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:25.600 position:56%
"Why don't you guys start publishing
poetry, because, you know,

00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:27.430
we've got some good poets here?"

00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:29.350
And they said, "No,
it's just a bad idea.

00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:30.670
It's dangerous, and so on.

00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:32.810
Nobody buys poetry, and so on."

00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:34.590
So then I sought funding.

00:56:34.590 --> 00:56:39.100
I looked for money, and I said,
"Look, I'll give you the money

00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:42.330
to subvent the cost of publication
so you don't lose any money."

00:56:42.330 --> 00:56:44.010
So that excuse goes out the window.

00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:46.750
And they said, "Well, we don't
know where we'll find the poets."

00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:48.050
I said, "Well, we'll find them."

00:56:48.050 --> 00:56:50.360
And then they said, "Well, we
don't have a poetry editor."

00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:52.700
And I said, "I will edit it.

00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:55.240
And we'll get it edited, and
then we'll work with you,

00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:57.450
and we'll publish these
books, and so on."

00:56:57.450 --> 00:57:00.430
Now there is such a thing called
the Palmetto Poetry Series

00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:02.860
in South Carolina that
is still going strong.

00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:04.160
And that's how it started.

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:06.340
And we no longer have
to pay them anything,

00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:09.430
because they've taken
it on as a methodology.

00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:13.460
But it took several years of
them publishing these books

00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:15.200
for it to be -- to seal it.

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:18.570
But essentially that's the model
that we used, talking to --

00:57:18.570 --> 00:57:21.620
we went to many people,
many publishers.

00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:28.360
And we were fortunate when Laura
Sillerman, the wonderful woman,

00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:31.300
decided to support the
African Poetry Book Fund

00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:34.470
by giving us just the money that
we needed to help subvent the cost

00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:36.220
of publication of these books.

00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:38.660
And that's how we made arrangements
with first [inaudible] Press,

00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:42.240
and then later on with
University of Nebraska Press,

00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:44.050
and of course [inaudible] Books,

00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:46.470
and a few other places
that we are talking to.

00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:48.420
And we do acquisition.

00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:49.720
We do editing.

00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:51.230
We do the mentoring of the writers.

00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:52.930
We create a wonderful network.

00:57:52.930 --> 00:57:56.600
So it's not just our decision,
and it's a team of people,

00:57:56.600 --> 00:58:01.140
about eight of us who are
incredible poets, Gabeba Baderoon

00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:06.110
from South Africa; Phillippa Yaa
de Villiers from South Africa;

00:58:06.110 --> 00:58:09.820
John Keene, an African
American poet; Aracelis Girmay,

00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:14.090
an African American poet
from East Africa background;

00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:18.210 position:56%
Bernardine Evaristo, who is
Nigerian heritage, lives in England,

00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:21.560
wonderful poet; Chris Abani,
of course; and Matthew Shenoda.

00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:23.670
This is the team, and
these are all people

00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:27.190
who have volunteered their time
and their life to mentor writers,

00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:29.190
work with writers,
and help us acquire.

00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:31.180
So we have a network
all around the world.

00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:34.100
I -- every year we say,
"Send us the name of poets

00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:36.510
that you think should
get some attention."

00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:38.680
We approach the poets, and
we say, "Send us some work."

00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:42.920
So for each of these chapbooks
we get about 40 submissions.

00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:47.220 position:56%
We ask -- we request 40 submissions,
and then we select the ones

00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:48.820
that we think are the
strongest ones.

00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:51.680
And we continue to work with
those that we don't select.

00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:56.450
So it's a big, major kind of
effort that the product is

00:58:56.450 --> 00:59:02.260
in four years we've published
over 40 poets -- African poets.

00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:05.490
&gt;&gt; Angel Batiste: Now you're also
editor with "Prairie Schooner."

00:59:05.490 --> 00:59:06.790
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: Yes.

00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:08.090
&gt;&gt; Angel Batiste: So can
you discuss that a bit?

00:59:08.090 --> 00:59:10.760
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: Yes, so
"Prairie Schooner" is a --

00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:13.230
I don't know if you know this, but
it's probably one of the oldest --

00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:17.560
it's the third oldest literary
journal in this country, right?

00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:20.150
"Prairie Schooner"
began in the early '20s.

00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:22.480
It's been going for 90 years.

00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:27.200
And I joined -- I became the
editor about five years ago.

00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:32.360
Before that it had been run by
Hilda Raz -- the amazing Hilda Raz,

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:34.720
who had run it for about 30 years.

00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:38.270
I think that I'm the fifth
editor of this journal.

00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:42.190
So it's one of these
-- and they never --

00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:48.060
this is 90 years of continued
publication, a quarterly.

00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:53.620
This is remarkable because
Depression, wars, whatever,

00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:56.060
they've been publishing steadily.

00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:58.690
So becoming the editor of "Prairie
Schooner" was very exciting,

00:59:58.690 --> 01:00:01.960
but of course, when I came in,
"Prairie Schooner" had one --

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:04.830
"Prairie Schooner" made the hugest
difference in terms of women poets,

01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:07.070
women writers in the '80s and '90s.

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:10.670
Hilderaz [assumed spelling] was
a great advocate and made space

01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:15.080
for women's writing, where, very
often, most of the other journals,

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:17.760
which were run by dudes, were
not doing that kind of work.

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:21.890
And some of our great poets
today, who we know by name,

01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:25.300
have a lot of their beginnings
with Prairie Schooner.

01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:27.290
But when I came in, I
thought, well, okay.

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:30.040
We'll continue that wonderful
work and that has continued

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:33.980
and we have a wonderful
record in that regard.

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:35.820
But I wanted to make
it more international

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:39.230
and to extend the international
weight of the journal,

01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:40.540
and that's what we've done.

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:44.730
So in a few years, the journal
has a great international reach,

01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:46.990
but we continue to publish
this journal every year.

01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:51.760 position:56%
And also, the good news is that
Prairie Schooner gives me a platform

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:54.470
to do this kind of work,
whether it's work here,

01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:57.830
whether it's in England, in
the Caribbean, with writers.

01:00:57.830 --> 01:01:03.310
For some useful reasons, people
want to publish in a journal

01:01:03.310 --> 01:01:06.340
so they are nice to you
when you talk to them.

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:08.330
So Prairie Schooner is my --

01:01:08.330 --> 01:01:12.060
is a calling card for me
and I don't apologize.

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:18.080
It's been very helpful.

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:19.380
Yeah.

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:24.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Angel Batiste: Working with both,
working with the African Poetry Fan

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:32.450 position:56%
and Prairie Schooner, how do you see
African poetry and American poetry?

01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:34.810
Is there a contrast?

01:01:34.810 --> 01:01:37.500
Are their comparisons?

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:41.600
Is there something that
can be lent to each other?

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.470
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: I think
that's a good question,

01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:44.970
but you know what,
here's the problem.

01:01:44.970 --> 01:01:50.330
I think -- I have to say that is a
profound compromise that I'm doing

01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:54.070
when I say things like
African poetry.

01:01:54.070 --> 01:01:56.340
Because in a sense,
that's a bit of misnomer.

01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:58.080
It's a convenience.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.830
It's a convenience
because of colonialism.

01:02:00.830 --> 01:02:03.860
It's a convenience
because we totalize Africa

01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:05.420
as if it's one place.

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:09.610
And we do it because it's the
only way people understand.

01:02:09.610 --> 01:02:12.540
If I said it's Nigerian
poetry, with a population

01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:14.740
of almost 200 million
people, people will say, well,

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:16.240
that's a little parochial.

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.540
You understand what I mean?

01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:20.930
So there's a way in which we
have to speak in a language

01:02:20.930 --> 01:02:24.590
that people will understand
to get the thing done.

01:02:24.590 --> 01:02:30.570
So comparing African poetry with
American poetry is a bit wonky.

01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:34.370
The reason I say that is American
poetry is more homogenous,

01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:36.510 position:56%
even though it's complex and varied.

01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:39.900
But if you think about all the
thousands of language groups

01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:42.350
in Africa, all the
different tribes in Africa,

01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:46.730 position:56%
all the different literal nations in
Africa, to collect them as one thing

01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:49.520
and say one thing about
it is, I think --

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:54.350
it's actually misleading and
intellectually problematic.

01:02:54.350 --> 01:02:58.340
Which is why when people ask me
let's talk about African poetry,

01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:01.940
I'm resistant of sort of
making broad generalizations

01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:05.140
because I think it
perpetuates this myth

01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:08.790
that African poetry is one
thing or looks like one thing,

01:03:08.790 --> 01:03:11.610
in the very same way that,
frankly, if you were honest

01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:14.800
and somebody said, "Tell us about
American poetry," you would go,

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.090
"I don't know what the
heck you're talking about."

01:03:17.090 --> 01:03:23.510
Like, how do you put somebody --
Billy Collins behind Ameri Baraka?

01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:24.810
I mean, what connects them?

01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:27.650
And all we do is run to Walt
Whitman and Emily Dickinson

01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:30.840
and say that's the root
and that's all we can do.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.140
You understand?

01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:35.900 position:56%
And everybody does this, as if this
is the only answer to that question.

01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:39.020
So that's one kind of the answer.

01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:45.480
But the other part of the answer
is to say that America has grown

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:49.980
and its poetry has grown and
blossomed because of its openness

01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:51.830
to poetry from other
parts of the world.

01:03:51.830 --> 01:03:57.170
And that openness has come through
publication and through translation

01:03:57.170 --> 01:03:59.350
and through communication.

01:03:59.350 --> 01:04:02.190
And that's why us doing this

01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:05.370
with African poetry
enriches American poetry.

01:04:05.370 --> 01:04:08.840
It gives America access
to the poetics of a place

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:13.570
that it has ignored for so
long, sometimes not willfully

01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:15.960
because there's just not
enough books for them to look

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:19.290
at to see what the connections
are and to create a conversation.

01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:23.020
So indeed, I think it
enriches the American --

01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:25.310
because it challenges
American poetry.

01:04:25.310 --> 01:04:28.770
It challenges American
poetry about what is poetry.

01:04:28.770 --> 01:04:33.410
Is poetry about simply, you know,
talking about flowers and plants

01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:37.970
or can poetry be about politics

01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:40.450
or about spirits and
so on and so forth?

01:04:40.450 --> 01:04:42.610
Whatever it is that is brought

01:04:42.610 --> 01:04:45.900
into that conversation I think
enriches that conversation.

01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:48.710
And I think the good
news about America is

01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:53.870
that American poetry has been
open to those conversations

01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:56.250
and we don't want those
doors to shut.

01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:59.460
And so, we want to ensure that
that conversation continues

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:01.630
and that becomes --
that we become a place

01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:05.430
in which the world's poetry
can be articulated and spoken.

01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:08.070
Now, I might be saying that just
because I'm here in American,

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:09.590
because probably if
I was in England,

01:05:09.590 --> 01:05:12.380
I would say the British
tradition has been very open.

01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:14.910
No. But I think it's true.

01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:16.890
I think it's uniquely
true about America.

01:05:16.890 --> 01:05:20.370
I don't think that's
an invention at all.

01:05:20.370 --> 01:05:21.670
&gt;&gt; Angel Batiste: I thank you.

01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:23.810
Kwame, I thank you
for this conversation.

01:05:23.810 --> 01:05:25.570
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: Thank
you for these questions.

01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:26.870
&gt;&gt; Angel Batiste: Okay.

01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:28.170
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: Good.

01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:30.780
&gt;&gt; Angel Batiste: I think at this
point, we can have our Q and A.

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:37.080
&gt;&gt; We're just going to
put up the questions here.

01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:38.710
So I'll come around to you

01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:40.500
and if you have a question,
[inaudible] answer.

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:44.340
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you so much.

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:47.790
I thoroughly enjoyed it.

01:05:47.790 --> 01:05:52.170
I wish you could stay
longer and put some more.

01:05:52.170 --> 01:05:53.470
I so enjoyed it.

01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:57.870
I have a quick question.

01:05:57.870 --> 01:06:01.440
Is it okay, then, to
say conversations

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:04.410
with African poets [inaudible]?

01:06:04.410 --> 01:06:05.990
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: If
it's okay to say it?

01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:08.200
Yes, I think it's okay to say it.

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:11.160
Yeah. And, I mean, as
long as we recognize --

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:14.910
you know, we always should put
before sort of a kind of preface

01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:19.050
to say that we -- you know,
because you could say --

01:06:19.050 --> 01:06:21.690
we could say English poets, we
could say poets writing in English.

01:06:21.690 --> 01:06:26.740
We could do totalizing things as
long as we recognize that behind

01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:31.230
that is great variety and -- as
long as we are conscious of that

01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:34.310
and we keep saying it's not
a country, it's a continent.

01:06:34.310 --> 01:06:36.030
It's not a country,
it's a continent.

01:06:36.030 --> 01:06:37.330
But absolutely.

01:06:37.330 --> 01:06:38.630
I think it's fair to say that.

01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:41.140
And also, let's not make
any mistake about it.

01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:46.850
The fact of colonialism has
made these countries connected

01:06:46.850 --> 01:06:49.690
to each other, whether
they want it to or not.

01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:52.230
And therefore, it's part
of their narrative history

01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:54.510
and we should recognize
that and value that.

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:59.880 position:56%
You can't talk about Latin America
without understanding Simon Bolivar,

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:05.030
and that has made Latin America a
thing, which it wasn't necessarily.

01:07:05.030 --> 01:07:10.140
So -- until that political
vision of Simon Bolivar.

01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:12.000
So I think it's fair to say that,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.720
but also to recognize the
distinctions and the differences.

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.020
Yeah.

01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:20.190
&gt;&gt; And we have to add to
[inaudible] also specific

01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:22.070
about each country,
each [inaudible].

01:07:22.070 --> 01:07:23.370
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: Absolutely.

01:07:23.370 --> 01:07:28.070
And if you don't, they will
tell you what about us?

01:07:28.070 --> 01:07:31.010
Why do you have so many Nigerians?

01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:32.310
Yes?

01:07:32.310 --> 01:07:38.990
&gt;&gt; I just have a quick question
about language and in particular

01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:43.790
with regards to African
languages, evocation of things

01:07:43.790 --> 01:07:45.090
in the original language.

01:07:45.090 --> 01:07:46.390
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: Yes.

01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:51.770
&gt;&gt; What sort of initiatives are you
doing, perhaps, or are being done

01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:57.940
to preserve language to promulgate
poetry in the original language?

01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:59.240
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: Yeah.

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:00.540
So we are doing nothing
in terms of --

01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:02.880
we are doing nothing
directly to promulgate writing

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:04.920
in the original languages
and publication

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:06.250
in the original languages.

01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:08.880
But what we are trying
to do is to -- we --

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:10.500
one of the things that we've talked

01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:14.570
about as a really important
philosophical question is that --

01:08:14.570 --> 01:08:17.220
is the question of how
does a language survive?

01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:20.700
And a language survives,
weirdly enough,

01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:23.440
through the process of translation.

01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:26.820
Translation actually
allows a language to survive

01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:31.010
because if the culture
produces a work --

01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:32.310
I mean, this is something

01:08:32.310 --> 01:08:37.520
that I think Ngugi wa Thiong'o
was always arguing about, Gikuyu.

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:39.760
In 1986, when I met
Ngugi wa Thiong'o,

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:43.770
that was when he had decided that
he was no longer going to write

01:08:43.770 --> 01:08:46.550
in English and everything he was
going to write was going to be

01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:49.720
in Gikuyu and it's
going to be translated.

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:52.850
At the time, Ngugi was clear
about this and felt this is going

01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:54.240
to be important and so on.

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:56.990
Well, it became very clear
quickly to him and to all of us

01:08:56.990 --> 01:09:00.870
that if somebody didn't
get that work translated,

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:05.060
then this project was going
to suffer at some point,

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:07.990
and Ngugi recognized that.

01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:12.640
And so, his last novels, whether
it's Matigari and Devil --

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:16.810
the lastest one, the crow
one, I forget the name of it,

01:09:16.810 --> 01:09:19.940
all were written originally
in Gikuyu and then translated.

01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:23.670
But you can see that when he
started his first set of books,

01:09:23.670 --> 01:09:26.690
which were written in English,
were published at a rapid pace.

01:09:26.690 --> 01:09:33.220
As soon as he took on this new
mandate, publication slowed down.

01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:35.530
Right? And it's not
that he stopped writing.

01:09:35.530 --> 01:09:39.180
So one of the ways in which
we think we've been working is

01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:41.470
to first translate work into --

01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:44.140
we're working with an
English audience to start off.

01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:47.310
So we translate work from other
European languages in Africa

01:09:47.310 --> 01:09:50.060
into English, but we also
translate in Swahili.

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:54.570
We've started a partnership
with the Swahili Book Prize

01:09:54.570 --> 01:09:58.460
and if the winner is a poet, then
we will publish the translation

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:00.760
of that work, which
will then draw attention

01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:03.420
to the Swahili language poets.

01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:06.820
We are also doing -- talk about
translation of work in Shona

01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:10.980
and different languages so
that when the books come out,

01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:15.220
the conversation would be about
this was in the original language.

01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:20.410 position:56%
So our role, I think, is -- at least
as it stands now, with the limits

01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:24.640
that we have, as it stands now,
is to at least create a situation

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:27.670
where those language
groups and the poets writing

01:10:27.670 --> 01:10:31.770
in those languages have a life
beyond their language groups

01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:33.740
and their communities
and have a life beyond

01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:35.260
that through translation.

01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:39.820
And I think that's
an important thing.

01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:42.000
The other things is that I also
know that there's a lot of work

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.480
in those countries, more
work in those countries,

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:49.350
in preserving those language group
publications than, for instance,

01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:51.010
in just publishing poets.

01:10:51.010 --> 01:10:55.500 position:56%
They would publish a language group
work rather than just publish a poet

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:57.300
for the sake of publishing a poet.

01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:59.000
And this is true in India as well.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.710
I mean, if you -- one
of the fantastic things

01:11:01.710 --> 01:11:05.310
about India is they're such
a wide publishing world

01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:09.220
in the different Indian languages
that has created a great thing.

01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:11.410
But of course, their
survival, as they say,

01:11:11.410 --> 01:11:14.880
always is if the work
is not translated,

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:16.720
we don't get the attention
and so on.

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:18.910
So we limit -- we are limited.

01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:22.220
We intentionally limit what we can
do to make sure things can be done.

01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:24.450
And so, one of the things that
we want to do is pay attention

01:11:24.450 --> 01:11:27.350
to translation as a
big part of our work.

01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:29.060
Yeah.

01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:32.540
&gt;&gt; My name is William [inaudible].

01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:33.840
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: Yes.

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.870
&gt;&gt; And I'm from Guyana, too.

01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:37.170
I'm from [inaudible].

01:11:37.170 --> 01:11:45.150
In this -- with the question
she asked, I want to find

01:11:45.150 --> 01:11:51.660
out if you think it would be proper
to answer the points in your --

01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:52.960
that [inaudible] about --

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.260
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: About
-- that's right.

01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:56.190
&gt;&gt; Into English.

01:11:56.190 --> 01:12:02.970
Because as a child, I think
my mother read me [inaudible]

01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:04.340
over and over again.

01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:05.640
I think [inaudible] --

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:06.940
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: Oh,
it would be fantastic.

01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:08.240
But, you know, [inaudible]
did a lot of --

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.890
[inaudible] and Anita Hoe
[assumed spelling] have done a lot

01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:13.750
of translation from
[inaudible] into English.

01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:17.140
So they -- so we're looking
at some of their work.

01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:19.790
Some of [inaudible]'s poems are
translated from [inaudible].

01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:21.090
So -- and it's true.

01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:22.980
There's a long tradition
of that and in the north,

01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:26.860
there are all the proverbs,
which are --

01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:32.330
there's a fantastic process of
women taking traditional proverbs

01:12:32.330 --> 01:12:34.350
and making them feminist.

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:36.190
This is -- these women
haven't had any encounter

01:12:36.190 --> 01:12:39.230
with Betty [inaudible]
or anybody like that.

01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:44.660
But they are actually creating this
resistance through this rewriting

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:48.150
of proverbs that have been
historically men's problems.

01:12:48.150 --> 01:12:52.640
There's a woman called [inaudible]
who is a professor in Leguan

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:55.130
who is doing work on that project.

01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:58.290
So -- and we see that as part
of a larger poetics agenda

01:12:58.290 --> 01:13:00.860
that we are interested in look at.

01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:05.010 position:56%
So that -- it's absolutely something
that should be done, has been done,

01:13:05.010 --> 01:13:07.470
but we would love to
publish more of that work.

01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:14.410
Yeah. We can do one more?

01:13:14.410 --> 01:13:16.820
Yes. Hello.

01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:19.910
&gt;&gt; Question about your own work.

01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:21.210
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: Yes.

01:13:21.210 --> 01:13:25.080 position:56%
&gt;&gt; After growing up in the Caribbean
and Africa, living for a long time

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:31.180
in South Carolina, which has a real
rich African-American culture --

01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:33.320
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: Absolutely.

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:35.650
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: -- then,
you moved to Nebraska.

01:13:35.650 --> 01:13:45.250 position:56%
Don't want to stereotype the farm
belt, but it's a very different kind

01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:50.120
of place and I wonder how
that's influenced your work

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:51.420
and your perspective.

01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:52.720
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: It's a
very different place.

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.020
Yeah. You know, here's the thing.

01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:55.320
I've moved so much.

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:59.340 position:56%
I've moved enough, anyway, and lived
in enough places, not as many --

01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:01.310
as much as other people, I
really believe that the --

01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:05.490 position:56%
that as a poet, I have to understand
my body in any place that I live in

01:14:05.490 --> 01:14:09.330
and there are things that
my body carries with it.

01:14:09.330 --> 01:14:13.090
And it will emerge in my poetry,
but even as I live in that space,

01:14:13.090 --> 01:14:18.500
my body collects this --
the details of that space.

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:21.460
So there is a kind of kumbaya sense

01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:23.890
of all humanity is one
and so on and so forth.

01:14:23.890 --> 01:14:28.420
But the truth is I can't
shake my own discourse

01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:30.060
and my own narrative history.

01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:34.770
So what has to happen is as much
as I might evolve or change,

01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:37.600
Nebraska is going to
have to accommodate me.

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:39.280
Do you understand?

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.990
So Nebraska changes by my presence.

01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:44.490
This is how I believe it works.

01:14:44.490 --> 01:14:46.980
This is how I believe it
worked in South Carolina.

01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:49.250
This is how I believe it
worked in New Brunswick.

01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:52.200
This is -- I believe my
body changes the space

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:54.850
and they are going to
have to deal with it.

01:14:54.850 --> 01:14:58.800
So Nebraska cannot be
comfortably just called a farm belt

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:02.790
because there's a guy who is
there who is writing in that space

01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:07.780
who is not deciding to run away
from the reality of being there.

01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:09.820
So I think that's how
the world's changed.

01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:17.180
I think that's how cultures begin
to evolve, not simply by them sort

01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:20.170
of creating what is rigidly there,
but when you bring something

01:15:20.170 --> 01:15:22.840
into that space, it
changes that space.

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:26.810
That space, in changing and
accommodating becomes a new space

01:15:26.810 --> 01:15:28.200
and an interesting space.

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:32.550
So there's a history
of Africans in Nebraska

01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:35.940
and how do we deal with that?

01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:38.690
I'll say this very short story.

01:15:38.690 --> 01:15:44.030
In South Carolina, I became
very quickly African-American,

01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:45.390
and comfortably so.

01:15:45.390 --> 01:15:49.250
And in fact, I was fast -- I
was more South Carolinian --

01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:53.490
I became South Carolinian
before I became American.

01:15:53.490 --> 01:15:56.980
I comfortably was embraced
by the black community there

01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:59.930
and I was an African-American.

01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:03.100
I get to Nebraska and I'm
suddenly, for the first time

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:05.800
in years, Guyanean again.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:10.130
Why? Because Nebraska
doesn't have a narrative

01:16:10.130 --> 01:16:14.900
around African-American identity
except in an alien sort of way.

01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:19.870
And I found that fascinating,
how quickly the space decides

01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:23.900
to locate you by what it's
comfortable with and how you have

01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:29.060
to assert that solidarity and
that connection even among

01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:31.480
African-Americans in that space.

01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:34.280
And I am an annoying
person so I assert it.

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:36.800
You know, that's my job.

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:44.230
Right? And my poetry is the way
that I say I'm talking to you.

01:16:44.230 --> 01:16:46.910
Right? You know, Bob
Marley sings, "It's you.

01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:48.520
It's you I'm talking to.

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.360
Yes, it's you.

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:51.660
You I'm talking to.

01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:53.340 position:56%
Why do you look so sad and forsaken?

01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:57.670
When one door is closed,
many more is open."

01:16:57.670 --> 01:16:59.290
It's you I'm talking to.

01:16:59.290 --> 01:17:04.060
So if I'm in Nebraska,
people, I'm talking to you.

01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:05.580
So deal with it.

01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:09.990
&gt;&gt; Okay. One question
to close it out.

01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:13.350
You began your reading
talking about imagination

01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:15.330
and the importance of imagination.

01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:19.590 position:56%
But then, you also made reference to
an Africanness and the critical --

01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:21.360
how it's important to you.

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:23.970
I'm interested in the
intersection of the two,

01:17:23.970 --> 01:17:28.550
if your Africanness somehow
allows imagination for you

01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:30.890
or if they're connected or if not.

01:17:30.890 --> 01:17:32.190
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: Yeah.

01:17:32.190 --> 01:17:40.570
So I think my Africanness
or the complication

01:17:40.570 --> 01:17:46.080
of my Africanness has
forced me to invent

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:51.270
through the imagination a
line of connection and a line

01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:53.330 position:56%
of identity that gives me grounding.

01:17:53.330 --> 01:17:56.220 position:56%
And invention is not that something.

01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:58.910
Invention is pulling together facts

01:17:58.910 --> 01:18:01.580
and experiences that
create a narrative.

01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:03.660
That's what I mean by invention.

01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:07.100
Right? So one of my
mottos -- and I'm --

01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:10.300
I've been waiting for
somebody to come and knock me

01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:11.910
in the head and say I made that up.

01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:16.380
But I've had this for about 30
years, that all memory is fiction.

01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:19.820
And by that, I don't mean all
memory is made up or false,

01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:22.560
but all memory is constructed.

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:24.420
All memory is constructed.

01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:29.000
We remember what we need to
remember and we create a narrative

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.880
of ourselves by constructing it.

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:35.560
And therefore, all that
memory is invented.

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:39.060
And so, the truth about Africa --

01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:41.040
I mean, one of the
great things about going

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:44.710
to that museum yesterday
is just in that little hall

01:18:44.710 --> 01:18:48.320
where you're hearing these voices
moving around so on, it almost --

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:54.110
it brought me to tears
because invention is survival.

01:18:54.110 --> 01:19:00.920
The capacity to create, to imagine
a tomorrow, this is survival.

01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:06.010
And it's been true about
African-Americans in --

01:19:06.010 --> 01:19:07.460
and it's true about people

01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:10.860
of African descent
for a very long time.

01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:13.170
Now, it may be true about
everybody else, but, boy,

01:19:13.170 --> 01:19:15.370
it's funky with African people.

01:19:15.370 --> 01:19:17.920
It really is kind of
sweet with African people.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:22.170
And that invention, I
take great solace in.

01:19:22.170 --> 01:19:27.980
I take great comfort in and
I take a sense that I belong.

01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:29.280
I can speak.

01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:32.310
I have a right to speak
in this space.

01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:36.920
And don't underestimate how
important that confidence

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:39.830
to say I have a right
to speak in this space.

01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:41.360
I'll end with one little anecdote.

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.330
I remember I was in
England some years ago.

01:19:43.330 --> 01:19:46.860
I was going to read at
Cambridge University.

01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:50.490
And if you have been colonized
or lived in a colonial place,

01:19:50.490 --> 01:19:53.760
you know when you say Oxford and
Cambridge, you know, it's, like,

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:55.330
gods and people like
that live there.

01:19:55.330 --> 01:19:56.630
That's the notion.

01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:59.350
Right? And I'm going, I
don't care about that.

01:19:59.350 --> 01:20:00.650
I'm a [inaudible].

01:20:00.650 --> 01:20:01.950
I'm a [inaudible].

01:20:01.950 --> 01:20:03.250
I fight against all
that Babylon business.

01:20:03.250 --> 01:20:06.880
And I'm talking -- I had that
confidence until I got to Cambridge

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:10.260
and I'm sailing on their
little boats and then I --

01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:14.740
that somebody says, you know,
Robert Burns stayed in that room

01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:17.060
and this one stayed
-- and I got panicky

01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:19.650
because I said what the
heck am I doing here?

01:20:19.650 --> 01:20:23.730 position:56%
This little kid, what am I doing in
the Pythagoras room, which is, like,

01:20:23.730 --> 01:20:27.460
2,000 years old, and I'm
going to read my poetry,

01:20:27.460 --> 01:20:30.860
my little dead poetry,
to these ancient places.

01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:32.160
I got freaked out.

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.170
I started to panic.

01:20:34.170 --> 01:20:38.520
And then, while we are sailing
into -- bringing this boat into t--

01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:40.440
he bunting, it's so cliche.

01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:42.940
But we're coming in
and we're getting in.

01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:47.280
I hear a sound that I
go this sounds familiar.

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:51.390
And then, I realized
it's Bob Marley's voice.

01:20:51.390 --> 01:20:56.490
There's Bob Marley music playing
and I'm on this river in Cambridge

01:20:56.490 --> 01:20:59.710
and wafting through
the air is Bob Marley.

01:20:59.710 --> 01:21:05.880
And I just thought,
well, if Bob is here

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:09.310
and he's not giving a
damn, then I'm good.

01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:11.850
Then I'm good.

01:21:11.850 --> 01:21:16.260
And that confidence
is not a small thing.

01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:20.910
Because we have been
denied that confidence

01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:23.810
as a people again and
again and again.

01:21:23.810 --> 01:21:27.400
This work we are doing is
to bring that confidence

01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:31.400
by saying there is a history,
there is a tradition, there is --

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:34.850
it comes from somewhere and it's
somewhere that we should embrace

01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:37.680
and be proud of because we
need to have that confidence.

01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:41.910
A lot of people take that for
granted, but it's a big deal

01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:45.590
to have the confidence to say
I'm going to write in this space

01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:48.360
and I belong in that conversation.

01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:49.660
So that's it.

01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:51.460
