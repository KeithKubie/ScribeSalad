00:00:08.187 --> 00:00:10.987
Hunger claws at your grumbling belly.

00:00:10.987 --> 00:00:15.888
It tugs at your intestines, 
which begin to writhe, aching to be fed.

00:00:15.888 --> 00:00:20.879
Being hungry generates a powerful,
often unpleasant physical sensation

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:23.469
that's almost impossible to ignore.

00:00:23.469 --> 00:00:26.648
After you've reacted by gorging
on your morning pancakes,

00:00:26.648 --> 00:00:30.491
you start to experience 
an opposing force, fullness,

00:00:30.491 --> 00:00:34.910
but how does your body actually know
when you're full?

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.930
The sensation of fullness is set in motion
as food moves from your mouth

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.209
down your esophagus.

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:44.980
Once it hits your stomach,
it gradually fills the space.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.131
That causes the surrounding
muscular wall to stretch,

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:50.760
expanding slowly like a balloon.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.208
A multitude of nerves wrapped
intricately around the stomach wall

00:00:54.208 --> 00:00:56.170
sense the stretching.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.700
They communicate with the vagus nerve
up to the brainstem and hypothalamus,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.650
the main parts of the brain
that control food intake.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.490
But that's just one input your brain uses
to sense fullness.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.011
After all, if you fill 
your stomach with water,

00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:13.522
you won't feel full for long.

00:01:13.522 --> 00:01:16.700
Your brain also takes into account
chemical messengers

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.981
in the form of hormones produced
by endocrine cells

00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:22.089
throughout your digestive system.

00:01:22.089 --> 00:01:26.712
These respond to the presence of specific
nutrients in your gut and bloodstream,

00:01:26.712 --> 00:01:30.522
which gradually increase 
as you digest your food.

00:01:30.522 --> 00:01:33.692
As the hormones seep out, 
they're swept up by the blood

00:01:33.692 --> 00:01:38.371
and eventually reach the hypothalamus
in the brain.

00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:43.642
Over 20 gastrointestinal hormones 
are involved in moderating our appetites.

00:01:43.642 --> 00:01:46.112
One example is cholecystokinin,

00:01:46.112 --> 00:01:51.193
which is produced in response to food
by cells in the upper small bowel.

00:01:51.193 --> 00:01:52.890
When it reached the hypothalamus,

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.272
it causes a reduction in the feeling
of reward you get when you eat food.

00:01:58.272 --> 00:02:02.270
When that occurs, the sense
of being satiated starts to sink in

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.044
and you stop eating.

00:02:05.044 --> 00:02:08.650
Cholecystokinin also slows down
the movement of food

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.493
from the stomach into the intestines.

00:02:11.493 --> 00:02:15.076
That makes your stomach stretch
more over a period of time,

00:02:15.076 --> 00:02:19.224
allowing your body to register
that you're filling up.

00:02:19.224 --> 00:02:23.075
This seems to be why when you eat slowly,
you actually feel fuller

00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:26.805
compared to when you consume your food
at lightning speed.

00:02:26.805 --> 00:02:31.755
When you eat quickly, your body doesn't
have time to recognize the state it's in.

00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:35.935
Once nutrients and gastrointestinal
hormones are present in the blood,

00:02:35.935 --> 00:02:39.145
they trigger the pancreas
to release insulin.

00:02:39.145 --> 00:02:44.464
Insulin stimulates the body's fat cells
to make another hormone called leptin.

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:49.896
Leptin reacts with receptors
on neuron populations in the hypothalamus.

00:02:49.896 --> 00:02:55.236
The hypothalamus has two sets of neurons
important for our feeling of hunger.

00:02:55.236 --> 00:03:00.877
One set produces the sensation of hunger
by making and releasing certain proteins.

00:03:00.877 --> 00:03:04.993
The other set inhibits hunger through
its own set of compounds.

00:03:04.993 --> 00:03:09.047
Leptin inhibits the hypothalamus neurons
that drive food intake

00:03:09.047 --> 00:03:12.828
and stimulates the neurons 
that suppress it.

00:03:12.828 --> 00:03:15.697
By this point, your body has reached
peak fullness.

00:03:15.697 --> 00:03:18.706
Through the constant exchange 
of information between hormones,

00:03:18.706 --> 00:03:19.957
the vagus nerve,

00:03:19.957 --> 00:03:21.118
the brainstem,

00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:23.455
and the different portions 
of hypothalamus,

00:03:23.455 --> 00:03:27.400
your brain gets the signal
that you've eaten enough.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.758
Researchers have discovered

00:03:28.758 --> 00:03:32.907
that some foods produce 
more long-lasting fullness than others.

00:03:32.907 --> 00:03:35.056
For instance, boiled potatoes are ranked

00:03:35.056 --> 00:03:37.756
as some of the most 
hunger-satisfying foods,

00:03:37.756 --> 00:03:42.148
while croissants 
are particularly unsatisfying.

00:03:42.148 --> 00:03:45.439
In general, foods with more protein,
fiber, and water

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:49.931
tend to keep hunger at bay for longer.

00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:52.261
But feeling full won't last forever.

00:03:52.261 --> 00:03:57.009
After a few hours, your gut and brain
begin their conversation again.

00:03:57.009 --> 00:04:00.369
Your empty stomach produces
other hormones, such as ghrelin,

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:03.729
that increase the activity of 
the hunger-causing nerve cells

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:05.830
in the hypothalamus.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.988
Eventually, the growling beast of hunger
is reawakened.

00:04:09.988 --> 00:04:12.890
Luckily, there's a dependable 
antidote for that.
