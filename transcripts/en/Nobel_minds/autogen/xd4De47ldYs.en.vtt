00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:53.999 align:start position:0%
the three or four years prior so that we
 

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:56.389 align:start position:0%
the three or four years prior so that we
were<00:00:54.089><c> making</c><00:00:54.239><c> we</c><00:00:54.929><c> can</c><00:00:55.079><c> make</c><00:00:55.229><c> him</c><00:00:55.350><c> a</c><00:00:55.379><c> lot</c><00:00:55.440><c> faster</c>

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
were making we can make him a lot faster

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 align:start position:0%
than the company see just I worked for
 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.619 align:start position:0%
than the company see just I worked for
could<00:00:58.620><c> use</c><00:00:58.829><c> them</c><00:00:59.039><c> I</c><00:00:59.280><c> had</c><00:01:00.179><c> seven</c><00:01:00.510><c> people</c>

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 align:start position:0%
could use them I had seven people
 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.799 align:start position:0%
could use them I had seven people
working<00:01:01.170><c> for</c><00:01:01.379><c> me</c><00:01:01.440><c> and</c><00:01:01.949><c> I</c><00:01:02.519><c> was</c><00:01:03.299><c> thinking</c><00:01:03.359><c> well</c>

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 align:start position:0%
working for me and I was thinking well
 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.390 align:start position:0%
working for me and I was thinking well
I'm<00:01:03.929><c> either</c><00:01:04.290><c> gonna</c><00:01:04.530><c> have</c><00:01:04.739><c> to</c><00:01:04.800><c> cut</c><00:01:05.100><c> the</c><00:01:05.190><c> staff</c>

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
I'm either gonna have to cut the staff
 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
I'm either gonna have to cut the staff
down<00:01:05.730><c> to</c><00:01:06.060><c> like</c><00:01:06.300><c> about</c><00:01:06.510><c> three</c><00:01:06.840><c> because</c><00:01:07.200><c> now</c><00:01:07.350><c> we</c>

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 align:start position:0%
down to like about three because now we
 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
down to like about three because now we
got<00:01:07.650><c> these</c><00:01:07.800><c> little</c><00:01:08.010><c> automated</c><00:01:08.670><c> devices</c><00:01:09.120><c> they</c>

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 align:start position:0%
got these little automated devices they
 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.300 align:start position:0%
got these little automated devices they
don't<00:01:09.630><c> do</c><00:01:09.720><c> that</c><00:01:09.870><c> or</c><00:01:10.800><c> I'm</c><00:01:10.950><c> gonna</c><00:01:11.100><c> have</c><00:01:11.250><c> to</c>

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 align:start position:0%
don't do that or I'm gonna have to
 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.640 align:start position:0%
don't do that or I'm gonna have to
increase<00:01:11.970><c> the</c><00:01:12.270><c> demand</c><00:01:12.450><c> for</c><00:01:12.840><c> all</c><00:01:13.440><c> your</c>

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 align:start position:0%
increase the demand for all your
 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.140 align:start position:0%
increase the demand for all your
nucleotides<00:01:14.130><c> so</c><00:01:14.280><c> I</c><00:01:14.430><c> started</c><00:01:14.670><c> thinking</c><00:01:14.850><c> of</c>

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 align:start position:0%
nucleotides so I started thinking of
 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
nucleotides so I started thinking of
what<00:01:15.270><c> else</c><00:01:15.420><c> can</c><00:01:15.660><c> you</c><00:01:15.690><c> do</c><00:01:15.870><c> with</c><00:01:15.900><c> them</c><00:01:16.200><c> and</c><00:01:16.610><c> I</c>

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 align:start position:0%
what else can you do with them and I
 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.940 align:start position:0%
what else can you do with them and I
thought<00:01:18.120><c> that</c><00:01:18.540><c> it's</c><00:01:19.140><c> possible</c><00:01:19.650><c> that</c><00:01:19.710><c> you</c><00:01:19.860><c> can</c>

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 align:start position:0%
thought that it's possible that you can
 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.810 align:start position:0%
thought that it's possible that you can
make<00:01:20.100><c> a</c><00:01:20.130><c> rapid</c><00:01:21.020><c> clinical</c><00:01:22.020><c> assay</c><00:01:22.410><c> for</c><00:01:22.820><c> single</c>

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 align:start position:0%
make a rapid clinical assay for single
 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
make a rapid clinical assay for single
base<00:01:24.890><c> polymorphisms</c>

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 align:start position:0%
base polymorphisms
 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.980 align:start position:0%
base polymorphisms
like<00:01:26.490><c> sickle</c><00:01:26.850><c> cell</c><00:01:27.030><c> anemia</c><00:01:27.450><c> was</c><00:01:27.660><c> a</c><00:01:27.720><c> good</c>

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 align:start position:0%
like sickle cell anemia was a good
 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.890 align:start position:0%
like sickle cell anemia was a good
example<00:01:28.290><c> out</c><00:01:28.590><c> people</c><00:01:29.490><c> there</c><00:01:29.640><c> that</c><00:01:30.150><c> took</c><00:01:30.450><c> back</c>

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
example out people there that took back
 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.350 align:start position:0%
example out people there that took back
then<00:01:31.140><c> maybe</c><00:01:31.860><c> you'd</c><00:01:32.370><c> go</c><00:01:32.550><c> into</c><00:01:32.760><c> a</c><00:01:32.820><c> clinic</c><00:01:33.030><c> and</c>

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
then maybe you'd go into a clinic and
 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.570 align:start position:0%
then maybe you'd go into a clinic and
they<00:01:34.110><c> take</c><00:01:34.320><c> a</c><00:01:34.350><c> sample</c><00:01:34.590><c> and</c><00:01:35.010><c> maybe</c><00:01:35.220><c> three</c><00:01:35.550><c> weeks</c>

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 align:start position:0%
they take a sample and maybe three weeks
 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.790 align:start position:0%
they take a sample and maybe three weeks
later<00:01:36.060><c> you</c><00:01:36.720><c> know</c><00:01:36.930><c> it's</c><00:01:37.410><c> just</c>

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 align:start position:0%
