00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:02.560
shows the rain radar image okay so it
 

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.020
shows the rain radar image okay so it
steps to the time from like 10 minutes

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:06.030
steps to the time from like 10 minutes
 

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.670

a handler and those kinds of things but

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:26.590
a handler and those kinds of things but
 

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:29.490

in the new API you have to actually add

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:29.500
in the new API you have to actually add
 

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.550
in the new API you have to actually add
some ground overlay or child sets or

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:32.560
some ground overlay or child sets or
 

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.620
some ground overlay or child sets or
those kind of things there's no way

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:34.630
those kind of things there's no way
 

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:36.780

or height one layer and then make

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:40.570
or height one layer and then make
 

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:42.900
or height one layer and then make
another layer visible then it's not

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:42.910
another layer visible then it's not
 

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:44.190
another layer visible then it's not
really smooth

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:44.200
really smooth
 

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:48.280
really smooth
interesting no I've not tried that yeah

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:48.290
interesting no I've not tried that yeah
 

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:52.090
interesting no I've not tried that yeah
I thought about just look drawing over

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:52.100
I thought about just look drawing over
 

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.430
I thought about just look drawing over
with a few or something but I guess that

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:54.440
with a few or something but I guess that
 

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.700
with a few or something but I guess that
won't work writer I'm sure a number of

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:57.710
won't work writer I'm sure a number of
 

00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:59.200
won't work writer I'm sure a number of
solutions will emerge over the next

00:19:59.200 --> 00:19:59.210
solutions will emerge over the next
 

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:01.180
solutions will emerge over the next
couple of months if it is an issue but I

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:01.190
couple of months if it is an issue but I
 

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:04.750
couple of months if it is an issue but I
haven't seen it myself okay yeah you did

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:04.760
haven't seen it myself okay yeah you did
 

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.150
haven't seen it myself okay yeah you did
I keep put it in a frame layout and just

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:07.160
I keep put it in a frame layout and just
 

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.680
I keep put it in a frame layout and just
draw have it your own layer on top of

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:08.690
draw have it your own layer on top of
 

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.410
draw have it your own layer on top of
the map yeah I thought about it but then

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:11.420
the map yeah I thought about it but then
 

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.920
the map yeah I thought about it but then
i would also need a custom location over

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:14.930
i would also need a custom location over
 

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:17.890
i would also need a custom location over
low for that planning events and so

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:17.900
low for that planning events and so
 

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.100
low for that planning events and so
forth yeah yeah and for now for example

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:21.110
forth yeah yeah and for now for example
 

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:22.960
forth yeah yeah and for now for example
now I have an option to share location

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:22.970
now I have an option to share location
 

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.510
now I have an option to share location
on top of the cloud so if it's very

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520
on top of the cloud so if it's very
 

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.130
on top of the cloud so if it's very
cloudy then you can see your location

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:27.140
cloudy then you can see your location
 

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:31.870
cloudy then you can see your location
still and but yeah if I go dead rat and

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:31.880
still and but yeah if I go dead rat and
 

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.960
still and but yeah if I go dead rat and
I have to draw basically every nothing

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:34.970
I have to draw basically every nothing
 

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:36.940

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:47.240
yeah try that what part of the letters
 

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:52.660
yeah try that what part of the letters
are questions so what's that question

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:52.670
are questions so what's that question
 

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:59.350
are questions so what's that question
from it so also complete text you back

00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360
from it so also complete text you back

it going I posted a question last

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:12.470
it going I posted a question last
 

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:16.210
it going I posted a question last
weekend or last hangout and I wasn't

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:16.220
weekend or last hangout and I wasn't
 

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.190
weekend or last hangout and I wasn't
able to join because I guess that group

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:18.200

was full what I'm trying to accomplish

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:20.870
was full what I'm trying to accomplish
 

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:25.180
was full what I'm trying to accomplish
is basically have a a multi autocomplete

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:25.190
is basically have a a multi autocomplete
 

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:29.230
is basically have a a multi autocomplete
view back by a cursor loader but what I

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:29.240
view back by a cursor loader but what I
 

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.960
view back by a cursor loader but what I
want to have happen is have a custom

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:31.970
want to have happen is have a custom
 

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:34.360
want to have happen is have a custom
tokenizer so instead of having like a

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:34.370
tokenizer so instead of having like a
 

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:37.840
tokenizer so instead of having like a
comma delimited tokenizer I wanted to

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:37.850
comma delimited tokenizer I wanted to
 

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.910
comma delimited tokenizer I wanted to
achieve something like a space delimited

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:39.920
achieve something like a space delimited
 

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:43.510
achieve something like a space delimited
tokenizer so I know I have to override

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520
tokenizer so I know I have to override
 

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:47.890
tokenizer so I know I have to override
the hook I think it's the token you are

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:47.900
the hook I think it's the token you are
 

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:52.030

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:57.450
into issues
 

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:01.580
into issues
as far as overriding that because for

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:01.590
as far as overriding that because for
 

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:05.149

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480
type in the word Joe Johnson or the two
 

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:13.580
type in the word Joe Johnson or the two
words Joe Johnson I think the call to on

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:13.590
words Joe Johnson I think the call to on
 

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:16.370

was entered like a space I expect it to

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200
was entered like a space I expect it to
 

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.779
was entered like a space I expect it to
only be called once but it's being

00:22:26.779 --> 00:22:26.789
only be called once but it's being
 

00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:32.419
only be called once but it's being
called like more than once ok so I'm not

00:22:32.419 --> 00:22:32.429
called like more than once ok so I'm not
 

00:22:32.429 --> 00:22:35.840
called like more than once ok so I'm not
able to successfully implement this

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:35.850
able to successfully implement this
 

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:41.779

custom on a custom what's it called like

00:22:41.779 --> 00:22:41.789
custom on a custom what's it called like
 

00:22:41.789 --> 00:22:45.860
custom on a custom what's it called like
a custom text watcher but if I go take

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:45.870
a custom text watcher but if I go take
 

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:47.180
a custom text watcher but if I go take
the approach of like using a simple

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:47.190
the approach of like using a simple
 

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:49.970
the approach of like using a simple
cursor adapter and don't go the cursor

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:49.980
cursor adapter and don't go the cursor
 

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.860
cursor adapter and don't go the cursor
loader approach then I'm able to

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:51.870
loader approach then I'm able to
 

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:54.110
loader approach then I'm able to
implement it but it's not I don't think

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120
implement it but it's not I don't think
 

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:59.810
implement it but it's not I don't think
it's like as efficient so what stage you

00:22:59.810 --> 00:22:59.820
it's like as efficient so what stage you
 

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.639
it's like as efficient so what stage you
trying what how come you can do it with

to do with when when I did go with a
 

00:23:13.919 --> 00:23:17.060
to do with when when I did go with a
simple cursor adapter approach then I

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:17.070
simple cursor adapter approach then I
 

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:20.450
simple cursor adapter approach then I
took a look at I have a filter query

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:20.460
took a look at I have a filter query
 

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.539
took a look at I have a filter query
provider that has a run query method

00:23:23.539 --> 00:23:23.549
provider that has a run query method
 

00:23:23.549 --> 00:23:26.389
provider that has a run query method
that I'm overriding and I'm also

00:23:26.389 --> 00:23:26.399
that I'm overriding and I'm also
 

00:23:26.399 --> 00:23:31.519
that I'm overriding and I'm also
noticing that aunt exchanged method this

00:23:31.519 --> 00:23:31.529
noticing that aunt exchanged method this
 

00:23:31.529 --> 00:23:33.740
noticing that aunt exchanged method this
run query seems to be getting called

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:33.750
run query seems to be getting called
 

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:38.750
run query seems to be getting called
twice as well so I'm not really familiar

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760
twice as well so I'm not really familiar
 

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.350
twice as well so I'm not really familiar
with how the text watcher run query

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360
with how the text watcher run query
 

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:45.080
with how the text watcher run query
method gets called I was expecting to

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:45.090
method gets called I was expecting to
 

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:48.289
method gets called I was expecting to
just be called once when Texas change I

00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:48.299
just be called once when Texas change I
 

00:23:48.299 --> 00:23:50.799
just be called once when Texas change I
thought it would just get called once

00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:50.809
thought it would just get called once
 

00:23:50.809 --> 00:23:52.879
thought it would just get called once
but it seems like it's getting called

00:23:52.879 --> 00:23:52.889
but it seems like it's getting called
 

00:23:52.889 --> 00:23:55.970
but it seems like it's getting called
more than once and there's an argument

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:55.980
more than once and there's an argument
 

00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:01.100
more than once and there's an argument
in the on text change method called s

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:01.110
in the on text change method called s
 

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:03.620
in the on text change method called s
car sequence it's of type car sequence

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:03.630
car sequence it's of type car sequence
 

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:06.049
car sequence it's of type car sequence
and that's basically the length of the

00:24:06.049 --> 00:24:06.059
and that's basically the length of the
 

00:24:06.059 --> 00:24:09.049
and that's basically the length of the
string so the first time on Tex change

00:24:09.049 --> 00:24:09.059
string so the first time on Tex change
 

00:24:09.059 --> 00:24:11.330
string so the first time on Tex change
is called its of a certain length

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:11.340
is called its of a certain length
 

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:12.920
is called its of a certain length
and then the second time it's called

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:12.930
and then the second time it's called
 

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:16.820
and then the second time it's called
it's a different Lane so if I'm trying

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:16.830
it's a different Lane so if I'm trying
 

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:18.800
it's a different Lane so if I'm trying
to do any kind of processing of a custom

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:18.810
to do any kind of processing of a custom
 

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:22.400
to do any kind of processing of a custom
tokenizer it's not what I anticipate all

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:22.410
tokenizer it's not what I anticipate all
 

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.080
tokenizer it's not what I anticipate all
right it's cold isn't the before text

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:24.090
right it's cold isn't the before text
 

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:25.940
right it's cold isn't the before text
change call him one afterwards is the

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:25.950
change call him one afterwards is the
 

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:29.360
change call him one afterwards is the
untitled fortune yeah so I try to put

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:29.370
untitled fortune yeah so I try to put
 

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:32.060
untitled fortune yeah so I try to put
some kind of logic to see what the

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:32.070
some kind of logic to see what the
 

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:35.720
some kind of logic to see what the
string was before exchange and after two

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:35.730
string was before exchange and after two
 

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:38.210
string was before exchange and after two
exchanged I was never able to get

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:38.220
exchanged I was never able to get
 

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:42.530
exchanged I was never able to get
something to really work as far as the

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:42.540
something to really work as far as the
 

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:44.900
something to really work as far as the
changing from from the first call to the

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:44.910
changing from from the first call to the
 

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:47.990
changing from from the first call to the
second call so I was looking into that

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000
second call so I was looking into that
 

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.350
second call so I was looking into that
approach but haven't I haven't come up

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360
approach but haven't I haven't come up
 

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:55.190
approach but haven't I haven't come up
with any clean solutions No so you're

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200
with any clean solutions No so you're
 

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.900
with any clean solutions No so you're
not setting the text at any point in

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:56.910
not setting the text at any point in
 

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:58.250
not setting the text at any point in
these methods are you like if you're

00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:58.260
these methods are you like if you're
 

00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.510
these methods are you like if you're
running it through recognizer then

00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520
running it through recognizer then
 

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.780
running it through recognizer then
stripping out spaces or one characters

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:02.790
stripping out spaces or one characters
 

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:06.380
stripping out spaces or one characters
and then no well basically what i would

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:06.390
and then no well basically what i would
 

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:08.870
and then no well basically what i would
wanting to do is as soon as i saw a

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880
wanting to do is as soon as i saw a
 

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.610
wanting to do is as soon as i saw a
delimiter i save this value of s and

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:12.620
delimiter i save this value of s and
 

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.590
delimiter i save this value of s and
then i do something with that value of s

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600
then i do something with that value of s
 

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.010
then i do something with that value of s
but the problem is this on text change

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:19.020
but the problem is this on text change
 

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:24.140
but the problem is this on text change
gets called twice once instead of just

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:24.150
gets called twice once instead of just
 

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:25.550
gets called twice once instead of just
being called once after you see a

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:25.560
being called once after you see a
 

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.570
being called once after you see a
delimiter gets called twice so the first

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:29.580
delimiter gets called twice so the first
 

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.660
delimiter gets called twice so the first
time i see the delimiter it says oh that

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:32.670
time i see the delimiter it says oh that
 

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:35.840
time i see the delimiter it says oh that
the string is Joe Johnson then the

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:35.850
the string is Joe Johnson then the
 

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:38.060
the string is Joe Johnson then the
second time it sees actually more text

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:38.070
second time it sees actually more text
 

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:41.390
second time it sees actually more text
if I like keep typing and instead of

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:41.400
if I like keep typing and instead of
 

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.470
if I like keep typing and instead of
being that new word it has the entire

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:45.480
being that new word it has the entire
 

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.420
being that new word it has the entire
string of Joe Johnson plus the extra

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:47.430
string of Joe Johnson plus the extra
 

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:50.510
string of Joe Johnson plus the extra
text nothing that's the expected

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:50.520
text nothing that's the expected
 

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.830
text nothing that's the expected
behavior but it takes what she will

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840
behavior but it takes what she will
 

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.190
behavior but it takes what she will
always return the entire text as the

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:54.200
always return the entire text as the
 

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.470
always return the entire text as the
Indian suitable text so is there any way

00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:57.480
Indian suitable text so is there any way
 

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.110
Indian suitable text so is there any way
to get as soon as you see a good

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120
to get as soon as you see a good
 

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:04.610
to get as soon as you see a good
delimiter then grab that first the text

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:04.620
delimiter then grab that first the text
 

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.900
delimiter then grab that first the text
before the first delimiter and then

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:07.910
before the first delimiter and then
 

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:12.340
before the first delimiter and then
basically only see delimited by

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:12.350
basically only see delimited by
 

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:15.170
basically only see delimited by
potential donors the thing that's tricky

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:15.180
potential donors the thing that's tricky
 

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:19.430
potential donors the thing that's tricky
is that the deliverer is a space that I

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440
is that the deliverer is a space that I
 

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.710
is that the deliverer is a space that I
want it use but there could be spaces

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720
want it use but there could be spaces
 

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.659
want it use but there could be spaces
within a text basically it the

00:26:24.659 --> 00:26:24.669
within a text basically it the
 

00:26:24.669 --> 00:26:26.909
within a text basically it the
text could be like contacts where you

00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:26.919
text could be like contacts where you
 

00:26:26.919 --> 00:26:28.849
text could be like contacts where you
have a first name and a last name

00:26:28.849 --> 00:26:28.859
have a first name and a last name
 

00:26:28.859 --> 00:26:32.430
have a first name and a last name
separated by a space but if you have a

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:32.440
separated by a space but if you have a
 

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.519
separated by a space but if you have a
if this multi complete auto or multi

00:26:35.519 --> 00:26:35.529
if this multi complete auto or multi
 

00:26:35.529 --> 00:26:37.830
if this multi complete auto or multi
auto complete text view has different

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:37.840
auto complete text view has different
 

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.409
auto complete text view has different
contacts it could have a bunch of

00:26:40.409 --> 00:26:40.419
contacts it could have a bunch of
 

00:26:40.419 --> 00:26:42.840
contacts it could have a bunch of
different contact names and within this

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:42.850
different contact names and within this
 

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:44.460
different contact names and within this
contact names it has a first name and a

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:44.470
contact names it has a first name and a
 

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:47.599
contact names it has a first name and a
last name that happens to have a space

00:26:47.599 --> 00:26:47.609
last name that happens to have a space
 

00:26:47.609 --> 00:26:50.340
last name that happens to have a space
so that's where it's becomes a little

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:50.350
so that's where it's becomes a little
 

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:53.909
so that's where it's becomes a little
tricky with just a comma delimiter it

00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919
tricky with just a comma delimiter it
 

00:26:53.919 --> 00:26:55.049
tricky with just a comma delimiter it
sounds that you're gonna have to keep

00:26:55.049 --> 00:26:55.059
sounds that you're gonna have to keep
 

00:26:55.059 --> 00:27:00.060
sounds that you're gonna have to keep
track via yourself ready yeah yeah asian

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:00.070
track via yourself ready yeah yeah asian
 

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:02.399
track via yourself ready yeah yeah asian
decide when you want to keep the string

00:27:02.399 --> 00:27:02.409
decide when you want to keep the string
 

00:27:02.409 --> 00:27:03.810
decide when you want to keep the string
when you don't want to keep it I think

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:03.820
when you don't want to keep it I think
 

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:05.340
when you don't want to keep it I think
that's now that because if it sounds at

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:05.350
that's now that because if it sounds at
 

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:06.599
that's now that because if it sounds at
some point you're putting set text

00:27:06.599 --> 00:27:06.609
some point you're putting set text
 

00:27:06.609 --> 00:27:08.759
some point you're putting set text
within your tex culture which is

00:27:08.759 --> 00:27:08.769
within your tex culture which is
 

00:27:08.769 --> 00:27:10.470
within your tex culture which is
entirely adjustment you can do that but

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480
entirely adjustment you can do that but
 

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.849
entirely adjustment you can do that but
you need to handle the case either and

00:27:11.849 --> 00:27:11.859
you need to handle the case either and
 

00:27:11.859 --> 00:27:14.369
you need to handle the case either and
if it somehow recursively anything yeah

00:27:14.369 --> 00:27:14.379
if it somehow recursively anything yeah
 

00:27:14.379 --> 00:27:17.549
if it somehow recursively anything yeah
i had was if you had a tech to where you

00:27:17.549 --> 00:27:17.559
i had was if you had a tech to where you
 

00:27:17.559 --> 00:27:19.049
i had was if you had a tech to where you
could only enter it valid information

00:27:19.049 --> 00:27:19.059
could only enter it valid information
 

00:27:19.059 --> 00:27:20.999
could only enter it valid information
which then affected other fields which

00:27:20.999 --> 00:27:21.009
which then affected other fields which
 

00:27:21.009 --> 00:27:23.940
which then affected other fields which
that are you affected that one if you

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:23.950
that are you affected that one if you
 

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:26.159
that are you affected that one if you
start getting really kind of messy traps

00:27:26.159 --> 00:27:26.169
start getting really kind of messy traps
 

00:27:26.169 --> 00:27:27.720
start getting really kind of messy traps
you have to make sure you get to make me

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:27.730
you have to make sure you get to make me
 

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:31.440
you have to make sure you get to make me
you you account for that basically the

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:31.450
you you account for that basically the
 

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:32.399
you you account for that basically the
other thing you could take a look at is

00:27:32.399 --> 00:27:32.409
other thing you could take a look at is
 

00:27:32.409 --> 00:27:35.909
other thing you could take a look at is
the chips UI which is the uo e use in

00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919
the chips UI which is the uo e use in
 

00:27:35.919 --> 00:27:40.009
the chips UI which is the uo e use in

source so you can take a look look for

00:27:43.499 --> 00:27:43.509
source so you can take a look look for

source so you can take a look look for
the chips you are i think it's called

00:27:44.519 --> 00:27:44.529

enter a name it turns it into a little
yeah i was reading a little bit about

00:27:50.639 --> 00:27:50.649
yeah i was reading a little bit about
 

00:27:50.649 --> 00:27:54.210
yeah i was reading a little bit about
that but i didn't get to check out the

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:54.220
that but i didn't get to check out the
 

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:57.389
that but i didn't get to check out the
documentation yet it's what about Oh

00:27:57.389 --> 00:27:57.399
documentation yet it's what about Oh
 

00:27:57.399 --> 00:28:00.389

somewhere isn't that I'm sure I've seen

00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399
somewhere isn't that I'm sure I've seen
 

00:28:00.399 --> 00:28:02.580
somewhere isn't that I'm sure I've seen
it come up a couple of times someone but

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:02.590
it come up a couple of times someone but
 

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:06.029
it come up a couple of times someone but
yeah I was thinking maybe potentially my

00:28:06.029 --> 00:28:06.039
yeah I was thinking maybe potentially my
 

00:28:06.039 --> 00:28:10.229
yeah I was thinking maybe potentially my
approach once I um see a delimited like

00:28:10.229 --> 00:28:10.239
approach once I um see a delimited like
 

00:28:10.239 --> 00:28:13.590
approach once I um see a delimited like
let's say someone typed in Joe Johnson

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600
let's say someone typed in Joe Johnson
 

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.690
let's say someone typed in Joe Johnson
and then they press space then I can

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:15.700
and then they press space then I can
 

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:19.560
and then they press space then I can
save this in some other eat a variable

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:19.570
save this in some other eat a variable
 

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:22.680
save this in some other eat a variable
like global variable and regardless of

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:22.690
like global variable and regardless of
 

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:24.960
like global variable and regardless of
the what the on text changes then I just

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:24.970
the what the on text changes then I just
 

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:27.509
the what the on text changes then I just
update that global variable and I can

00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:27.519
update that global variable and I can
 

00:28:27.519 --> 00:28:30.409
update that global variable and I can
put some arbitrary delimiter within this

00:28:30.409 --> 00:28:30.419
put some arbitrary delimiter within this
 

00:28:30.419 --> 00:28:33.690
put some arbitrary delimiter within this
string so i could say Joe Johnson and

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:33.700
string so i could say Joe Johnson and
 

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:37.560
string so i could say Joe Johnson and
then put like a pipe that would just

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:37.570
then put like a pipe that would just
 

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:38.100
then put like a pipe that would just
eliminate

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:38.110
eliminate
 

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:40.980
eliminate
in this arbitrary string and then if

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:40.990
in this arbitrary string and then if
 

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:43.110
in this arbitrary string and then if
more Texas is added on Tex change will

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120
more Texas is added on Tex change will
 

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:46.400
more Texas is added on Tex change will
always show what's in the edit text view

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:46.410
always show what's in the edit text view
 

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:49.919
always show what's in the edit text view
right but my global string will show how

00:28:49.919 --> 00:28:49.929
right but my global string will show how
 

00:28:49.929 --> 00:28:52.380
right but my global string will show how
its delimited yeah that sounds

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:52.390
its delimited yeah that sounds
 

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:53.430
its delimited yeah that sounds
reasonable you like hugging them in a

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440
reasonable you like hugging them in a
 

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.220
reasonable you like hugging them in a
map or sex or something yeah yeah I'm

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:56.230
map or sex or something yeah yeah I'm
 

00:28:56.230 --> 00:29:00.930
map or sex or something yeah yeah I'm
like that ok and I'll take a look at

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:00.940
like that ok and I'll take a look at
 

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:04.340
like that ok and I'll take a look at
that on the chips you I are the chips

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:04.350
that on the chips you I are the chips
 

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:11.039
that on the chips you I are the chips
and then yeah geyser yeah thank you no

00:29:11.039 --> 00:29:11.049
and then yeah geyser yeah thank you no
 

00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:14.820
and then yeah geyser yeah thank you no
ways but just go back to questions so

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:14.830
ways but just go back to questions so
 

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:15.900
ways but just go back to questions so
what are we trying to make it to a

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:15.910
what are we trying to make it to a
 

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:20.780
what are we trying to make it to a
loader rather than using a on query um

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:20.790
loader rather than using a on query um
 

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:26.270
loader rather than using a on query um
because I wanted to basically do a

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:26.280
because I wanted to basically do a
 

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.890
because I wanted to basically do a
synchronous asynchronous Leon do the

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:28.900
synchronous asynchronous Leon do the
 

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:32.520
synchronous asynchronous Leon do the
loading the background and cursor

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:32.530
loading the background and cursor
 

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:34.500
loading the background and cursor
loaders are of red that crystal odors

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:34.510
loaders are of red that crystal odors
 

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:39.180
loaders are of red that crystal odors
are a lot more efficient at that instead

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:39.190
are a lot more efficient at that instead
 

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:44.549
are a lot more efficient at that instead
of like blocking main UI I thought yeah

00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559
of like blocking main UI I thought yeah
 

00:29:44.559 --> 00:29:47.070
of like blocking main UI I thought yeah
how to approach this a lot of the

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:47.080
how to approach this a lot of the
 

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.740
how to approach this a lot of the
heaviness thing doesn't it and what's

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:49.750
heaviness thing doesn't it and what's
 

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:51.030
heaviness thing doesn't it and what's
the most complete sexy will do that

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:51.040
the most complete sexy will do that
 

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:55.669
the most complete sexy will do that
anyway for you right you normally use a

00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679
anyway for you right you normally use a
 

00:29:55.679 --> 00:29:58.980
anyway for you right you normally use a
cool it's nice in query anyways then

00:29:58.980 --> 00:29:58.990
cool it's nice in query anyways then
 

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:09.900
cool it's nice in query anyways then
image victims yeah it was cool oh yeah I

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:09.910
image victims yeah it was cool oh yeah I
 

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:11.430
image victims yeah it was cool oh yeah I
think you know me did in religious it

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440
think you know me did in religious it
 

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.340
think you know me did in religious it
exocrine city anyway so you know I'm all

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:14.350
exocrine city anyway so you know I'm all
 

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.950

typed it already does it mean seriously

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960
typed it already does it mean seriously
 

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:21.270
typed it already does it mean seriously
yeah okay so potentially just using a

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:21.280
yeah okay so potentially just using a
 

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.470
yeah okay so potentially just using a
simple cursor adapter um I I get it says

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:25.480
simple cursor adapter um I I get it says
 

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:30.000
simple cursor adapter um I I get it says
efficient as it needs to be because with

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:30.010
efficient as it needs to be because with
 

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:33.780
efficient as it needs to be because with
the symbol cursor adapter I'm I think

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:33.790
the symbol cursor adapter I'm I think
 

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:36.180
the symbol cursor adapter I'm I think
what happened is something about like I

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:36.190
what happened is something about like I
 

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:39.150
what happened is something about like I
needed to manage the cursor and it

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:39.160
needed to manage the cursor and it
 

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.700
needed to manage the cursor and it
wasn't closed properly that's why I went

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:41.710
wasn't closed properly that's why I went
 

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:44.990
wasn't closed properly that's why I went
with the cursor loader so handled that I

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000
with the cursor loader so handled that I
 

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.610
with the cursor loader so handled that I
the cursor and managing that efficiently

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:50.620
 
 

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.680
 
I think I turned on like a debugging

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:52.690
I think I turned on like a debugging
 

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:56.130
I think I turned on like a debugging
mode one of the strict modes and it

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:56.140
mode one of the strict modes and it
 

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.980
mode one of the strict modes and it
complained because Herschel the cursor

00:30:58.980 --> 00:30:58.990
complained because Herschel the cursor
 

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:02.910
complained because Herschel the cursor
wasn't closed correctly so that's why

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:02.920
wasn't closed correctly so that's why
 

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.860
wasn't closed correctly so that's why
went with approach of cursor loader that

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:04.870
went with approach of cursor loader that
 

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:08.250
went with approach of cursor loader that
would manage that cursor ya know you did

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:08.260
would manage that cursor ya know you did
 

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.600
would manage that cursor ya know you did

doing yeah yeah a scene query handler

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:18.160
doing yeah yeah a scene query handler
 

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:22.320

went off the ICA you're okay then okay

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:22.330
went off the ICA you're okay then okay
 

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:23.880
went off the ICA you're okay then okay
and then I just have to figure out where

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:23.890
and then I just have to figure out where
 

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:27.180
and then I just have to figure out where
to close that cursor yeah it's my J

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:27.190
to close that cursor yeah it's my J
 

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:34.370
to close that cursor yeah it's my J

onto a pc / USB and then can you share
 

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:31.630

then the teachers want to make sure what

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960
then the teachers want to make sure what
 

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.770
then the teachers want to make sure what
they're doing is right even then more

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:47.780
they're doing is right even then more
 

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:53.390

all yourself and piece it back together
 

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:39.760
all yourself and piece it back together
are you returning much larger data to

don't there is a right answer here I
 

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:48.310
don't there is a right answer here I
think I leave it you could probably end

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:48.320
think I leave it you could probably end

up writing a lot more code it might be a

up writing a lot more code it might be a
 

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.099
up writing a lot more code it might be a

little bit more efficient but then the
 

00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:52.359

overhead of having to do it all yourself
 

00:39:52.369 --> 00:39:54.880
overhead of having to do it all yourself
might not be worth it say you could do a

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:54.890
might not be worth it say you could do a
 

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:59.010
might not be worth it say you could do a
test and see what which if it works out

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:03.130

little bit more information but yeah I
 

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.680
little bit more information but yeah I
can't agree if you're managing all that

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:05.690
can't agree if you're managing all that
 

00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:07.510
can't agree if you're managing all that
