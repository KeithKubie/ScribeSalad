00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:06.501
Narrator: INTRODUCING
THE UNDERWATER JET PACK.

00:00:06.501 --> 00:00:10.701
WEAR IT AND FREESTYLE FASTER
THAN MICHAEL PHELPS.

00:00:10.701 --> 00:00:12.834
EAT YOUR HEART OUT, AQUAMAN.

00:00:12.834 --> 00:00:14.334
Gradman:
ANYTIME YOU CAN USE TECHNOLOGY

00:00:14.334 --> 00:00:18.033
TO GIVE HUMAN BEINGS
SUPERPOWERS, I'M ALL-IN.

00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:19.667
Narrator: WE'VE PADDLED
TO PORTSMOUTH, ENGLAND,

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:21.234
TO ASK INVENTOR SIMON PARK

00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:24.634
WHAT PROMPTED
THIS AQUATIC AWESOMENESS.

00:00:24.634 --> 00:00:26.300
Park: I CREATED
THE UNDERWATER JET PACK

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.133
TO ENABLE PEOPLE
TO FLY UNDERWATER.

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.801
REALLY, IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:31.067
I'VE ALWAYS HAD
THIS KIND OF PASSION

00:00:31.067 --> 00:00:32.601
FOR TRYING TO DEVELOP
THE TECHNOLOGY

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:35.133
THAT WE WERE PROMISED AS KIDS
BUT WERE NEVER DELIVERED.

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.701
YOU KNOW, YOU WATCH
THE JAMES BOND MOVIES,

00:00:36.701 --> 00:00:38.234
AND, REALLY,
THOSE KIND OF THINGS

00:00:38.234 --> 00:00:40.067
CAPTURED MY IMAGINATION
AS A CHILD.

00:00:40.067 --> 00:00:41.467
AND I WAS LEFT
AS AN ADULT SAYING,

00:00:41.467 --> 00:00:44.534
"WHERE'S MY JET PACK?
WHERE'S MY JET PACK?"

00:00:44.534 --> 00:00:46.234
Narrator:
THERE'S YOUR JET PACK.

00:00:46.234 --> 00:00:47.701
BUT HOW DOES IT WORK?

00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:49.534
THIS UNDERWATER JET PACK
IS COMPOSED

00:00:49.534 --> 00:00:51.868
OF TWO THRUSTERS,
ONE ON EACH ARM,

00:00:51.868 --> 00:00:54.334
WHICH ARE POWERED
BY TWO LITHIUM POLYMER BATTERIES

00:00:54.334 --> 00:00:56.234
IN A BACKPACK
THAT THE SWIMMER WEARS.

00:00:56.234 --> 00:00:58.901
AND YOU CONTROL IT
WITH A HANDHELD THROTTLE.

00:00:58.901 --> 00:01:01.834
Gradman:
PRESS THE THROTTLE BUTTON,
AND THE THRUSTERS POWER UP,

00:01:01.834 --> 00:01:03.667
DRIVING YOU THROUGH THE WATER.

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:05.801
THESE THRUSTERS WORK
BY MEANS OF PROPELLERS.

00:01:05.801 --> 00:01:08.767
Wrigglesworth:
WHAT SIMON HAS DONE
IS ENCASE EACH PROPELLER

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:11.767
INTO A SPECIAL DUCTING
CALLED A KORT NOZZLE.

00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:13.601
Gradman:
KORT NOZZLE HAS A CROSS SECTION

00:01:13.601 --> 00:01:15.234
MUCH LIKE
THE WING OF AN AIRPLANE.

00:01:15.234 --> 00:01:17.567
IT'S SHAPED SO THAT
AS WATER MOVES BACKWARDS

00:01:17.567 --> 00:01:18.834
ALONG ITS LENGTH,

00:01:18.834 --> 00:01:21.234
IT GETS THROUGH
A SMALLER AND SMALLER APERTURE.

00:01:21.234 --> 00:01:22.734
WHAT THAT MEANS
IS THAT THE WATER

00:01:22.734 --> 00:01:25.801
IS FORCED TO ACCELERATE
BECAUSE WATER CAN'T COMPRESS.

00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:28.167
THAT WATER JETS OUT
THE BACK OF THE THRUSTER,

00:01:28.167 --> 00:01:31.901
AND THE USER GOES SCREAMING
THROUGH THE WATER.

00:01:31.901 --> 00:01:34.133
Park:
IF YOU SKYDIVE, YOU'LL KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT IT FEELS LIKE.

00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:35.534
IT'S ACTUALLY EVEN MORE INTENSE.

00:01:35.534 --> 00:01:37.534
YOU KNOW, WATER'S
1,000 TIMES DENSER THAN AIR.

00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:40.367
SO, YOU KNOW, WE MIGHT ONLY BE
DOING 6 OR 7 MILES AN HOUR,

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:42.667
BUT WHEN YOU SCALE THAT SPEED
AGAINST AIRSPEED,

00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:43.734
IT'S FEROCIOUS.

00:01:43.734 --> 00:01:45.400
I CALL IT UNDERWATER HYPERDRAFT.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.133
Narrator:
AND WE CALL IT AWESOME.
