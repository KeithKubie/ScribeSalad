Speaker 1:          00:00          Hi Jocko and echo. I recently read the book marine, the life of chesty puller and in the book chesty references and the unnecessary loads of administrative paperwork that was required to be prepared for the military. I also recently member on it on a recent podcast, you recalling a situation in Ramadi where your platoon leaders were not thrilled to fill out required paperwork. I'm a squad sergeant in a prominent American police department and I'm experiencing the same dilemma. The micromanaging and oversight is extreme and I'm, and it's taken a toll on the morale of the officer's citywide. The tedious paperwork and constant micro-managing is preventing good cups from being proactive. I feel like the job, quote unquote, has changed beyond recognition. I'd appreciate your advice on how to approach the bullshit paperwork and increase the morale of my cops. Thank you for your time.

Speaker 2:          01:00          Okay, so what would I do in this situation? Um, first of all, I am going to be awesome at the paperwork. I'm going to do it so well that, because if you blow off the paperwork, then you go to your boss and say the paperwork sucks. And it's not any good. The guy looks at you and says, Oh, you know what? You don't even know how to do the paperwork. How do you know if, how do you know if it's hard or not? So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do, I'm gonna Start building a case. That's what I'm going to do. So I'm going to do the paperwork. I'm actually going to log down how many hours I put into the paperwork. I'm going to follow that paperwork and see where it goes and see if anyone actually reads it, right? Cause if I can go to my boss and say, Hey, I spent 28 hours a week filing this paperwork and know not one single person read it.

Speaker 2:          01:46          And then you take the manpower of everyone in the department and then what you do is you actually build a case. When you go in to talk to the boss, you should have a full magazine of ammunition to combat this paperwork that you're being forced to do. You have to be able to explain it to them in a rational, logical manner. And you can't. You can't make any headway against your boss if you are trying to fight from the low ground. The low ground is why don't really turn in the paperwork and I don't really do the paperwork and I think the paperwork is crap. Then they're looking down on you. What are you talking about? How are you dare you say that you don't even do it. You don't even know what you're doing. You got to get on the high ground. How do you get on the high ground?

Speaker 2:          02:31          You get all that stuff done to the best of your ability. You logged down the hours it takes. You get your whole little team doing it and you tell your whole team, hey look, I know this is painful right now. Everyone in this squad, everyone in this platoon is gonna do all this. We're going to log down what it takes because I am going to bring a solid case up the chain of command of where we need to limit this paperwork. This is a long war situation. You know how long it took to build up all that paperwork? It took years. It took 20 years, 30 years for that to happen. I used to joke about the marines, the navy seal teams, the range, our range procedures are super loose. We go out there and we shoot like crazy and do all kinds of really dynamic things and we'd sometimes go to a Marine Corps range.

Speaker 2:          03:16          It was like everything was super tight and I would tell my guys, I'd say, look, that's because that happened over years. One mistake happens. How do you stop that mistake from happening again? Put a rule in place that stops it. Another mistakes happen, another mistake happens. Put another rule in place. Another mistake happens. Put a p a piece of paper to stop it from happening again. And eventually you end up with a range that's barely even usable. So that's what happened in this department. There was little things that happened over time and they built and they build upon themselves and the next thing you know, you can't even recognize what your actual job was. So we have to, it's so that took 20 years to happen. You're not going to undo it overnight and you're definitely not gonna undo it from the low ground. You have to get the high ground. You have to be a performer. If you're not a performer, you have no say, do your job, do it well, fight the long war.
