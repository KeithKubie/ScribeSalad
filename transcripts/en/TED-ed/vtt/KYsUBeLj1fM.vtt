00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.218
Actually,

00:00:06.218 --> 00:00:07.213
and this goes back to,

00:00:07.213 --> 00:00:09.761
you know, questions I ask people in interviews,

00:00:09.761 --> 00:00:13.608
the ability to think critically

00:00:13.608 --> 00:00:15.308
is a skill that translates

00:00:15.308 --> 00:00:16.810
to every single job,

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.453
so I always look at that.

00:00:18.453 --> 00:00:20.793
If somebody doesn't have the specific skill set

00:00:20.793 --> 00:00:22.217
that I need for a particular job

00:00:22.217 --> 00:00:23.485
but has demonstrated an ability

00:00:23.485 --> 00:00:25.673
to think around difficult problems,

00:00:25.673 --> 00:00:26.891
to route around things,

00:00:26.891 --> 00:00:28.090
connect people,

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.925
that, you can train people on individual skills,

00:00:30.925 --> 00:00:32.494
it's that real foundation,

00:00:32.494 --> 00:00:34.025
the ability to communicate with people,

00:00:34.025 --> 00:00:35.081
analyze problems,

00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:36.739
those are critical things.
