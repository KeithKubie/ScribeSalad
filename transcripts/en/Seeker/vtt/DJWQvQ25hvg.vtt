00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.630
Got a gambling problem?

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.529
It's not you, it's your relatives!

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:11.830
Hey folks, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.370
You're probably already well aware that gambling
can be addictive.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.290
What's a fun night on the town for most people
can be a toxic breeding ground for impulsive

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.490
behavior in about 2-4% of the population.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.550
Gambling addiction works just like other types
of addiction: the person becomes obsessed

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.790
and they can't control themselves, it's the
ultimate high.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.310
They'll continue to pursue the high -- even
as they're running into financial problems

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.200
and tearing their family apart.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.159
Some may even break the law or steal in order
to recover their losses.

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:42.300
Even though problem gambling is commonly seen
as a personal failing by the mainstream, scientists

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.219
have found that there is real biology behind
the behavior.

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.020
For many years, scientists thought that gambling
was a matter of impulse control -- I mean,

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.610
claiming that gambling was like alcoholism
was pretty controversial in the 70s and 80s.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.929
But last year, psychiatrists moved problem
gambling to the addictions chapter of the

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.979
DSM, reflecting our developed understanding
of addiction in the brain.

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.420
This week, scientists have added more to the
growing body of researching about gambling

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.690
-- and they've found some pretty important
stuff.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.049
Awhile ago on DNews we talked about how smoking
is contagious, then pregnancy, and now gambling.

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.439
In a new study published in the Journal of
Clinical Psychiatry, scientists have found

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.560
that having a relative with a gambling problem
puts you at EIGHT TIMES the risk of developing

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.120
one as well.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.200
Amongst those with gambling problems, 11%
of their relatives also had pathological issues

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.970
-- compare that to the non-addicted population
where only 1% of their relatives have gambling

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:26.970
problems.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.570
But here's the real kicker: amongst the RELATIVES
of those with a gambling problem, the scientists

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.539
also found a much higher prevalence of behavioral
disorders: like antisocial personality disorder,

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:36.710
and social anxiety.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.219
And, those disorders in the relatives didn't
necessarily overlap with pathological gambling

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:42.219
itself.

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:45.999
There were some overlaps though with MOOD
disorders: in the pathological gamblers, rates

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:50.369
of bipolar disorder, major depression, and
substance abuse were much more common.

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.530
What this suggests is that problem gambling
and some psychiatric disorders may have some

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.880
kind of shared genetic cause, which could
hold the key to effective treatments and help

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.270
us better understand psychiatric disorders.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.939
But scientists aren't quite sure what genes
are at play..........yet.

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.539
Thanks for watching DNews everyone!

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.349
We'll be back soon with more science updates.
