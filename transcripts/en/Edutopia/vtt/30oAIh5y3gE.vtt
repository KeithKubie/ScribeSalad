00:00:07.086 --> 00:00:08.046
&gt;&gt;Ben: This is very well done.

00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:09.776
&gt;&gt;Student: Thank you.

00:00:10.206 --> 00:00:13.936
&gt;&gt;Ben: The recipe is a good one
and you executed it properly.

00:00:14.076 --> 00:00:16.586
&gt;&gt;Brent: If you have someone from the
community that walks into a classroom

00:00:16.586 --> 00:00:18.506
to help kids with a design project,

00:00:18.506 --> 00:00:21.356
it's something that brings
meaning to student work.

00:00:21.936 --> 00:00:25.236
When you involve kids in the community
and the community with the kids,

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:28.836
it's providing relevancy to what
is being studied in the classroom.

00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:38.676
&gt;&gt;Our community itself is rich in
resources, and every community is

00:00:38.856 --> 00:00:42.576
and so it's reaching out
and finding who can help,

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:46.206
whether it be an engineer,
a local business person.

00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:49.436
Whether it be a local chef, I
mean, these are all professions

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:53.236
that we've invited into our
schools, to either help teach

00:00:53.336 --> 00:00:57.976
or to evaluate the student work, or
to have our students present for them.

00:00:58.056 --> 00:01:00.416
&gt;&gt;Michael: When you put that
plate in front of somebody,

00:01:00.656 --> 00:01:02.066
the lettuce needs to be cold.

00:01:02.146 --> 00:01:05.066
The meat needs to be warm and the
potatoes need to be warm, right.

00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:05.996
All that kind of stuff.

00:01:05.996 --> 00:01:08.396
So judges will be here
in not too terribly long.

00:01:08.396 --> 00:01:09.976
Think it through.

00:01:10.046 --> 00:01:11.406
&gt;&gt;We have our student kitchen.

00:01:11.406 --> 00:01:13.716
Sixth graders do pretty basic
stuff, measurement and mixing

00:01:13.716 --> 00:01:16.906
and then seventh graders get more
complex, and eighth graders run cafes

00:01:16.906 --> 00:01:18.356
and get their food handlers card.

00:01:18.626 --> 00:01:21.906
And so we've started this thing
called Iron Chef, off the TV show.

00:01:22.016 --> 00:01:26.186
There are six teams, each of which
were given a list of the ingredients

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:27.296
that are available to them.

00:01:27.846 --> 00:01:31.476
They had to develop recipes
and put a menu together.

00:01:31.516 --> 00:01:33.166
And it's all about presentation
and how do they greet the people

00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:33.976
when they walk into their kitchen.

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:37.306
&gt;&gt;Lauren: We're going to have
I think four to six judges.

00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:38.886
It's not going to be teachers.

00:01:39.226 --> 00:01:43.586
We are going to set up little plates
of food and they're going to see

00:01:43.586 --> 00:01:44.766
which one they like the best.

00:01:45.046 --> 00:01:46.356
&gt;&gt;Michael: We try to,
as often as possible,

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:48.206
have a real audience that comes in.

00:01:48.206 --> 00:01:48.936
&gt;&gt;Excellent, all right.

00:01:49.456 --> 00:01:53.406
&gt;&gt;Really validate the kids' hard work
and get them excited about the level

00:01:53.406 --> 00:01:54.976
of detail that they've
been able to attain.

00:01:55.196 --> 00:01:58.036
&gt;&gt;Gerardo: So we're going to
have a chef from Celilo come,

00:01:58.166 --> 00:01:59.646
and he's going to be one of our judges.

00:01:59.646 --> 00:02:04.126
And basically, work harder
to show them what we've got.

00:02:04.576 --> 00:02:06.196
&gt;&gt;Michael: So each of
you gets six sheets.

00:02:06.646 --> 00:02:08.096
I've got pens, gentlemen.

00:02:08.096 --> 00:02:08.726
&gt;&gt;Ben: All right, after you.

00:02:08.956 --> 00:02:11.086
Start your engines.

00:02:12.126 --> 00:02:14.586
&gt;&gt;I am a judge for the Iron
Chef Hood River Middle School.

00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:18.166
My daughter is in this class and
they take this very seriously.

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:19.546
It's a class assignment.

00:02:19.986 --> 00:02:20.856
They're going to get a grade.

00:02:20.966 --> 00:02:24.946
They understand that it's something
from school, but it's a competition,

00:02:25.186 --> 00:02:26.976
and I think that just ups the
level of everybody's participation.

00:02:28.056 --> 00:02:28.676
&gt;&gt;Judge: Who's next?

00:02:28.676 --> 00:02:35.476
&gt;&gt;Josephine: Usually in class there's
like people who don't care as much,

00:02:35.586 --> 00:02:40.696
but now that there's people
like actually judging,

00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:42.456
you're trying harder, which is good.

00:02:42.456 --> 00:02:45.486
&gt;&gt;Michael: We got the kids some amazing
feedback from some very critical judges.

00:02:45.486 --> 00:02:47.996
I think they're pretty excited about
what they're ready to pull off.

00:02:48.066 --> 00:02:48.686
&gt;&gt;Judge: That's delicious.

00:02:48.826 --> 00:02:48.976
&gt;&gt;Student: Oh, good.

00:02:52.046 --> 00:02:53.216
&gt;&gt;Sarah: As a teacher, I
don't have all the answers,

00:02:53.216 --> 00:02:57.636
and so I regularly access
outside professionals.

00:02:57.726 --> 00:03:02.016
And so Andrea at the Hood River
Historical Museum is somebody I

00:03:02.016 --> 00:03:04.076
connected with very quickly
and then I said,

00:03:04.076 --> 00:03:06.976
"Could you come do a variety of talks?"

00:03:07.046 --> 00:03:10.616
&gt;&gt;Andrea: So today, we are going
to talk a little bit about pioneers

00:03:10.616 --> 00:03:13.346
of Hood River and how they
are shaping your lives,

00:03:13.346 --> 00:03:16.036
your education and your school today.

00:03:16.146 --> 00:03:19.526
&gt;&gt;I'm Andrea Smith and I am at the
History Museum of Hood River County

00:03:19.526 --> 00:03:21.916
as the education and
volunteer coordinator.

00:03:21.916 --> 00:03:26.036
I will do everything from dress
up like a pioneer to bring

00:03:26.036 --> 00:03:28.316
in a few artifacts for
the kids to handle.

00:03:28.316 --> 00:03:32.126
Teach them about either Hood
River history, museums, archives.

00:03:32.566 --> 00:03:36.886
That's the beginning of engaging them,
is bringing someone new in to listen to,

00:03:36.886 --> 00:03:38.866
to present them with new information.

00:03:39.116 --> 00:03:42.496
&gt;&gt;So from here, we're going to go to
the museum and learn a little bit more

00:03:42.496 --> 00:03:45.016
about your history and
living in your era.

00:03:45.396 --> 00:03:47.526
You're going to get to
see a school register.

00:03:47.636 --> 00:03:50.966
The actual register from
eighteen ninety-two.

00:03:51.196 --> 00:03:55.276
We're going to locate those people
that are on the register in the photo.

00:03:55.376 --> 00:03:58.166
I'm hoping that this makes these
people really real for you guys.

00:03:59.266 --> 00:04:02.206
&gt;&gt;Henry: It's kind of nice to get
a different perspective on things.

00:04:02.356 --> 00:04:04.656
It makes it a lot easier
to learn when people

00:04:04.656 --> 00:04:06.776
from museums come and
give us presentations.

00:04:06.776 --> 00:04:09.096
&gt;&gt;Andrea: And if you
look at these statistics,

00:04:09.096 --> 00:04:11.496
attendance really drops
off towards the end.

00:04:11.496 --> 00:04:13.376
Anyone have any idea why that could be?

00:04:13.476 --> 00:04:16.946
&gt;&gt;Aleyah: I know that it was really
hard for some people to get to school

00:04:16.946 --> 00:04:21.866
because of like the weather conditions,
or like they had to take care of--

00:04:21.866 --> 00:04:24.976
like they had to work for their
family or something like that.

00:04:25.046 --> 00:04:25.566
&gt;&gt;Andrea: Exactly.

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:27.366
&gt;&gt;Aleyah: I think it's really important
for people to learn outside of school,

00:04:27.366 --> 00:04:29.496
because it gives us a
better understanding

00:04:29.706 --> 00:04:32.836
of what we are like learning in school.

00:04:32.836 --> 00:04:34.616
&gt;&gt;Sarah: A kid who learns
how to interact

00:04:34.616 --> 00:04:37.276
with their community is somebody
who feels very comfortable going

00:04:37.276 --> 00:04:38.726
out in the community throughout life.

00:04:39.286 --> 00:04:42.216
&gt;&gt;Brent: So that's a very
important part of what we do,

00:04:42.266 --> 00:04:45.056
is we engage our kids
with the community.

00:04:45.056 --> 00:04:46.926
We engaged our community with the kids.
