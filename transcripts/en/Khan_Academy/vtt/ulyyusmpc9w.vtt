00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.330
A function f of x
is plotted below.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.680
Highlight an interval
where f prime of x, or we

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.870
could say the first
derivative of x,

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.260
for the first derivative
of f with respect

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.750
to x is greater than
0 and f double prime

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.710
of x, or the second derivative
of f with respect to x,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.770
is less than 0.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.560
So let's think about
what they're saying.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.851
So we're looking for a place
where the first derivative

00:00:22.851 --> 00:00:24.320
is greater than 0.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.530
That means that the slope of
the tangent line is positive.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.100
That means that the function is
increasing over that interval.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.670
So if we just think
about it here,

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.310
over this whole region
right over here,

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.690
the function is
clearly decreasing.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.130
Then the slope becomes
0 right over here.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.430
And then the function
starts increasing again,

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.020
all the way until this
point right over here.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.190
It hits 0.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.850
And then it goes, and the
function starts decreasing.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.405
Just this first constraint
right over here tells us

00:00:51.405 --> 00:00:55.050
it's going to be something in
this interval right over there.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.200
And then they say where
the second derivative

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.570
is less than 0.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.840
So this means that
the slope itself,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.290
whether it's
positive or negative,

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.780
that it's actually decreasing.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.850
We are going to be concave
downwards right over here.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.120
The slope itself--
it could be positive.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.979
But it will be becoming less
and less and less positive.

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.520
And so we're looking for a place
where the slope is positive,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.890
but it's becoming less and
less and less positive.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.720
If you look over here,
the slope is positive.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.980
But the slope is increasing.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.551
It's getting steeper and
steeper and steeper as we go.

00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:30.050
And then, all of a
sudden, it starts

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.420
getting less steep, less
steep, less steep, less steep

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.400
all the way to when the
slope gets back to 0.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.170
So if we want to
select an interval,

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.470
it would be this
interval right over here.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.950
Our slope is positive.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.150
Our function is
clearly increasing,

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.130
but it is increasing at
a lower and lower rate.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.560
So I will select that
right over there.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.270
Let's do one more example.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.780
A function f of x
is plotted below.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.630
Highlight an interval where f
prime of x is greater than 0.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.640
So the same thing where
our function is increasing,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.830
but it's increasing at a
slower and slower rate.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.720
So our function is increasing
in this whole region

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.360
right over here, and we
see it's really steep here,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.280
that it's getting less
steep and less steep.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.696
And it's getting
closer and closer

00:02:12.696 --> 00:02:14.400
to 0, the slope of
the tangent line

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.090
or the rate of increase
of the function.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.394
So I would pick anything right
around this region right here.
