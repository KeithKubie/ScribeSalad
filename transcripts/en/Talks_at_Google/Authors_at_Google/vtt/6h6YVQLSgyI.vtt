[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:07.870
DREW PHILP: Thank you all
so much for being here.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.059
I very much appreciate it.

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:11.100
So my name is Drew Philp.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.440
I went to school
here at U of M. I

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.580
come from a pretty
blue collar family.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.660
And I felt really lucky to
get the education that I did.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.460
So when school was over--

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.560
this was in 2008--

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.630
I saw so many people
leaving the state

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.850
that I wanted to stay here.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.090
And I thought that I got
this world-class education,

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.940
and I wanted to use it at home
for something good, however

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.400
naive that that may
have been at the time.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.220
So I moved to Detroit
because I thought

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.920
that was where I could
have the biggest impact.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.180
So what I were to do in
Detroit would affect my cousin

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.430
in Kalamazoo, framing
out houses for my sister

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.000
in Lansing, who's a nurse.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.600
And when I was there,
this was the market crash.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.270
And I decided to buy a house
because I wanted to keep myself

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.670
there, because so many
people had told me,

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.700
what are you doing here?

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.780
You're throwing your
life away being here.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.110
And everyone leaves.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.590
Sometimes people come, and
this is the place of leaving.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.170
It is the city of leaving.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.940
Over the last decade,
I believe, one

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.260
in four elementary school-aged
children has left the city.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.180
Obviously, the
city has been built

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.920
for almost three
times the amount

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.960
of people that live there now.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.030
So buying a house was a
way to keep myself there.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.270
If I had a house, I
couldn't just leave.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.300
At the time, there was
no way to rent it out.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.710
So in 2009, I purchased an
abandoned house for $500.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.620
It was filled with trash.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.750
10,000 pounds of trash I took
out of just the first floor.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.130
I took out the better
part of a Dodge Caravan,

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.280
cut into pieces with
a reciprocating saw

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.700
in my house, needles, human
shit, all kinds of stuff.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.640
The house had no windows,
no plumbing, no electricity,

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.970
and had a pornographic
hole in the roof.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.060
So I fixed that up
with my own hands.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.030
And I live there now.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.610
So over almost the last decade--

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.730
I purchased the house in 2009.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.180
And I wrote about the
experience in this book.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.710
The house is just the
spine for the book, a way

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.260
to get people through the
narrative to really talk

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.940
about some of the
social issues that

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.660
are going on in Detroit and,
to a larger extent, the United

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.440
States.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.710
SPEAKER: If you haven't
read the book yet,

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.793
I hope you all get a chance
to, because he touches

00:02:37.793 --> 00:02:43.230
on a myriad of issues,
ranging from policing

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.000
to consumerism to all of
those topics in Detroit.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
But also, I think
your quote is, Detroit

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.310
is America, just with the
volume turned all the way up.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.430
So you have these
very American stories,

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.810
but it's amplified because
it's happening in Detroit.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.670
And one of the things
you do in the book

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.309
is, you make a very conscious
choice about how you're

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:07.350
going to build the house.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.780
And you want to
build it yourself.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.010
You want to use materials that
are sourced a certain way.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.000
I guess, what did that decision
process look like in terms of,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.250
what drove you to make those
decisions on what you put

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.020
into the house,
and how long did it

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.854
take you to accumulate
all those things when

00:03:23.854 --> 00:03:24.728
you were building it?

00:03:24.728 --> 00:03:26.280
DREW PHILP: So that
decision came out

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.890
of just general
stubbornness a lot.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.480
I wanted to work for all the
money that went into the house.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.000
I didn't feel like
I wanted to take out

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.580
a mortgage, for example, and pay
someone already rich interest

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.190
to be able to do that.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.540
I wanted to own it outright.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.000
And I wanted to have
nobody tell me what to do.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.396
A huge part of my
life is, I just

00:03:51.396 --> 00:03:52.770
don't want anyone
to tell me what

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.890
to do so I can make ethical
decisions for myself.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.260
So I didn't take out any loans.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.180
I didn't take any kind
of foundation money.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.721
If I would have
called the house art,

00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:04.650
the foundations would have
been throwing money at it,

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.730
and it would have been easier,
in some ways, to do so.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.580
But I wanted to be free,
in a certain sense.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.399
And I think, often, free
money can be golden handcuffs.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:21.779
And I wanted to just
do that on my own.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.320
Nobody can take it away.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.810
I suppose the city
can if I don't

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.220
pay my taxes or something.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.450
I also wanted to change
myself by building a house

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.210
and become the kind of person
that I wanted to become.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.550
And changing-- excuse
me, building the house

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.170
did change me.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.900
I lived without heat for two
years in Detroit winters,

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.870
which were almost two years,
which was a huge, huge deal.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.950
I found something inside of
myself that was very real.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.776
It was a hard time.

00:05:00.776 --> 00:05:02.400
I'm not going to lie,
it was difficult.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.620
But I found some
things that I didn't

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.490
know I had, or were
buried so deeply that I

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.616
wasn't able to access them.

00:05:09.616 --> 00:05:11.031
SPEAKER: Can you
talk a little bit

00:05:11.031 --> 00:05:13.980
about the community in Detroit
that helped you through this?

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.530
Because that's a big focus
of the book when you first

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:17.540
moved to Detroit.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.860
Then as you're
building the house,

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.340
your neighbors, being a
white guy in a city that,

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.079
traditionally, it's
still 80% black today,

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:28.620
which is the reverse
of the suburbs--

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.130
the suburbs in
metro are 80% white.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.080
And so just the
community you came into,

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.399
the people that you encountered,
things on those lines.

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:38.940
DREW PHILP: But Detroit is the
most racially segregated metro

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.450
area in the United
States by far.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.087
And I'm a young white guy with
an education moving in there.

00:05:46.087 --> 00:05:47.670
Obviously, I have a
lot more privilege

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.930
than a whole lot of people
that live in Detroit, not just

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.590
my skin color, but education,
background, things like that.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.870
And there is a persistent
myth in Detroit

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.410
that Detroit is this
kind of blank slate

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.910
where, because the
city is half empty,

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.500
they forget about
the other half.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.780
So people always--
often, excuse me--

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.200
want to come in and
start changing things.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.460
I'd like to try it how it was.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.240
And that was, honestly, how I
thought when I was moving in,

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.966
that I'm going to save Detroit.

00:06:25.966 --> 00:06:27.090
I'm going to save the city.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.050
This is the city that's
loomed over my childhood.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.630
And I'm going to use my
well-read, 21-year-old white

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.354
kid education to save that.

00:06:37.354 --> 00:06:39.270
And what I found was
something very different,

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:45.120
that America, American popular
culture and capitalism,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.270
to a large extent, left Detroit.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:54.930
And in that vacuum, people
created a very distinct

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:55.530
culture.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:59.237
I call it radical
neighborliness in the city

00:06:59.237 --> 00:07:00.820
where people look
out for one another.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.835
People say hello to one another.

00:07:02.835 --> 00:07:04.710
It's like the opposite
of New York City where

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.440
you wander around and people
won't look you in the eye

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.230
and nobody wants
to say hi, where

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.920
people have done some pretty
stunning things, for me,

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.360
to help me along.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.050
I was lucky enough to find
a number of different kind

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.890
of flavors, I call
them, of people

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.429
that wanted to just be left
alone and do their own thing

00:07:26.429 --> 00:07:28.470
and raise their children
and live their lives how

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:29.550
they wanted to.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.970
In the book, I call one of
these places Forestdale,

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.150
which was started by one of
the finest men I've ever met.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.290
His name is Paul Weertz.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.039
He was a teacher at
the Catherine Ferguson

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:43.320
Academy, which was a school for
pregnant and parenting mothers.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.860
His idea 20, 30 years
ago was to teach

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.266
the young women to raise
their children by first

00:07:51.266 --> 00:07:52.390
raising plants and animals.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.870
So there was a working farm
on the grounds of the school

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:55.680
that was enormous.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.080
I forget how many acres it
was, but it was stunning.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:03.450
They had horses and
cows, dozens of beehives

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.880
and fruit trees,
all kinds of stuff.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.230
And he also started this block,
although it wasn't intentional,

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.330
with other like-minded
folks where

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:18.760
they would bale hay for the
horses and chickens and cows

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.680
at the school.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.310
You can walk baseball
stadium from here.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:27.270
And baling hay in Detroit's
wild to think about.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.000
But it's also pretty smart, too.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:37.080
So one of the folks that I
respect and liked quite a bit

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.320
was Grace Lee Boggs, who
I called Detroit's patron

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.130
saint of change.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.650
She was a philosopher
in the old school sense.

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:46.860
Excuse me.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.390
And there is now a Boggs School.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:51.940
She has recently passed away.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.560
What I found was a very strong,
interesting community in a way

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.610
that I don't think
exists anywhere else

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.290
in the United States.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:02.610
And the city wasn't blank.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.560
And I guess the way I
put in the book was,

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.870
I wanted to add my
voice to the chorus,

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.080
rather than overwrite
that or be the soloist.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.249
SPEAKER: I'm curious how you
think Detroit has changed now

00:09:13.249 --> 00:09:14.290
since you wrote the book.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:16.130
And you've mentioned
these things

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:17.880
during the course of
the book, the changes

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.921
that you see in the city.

00:09:18.921 --> 00:09:21.870
But there is development
downtown now.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.900
There's development in
some of the neighborhoods.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.460
Some of it is publicly funded.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.160
Some of it's privately funded.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.840
How do you look at
development now?

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.580
And how have things changed
in your neighborhood

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.620
and in Detroit since
you wrote the book?

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.600
And is it for
better or for worse?

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.225
DREW PHILP: As we
talked about earlier,

00:09:40.225 --> 00:09:41.970
I think it's a mixed bag.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:46.910
So we are losing some things
with this development.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:50.390
And obviously, we're
gaining the obvious ones--

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:54.950
jobs, economics, and such.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:57.830
I think that development
has been rather uneven

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.000
in terms of race.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.980
I think most of
that development is

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.280
going to a very few
neighborhoods, specifically

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.080
midtown and downtown.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:10.850
And that money isn't making its
way out to the neighborhoods

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.200
where I live and where you live.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:21.830
I call it trickle-down
urbanism, because the idea

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.470
is that if we fix
the city center,

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.980
then that will trickle down.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.140
If it works like
trickle-down economics,

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.450
I don't think
that's a great idea.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.530
I think the poster
child for this is,

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.060
just a week after Detroit
declared bankruptcy--

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.540
it was the largest municipal
bankruptcy in United States

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:42.530
history--

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:46.390
we gave more than $350
million to Mike Ilitch,

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:49.700
who is a billionaire, to
build the new hockey stadium.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:55.220
So there was no money, but
we could find $350 million

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.430
to give this already
very wealthy person money

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.056
to build a hockey stadium.

00:11:00.056 --> 00:11:01.430
The question I
ask is, what would

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:05.420
happen if we gave out 700
half-million-dollar small

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.340
business grants and loans?

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:10.010
That would make the city
look be very, very different

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:13.736
with 700 new small
businesses in the city.

00:11:13.736 --> 00:11:15.110
I think that we're
repeating some

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:16.520
of the mistakes of the past.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.070
I don't think race gets talked
about enough, especially

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:22.700
in the most racially
segregated metro area in the US

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.880
where, literally, Detroit
is more than 80% black

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.280
and the suburbs are the reverse.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.030
So I think that it's hopeful
to see what's going on.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.780
And I like it.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.730
I think that we need to be
very careful about democracy,

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.910
though, as well.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:41.120
People like Dan Gilbert
and some of the foundations

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.580
who are generally
doing good things,

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.530
there's no way to
vote these people out

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:49.010
if we don't like
what they're doing.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:52.880
And so that presents a
large problem for democracy.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.550
I mean, everything's going well
right now, but if that changes,

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:56.780
what is our recourse?

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.670
SPEAKER: I'm curious, too,
more specifically as you've

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:00.300
seen things in the
neighborhood change,

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.530
so does anybody
here know the name

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:06.890
Hantz Bank, Hantz Farms at all?

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.567
So to give you a little bit of
background-- and you mention

00:12:09.567 --> 00:12:11.150
this person in the
book a little bit--

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:15.410
so very shortly after
the recession in Detroit,

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.790
there was a bank that
came in and had proposals

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:24.620
around buying big plots of land
on the city's east side, which

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.320
was Hantz Bank, and now
has an organization called

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.400
Hantz Farms.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.640
And they pop up throughout
the book a little bit.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:35.540
But have you seen
organizations like Hantz,

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.510
which are privately-funded
organizations,

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:42.830
interested in buying
land in neighborhoods?

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.680
Have you seen that
change your neighborhood

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.990
for better or for worse?

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:50.060
And how do you see
that playing out?

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:53.060
DREW PHILP:
According to NPR, 20%

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.830
of the abandoned
properties in Detroit

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:58.070
are owned by
foreigners, basically.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:59.954
So I live next to
an abandoned house,

00:12:59.954 --> 00:13:02.120
right next to an abandoned
house, which I can almost

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:05.970
touch from my bedroom window.

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:07.550
It's now owned by Land Bank.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:09.620
But for the first
seven years I lived

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.410
there, it was owned by a
limited liability corporation.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:16.050
And I could not find
who was behind--

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:17.789
because of how the
laws are structured,

00:13:17.789 --> 00:13:19.580
I couldn't find out
who actually owns that.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:23.420
I couldn't get to a
person on the end of that.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.400
That house is being
kept as an investment.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:30.395
I would have preferred to fix
that up and put my cousin in it

00:13:30.395 --> 00:13:33.240
or rent it out or house
a family of refugees,

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.230
which is the current idea.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:38.359
But I couldn't,
because somebody was

00:13:38.359 --> 00:13:39.650
trying to make money from that.

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:41.870
If that house burns down, my
house is going to go with it,

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:43.495
and it's probably
going to kill my dog.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:50.450
So I think we're seeing
a lot of speculation that

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:53.300
may be good for an
individual's pocketbook,

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.790
but it's not necessarily
good for the neighborhood.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.280
I think that's one of the
flip sides of development.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.670
And it's attracting
a lot of attention.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:05.930
And people are saying, I
can make money from that.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:09.170
In terms of Hantz Farms, it's
a little bit more complicated

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:12.320
than that, because
Hantz lives in town.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.200
He is a banker.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.670
He's never grown
anything living.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:19.970
Originally, his idea was to come
into my neighborhood, actually.

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:23.150
I live in Poletown, which
is near Eastern Market.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.310
It borders Eastern Market.

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.470
And they wanted
to do vegetables.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:28.370
That switched.

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:31.541
They're now doing a
hardwood tree farm.

00:14:31.541 --> 00:14:34.320
And by all accounts, they've
cleaned up the neighborhood.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.912
The neighbors over there
really seem to love it.

00:14:36.912 --> 00:14:38.370
I've talked to some
of them myself,

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:39.744
and they're really
into it, which

00:14:39.744 --> 00:14:44.310
is in terms of
development, what I go by.

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:48.660
Many other people think it's
a land grab, very simply,

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.910
a way they got the land
very inexpensively,

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:53.400
in a way that someone
that's small time, like me

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.570
or my neighbors,
don't have access to.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:58.590
And so we'll see.

00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:59.475
Time will tell.

00:14:59.475 --> 00:15:00.850
They were going
to do vegetables,

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:02.349
and now they're
doing hardwood trees

00:15:02.349 --> 00:15:06.510
to cut them down someday
and sell them for money.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:09.390
And we'll see what happens.

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:14.940
There are a lot of promises
that we just won't know.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.820
But looking at American
history, those promises

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:23.310
don't always seem to
bear out for those that

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:24.657
don't have much to begin with.

00:15:24.657 --> 00:15:26.490
SPEAKER: Pivoting a
little bit from Detroit,

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:27.780
I want to talk about two things.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.700
And I also wanted to open
it up to the audience

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:30.366
in a little bit.

00:15:30.366 --> 00:15:35.245
But one of the things, I
think, on a lighter note,

00:15:35.245 --> 00:15:37.620
because a lot of the places
in the beginning of the book,

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.036
and even through
the end, you talk

00:15:39.036 --> 00:15:41.490
about just places that are
special to you in Detroit,

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:43.960
bars that you would write
in, and things like that.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.620
So what are some of
the places that you've

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:50.910
become accustomed to or you're
a regular at in Detroit,

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:53.580
for folks that are interested
in visiting and getting to know

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.230
the city at a deeper level?

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:57.420
DREW PHILP: I'm
somewhat of a recluse.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.670
So I only go to a
few places anymore.

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:01.030
SPEAKER: You don't have
to give away your secrets.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.946
DREW PHILP: No, no no.

00:16:01.946 --> 00:16:03.280
I'd be happy to.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.060
So the place I generally write
at is called Trinosophes.

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:08.950
This is a coffee house
in Eastern Market.

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:12.510
It's owned by a man named Joel
Peterson and a woman named

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:15.390
Rebecca Mazzei, who have been
great patrons of the arts

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:16.980
in Detroit for a long time.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.240
They're wonderful people.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.360
It's very much a hub
of culture and writing,

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:25.590
and rather diverse,
which I look for.

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:30.900
As we talked about earlier, the
DIA is just an absolute gem.

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.690
It is just an absolutely
world-class museum.

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:35.220
They always have
events going on.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.840
There's always something to do.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.030
The main collection is great.

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:41.410
I just can't say enough
good things about the DIA

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.570
and the DFT, the
Detroit Film Theater.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.440
And when I drink, which
is rarely any more,

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.460
I drink in Hamtramck.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.052
Hamtramck is a
great place to go,

00:16:50.052 --> 00:16:51.510
because it's only
two square miles.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.220
You can walk to all of them.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.270
And they all have a little
bit different flavor,

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:58.520
but they're all
pretty much dive bars.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.550
They're all good.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:00.450
So I do that.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.879
I spend a lot of
time at home now.

00:17:02.879 --> 00:17:04.920
SPEAKER: My other question,
before I kick it over

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.500
to the audience, is
around technology.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.859
And you are, by no
means, a Luddite.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:10.650
You have a website.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:11.930
You are on social media.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:15.150
You're on various platforms.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:19.950
But the book talks a
lot about physical work,

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.109
being involved in
disconnecting a little bit.

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:24.140
So I'm wondering how
you balance those things

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.781
in your personal
life a little bit.

00:17:25.781 --> 00:17:27.780
Because you're a writer,
you're connected a lot.

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.390
And how do you balance
working on a house

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:32.820
and doing that, or
living your life

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.100
in a certain way with the
values that you talked about

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:35.550
in the book?

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:37.200
DREW PHILP: So I don't have
the internet at my house.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.020
I don't keep the
internet at my house.

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:40.971
It makes me read.

00:17:40.971 --> 00:17:43.226
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:43.226 --> 00:17:45.099
DREW PHILP: Right.

00:17:45.099 --> 00:17:47.140
I was never allowed to
watch TV when I was a kid.

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:48.930
I just got my first
TV a week ago.

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:49.980
I'm super stoked.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.313
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE] is
catching up on "Game of Thrones"

00:17:52.313 --> 00:17:52.840
right now.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.968
DREW PHILP: I watched
the first season on DVD.

00:17:54.968 --> 00:17:56.188
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:56.188 --> 00:17:57.410
Yeah.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:01.275
So for my own sanity,
I need to disconnect

00:18:01.275 --> 00:18:04.040
a little bit, because I have
to use the internet for work,

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.740
and Twitter and Facebook, as not
only a promotional tool for me,

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:11.010
but also informational
gathering.

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:12.870
And just to have these
nightmares beamed

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:16.380
into your eyes by something you
keep in your pocket all day,

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.580
I need to be able
to disconnect from.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.490
And I think there's
nothing like physical work.

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.540
There is no sense--

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.190
maybe, I don't know.

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:28.470
Maybe it would be
interesting to see.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:32.670
I've never written a program
or coded anything where you

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.830
can turn it on and it works.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.170
For me, there's nothing
like turning the key

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:40.430
in a car that doesn't work, and
then having that engine roar

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:41.370
to life.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.920
It's very immediate.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.860
It's very visceral.

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:48.630
And I haven't found any
way to replace that,

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.120
even in writing, even
having things published.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.456
I'm on the staff at "The
Guardian" newspaper.

00:18:54.456 --> 00:18:58.710
It doesn't compare
to turning that key

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:02.470
and having that
engine come to life.

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:07.110
I do think we're losing
a sense of wildness

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:10.170
that we talked about
a little bit, too.

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.300
I think the world is
becoming less wild.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.160
And in some sense, that's good.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:19.415
And others, we're, I think,
losing some of the values that

00:19:19.415 --> 00:19:20.040
come with that.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.470
One of them is self-sufficiency.

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:23.465
I'm very big on
self-sufficiency.

00:19:23.465 --> 00:19:25.590
I want to try to be as
self-sufficient as possible,

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:28.770
which also has its downsides, as
well, especially when you talk

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:31.497
about community and what
that means, what it means

00:19:31.497 --> 00:19:32.580
to be part of a community.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.179
But like I said, there's
nothing like turning that key.

00:19:35.179 --> 00:19:37.470
SPEAKER: I've got 1,000
questions that I could ask him.

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.390
But is there anybody
in the audience

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:42.410
that has questions about
Detroit, anything in the book?

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:45.150
AUDIENCE: I'm still struck by
when you walked into the house,

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:48.487
probably for the first time,
and saw what sounded like pretty

00:19:48.487 --> 00:19:49.320
terrible conditions.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.670
And you clearly,
from what you said,

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:54.010
have a lot of love
for those around you

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:56.080
and your neighbors in the city.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.800
How do you manage that
juxtaposition of the conditions

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.740
you walked into in
the home and whatever

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.230
people had created
that with the way

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:07.805
you feel, generally, about
your surrounding neighbors?

00:20:07.805 --> 00:20:09.430
DREW PHILP: An
interesting conversation

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:11.304
I often think about is
scrappers, like people

00:20:11.304 --> 00:20:13.230
scrapping these places out.

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:18.555
So oftentimes, these houses will
get burned down for the copper,

00:20:18.555 --> 00:20:20.940
or the copper wires
and the copper pipes

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:22.230
will be ripped out.

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:24.472
It's hard for me
to hate on that,

00:20:24.472 --> 00:20:26.180
because like people
have no other option.

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.590
This is what folks
are doing to survive.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:30.070
And nobody's making a profit.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.820
Nobody's getting rich off that.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.080
They're just trying to feed
their family or themselves

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.380
or whatever.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:42.660
What troubles me is, I guess,
on the governmental level,

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.250
where people are overseeing
and looking at this,

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:48.260
we're demolishing incredible
amounts of houses.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.970
I forget how many it is a day,
but it's like a dozen a day

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:55.690
or something, like 10,000
over the last year.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:59.790
And to me, that seems like a
staggering waste of resources.

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:04.620
I think that we could
harvest many of the things

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:08.330
in these house, which would
be better for the environment.

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.830
We could use that to build the
new housing stock in the city

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:12.100
that we obviously need.

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:15.030
And we could provide
people lots of jobs.

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.120
What I'm fearing is
the loss of creativity

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.500
in how we do stuff like that.

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.610
So I could look at a house
that was filled the trash

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:26.000
and say, OK, we can do this.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:26.880
It's not a big deal.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.130
It also kept me out of trouble.

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:32.300
So I didn't waste my 20s in
a cloud of marijuana smoke

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:33.860
and cat videos.

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:38.930
I knew I would have something
that would always keep me busy.

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:42.110
When I didn't have a job or
if I couldn't have a job,

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:45.780
I would always have something
to do and something to work on.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:49.110
So I think we could use a
little more imagination.

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:51.590
And I think imagination
is absolutely essential,

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:54.140
which is why when we see
art programs and music

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.230
programs being
removed from schools,

00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:59.210
it's troubling, because
who's going to create

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:02.500
the next things of the future.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.374
AUDIENCE: Do you feel
a sense of listlessness

00:22:04.374 --> 00:22:07.862
from having finished the
house and the project is done.

00:22:07.862 --> 00:22:10.730
Would you want to buy
another house and fix it up

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:13.130
for your cousin
is on your agenda?

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:14.270
DREW PHILP: I do, somewhat.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:16.997
So the house is not
totally finished.

00:22:16.997 --> 00:22:19.580
I'll probably be working on the
house for the rest of my life.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.220
It's very nice now.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:21.830
I live there.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:23.120
And it's very comfortable.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.610
And I have two bathrooms
and a guest bedroom

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:27.050
and stuff like that.

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:27.800
So that's nice.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.080
And finishing a big
project like a book, I do.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.930
I've spent 10 years in Detroit.

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:35.570
I was recently awarded a
Kresge Foundation grant.

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:38.780
So I have to be in the
city for a year for that.

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:43.460
And after that, I
may move to Europe,

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:47.060
to Scandinavia or
Northeastern Europe,

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.430
because I want to see the
opposite side of things, where

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:51.513
we have public transportation
and things work well

00:22:51.513 --> 00:22:55.400
and socialism, just generally.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:55.970
So I do.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:58.890
I think I need some new
inspiration, just personally.

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:03.250
But Detroit will
always be my home.

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:05.360
I don't know how many
generations my family

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.320
goes back in Michigan.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.653
We've been here for a long time.

00:23:07.653 --> 00:23:09.950
My whole extended
family lives here.

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.290
So I'll never really leave.

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:15.410
But yeah, I don't think I want
to build another house right

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.520
now.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.810
People ask me this, and I say,
if I could be 22 years old

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.050
again, for sure, I'd do it.

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:23.990
But I'm getting old.

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:26.310
It's hard on your body.

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:30.089
I'm looking at my father
and grandfather and uncles.

00:23:30.089 --> 00:23:32.630
I'm the oldest male member of
my family, aside from an uncle,

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:34.400
with all of my fingers intact.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.590
I haven't cut any of
my fingers off yet.

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:39.650
So there are real
consequences to these

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:40.970
and breathing all the stuff.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:44.600
I did it once.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:48.170
And I proved I can do it
to myself and my family.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:52.100
And if the
opportunity comes up--

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:56.150
I'm attempting to buy the
house next door to me, still.

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:58.250
And if I'm able to
do that, the plan is,

00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:59.480
I'll do with my father.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.470
And in the lower
apartment, we'll

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:04.940
rent it out at market rate,
like hipsters or whatever,

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:09.940
and get as much money
for it as we can,

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.400
and which will support--

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:16.250
we'd like to house a refugee
family in the top, free

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:18.680
of cost, so they can get
on their feet, supported

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:22.514
by the market rate apartment.

00:24:22.514 --> 00:24:23.930
SPEAKER: Can you
talk a little bit

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:26.520
about buying a house in Detroit?

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.520
So when the book
kicks off, you're

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.820
describing the process of
buying the house at the auction.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:36.607
And in 2008, it was, you're
flipping through pages,

00:24:36.607 --> 00:24:37.815
and you're trying to do that.

00:24:37.815 --> 00:24:41.447
So that versus what
it is today and how

00:24:41.447 --> 00:24:43.280
that's changed things
and changes the market

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.530
and changes the neighborhoods.

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:45.251
DREW PHILP: Sure.

00:24:45.251 --> 00:24:45.750
Yeah.

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:48.170
So when I purchased my house,
it was at a live auction.

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:52.340
I had a bidder card that I
used to purchase this house.

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:56.480
It is done online
today, which has

00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:02.150
an interesting
ethical segment to it.

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:04.670
So I think it's 40% of
Detroiters don't have access

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:08.420
to the internet, whether on a
computer or on their phones,

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.880
have absolutely no
access to the internet.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:14.690
There is a serious issue with
internet literacy in Detroit,

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:17.520
as well, that people are
working on and trying to change.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:23.990
But having the auction online
creates a huge power imbalance

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.810
between people who are savvy
with the internet and have

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:29.660
the time and resources to do
that and figure those things

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.710
out and those that don't.

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:34.580
So for example, the
neighbors behind me--

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:36.890
I only have two neighbors--
they're an elderly family.

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:38.540
The gentleman is
a little senile,

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:41.450
and he was taking
care of all the bills.

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:44.270
But the woman in the
house was running things.

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:48.500
And their house was
up for foreclosure.

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.020
And the auction was online.

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:53.080
These people are
80 years old, have

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.510
owned this house for 30
years, and owned it outright,

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:58.610
and are all of a sudden
facing getting thrown out

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:00.180
on the street.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:03.080
Another neighbor of
mine and I ended up

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.567
purchasing the house for them,
with them paying us back.

00:26:06.567 --> 00:26:08.150
There was somebody
bidding against us.

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:10.960
They would have thrown
my neighbors out.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:22.520
So these things that are often
looked at as unalloyed goods

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.005
can have--

00:26:24.005 --> 00:26:26.300
they're tools.

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:30.530
We tend to think of tools as
inert or just what they are,

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:33.215
but they can have these
unintended consequences

00:26:33.215 --> 00:26:38.660
of this family not
being able to even begin

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.990
to understand how to
purchase this house back,

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:43.190
their own house.

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:46.220
Back on the internet,
when my neighbor and I

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.320
are bidding against--

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.900
I [INAUDIBLE] the guy.

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.627
He was buying dozens of
properties. that day.

00:26:52.627 --> 00:26:53.210
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:58.070
And as a just side note, you
have to put a $2,000 deposit

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:00.607
down online to buy a house.

00:27:00.607 --> 00:27:02.440
There's a barrier to
entry, even if you want

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.430
to buy a house in the city.

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:06.390
That

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:08.223
DREW PHILP: The amount
of structural poverty

00:27:08.223 --> 00:27:10.425
is staggering.

00:27:10.425 --> 00:27:13.840
Until you really see it, with
people living without water--

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.920
one in six homes has
been shut off to water.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.370
One in four houses has
been foreclosed upon.

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:22.490
And when you see people living
without water and electricity

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:26.120
and in America, it's
not only heartbreaking,

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.380
but mind-blowing.

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:31.360
It's wild that we allow
these things that go on.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:36.062
So even $2,000 is completely
unreachable for many people.

00:27:36.062 --> 00:27:39.240
AUDIENCE: Looking at the
housing market now in Detroit,

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.976
I'm sure that it's
rising exponentially.

00:27:41.976 --> 00:27:43.010
DREW PHILP: Absolutely.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:44.885
AUDIENCE: Would you say
that it would be hard

00:27:44.885 --> 00:27:47.990
for, say, a Googler like
us to get in and purchase?

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:50.664
And if so, what is that
rate comparing to, if you

00:27:50.664 --> 00:27:51.830
have any background in that?

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:53.270
DREW PHILP: Oh, sure.

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:55.511
I mean, there are
incredible deals.

00:27:55.511 --> 00:27:58.010
If you want to live in Detroit,
buy a house there right now.

00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:01.520
You can probably buy it
with what's in your savings.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:07.220
The $500 houses, there's
not a whole lot of them.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.470
The housing market
is rising rapidly.

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:10.970
But if you want to
purchase a house

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:13.910
and become part
of the community,

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:15.110
absolutely, go for it.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:17.900
Do it tomorrow,
because those prices

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:19.540
are going up consistently.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:22.850
I do always tell people,
there's a huge difference

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:26.920
in buying a property to
make money for yourself,

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.480
becomes an absentee landlord.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.559
The way I put it is that we want
things to flourish in Detroit,

00:28:32.559 --> 00:28:33.850
but we want them to have roots.

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:35.450
So I get a lot of
people calling me,

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:37.730
hey, help me buy some
investment properties there.

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:39.770
It's like, no, man,
that's not what I'm about.

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:41.334
I want a good, strong community.

00:28:41.334 --> 00:28:42.500
I want to know my neighbors.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.890
I want to have people
over for dinner.

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:48.260
If you're trying to
do that, do it now.

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.540
Get in right now.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:51.920
And people will accept you.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:59.000
I mean, it's amazing that people
in Detroit just want equality.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.540
They're not asking
for revenge, which

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.210
is, I think, a huge
credit to people.

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:06.440
And people like me,
who are young and white

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.180
and look different
than many people,

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:11.420
have largely been
accepted, to Detroit's

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:15.420
enormous, enormous credit.

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.630
So if you want to
do it, do it now.

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.785
SPEAKER: And there's a
couple of different tracks

00:29:20.785 --> 00:29:21.910
in terms of buying a house.

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:23.560
So you bought it
from the auction,

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.830
which you can do online now.

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:26.390
There's the Detroit
Land Bank that

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:29.240
has houses that usually
start around $1,000

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.500
that they auction off.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.770
But there's
requirements in place,

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:34.670
whereas if you buy
it a certain way,

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:36.980
you could spend a lot of time
fixing it up, as you did.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.840
If you buy it through
the Land Bank,

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:42.940
you have to meet certain
criteria and threshold

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:45.170
you have your house up
to date by certain days,

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:47.760
or they can take it back.

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.450
And you have to be a Michigan
resident and things like that.

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:54.230
They're trying to get people
to fix houses up on a timeline,

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:56.330
instead of saying,
oh, we'll just

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:59.566
sit on these houses for
20 years sort of thing,

00:29:59.566 --> 00:30:00.940
and not invest
any money in them.

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:02.898
DREW PHILP: And you can
get a really nice house

00:30:02.898 --> 00:30:03.590
with $20,000--

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:04.173
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:30:04.173 --> 00:30:05.080
Yeah, absolutely.

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:09.320
DREW PHILP: --and have a place
to live and have a part in-- it

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.120
feels good living there
a lot of the time,

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.380
because you can have an actual
impact and an actual direction

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.450
on what people go.

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:17.810
And I'm a big proponent
of buying houses

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:20.390
because, like for myself,
it keeps people someplace.

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:22.910
I think what people are
scared of in Detroit,

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:24.180
including myself--

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:26.870
and this used to happen more
often than it does now--

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:29.220
is people would
come in, very smart,

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.430
educated people would come
in from the Ivy League

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:33.830
universities and spend
a year in a Detroit

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:36.050
and make decisions that
they weren't around to see

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:38.520
the consequences of.

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:42.700
So I think people in
Detroit and myself--

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.710
everybody makes mistakes and
we all have to get along.

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:47.960
But if you just make
decisions that affect my life

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.422
and then leave for New York
or San Francisco or whatever--

00:30:50.422 --> 00:30:51.880
I understand
everybody's got to go,

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.890
but there was a deluge of it.

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:56.740
And it was also people that
had so much more societal power

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.720
than the average Detroiter.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.420
I think what people
want, including myself,

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:03.520
is people to come and be
part of the community.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:11.226
And we've never met, but we'll
be neighbors for a long time.

00:31:11.226 --> 00:31:12.850
And you treat people
in a different way

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:14.680
when that happens, I think.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:17.490
SPEAKER: I think there
is another question.

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:18.400
AUDIENCE: You can go.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.770
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:22.666
So my question was, are
there any organizations

00:31:22.666 --> 00:31:25.660
that you feel like,
within Detroit, provide

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:28.257
especially good
opportunities for people

00:31:28.257 --> 00:31:33.677
from different backgrounds
to mingle and get

00:31:33.677 --> 00:31:36.820
a better understanding of what
it's like for real people.

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:39.080
DREW PHILP: Sure.

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.360
I think that we could
use more of them.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:45.790
One of my favorites is the
Allied Media Conference, which

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:47.040
is a little bit off the radar.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.600
I think they're
absolutely brilliant there

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.040
and really know what
they're talking about.

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:55.250
But I think the large cultural
institutions in the city

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:55.790
do that--

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:57.989
places like the DIA, the
Detroit Film Theater,

00:31:57.989 --> 00:32:00.530
the Detroit Historical Society,
of the Charles Wright Museum,

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:02.960
which is an African-American
history museum.

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:07.730
I think they do, really,
honestly, the best job of this.

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:13.070
I think people are really trying
to work on how to do this,

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:14.970
but we don't know anymore.

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:17.660
I feel like in Detroit
we're building from scratch.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.240
I mean, I did not--

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:23.330
10 years ago, there
was no place I

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:26.060
could go in Detroit where there
would be only white people.

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:29.810
And that is completely
different now.

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:31.580
I think people care about it.

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.880
And I think people are
trying to figure it out,

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.640
but we're not quite there yet.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.010
I think the motives and
the intentions are good,

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:40.790
but we really don't know.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:44.140
That's an active question
we're trying to figure out.

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:47.750
And think the large cultural
institutions are really

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:48.637
doing that the best.

00:32:48.637 --> 00:32:50.720
SPEAKER: And I would also
say neighborhood groups.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:54.260
So if you are interested in a
particular area or neighborhood

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.840
in Detroit, figure out when
their community meetings

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.410
are and just go to one.

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:01.270
That's the best way to meet
people from the community

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:04.820
and see the diversity in people
from different walks of life

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:07.130
all in one place.

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:09.230
The neighborhood I live
in has one once a month.

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:12.185
And I meet new people
every single time I go.

00:33:12.185 --> 00:33:16.145
And that's been, outside of the
cultural institutions, probably

00:33:16.145 --> 00:33:17.709
the biggest place for me.

00:33:17.709 --> 00:33:20.000
And that's the thing, a lot
of neighborhoods in Detroit

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.640
still don't have
something like that.

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.530
That's a disparity
between neighborhoods

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:26.420
is folks have
organized in some ways

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:29.100
and have a non-profit or
something that's an organizing

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:30.810
force, and then
some neighborhoods

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:32.190
don't have that yet.

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:35.150
And that is a whole imbalance
of the neighborhoods that

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:37.280
might get developed
versus not is, do you

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.549
have someone speaking for
your voice in the city?

00:33:39.549 --> 00:33:41.090
DREW PHILP: People
are friendly, too.

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:43.520
People who are just
straight-up friendly there.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:47.000
And just saying hello, this is
something that cultural icon

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.980
Marsha Music, talks about a lot.

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:53.040
With white folks coming in,
it's just like, just say hi.

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:53.900
Go say hi to people.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:56.990
It's a simple thing,
but it doesn't always--

00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:00.226
we've gotten away from that
in our society, I think.

00:34:00.226 --> 00:34:02.483
AUDIENCE: So you said
that you wanted to add

00:34:02.483 --> 00:34:04.175
your voice to the chorus.

00:34:04.175 --> 00:34:07.635
So are there other authors
or artist or activist

00:34:07.635 --> 00:34:10.075
that you would
recommend we check out

00:34:10.075 --> 00:34:12.199
if we're interested in
learning more about Detroit?

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:13.894
DREW PHILP: Certainly.

00:34:13.894 --> 00:34:16.780
One of my favorite
artists in there,

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:18.679
a sound artist or
musician, is named

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:21.230
Sterling Toles, Detroit
underground techno,

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:24.409
just came out with a
wonderful album called

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:26.179
"Resurgent Cineribus."

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:29.210
Sterling's a
generational Detroiter,

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:31.679
a fascinating, brilliant man.

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:33.650
Marsha Music is
another one who is also

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:37.370
a writer in the city that
is absolutely brilliant,

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:40.580
also a generational Detroiter.

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.620
Oh, who else?

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:44.510
So I think I
mentioned Trinosophes.

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:46.800
I would totally start there.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.300
This is another one
of these places.

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.841
It's a coffee house
in Eastern Market

00:34:49.841 --> 00:34:51.590
where a lot of
artists and writers

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:54.659
hang out that you can see.

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:57.050
So the Master
Musicians of Jajouka

00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:59.090
is the oldest band in the world.

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:01.070
When they came to
the United States,

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:02.840
they played Bonnaroo
Music Festival,

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:06.770
they played the Kennedy Center,
and they played Trinosophes.

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:11.640
So that's another good one.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.630
There's the "Belt Magazine"
is publishing "The Detroit

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:18.050
Neighborhood
Guidebook" on the 24th,

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:20.810
I think, is the release
party at Signal-Return,

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:23.920
also in Eastern Market.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.230
Oh who else?

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:29.370
SPEAKER: And Aaron Foley
is the writer of that book.

00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:31.430
So if you haven't
checked him out--

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:32.430
DREW PHILP: Aaron Foley.

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:33.740
SPEAKER: Yeah, because
he wrote a book called,

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.490
"How to Live in Detroit and
Not Be a Jackass," which

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:39.200
is definitely a good
read if you're thinking

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.220
about moving to Detroit.

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:41.620
DREW PHILP: Sure.

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:46.766
In terms of visual art, Tiff
Massey is a jewelry designer,

00:35:46.766 --> 00:35:47.640
amongst other things.

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.430
She is just incredible.

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:53.360
I mean, there's a lot
of underground talent.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.700
I tell people, if you want
to be an artist, if you're

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:58.033
an emerging artist, Detroit
is absolutely the best place

00:35:58.033 --> 00:36:01.430
to live in in the United States
because it's inexpensive,

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:04.190
because you can have space and
materials that are available,

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:07.640
but also because there is
just an incredible artistic

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.940
community happening
there just bursting

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:12.680
with ideas and discussions.

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:16.320
And like I said, a coffee
house like Trinosophes,

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.840
you can walk in there, if
you've been in town long enough,

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.450
know every single
person in there,

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:24.090
and just have a discussion
with a map-maker who's

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:26.565
mapping the racial
politics in Detroit

00:36:26.565 --> 00:36:32.210
next to somebody who's making
Afrocentric Afrofuturistic

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:36.540
jewelry next to somebody like
Adrienne Maree Brown, who

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:42.260
is writing Afrofuturism
stories in the vein of Octavia

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:46.300
Butler that are
becoming very popular.

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:49.180
AUDIENCE: It seems like an
inhibitor to moving to Detroit

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:51.100
and setting up
[INAUDIBLE] school system.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:55.426
Also, when people have
families [INAUDIBLE] when

00:36:55.426 --> 00:36:56.754
you send your kids to school.

00:36:56.754 --> 00:36:58.995
Have you seen a
movement around helping

00:36:58.995 --> 00:37:04.224
to improve the Detroit public
school system or any schools

00:37:04.224 --> 00:37:05.740
within Detroit?

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:07.030
DREW PHILP: Sure.

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:10.120
The school system
is trash, obviously.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:14.550
And I do see people,
younger folks with kids,

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:15.460
starting to stay.

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:16.810
That was always the big thing.

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:19.180
That was the tipping point
for where the city was--

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.889
if you had kids, did you stay?

00:37:20.889 --> 00:37:22.430
People are starting
to figure it out,

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:26.410
and that's almost exclusively
in private and charter schools.

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:28.750
There are some public charters,
like the Grace Lee Boggs

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:30.320
School, which is
right next to me,

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:34.990
which I am a huge proponent of,
that does a really good job.

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:38.505
They do place-based education,
which they use the challenges

00:37:38.505 --> 00:37:39.880
and resources in
the neighborhood

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.860
to teach their students about
being good community citizens.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:47.290
So yeah, it's still a
question, but I definitely

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:50.200
see people beginning to
figure this question out.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:53.520
Another one is the
Waldorf School.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.020
Lots of my friends send their
children to the Waldorf School

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:57.030
there.

00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.934
It is happening.

00:37:57.934 --> 00:37:59.350
I don't think,
unfortunately, it's

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:01.900
happening-- just
the real politic,

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:05.380
not really happening in the
Detroit public schools yet.

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:08.492
And to be honest, I don't
really see a path out of it yet.

00:38:08.492 --> 00:38:09.700
Do we have time for one more?

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:10.900
SPEAKER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.860
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
the techno scene.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.575
And I was just
curious what you feel

00:38:14.575 --> 00:38:18.355
the impact, whether good or bad,
of something like [INAUDIBLE]..

00:38:18.355 --> 00:38:19.230
DREW PHILP: Oh, yeah.

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.354
I mean, I think it's great.

00:38:20.354 --> 00:38:22.660
People come from all
over the world to see--

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:26.560
in Germany and Belgium,
it's called Detroit music.

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:27.590
We invented it.

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:30.010
It's one of our cultural icons.

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:32.710
And I think, actually, we
could do a whole lot more

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:35.470
to support electronic
music in Detroit.

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:38.440
And it's a big, huge deal.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.540
And it came from here.

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:43.510
I'm not a huge electronic
music fan myself,

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:46.210
but I have enormous
respect for someone

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:48.460
that can take the
noises of the factory

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:50.890
and create this beautiful
thing out of it.

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:58.870
That's so human to me, to take
this mechanical, inhuman thing

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:01.780
and make something
beautiful out of it.

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:04.984
I actually think, in Detroit,
we could do a whole lot more

00:39:04.984 --> 00:39:05.650
to support that.

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:10.330
There's kids like Kyle Hall, who
is another Detroit artist you

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:15.520
might want to check out, that
will play to 20 people at Motor

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.280
City Wine bar, and
then will fly to Berlin

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:23.789
and play to 20,000
people, for real.

00:39:23.789 --> 00:39:26.080
SPEAKER: I think the city's
getting a little bit better

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:27.430
in terms of recognizing things.

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:29.380
I mean, we're just getting
[INAUDIBLE] the Motown

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:31.088
Museum, which was
literally just a house,

00:39:31.088 --> 00:39:33.640
and now they're building
an actual full-on museum

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:34.909
over there.

00:39:34.909 --> 00:39:36.450
But yeah, there's
still a lot of work

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:40.743
to do in terms of recognizing
music history, cultural history

00:39:40.743 --> 00:39:41.510
of the city.

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:43.330
DREW PHILP: And
we're starting to.

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:44.210
It's getting better.

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:48.080
And I hope electronic music,
techno, is really something.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:51.330
I mean, Carl Craig and
Carl Cox are still around.

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:53.005
You can see them at the bar.

00:39:53.005 --> 00:39:54.160
This is like legend--

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:58.310
it's like seeing Jimi
Hendrix at the bar.

00:39:58.310 --> 00:40:00.042
So yeah, I hope--

00:40:00.042 --> 00:40:02.000
I think we can do a better
job of it, actually.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.840
And I would like to see
that celebrated even more.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:07.700
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.790
Well, if there's no
more audience questions,

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:11.250
thank you, Drew, for coming.

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:11.930
DREW PHILP: Thank
you for having me.

00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:12.888
I really appreciate it.

00:40:12.888 --> 00:40:16.180
[APPLAUSE]
