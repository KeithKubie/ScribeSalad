[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.388 --> 00:00:03.430
TAYLOR WILSON: All right.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:04.720
Take a seat.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.220
All right.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.980
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.260
I'm Taylor Wilson.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.760
For those of you
who know who I am,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.190
I'm a nuclear physicist
in my day job.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.830
I built a nuclear
reactor when I was 14.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.510
I think that's one
of the many things

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.570
that we share in common
our interests in things

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.320
of that nature when
we were really young.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.250
So I'm excited to be here
today to interview Dr. Kaku

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.190
about physics and the future.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.670
So I guess with that
we'll get started.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.780
I will say that when we
finish our talking up here,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.780
we're going to take
questions from the audience.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.700
So if you want to start thinking
about some questions that you

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.720
have for Dr. Kaku about the
future of humanity or physics,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.670
we're happy to try to
give you an answer.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.128
So with that, thank you for
joining us this morning.

00:00:49.128 --> 00:00:50.170
MICHIO KAKU: My pleasure.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.962
TAYLOR WILSON: Yes.

00:00:50.962 --> 00:00:54.352
I wanted to start with something
that's been in the news

00:00:54.352 --> 00:00:56.560
the last couple of weeks
and I'm sure a lot of people

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.602
are really interested in.

00:00:57.602 --> 00:01:00.700
And that's that picture of
a black hole that was taken

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.115
by the Event Horizon telescope.

00:01:02.115 --> 00:01:03.490
Maybe you could
talk a little bit

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.170
about how you feel
seeing that image

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.610
and what that tells us about
the physics of the universe.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.040
MICHIO KAKU: Well, when I was
a grad student at Berkeley,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.110
black holes were
considered science fiction.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.340
It was considered like
finding a unicorn.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.960
It's a fabled animal.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.830
Everyone talks about unicorns.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.000
But no one's ever seen one
because they don't exist.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.380
Now we've got it in the bag.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.540
We've actually photographed
the silhouette,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.030
the shadow of a black hole.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.460
But that's just the beginning.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.830
You see, this black hole is
spinning, spinning rapidly.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.610
We've clocked black holes at
about a million miles an hour.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.670
And if you look at
Einstein's equations

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.800
and have a spinning black hole,
they don't collapse to a dot.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.060
They collapse to a ring,
a ring of neutrons.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.910
So it's that centrifugal force
prevents it from collapsing.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.100
It's stable.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.270
If you were to fall through
the north pole of the ring,

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.350
you wind up, mathematically,
on a parallel universe.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.440
And if you go a second
time, you wind up

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.780
on another parallel universe.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.270
And you keep on going
through the ring.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.430
It's like going through
an apartment building,

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.040
hitting the elevator, each
floor being another universe.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.500
And we want to
know is that real,

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.490
or is it just a mathematical
fiction, a unicorn,

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.670
in other words, a
wormhole at the center

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.460
of a spinning black hole.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.080
And that's what we want to
do with the next generation

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.340
of radio telescope technology.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.090
TAYLOR WILSON: OK.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.930
That's fascinating.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.400
So this idea that black holes,
40, 50 years ago were something

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.950
that we might have had
theoretical evidence

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.110
of or even indirect
observational

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.640
evidence of, but now we have
that real, first, true, direct

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.050
observational evidence of.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.990
So what you're saying
is maybe what's next--

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.427
what could those other
possibilities be for objects

00:03:09.427 --> 00:03:10.510
that we have not yet seen.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.302
MICHIO KAKU: Right.

00:03:11.302 --> 00:03:14.980
In other words, a black hole
is a cosmic roach motel.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.730
Everything checks in,
nothing checks out.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.160
But then the question
is, where does it go?

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.970
Where does all that stuff go
if it falls into a black hole?

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.880
Some theorists have
stated that maybe it's

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.300
blown out the other
end as a white hole.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.350
So maybe there's a white hole on
the other side of a black hole

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.287
such that it spews out matter.

00:03:37.287 --> 00:03:38.120
TAYLOR WILSON: Yeah.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.980
MICHIO KAKU: Now doesn't
that sound like the big bang?

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.340
Some people even think
that maybe our universe

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.240
is a white hole and
that we are connected

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.205
with an umbilical cord
to another universe.

00:03:52.205 --> 00:03:53.330
TAYLOR WILSON: Fascinating.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.270
MICHIO KAKU: This is
the multiverse idea

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.550
which is now gaining
a tremendous amount

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.830
of theoretical credibility.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.772
Though, of course, we have not
yet proven this theory at all.

00:04:02.772 --> 00:04:04.480
TAYLOR WILSON: Well,
that's a good segue,

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.622
talking about multiverses
and into something

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:09.580
that you're quite familiar
with, string theory.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.997
So maybe you want
to tell everyone

00:04:10.997 --> 00:04:14.350
kind of your background and
how you ended up in physics.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.387
You're from this area
originally, correct?

00:04:16.387 --> 00:04:17.470
MICHIO KAKU: That's right.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.829
I'm a local kid.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.680
I was born in San Jose.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.880
I grew up in Palo
Alto, went to school,

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.100
up to high school in Palo Alto.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.620
But when I was eight
years old, when

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.750
I was eight years old
something happened

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.630
which changed my whole destiny.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.570
And that is in the
newspapers they

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.370
announced that a great
scientist had just died.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.850
And they put a picture of
his desk on the front page.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.790
And the caption said this
is the unfinished manuscript

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.330
from the greatest
scientist of our time.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.810
And I thought to myself,
why couldn't he finish it?

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.200
What's so hard that a
great scientist could not

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.590
finish this theory?

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.290
It's a homework problem, right?

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.300
Why didn't he ask his mother?

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.460
What could be so hard?

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.090
So I went to the library.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.150
I found that this man's
name was Albert Einstein.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.270
And that book, that
book on the desk

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.440
was the unfinished
theory of everything.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.290
He wanted an equation
one inch long

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.360
that would allow him to
quote, "read the mind of God."

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.790
So I said to myself, wow.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:35.457
That's for me.

00:05:35.457 --> 00:05:36.290
TAYLOR WILSON: Yeah.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.082
MICHIO KAKU: That's
what I want to work on.

00:05:38.082 --> 00:05:42.170
I want to help finish this great
theory that Einstein could not

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.860
finish.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.350
Well, today, we
think we have it.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:46.940
It's called string theory.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.400
It has not yet been tested.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.660
But we think that this
could be the final unicorn,

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.170
the final theory of everything.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.350
So that every
neutron, every proton,

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.740
every electron is nothing
but tiny vibrations

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.420
on a tiny string.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.950
This is an electron.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.240
That's a quark.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.950
This is a neutrino.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.620
Nothing but musical
notes on a string.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.860
Physics, therefore,
is the harmonies

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.960
you can write on a string.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.300
Chemistry is the melodies you
can play on vibrating strings.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.300
The universe is a
symphony of strings.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.590
And then the mind of
God, the mind of God

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.490
that Einstein wrote about for
the last 30 years of his life,

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:41.970
the mind of God is cosmic
music resonating through 11

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.322
dimensional hyperspace.

00:06:43.322 --> 00:06:44.280
TAYLOR WILSON: Amazing.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.440
MICHIO KAKU: That
is the mind of God.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.260
TAYLOR WILSON: So this idea,
this grand unified theory

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.650
that's based on
string theory, is

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.197
something you've spent your
entire career working on?

00:06:55.197 --> 00:06:56.280
MICHIO KAKU: That's right.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.710
We want that equation
one inch long.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.130
Now for strings, not membranes,
but just for strings,

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.047
we have that equation.

00:07:03.047 --> 00:07:03.838
TAYLOR WILSON: Yes.

00:07:03.838 --> 00:07:05.250
MICHIO KAKU: That's my equation.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.590
I'm the co-founder of
string field theory, which

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.950
allows you to summarize
this vast body of knowledge

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.990
into an equation one inch long.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.350
But today we have
membranes, M-theory, which

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:18.280
makes things more complicated.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.960
So it's unfinished.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.920
So if one of you in the
audience ever figures out

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.840
the final theory, be
sure to tell me first.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.460
We'll split the
Nobel Prize together.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.530
TAYLOR WILSON: Now that's
not a bad deal for you.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:35.920
That's really interesting.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.490
So this is the idea of taking
the physics [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:42.390
large, like, the laws
that govern gravitation

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:45.600
and the like, and unifying
it with the theories that

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.500
govern the very small
and the very hot,

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.780
the quantum rules
of the universe.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.780
So your idea is
that the best way

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.997
to solve this problem is
through string theory?

00:07:53.997 --> 00:07:55.080
MICHIO KAKU: That's right.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.200
Nature has a left
hand and a right hand.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.200
The left hand, as you said, is
the theory of the very big--

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.950
black holes, the big bang,
Einstein's theory of gravity.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:08.820
But the other hand of God
is the quantum theory,

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.500
the theory of the very small.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.310
So why should we have
two hands that don't

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.230
coordinate with each other.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.647
And that's why we do believe
that there is a final theory.

00:08:18.647 --> 00:08:19.438
TAYLOR WILSON: Yes.

00:08:19.438 --> 00:08:21.360
MICHIO KAKU: And we're
going to test it.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.650
The Large Hadron Collider has
given us the Higgs Boson, given

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.540
us the so-called God particle.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.740
But now, we're going to build
a successor to the Large Hadron

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:32.789
Collider.

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:36.299
The Japanese, with the
International Linear Collider,

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:38.880
the Chinese with the
Circular Collider,

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.350
and the European Union--

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:46.140
three ventures have been
proposed for the successor

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.790
of the Large Hadron Collider.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:51.120
But unfortunately, not
from the United States.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.807
We're left in the
dust once again.

00:08:52.807 --> 00:08:53.640
TAYLOR WILSON: Yeah.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.440
But that's the
way to really test

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.660
the theory is to build
a very large collider,

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.420
collide the particles,
and see what comes out.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.380
MICHIO KAKU: Our super collider
was canceled in the 1990s

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.080
to be built outside
Dallas, Texas.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.140
One reason why it was canceled
is because a congressman asked

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.640
a physicist on the last
days of hearing quote,

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.630
"Will we find God
with your machine?

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.580
If so, I will change my vote."

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.200
Well, the physicists
didn't know what to say.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.100
$10 billion to find God--

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.730
so he said, we're going
to find the Higgs boson.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:36.510
Well, all the jaws hit the floor
in the United States Congress.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:41.760
$10 billion for another
goddamn subatomic particle.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.980
They took the vote,
and it was canceled.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.040
Since then we physicists
had to ask ourselves,

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.448
how would we answer
that question?

00:09:50.448 --> 00:09:51.240
TAYLOR WILSON: Yes.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.657
MICHIO KAKU: The
next time someone

00:09:52.657 --> 00:09:56.010
asks us will we find
God with your machine,

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.493
how will we answer it?

00:09:57.493 --> 00:09:58.410
TAYLOR WILSON: Mm-hmm.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.800
MICHIO KAKU: I would have
answered it differently.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:07.320
I would have said God, by
whatever signs or symbols you

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.240
ascribe to the deity, this
machine, the Super Collider

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.890
will take us as close as
humanly possible to his greatest

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.010
creation, genesis.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.890
This is a genesis machine.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.910
It will recreate, on a small
scale, the most incredible

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:32.040
event in the history of
the universe, its birth.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.890
Unfortunately, we
said Higgs boson.

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:36.378
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:36.378 --> 00:10:37.670
TAYLOR WILSON: Not as exciting.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:38.813
MICHIO KAKU: Wrong answer.

00:10:38.813 --> 00:10:39.980
TAYLOR WILSON: Wrong answer.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.257
And you have a little personal
experience with colliders.

00:10:43.257 --> 00:10:45.590
Maybe you want to talk a
little bit about what you built

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:46.940
when you were in high school?

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:47.690
MICHIO KAKU: Yeah.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:51.800
Well, just like you, when I
was a junior in Cubberley High

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.800
School, which is just
about two miles from here,

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.790
I decided to build a particle
accelerator, an atom smasher,

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.190
in my mom's garage.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:03.410
So I went to my mom,
and I said, mom,

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.800
can I have permission
to build a 2.3 million

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.190
electron volt betatron electron
accelerator in the garage?

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:16.470
And she kind of looked
at me and said, sure.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:17.360
TAYLOR WILSON: Yeah.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.580
MICHIO KAKU: Why not?

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.350
And don't forget to
take out the garbage.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:21.740
TAYLOR WILSON: Yeah.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.630
MICHIO KAKU: So I
went to Westinghouse.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.285
I got 400 pounds of
transformer steel.

00:11:26.285 --> 00:11:29.810
I went to Varian, got
22 miles of copper wire.

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.090
And on the football
field over Christmas,

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.478
we [INAUDIBLE] 22
miles of copper wire.

00:11:34.478 --> 00:11:35.270
TAYLOR WILSON: Wow.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.150
MICHIO KAKU: It
finally was finished.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.580
It consumed six
kilowatts of power.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.467
I would plug it in,
I closed my ears.

00:11:43.467 --> 00:11:44.300
TAYLOR WILSON: Yeah.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.175
MICHIO KAKU: And I heard
this crackling sound

00:11:46.175 --> 00:11:49.280
as all this energy surged
in the capacitor bank.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.560
And then I heard this
pop, pop, pop sound

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.960
as I blew out all the
fuses in my mom's house.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.103
TAYLOR WILSON: Yeah.

00:11:56.103 --> 00:11:58.520
MICHIO KAKU: The whole house
would be plunged in darkness.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:03.190
And my poor mom, she must have
said to herself, why couldn't I

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:07.330
have a son who plays basketball?

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.750
Maybe if I buy him a football?

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.620
And for God's sake,
why can't he find

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.590
a nice Japanese girlfriend?

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:17.725
Why does he build these
machines in the garage?

00:12:17.725 --> 00:12:19.850
TAYLOR WILSON: I think our
parents would get along.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:23.590
I think they have similar
opinions about these things.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:25.040
So that's really exciting.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.640
So that was something
you did in high school.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.420
And then you went on to college
to study theoretical physics

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.100
and develop string theory.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.440
And now I guess you spend
a lot of time thinking

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.710
about the future and what all
this science and technology

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:42.250
means for our species
and our evolution.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.020
That leads me into
kind of a segue

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.900
away from basic
theoretical physics, which

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.497
is the topic of the brain.

00:12:48.497 --> 00:12:50.080
It's something I
think a lot of people

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:54.100
are interested in, knowing what
is the nature of consciousness,

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.610
and this thing inside our
head that controls our lives.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.390
But it's something we know
very little about today.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.920
I know you've
spent a lot of time

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:07.420
thinking and writing about the
brain and human consciousness.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.560
I was recently in
China with what

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.250
China calls the father
of quantum Pan Jianwei.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:19.150
And he was talking about this
idea of quantum consciousness

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:22.120
or the quantum mechanics
that underlie consciousness.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:27.520
So I give you that
question, for your thoughts.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.460
What are kind of the quantum
mechanical possibilities

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:34.910
that underlie the functioning
of the brain and consciousness?

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:37.690
MICHIO KAKU: Well, the
two greatest mysteries

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:42.040
in all of science, in all
of science, the two greatest

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:46.540
mysteries are one, what
happened before creation?

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.460
Why did we have a big bang?

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.330
What banged?

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.880
Are there other
universes, a multiverse,

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.410
before the Big Bang?

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:54.700
That's outer space.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.178
Then the second
mystery is inner space.

00:13:57.178 --> 00:13:57.970
TAYLOR WILSON: Yes.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:01.540
MICHIO KAKU: What goes
on behind your eyeballs?

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:07.780
We have 100 billion neurons in
your brain, as many as stars

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.030
in the Milky Way galaxy.

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:14.450
Each neuron is connected
to 10,000 other neurons.

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:16.300
And so what is the brain?

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.820
We made a mistake 50 years ago.

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.430
And we're still paying
the price for it today.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.820
50 years ago, we
made a huge mistake.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:31.140
We thought the brain was a
computer, a digital computer.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.650
But you see, the brain
has no operating system.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:36.570
It has no programming.

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:38.220
It has no windows.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.230
It has no CPU.

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:42.220
It has no Pentium chip.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.220
It has no subroutines.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:49.470
The brain doesn't have
anything resembling the brain

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:51.780
except neural activity.

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:55.810
50 years later, after
this wild goose chase,

00:14:55.810 --> 00:15:01.440
we now understand that the
brain is a pattern seeking

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.440
neural network, a
learning machine,

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.880
and it learns and rewires every
time it learns something new.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:13.170
For example, your laptop
today is just as stupid

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:15.030
as it was yesterday.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:18.240
Your laptop never
learns anything,

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.800
except now we have
deep learning.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.480
But our brain constantly
rewires itself.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:29.280
And that process can be
recreated with MRI machines.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.295
With physics, we can look at
the blood flow in the brain

00:15:32.295 --> 00:15:36.540
now and actually see thoughts
as they move in the brain--

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:37.530
amazing.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:40.950
We can actually test
Freudian theory.

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:43.710
We can actually test
old wives tales.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:46.590
For example, there's
an old wives tale

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:50.460
that everyone believes but
no one could prove until now.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.830
That when a man talks
to a pretty girl,

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.010
he starts to act stupid.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:54.760
TAYLOR WILSON: Hm.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:55.937
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:55.937 --> 00:15:57.520
MICHIO KAKU: Now
everyone believes it.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.312
TAYLOR WILSON: Yes.

00:15:58.312 --> 00:16:00.690
MICHIO KAKU: But
we now know why.

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:02.550
When a man talks
to a pretty girl,

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:05.820
blood drains from the
prefrontal cortex,

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.420
and they start to act
mentally retarded.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.348
Absolutely truem we can
quantify this effect now.

00:16:12.348 --> 00:16:13.140
TAYLOR WILSON: Yes.

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.640
MICHIO KAKU: We can
actually measure

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.870
this dropping of blood in
the prefrontal cortex because

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.610
of MRI machines.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:22.800
We can now extract images.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.220
Images can be extracted from
the living brain with an MRI

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.460
machine.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:31.670
Meaning that art, design
will be revolutionized.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.650
Artists of the future
will simply think,

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:40.380
think of a conception, and we'll
print it out on a 3D printer.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.380
Designers of
buildings, architects,

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:47.160
will dream of their
creation, and a 3D printer

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.450
will then print it out.

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:52.770
And when you go to
sleep, the MRI machine

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:58.470
keeps on plugging away and
will print out your dream.

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:01.920
In the future, when you
wake up in the morning,

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:06.089
you may push a button and see
the videotape of the dream

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:08.280
you had the previous night.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.094
Just don't tell your
wife or husband.

00:17:10.094 --> 00:17:12.047
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:12.047 --> 00:17:13.589
MICHIO KAKU: So
these are things that

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:16.859
were considered science
fiction, but now we

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:19.260
can put these on the internet.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:24.420
The future of the
internet is brain net.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.210
Instead of sending
digital signals,

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:32.620
we'll send emotions, memories,
feelings on the internet.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.970
The first memories were
recorded about three years ago

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:39.660
at Wake Forest University,
also in Los Angeles.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.780
Memories from animals
can now be recorded.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.630
Next will be
memories in monkeys.

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:47.370
We're doing that today.

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:50.430
Next is Alzheimer's patients--

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:54.180
Alzheimer's patients will
push a button and memories,

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:58.090
memories will come
flooding into their mind.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:01.020
And after that, who knows?

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.140
Maybe we'll be able
to upload calculus

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:09.780
or learned disciplines
inside our mind.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.940
And by the way, let me
ask you guys a question.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.740
Let me ask you guys a question.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:18.690
One day we may be able
to upload reality itself,

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:20.790
just like in the
movie, "The Matrix."

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:21.570
Right?

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:25.170
How many of you early,
late at night, just

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:28.260
before you go to sleep,
how many of you have ever

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.910
had that weird feeling,
that strange feeling

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:37.740
that maybe life is an illusion?

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:41.490
Maybe everything has been
uploaded into your mind.

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:45.690
Maybe you're the only real
thing and life is an illusion.

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:46.650
Raise your hand.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:49.140
Raise your hand if you've
ever had that feeling.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.070
Oh, my God.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.440
You're all crazy.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.560
We have so many crazy
people in this audience.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.290
How can you be the only
person in the world

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:01.110
when I'm the only
person in the world?

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.890
I'm just dreaming
I'm here at Google.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:05.902
I'm just dreaming.

00:19:05.902 --> 00:19:07.610
I'm in New York right
now, you know that?

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:08.040
TAYLOR WILSON: Yeah.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.900
MICHIO KAKU: I'm just about
to go to sleep in New York.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:10.567
I mean, come on.

00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:13.050
Give me a break.

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:16.020
TAYLOR WILSON: But this
is this idea of humanity

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.740
and our brains
interfacing with machines

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.380
and that being kind of a
future step in our evolution

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:22.280
as a species.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.290
I think that's a very
interesting topic

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:25.120
to think about.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.160
What are the implications
of that, both positive,

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.830
talking about being able to
learn things at a fast rate

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:33.790
or download memories,
but potentially

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.800
the negative
consequences of that.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.440
We can definitely see, with
digital architecture today,

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.190
the problems that we face.

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.680
So imagine if we're a
part of that architecture.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.020
MICHIO KAKU: Well, there's
good news and bad news.

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:50.150
The good news is that
information will be everywhere

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.580
and nowhere almost for free.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.490
The internet might be
in your contact lens.

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:58.460
You'll simply blink,
blink and then

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.820
the internet will appear
inside your contact lens

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.970
and who were the first people
to buy internet contact

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:08.820
lenses college students
taking final examinations.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.730
[CHEERING]

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:16.020
College students will blink and
see all the answers to my exam

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.790
right there in
their contact lens.

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.340
This could be really helpful.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:23.310
Your contact lens will
recognize people's faces

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:25.950
and tell you what
their background is

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:30.210
and translate Chinese
into German into English.

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.430
So let's say you're
at a cocktail party.

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:35.850
And there's some very important
people at that cocktail party,

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:38.670
but you don't know who they are.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:42.750
In the future, you will know
exactly who to suck up to

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:46.320
at any cocktail party.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.580
On a blind date, if your blind
date says that he's rich,

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.220
he's single, he's loaded.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.850
But your contact lens says that
no, he's three times divorced,

00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:01.730
pays child support
payments, and is a loser,

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:03.550
it could be very useful.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:04.680
Now that's the good news.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:05.160
TAYLOR WILSON: Yeah.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.035
MICHIO KAKU: The bad
news, though, the future

00:21:07.035 --> 00:21:08.650
does have bad news.

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:12.655
The bad news is that in the
future, we will have lawyers.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:15.920
TAYLOR WILSON: That's a given.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:20.050
MICHIO KAKU: That's because only
a human can argue to a jury.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.780
Only a human can
argue to a judge.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.520
Robots can't do that.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:28.490
Robots cannot understand
ethics or morals.

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:31.480
And so yeah, to people
involved in person

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:35.940
to person relationships, like
lawyers, professors, mentors,

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.877
we will have jobs in the future.

00:21:37.877 --> 00:21:38.710
TAYLOR WILSON: Yeah.

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:42.520
But the more monotonous tasks
will probably be going away.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.270
MICHIO KAKU: What?

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:44.530
TAYLOR WILSON: The
more monotonous tasks

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:45.940
will probably be going away.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.130
MICHIO KAKU: Well,
dull dirty, dangerous--

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:48.430
TAYLOR WILSON: Yes.

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:49.680
MICHIO KAKU: --the three D's--

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.770
dull jobs dirty,
dangerous repetitive jobs,

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:56.350
jobs that involve
danger, those jobs

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:58.573
will be done by
robots in the future.

00:21:58.573 --> 00:22:00.240
TAYLOR WILSON: Well,
that's interesting.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:00.490
OK.

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:02.240
We've talked a little
bit about the brain.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.560
We've talked a little bit
about artificial intelligence.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.310
I wanted to ask your
thoughts on something

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:09.610
I think that is near and
dear to both of our hearts,

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:14.410
which is space exploration and
where we're going beyond Earth.

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:17.020
You've written a lot about
this subject about missions

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.990
to Mars and the
planets and beyond.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:21.730
What are some of the
most exciting things

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:24.460
you can imagine seeing
in our lifetimes and then

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.860
maybe even beyond that?

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.810
MICHIO KAKU: Well, the
fundamental problem

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:31.990
with space travel has
been a four letter word--

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:38.290
cost, C-O-S-T. It cost $10,000
to put a pound of anything

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.850
in orbit around the Earth.

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:41.670
That's your weight in gold.

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:42.720
Your weight in gold.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:47.350
That's how expensive space
travel is until recently.

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:50.680
Prices are dropping
like a rock now.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.200
For example, how many
people here in this room

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.420
have seen the movie "The
Martian" with Matt Damon.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:57.980
Raise your hand.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:58.660
Wow.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:03.550
That movie cost $100
million dollars.

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:10.060
But the Indians sent a probe
to Mars for $70 million.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.310
going to Mars costs--

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:15.450
a Hollywood movie
about going to Mars

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:18.640
costs more than
actually going to Mars.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:23.680
That's how much space
travel has dropped.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.950
And when you drive a car
and you commute to work,

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:30.040
do you junk your
car after one ride.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.880
No, cars would be expensive if
you junked it after one ride.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.458
But that's what
we do for rockets.

00:23:35.458 --> 00:23:36.250
TAYLOR WILSON: Yes.

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:39.610
MICHIO KAKU: We junk
rockets after just one use.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:40.750
We junk them.

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:43.350
All that's changing
with reusable rockets,

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:45.580
with Silicon Valley
billionaires now

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:48.130
fulfilling their
dream of creating

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:50.560
fantastic devices in space.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:55.480
We're entering the second
golden era of space exploration.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.480
I wouldn't be surprised
if some of your grandkids

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.450
honeymoon on the moon.

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:03.498
I think the moon is
only three days away.

00:24:03.498 --> 00:24:04.290
TAYLOR WILSON: Yes.

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:04.930
A short trip.

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:06.490
MICHIO KAKU: As
costs go down, yeah,

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:08.950
I think our grandkids may
honeymoon on the moon.

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:11.020
It's a great weekend location.

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:15.763
Not great scenery, but well,
if you like craters and dust.

00:24:15.763 --> 00:24:16.930
TAYLOR WILSON: That's great.

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:21.970
And we were talking backstage,
one of the interesting things

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:24.640
that come out of a grand
unified theory in string theory

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.420
is the explanation of
what happens at these very

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.040
extreme conditions
where you have

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.950
incredible amounts of energy,
incredible amounts of heat

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:34.490
in a limited space.

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:36.160
And we were talking
about could this

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.970
be a way to travel
vast distances that we

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:41.470
can't travel today.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.987
Maybe you could speak
a little bit to that.

00:24:43.987 --> 00:24:45.820
MICHIO KAKU: Well, many
people want to know,

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:49.750
like in "Star Trek", can
you break the light barrier?

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:52.480
Can you go faster than
the speed of light?

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:56.590
Well, it was Einstein
himself in 1935

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:59.680
that opened the door
to faster than light

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.400
travel when he
introduced the wormhole.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:07.270
That was the first paper
written about wormholes.

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:11.440
The first book about wormholes
was written in the 1800s

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.280
by Charles Dodgson,
Oxford mathematician who

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:19.750
wrote a children's book,
"Alice in Wonderland."

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:22.030
Now this Oxford
mathematician could not

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:24.340
write under his name,
Charles Dodgson.

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:25.930
It was a children's book.

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:29.650
So he wrote under a pen
name, Lewis Carroll.

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:33.070
But the looking glass
is the wormhole.

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:35.800
You put your hand through
the looking glass,

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:39.850
and you wind up on a
different space and time.

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:43.690
So we think that, yes, that
would be a way to go faster

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:45.770
than the speed of light.

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:47.480
Now, what's the catch?

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.550
There's always a
catch some place.

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:53.290
First of all, the energy
necessary to punch

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:57.820
a hole in space and time
is that of a black hole.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.030
You're talking about
fantastic amounts of energy.

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.370
Second, you have
to stabilize it.

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:05.470
That means negative energy.

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:08.500
Positive energy to open
the gateway, and then

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.185
negative energy to prevent
it from collapsing,

00:26:11.185 --> 00:26:13.560
in other words, stability.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.760
And this has not
yet been worked out.

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:20.670
It would take a very advanced
civilization to do this.

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:25.460
Now I'm on radio and I
broadcast every week.

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.890
And some people call
me on the telephone.

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:31.370
And they say professor,
you're wrong.

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:32.810
You're totally wrong.

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:36.620
The aliens aren't there in
outer space with warp drive.

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:40.160
The aliens are
here on the Earth.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.620
And then I ask them,
how do you know?

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:44.960
And they say, well,
they've been kidnapped,

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.670
kidnapped by flying saucers.

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:48.770
They know that
they're out there.

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:50.750
Well I have a word of advice.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:56.180
The next time you are kidnapped
by a flying saucer, for God's

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.545
sake, steal something.

00:26:57.545 --> 00:26:59.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:03.252
There's no law against stealing
from an extraterrestrial

00:27:03.252 --> 00:27:03.835
civilization--

00:27:03.835 --> 00:27:05.210
TAYLOR WILSON:
That's true, yeah.

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:06.890
MICHIO KAKU: --no
law whatsoever.

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:12.750
An alien ship, an alien hammer,
an alien paperclip, anything

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:16.453
so that you have bragging rights
about going into outer space.

00:27:16.453 --> 00:27:17.870
TAYLOR WILSON:
That's good advice.

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:19.170
It's good advice.

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:19.670
All right.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:22.490
I guess we can start
opening it up to questions.

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:26.150
If you want to make your way
to the mic, start to line up.

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:29.350
We'll try to do our best to
answer the questions that you

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.850
have.

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:32.310
So over here, you
were the first.

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:33.320
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.510
Dr. Kaku, thank you so
much for coming out.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:36.620
I'm really inspired.

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:41.000
I wanted to hear some of your
thoughts on ethical development

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.210
and how we might be able to
help machines uphold ethics

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:45.895
in our society.

00:27:45.895 --> 00:27:47.270
MICHIO KAKU: What
was that again?

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:50.630
TAYLOR WILSON: Ethics and how we
help machines uphold the ethics

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:51.950
that we as a society hold.

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:54.000
Is that correct?

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.740
MICHIO KAKU: Well,
several things--

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.920
first of all, we
have to make sure

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:05.100
that this technology is used by
the largest numbers of people.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:08.610
But you see when technology
first becomes available,

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:10.370
it's always for the rich.

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:14.510
When the telephone first
came out over 100 years ago,

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:16.790
who had personal telephones?

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:18.230
It was rich people.

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:21.920
But eventually, we have things
like Moore's law, computer

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.240
power doubling every 18 months.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:28.190
And so with time, the cost
of telephone goes down.

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:32.240
We once thought there was going
to be a digital divide when

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:37.910
rich people would have laptops,
poor people would have nothing.

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:39.890
But now we know
that most children

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:42.260
are the first to be wired up.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.930
Because if a child is
not on the internet,

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:47.640
they don't exist
on the internet.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.850
But there's also
another ethical problem

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:52.190
for the next coming decades.

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:56.990
Some people wonder, when robots
become smarter and smarter,

00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:00.100
are they going to have
a civil rights movement?

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.050
Maybe-- because in
the future, robots

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:07.060
may be programmed to feel pain.

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:10.880
Today, we feel pain
because it's good for us.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:15.700
Otherwise, we lose our fingers,
our fingers get burned, cut up.

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.790
Pain is good, because
it prevents us

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:21.280
from destroying ourselves.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:24.900
Eventually, robots
may have to feel pain.

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:28.180
Otherwise, we will tell
them to jump off a cliff,

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.080
and they'll destroy themselves.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.540
They have to feel pain.

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:34.070
At that point, it
has to be regulated.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:37.120
So we may have a robots
civil rights movement

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:41.170
to limit the amount of
pain that a master can

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:44.350
impose upon their robot.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:47.080
Now that of course is
many, many decades away.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.210
But eventually,
robots may also be

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:53.020
part of our ethical
understanding of technology

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:56.320
when they feel pain.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.490
TAYLOR WILSON: Interesting.

00:29:57.490 --> 00:29:59.260
All right over here.

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.390
MICHIO KAKU: Dr. Kaku, one
of my earliest memories

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:04.270
is of watching the
Discovery Channel

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:06.260
and seeing you on there.

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:07.900
Thank you for the
role that you played

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.880
in shaping that part of my
early childhood experience.

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.930
MICHIO KAKU: Thank you.

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:12.820
AUDIENCE: And related
to that, I wanted

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.790
to hear what you are
excited about when it comes

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:19.060
to expanding the scale and
accessibility of science

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:20.350
communication into the future.

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:27.180
MICHIO KAKU: Well, it used to be
that mass media would stay away

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:31.320
from science because, quote,
"Science doesn't sell."

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:35.480
so back in those days we
only had three networks

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:39.930
and science was invisible
for the most part.

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:42.240
And most people, when they
learned about science,

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.890
they learned about
science in school.

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:46.590
But there's a problem there.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:49.260
First of all, we're
all born scientists.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:52.620
When we're born, we want
to know why the sun shines.

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:54.430
We better know
where we came from.

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:58.350
But then we hit
the greatest killer

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:01.590
of scientists known to science.

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:05.550
The greatest destroyer of
scientists known to science

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:10.430
is junior high school.

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:13.310
When we hit junior high
school, it's all over.

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:17.240
We lose scientists by the
hundreds of thousands.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:17.960
Why?

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.530
Because science is made boring.

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:22.250
It's made repetitive.

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:25.880
You have to learn to
name things rather than

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:30.390
learning the great principles,
the great concepts of science.

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:32.970
And that's why more recently
we have the internet,

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:37.290
we have cable, which brings
science to an audience.

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:41.120
Now it turns out that about
a million people subscribe

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.640
to "Scientific American".

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.500
That's the hard core.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.500
These people will
seek out science even

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:52.160
when there's no science, about
a million people, the hardcore.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:55.310
But then there's another
5 to 10 million people

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:59.030
who will tune in
sometimes to Discovery,

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:01.400
Science Channel,
National Geographic,

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.460
if there's something really
interesting happening.

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:08.360
So we know that we can
reach 5 to 10 million people

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.340
on a good program.

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:13.790
And then with the discovery
of the black hole,

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:18.410
we can reach 100 million
people when we reach resonance,

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:21.240
we resonate with the
people of the world.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.890
So we need more people
to write books, more

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:28.250
people to be on television,
to do radio shows.

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:31.850
We need more people like
that, rather than less people,

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:38.420
to become role models for a
new scientific revolution.

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:39.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:43.450
TAYLOR WILSON: Definitely,
that's great advice.

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:43.950
All right.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:44.450
Up here?

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:46.183
AUDIENCE: Thanks sir.

00:32:46.183 --> 00:32:47.350
Thanks for coming out today.

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:51.130
I was wondering your thoughts on
NASA's recently announced plan

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:53.620
to return to the moon in 2024.

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:55.713
Do you think it's feasible?

00:32:55.713 --> 00:32:57.130
MICHIO KAKU: First
of all, I think

00:32:57.130 --> 00:33:02.440
we're going to have a traffic
jam around the moon very soon.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:07.180
First, NASA has the
SLS booster rocket.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:11.140
Next year, we'll
orbit around the moon.

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:16.450
Then we have Elon Musk of
SpaceX who's selling tickets--

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:19.030
tickets to the general public.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:20.410
He's been sold out.

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:24.100
A Japanese billionaire
bought out the entire tickets

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:27.460
for the Falcon Heavy
rocket that is also

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:30.910
fully capable of
going around the moon.

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:35.230
And then we have Jeff Bezos of
Amazon, formerly the richest

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:36.830
man in the world.

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:41.500
He has a whole spaceport,
the Blue Origins rocket

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:46.900
program to go to the moon with
the Neil Armstrong rocket.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:49.265
And then we have the Chinese.

00:33:49.265 --> 00:33:50.890
The Chinese have
announced that they're

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:54.550
going to plant the
Chinese flag on the moon.

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:57.700
So I think we're going to
have a traffic jam with three

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:02.740
American rockets, one Chinese,
and perhaps one European rocket

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.620
fully committed to
go back to the moon.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.960
And the question is, why?

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:11.050
Because costs have
been dropping.

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:13.520
Technology is catching up.

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.530
You realize that
your cell phone--

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:20.199
your cell phone has more
computer power than all of NASA

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:24.978
in 1969 when we put
two men on the moon.

00:34:24.978 --> 00:34:25.520
That's right.

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:28.330
Your cell phone today
has more computer power

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:29.920
than all of NASA.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.870
In fact, I think
it's criminal what

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:35.380
they were doing in 1969,
criminal sending humans

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:38.500
into space backed up
by one cell phone.

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.710
Would you go into outer space
knowing that your rocket is

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:44.120
backed up by one cell phone?

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.110
That's what we did in 1969.

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:47.656
I think it's criminal.

00:34:47.656 --> 00:34:49.239
So I think that we're
going to witness

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:53.050
a second golden era
of space exploration

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:57.930
as costs begin to drop,
not $10,000 a pound,

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:00.790
not even $1,000 a
pound, but eventually,

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:03.200
a few hundred dollars per pound.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.600
That's the goal.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:06.350
TAYLOR WILSON: Oh.

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:06.892
That's great.

00:35:06.892 --> 00:35:08.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:09.420
All right.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:11.280
Over here?

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.530
AUDIENCE: It's an honor to
be here with you, Dr. Kaku.

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:15.990
I have a question, a simple one.

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:20.673
Do you believe humans will
reach a Type 1 civilization?

00:35:20.673 --> 00:35:21.340
MICHIO KAKU: OK.

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:23.660
A type-- I'm a physicist.

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:29.630
We rank civilizations by two
things, energy and information.

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:34.720
That's how we rank anything,
energy, information.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.620
Energy of a planet
eventually reaches Type 1.

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:42.940
So that Earth becomes
planetary, we, for example,

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:44.980
can control the weather.

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:46.750
We can mine the oceans.

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:50.080
Type 2 is stellar,
where you then

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:55.030
begin to consume the power
of a star, like "Star Trek."

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:58.210
"Star Trek" would be
a Type 2 civilization

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:00.490
where they've colonized
a few solar systems,

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:01.660
but not much more.

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:08.200
Type 3 is galactic, a galactic
civilization like "Star Wars",

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.960
where you can roam the
galactic space lane.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.490
Now what are we?

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:16.540
Are we Type 1 that can mine the
ocean, play with the weather?

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:19.230
Are we Type 2 that
play with stars?

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:22.180
Are we Type 3 that
play with black holes?

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:25.680
No, we're Type 0.

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.050
We don't even rate
on this scale.

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:32.410
We get our energy from
dead plants, oil and coal.

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:36.900
So we have all the savagery
of a Type 0 civilization--

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:40.170
sectarianism, religious
hatred, racism,

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:42.660
all the garbage from the past.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:49.180
But by the year 2100,
in 100 years' time,

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:52.320
we will become Type 1.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.350
And that gives us
room for hope that we

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:58.500
will be a planetary
civilization by 2100.

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.350
For example, what
language will they speak?

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:04.440
Already the two
languages on the internet

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:08.760
are English and
Mandarin Chinese.

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.900
Look at the internet.

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:12.340
What is the internet?

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:15.750
The internet is the
first Type 1 technology

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:18.300
to arrive in this century.

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:21.360
That's what the internet
is-- the first Type 1

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.710
technology to arrive.

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:27.300
That we have the European
Union, Type 1 economy.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:33.840
We have the beginning of a Type
I sports, Olympics, soccer.

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.340
We have the beginning
of a Type 1 music,

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:39.990
rock and roll, rap music, yuck.

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:42.270
We have the beginning
of a Type 1 culture.

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:45.090
But it's not
guaranteed that we will

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:47.730
make the transition to Type 1.

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:51.270
Because we still have all the
savagery, all the backwardness,

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:53.280
of our ancient past.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:57.150
By the way, I once spoke in
London at the planetarium.

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:59.165
And a little boy comes up to me.

00:37:59.165 --> 00:38:04.050
The little boy says,
Professor, you're wrong.

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:04.830
You're wrong.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:07.200
There's Type 4.

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.340
And so I told him, look, kid.

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:10.860
Look, kid.

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:13.530
There are planets,
stars, and galaxies.

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:15.240
That's it, folks.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.760
Planets, stars, and galaxies.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.928
Therefore, we have
Type 1, Type 2, Type 3.

00:38:20.928 --> 00:38:22.470
And he said, Professor,
you're wrong.

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:24.300
There's Type 4.

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.660
I said what energy
is beyond galactic?

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:31.060
And he said the continuum.

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:35.280
Now who here is a Trekkie who
understands what I just said?

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.560
What is the only
Type 4 civilization

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.710
on network television?

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:44.110
The Q-- if you
did not understand

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:49.470
what just transpired,
get with the program.

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:51.460
The Q is extragalactic.

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:53.260
And what is that energy--

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:54.980
dark energy.

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.400
Dark energy is beyond galactic.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.590
That is the energy of a Type 4.

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:00.340
TAYLOR WILSON: Hm.

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:00.850
Interesting.

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:01.350
All right.

00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:04.120
We'll take one more
question over here.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.730
AUDIENCE: First off,
thank you for being here.

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:08.890
Second, thank you
for being somebody

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:11.980
else who had a question
about the Kardashev Scale.

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:14.620
So I had to kind of think
of something new that's

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:16.510
still in kind of the same vein.

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:20.110
So my question
would be how long do

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:23.778
you think it will be before
we actually really begin

00:39:23.778 --> 00:39:24.820
to register on the scale?

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:26.980
And what can each
of us as individuals

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:30.370
do to kind of do
our part in society

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:33.790
to push it that way before
we destroy ourselves

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:35.560
as a civilization?

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.510
MICHIO KAKU: Well,
on this question

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:42.190
I actually differ with
many other scientists.

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:46.120
Most scientists would say that
technology has no direction,

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.860
no moral direction.

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:50.830
Science is a sword,
a double-edged sword.

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:54.610
One side can cut against
disease, ignorance, poverty.

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:57.130
The other side can
cut against people.

00:39:57.130 --> 00:39:58.880
I disagree.

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.960
I think technology does
have a moral direction.

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:05.830
Because the internet
spreads information.

00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:08.650
Information gives
you empowerment.

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:11.350
Empowerment gives you democracy.

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:16.840
And democracies do not war
with other democracies.

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.030
Let's do a science experiment.

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:25.840
Write down every single war
you had to memorize as a child

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.290
since you were in grade
school, every single war.

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:32.620
Every war has been fought
between kings, emperors,

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:39.790
queens, dictators, but never
between two major democracies.

00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:44.050
And so I think we are entering
a new moral dimension where

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:47.440
technology is changing
the way humans

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.260
interact with other
humans so that we don't

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:53.680
tolerate dictatorships so much.

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:56.410
When I was young, in
our history class,

00:40:56.410 --> 00:41:00.940
we learned something
called dictator for life.

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:02.230
You had Russia.

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:03.670
You had the United States.

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:07.540
If you were a pawn of
Russia or a pawn of America,

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:09.350
you were there forever.

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:12.940
The only way to take you out
of power is through a coffin.

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:17.120
Dictator for life--
today, we laugh at that.

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.030
I mean, dictators for life--

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:20.920
I mean, come on, right?

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.040
We have the internet.

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.500
We have empowerment.

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.030
We have knowledge.

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:29.120
And so dictators are
endangered species now.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:32.830
So I think that technology
does have a moral direction.

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:36.130
I think it is liberating,
it is empowering,

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:39.010
and it is changing
world history.

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:40.870
A new chapter in
world history is

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:43.750
being written as
individuals make

00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:47.508
their mark on human history.

00:41:47.508 --> 00:41:48.550
TAYLOR WILSON: All right.

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:49.420
Well, thank you all.

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:50.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:51.520
That was great.

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.850
Thank you all for joining us.

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:57.940
It was a lot of fun to get
to talk to you about physics

00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:59.125
and the universe.

00:41:59.125 --> 00:42:01.000
And I think this is a
great audience for that

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.450
because you're all
involved in technology.

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:06.760
You're all involved in that
pursuit of taking us forward

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.260
as a civilization.

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:11.720
So I hope this inspired
some interesting questions

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:12.910
and ideas.

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:14.740
And hopefully,
you helped take us

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:18.510
towards that Type 1 civilization
that we so desperately need.

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:20.412
So thank you so much, Dr. Kaku.

00:42:20.412 --> 00:42:21.370
MICHIO KAKU: Thank you.

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:24.120
