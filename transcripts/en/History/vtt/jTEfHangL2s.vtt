00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:02.752
[music playing]

00:00:02.752 --> 00:00:04.462
I believe that this
nation should commit itself

00:00:04.462 --> 00:00:08.550
to achieving the goal before
this decade is out of landing

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.429
a man on the moon and returning
him safely to the Earth.

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.181
NARRATOR: Four months after
John F. Kennedy was sworn

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.308
into office, he
promised that the United

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:19.060
States would put
a man on the moon

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.730
before the end of the 1960s.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.482
And on July 20, 1969--

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:28.027
NEIL ARMSTRONG: That's
one small step for man,

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:32.282
one giant leap for mankind.

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:36.244
NARRATOR: But why was landing
a man on the moon so important?

00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:38.371
When Kennedy made that
promise, the United

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:42.459
States and the Soviet Union were
at the height of the Cold War.

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:44.919
A major front in
that war was space,

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:46.671
and putting a man on the moon?

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:49.466
That would be the
ultimate victory.

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:52.927
On October 4, 1957,
the Soviet Union

00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:56.181
had launched Sputnik, the
first artificial satellite

00:00:56.181 --> 00:01:00.059
and the first man-made
object to orbit the earth.

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.853
ANNOUNCER: Today, a
new moon is in the sky,

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:05.690
a 23-inch metal sphere placed
in orbit by a Russian rocket.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.235
NARRATOR: One month later,
they launched Sputnik 2.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.780
The American press speculated
that these launches

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.200
gave Russia a military
advantage in the Cold War.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.076
This marked the
beginning of what would

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:19.537
be known as the space race.

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:22.707
Feeling pressure, the United
States launched the Vanguard

00:01:22.707 --> 00:01:24.334
satellite in December.

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:26.002
And after its launch
rocket reached

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:29.881
the height of a few feet,
it burst into flames.

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:33.259
Despite the slow start,
by the end of 1958,

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.472
Congress passed, and President
Eisenhower signed, the 1958

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:40.809
Space Act, which created NASA.

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:45.772
Both the US and the USSR created
lunar exploration programs,

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:50.276
each successfully launching
moon flyby missions in 1959.

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:52.779
But Russia led the space race.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:57.033
In September 1959, Luna 2
became the first spacecraft

00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:59.494
to reach the moon's surface.

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:03.623
On April 12, 1961,
Yuri Gagarin became

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:06.334
the first human in space.

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:10.004
The US was in dire need of
a win in the space race,

00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:11.965
and it had to be something big.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:14.759
So President Kennedy asked
Vice President Lyndon B.

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:17.095
Johnson to look into
what the US could

00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:19.556
do to beat the Soviet Union.

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:21.766
Put a laboratory in space?

00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:23.935
Orbit a man around the moon?

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:25.895
Land a man on the moon?

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:28.606
NASA's administrator,
James E. Webb,

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:31.484
said there was no way to beat
the Soviets in building a space

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:33.653
station, and the
Soviets could probably

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:36.573
send a man into the moon's
orbit just as quickly.

00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:40.577
But maybe, just maybe, the
US could be the first to land

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:42.328
a man on the moon.

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:48.376
On May 25, 1961, JFK publicly
proposed that the US send a man

00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:50.753
to the moon and return
him safely to Earth

00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:52.463
before the end of the decade.

00:02:52.463 --> 00:02:54.257
The effort to land
a man on the moon

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:56.593
was christened the
Apollo program,

00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:59.554
and Kennedy predicted its
success would inspire people

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:02.765
worldwide to choose
American-style freedom

00:03:02.765 --> 00:03:05.226
over Soviet-allied tyranny.

00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:07.854
A few weeks later,
Kennedy, ever the diplomat,

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:10.481
met with Soviet premier
Nikita Khrushchev

00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:13.234
and suggested the moon
landing be a joint effort.

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:15.236
But Khrushchev said no.

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:17.822
The Soviets deny that they
were trying to reach the moon,

00:03:17.822 --> 00:03:19.240
but they were.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.576
They built a moon suit
prototype and designed

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:24.996
a lunar module much like
their American counterparts.

00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:27.790
Even though the Apollo program
was launched in the spirit

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.959
of competition, there
were multiple efforts

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.338
to diffuse the space race
for diplomatic reasons.

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:36.424
In September of
1963, Kennedy even

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:40.386
suggested that the US and Soviet
Union could still work together

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:44.432
on project Apollo, but any
prospect of cooperation

00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:48.144
ended when he was
assassinated two months later.

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:51.439
Apollo became a memorial
to the fallen president,

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.942
and the space race continued.

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:56.235
Many firsts went to the Soviets.

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:59.072
The USSR achieved the
first long duration

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:02.283
spaceflight, the first
multi-person spaceflight,

00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:04.202
and the first spacewalk.

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:08.247
In 1966, Russia pulled off the
first soft landing on the moon

00:04:08.247 --> 00:04:12.835
with Luna 9, but they still
hadn't put a man on the moon.

00:04:12.835 --> 00:04:16.381
On July 20, 1969,
the United States

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:20.510
did, only five months before
the deadline Kennedy had set

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.387
at the beginning of the decade.

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:26.015
On that day, the Apollo 11
mission landed two men--

00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:28.184
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin--

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:29.811
on the moon.

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:31.980
They walked on the moon's
surface for over two hours,

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.774
and were then brought
safely back to Earth.

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:37.402
The US had finally
accomplished something

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:41.739
big the Soviets had not, and
set the stage for the future

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:44.492
of space exploration.
