CLIFF LUNGARETTI: My
name is Cliff Lungaretti.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.614
I will be your host today.

00:00:05.614 --> 00:00:07.280
I'm part of the Talks
at Google program.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.321
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:10.290
And Pat, let's
jump right into it.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.200
We've seen the effect you've
had on the world in the past 12

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.210
months.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.860
So, how did this all start?

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.450
How did you get diagnosed?

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.270
What was your first symptom?

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.290
PAT QUINN: I'm a young
man, so it was a long road

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.930
to a diagnosis for me.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.690
I always start with-- it goes
back to the summer of 2013.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.370
Actually, I'm sorry,
summer of 2011.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.910
And we were playing in a
softball tournament all day.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.300
I always like to say we won
the softball tournament.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.570
It was good day.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.220
And the next morning I
woke up and my left arm,

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.550
it was twitching.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.550
So in my head, it
was a long day,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.320
and there was a lot of fatigue.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.200
So I just didn't think twice.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.730
And a few weeks later, now my
left arm was still switching,

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.170
and I had a little
movement in my right.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.440
So I figured, there's
a problem here.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.680
Something's going on that
wasn't related to the softball

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.290
tournament.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.600
So like any kid whose mother
was a nurse, I went to my mom.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.400
And she freaks out.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.950
So even when nothing
really was wrong,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.490
the nurse instinct kicked in.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.890
We went right so a
local neurologist,

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.850
who could only really
think, eh, it's a twitch.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.690
It's benign fasciculation,
which is just

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.000
a big word for twitching.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.680
And we went back two weeks
later because, hey, listen,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.620
these twitches haven't stopped.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.190
So you got to figure
something else out.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.420
We got to do more tests.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.790
And the way he saw it was,
I was way too young to have

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.770
a neurological disease.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.360
But thankfully, he
wouldn't just let me go.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.400
He decided, you know what,
this might be a bigger case

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.530
than I can handle, and
sent me to the Hospital

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.750
for Special Surgery
down here in Manhattan,

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.120
to see his-- the
doctor who taught him.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.170
So by the time we got down
there, you're a little nervous,

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.480
but not-- not too much.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.000
I mean, I'm lucky in one
regard-- my progression is

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.380
a little slow.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.280
And because of that, my
diagnosis took a long time.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.960
But that was also very tough,
because for a long time

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.770
you don't know what's
wrong with you.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.255
And you're just going
to doctor appointment

00:02:39.255 --> 00:02:41.710
after doctor appointment.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.407
And we get these
big-time doctors.

00:02:44.407 --> 00:02:46.240
They pretty much wring
you through the mill.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.350
At first it's blood
tests-- negative.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.990
You go for MRIs and CAT scans.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.210
There's nothing popping up.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.970
And then we have to go further.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.030
So the next step is a spinal
tap, which I hope none of you

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.920
ever have to do, because
the headache the next day

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.840
was brutal.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.470
But, again, negative.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.760
Nothing happened.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.660
And there's a million
other tests I went through.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.760
It all led to eventually
trying a muscle neurobiopsy.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.600
So I had to get a surgery.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.930
I went under, and,
again, negative.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.800
There nothing-- there's nothing
wrong with you, almost right?

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:38.620
But I was still getting weaker,
and nothing was confirmed yet.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.000
So as this time passed-- it was
about a two-year time frame--

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.970
the last hope is
we were hoping it

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:54.060
was a case of multifocal
motor neuropathy, which

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.660
is a case of something
that mimics ALS,

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.180
but there is a treatment.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.090
And the treatment is called
IVIG, and what you do is,

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.930
I went in the hospital
a week straight,

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.170
and they just pumped me full
of stuff for eight hours a day.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.440
And before you know it,
you're just zonked out.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.670
You're out cold.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.390
Every day you wake up,
they pump you back.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.910
And after that
week, I don't know

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.650
why, but there was some hope
that-- it didn't get worse,

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.330
so maybe we're going
to get lucky here.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:35.790
But we went back into it one
last time, a biweekly IVIG,

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.840
and my symptoms were
still progressing.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.630
So at that point, we were
leaning towards motor neuron

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.060
disease, ALS, Lou
Gehrig's disease,

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.700
or-- but I just don't
know why he-- we

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.270
didn't find out directly there.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.015
We ended up going--
one day I went up

00:04:59.015 --> 00:05:01.990
to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.170
Pretty much ran every
test that I had previously

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.260
done, except the spinal tap
and the surgery, thank God,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:17.180
and that day they were able to
conclusively tell me that we

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.260
will diagnose you with ALS.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.340
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
And when was that?

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.819
PAT QUINN: That was March
13, 2013-- March 8, 2013.

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:29.360
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
So almost two years

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.740
after the softball tournament?

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.360
PAT QUINN: Just about, yeah.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.110
Almost.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:42.960
I'm saying my buddy Pete Frates'
diagnosis was March 13, 2012.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.920
I was March 8, 2013.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.654
Too close.

00:05:46.654 --> 00:05:48.070
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
And you and Pete

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.470
are credited with starting
this legitimate worldwide

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.660
phenomenon.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.410
So why ice?

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:55.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.050
PAT QUINN: It was hot.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.520
No, I mean, we got lucky.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.420
I really like to say that the
ice bucket challenge story,

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.560
it didn't start last summer.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.780
It started way before that.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.890
Because-- I know
everything in life

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:19.390
doesn't happen for a reason,
but I truly believe a lot does.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.440
And you meet people
at certain times

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.230
in your life for a reason.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.310
And after I was
diagnosed-- shortly

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.880
after-- I went on Google.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.210
And I searched
young ALS patients,

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.080
and Peter Frates
is what popped up.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.000
And I said, what the hell.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.940
Let me give this guy a shout
and see if he responds.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.150
What do I have to lose, right?

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.700
So I sent him an email.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.290
We were on our way up, me
and my wife-- girlfriend

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.880
at the time-- we were
on our way to Boston

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.580
anyway, so I sent him an email
because she kept pushing me to.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.400
Thank you, wherever you are.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.320
And he answered.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.660
So after our trip to Boston,
we went to-- I don't know Mass.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.020
that well, but another town.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.792
We got to meet Pat--
Pete-- in a restaurant,

00:07:17.792 --> 00:07:20.320
and we just hit it off.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.630
And he was really good
to me, really supportive,

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:29.240
and was all about helping me.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.200
And that meant a lot.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.230
I needed that
support at the time,

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.290
because I knew I
wanted to be proactive.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.750
I'm young.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.740
I'm energetic.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.626
I like to be out
there, and like I

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:43.220
said before, my
progression is pretty slow,

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.400
so I feel I'll have
a long fight where

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.050
I can be a voice for
patients that progression

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.630
is a lot more rapid.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.760
Because with ALS,
people are usually

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.030
in wheelchairs by now in my
case, or lost their voice.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:01.150
I mean, my voice
is a little weaker,

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.910
but I'm still here
talking, so I'm

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:07.320
very lucky in the
whole scheme of ALS.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.670
And that day he was
pretty much an open book.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.850
He just said, ask me
what you want to know.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:16.150
This thing isn't
easy, so ask now.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.470
And let's get this thing going.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:19.470
Let's create awareness.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:25.990
And I think ever since then,
we-- me and my wife, my family,

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:30.440
friends-- we started Quinn for
the Win, a small organization

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.120
in Yonkers.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.799
And we are doing
prototypical stuff

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:38.860
like three-on-three basketball
tournaments, golf outings.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.419
I'm sure you can tell I'm Irish.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:46.080
We went to bars and we had Irish
music, and people get fired up

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:46.910
and donate more.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.035
I'm telling you, it's true.

00:08:48.035 --> 00:08:49.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.300
But-- so we did that
a bunch of times.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.340
And the awareness was--
we were out there.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:58.260
I was on the news a bunch
locally in New York,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:03.740
for my area, but it's just--
it wasn't good enough.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:04.940
So we kept going.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:10.380
We kept going, and thank
God a golfer in Florida

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:17.090
sent up an ice bucket over his
head and said, this is for ALS.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:22.150
And the connection is, I
was linked to their network.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:27.100
So I picked up on it right after
they started getting it going.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:31.240
And like I said, you meet
people and you're connected

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.560
to people, all for a reason.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.150
Not everything, but a lot.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:41.240
And I feel the challenge
happened a town over from me

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.850
because I was meant to pick this
thing up and build it and get

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.090
the momentum going.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.770
And because I had
made acquaintances,

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:54.500
now friends, and now even more
now, good friends, with Pete,

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.910
we have mutual friends.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.730
So they have BC grads that
have come down and worked

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.360
in Manhattan.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.290
A friend of mine, a
good friend of his,

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.250
Tim Holden-- after
Quinn for the Win

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.900
got Yonkers involved
and a lot more

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.490
places getting the
bucket challenge going--

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.470
this friend of mine,
good friend of his-- I

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:17.110
said that twice--
[LAUGHTER] Tim Holden--

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:20.290
thank you buddy-- put a
Quinn for the Win shirt on,

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:22.070
and BC shorts.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:23.450
And that was it.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.332
It connected New
York to Boston, and--

00:10:26.332 --> 00:10:28.290
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Which
is all you really need.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:28.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.120
PAT QUINN: --that was it.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.810
New York was getting big.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:36.430
Boston got incredibly
big super fast.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.280
And because of Pete's
BC connections--

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.290
he played baseball--
athletes started doing it.

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.860
Once the pro athletes
got involved--

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.000
I think it was Matt Ryan,
Julian Edelman-- Boston

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.010
guys-- I can't hate them.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:52.740
I like them now because
of what they did.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:53.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:58.220
But they-- they got more
people involved with names

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.750
that people recognized.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:02.210
So athletes were doing it.

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:05.010
Before you knew it,
actors, actresses,

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:09.270
people that were in the
media that could really

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.430
create that awareness we were
looking for were building.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:15.870
And every day you would
see numbers increasing.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:19.080
The new-- you would wake up
and say, who did it yesterday?

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.080
Who did it last night?

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.150
And it just kept getting
bigger and bigger and bigger,

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.520
and the numbers-- they
speak for themselves now.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.020
I mean--

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.410
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Out
of everyone that did it,

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:33.500
who are you most like, oh
my God, that guy did this?

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.250
PAT QUINN: I get
that a lot, and--

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:35.870
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Is
there anybody that you

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.390
were just like, oh, man?

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.140
PAT QUINN: --I wish I
had a better answer.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.750
I know a lot of people like
Bill Gates, 'cause he's huge,

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:45.720
and I think-- I'm not
a big LeBron James fan,

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.750
but he's one of the best
athletes in the world.

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:48.820
He did it.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.660
Leonardo DiCaprio is
as big of an actor.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.260
He did it.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.364
I can't think of someone
who didn't do it, so--

00:11:55.364 --> 00:11:57.030
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
Show of hands, anybody

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:00.500
here not do the ice
bucket challenge in 2014?

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.464
We got the whole
room, so-- [LAUGHTER]

00:12:02.464 --> 00:12:03.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:08.960
PAT QUINN: Yeah. [LAUGHTER] And
it's not worth getting picky,

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:14.160
because every challenge,
no matter how big or small,

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.230
was doing what we
originally set out to do,

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:19.990
which was create awareness,
and the money coming in

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.290
was just completely unexpected.

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.040
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Well,
that was the thing

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.540
that-- I know when
it first started,

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.541
there was a lot of backlash
on the internet, of,

00:12:27.541 --> 00:12:29.248
oh, people are putting
ice on their head,

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:30.860
but who's actually
donating money?

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.530
But actually, fundraising
spiked last August

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:36.150
during this entire process.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:37.240
PAT QUINN: Incredibly.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:42.570
I mean, the grand total
is $220 million globally,

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.470
which ALS has never seen before.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:49.310
I mean, their budget
grew by leaps and bounds.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.040
And because of what
happened last year,

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.490
there's a lot more
research going on.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.990
There's a lot more
patient services.

00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:00.890
I know of a precision
medicine program in Boston

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:03.650
that went from a
handful of patients

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:09.500
allowed to be involved to
over 100, approaching 300 now.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:13.300
The value of what happened
will never be matched.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.390
It was something that
started-- the New York Genome

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:19.530
Center, right down
the block, got

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:23.700
a grant that opened up
more genetic study for ALS,

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.930
which people feel could be
where a breakthrough comes.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.010
And there's more and more stuff.

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:32.715
I don't want to get too
technical, 'cause I'm not,

00:13:32.715 --> 00:13:35.260
but the science is there now.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:39.300
There's doctors that see the
value and the money coming in

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.420
and want to help now.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.790
So the brightest minds
need to be working

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:46.810
on this, because ALS
is very difficult.

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:51.800
It's a disease that is so
different in every individual

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.550
that it's not like
other diseases,

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:57.840
where you just focus
in on one thing.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.110
Just for example, my progression
is a little slower than others.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:02.145
I'm walking.

00:14:02.145 --> 00:14:04.710
There's people that
die in the time frame

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.350
I've been diagnosed with ALS.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:11.970
So it's very difficult,
and I understand

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:16.970
that because there hasn't been
a breakthrough in-- Lou Gehrig

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:21.035
gave his farewell speech from
baseball over 75 years ago.

00:14:21.035 --> 00:14:22.600
It's his birthday,
actually, today.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:22.930
Happy birthday, Lou.

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:25.471
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: I was going
to say it's his birthday, yeah.

00:14:25.471 --> 00:14:29.180
PAT QUINN: And last time I
spoke with Ryan from Google,

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.850
it was Lou Gehrig's last game.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.890
And today it was Lou
Gehrig's birthday,

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:38.062
so I thought there was meaning
in that, but-- where were we?

00:14:38.062 --> 00:14:38.562
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:38.562 --> 00:14:40.317
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Where were we?

00:14:40.317 --> 00:14:42.150
Actually, one of things
I wanted to bring up

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:45.235
is basically, 2015,
where do you go here?

00:14:45.235 --> 00:14:46.610
You were honored
at the Webbies--

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:47.040
PAT QUINN: That was cool.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.670
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: --with a
special achievement award

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:50.310
by one Dave Grohl, I believe.

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.680
And you had, of
course, five words.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.980
So if you could tell everyone
your five-word speech?

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.180
PAT QUINN: Every
August until a cure.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.740
And we're really
riding that right now,

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:06.880
because like I stated
before, the ice bucket

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:11.860
challenge was a great
start to a lot of stuff.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.060
By no means is there a
treatment or a cure yet.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:19.820
So I know the public
perception may be,

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.890
what do they need
more money for?

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:25.870
I mean, they've raised
$155 million in the US,

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.780
220 globally.

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:30.910
It's because nothing's
happened yet.

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:33.770
Things are just getting started.

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:36.230
Like I said, the
research is flowing out.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:40.780
It was a great building
block, but nothing's ending.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:43.150
I get weaker every day.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:47.560
Every couple months I can notice
something pretty significant.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.730
My arms are very weak right now.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:55.290
So we-- I'm here talking because
I want more people to know.

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:58.800
The awareness has to
continue, because there

00:15:58.800 --> 00:15:59.960
will be a breakthrough.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.340
It'll happen eventually,
whether in my lifetime or not.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.656
We're going to fight
for it every day.

00:16:06.656 --> 00:16:10.260
And the best way to do that
is the ice bucket challenge,

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.540
we learned last summer.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:18.920
And regardless of the
magnitude this year,

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.960
it has to happen again because
of what happened last year.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.530
No matter how big
or small, it will

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:31.080
be significant to
the ALS community,

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.140
because more money will
come in than any other time

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.040
the rest of the year.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.550
So although I feel it
will be very successful,

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:41.470
and I have goals in my head
of bigger than last year--

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:46.710
which people may think
crazy-- but go big or go home.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:48.700
You gotta think big
to make a difference.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:49.230
And--

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:49.980
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
So every August

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.950
we can expect to throw
ice on our heads again.

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:54.390
PAT QUINN: Until we figure
something out, every August.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:55.130
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: I know
some co-workers here

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:56.740
who were hoping to see me
get doused with ice today.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:57.740
We're going to wait till August.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.155
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:58.155 --> 00:16:58.920
It's still too early.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.330
PAT QUINN: I got you
off the hook today.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:01.496
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Thank you.

00:17:03.271 --> 00:17:05.020
If anyone would like
to ask any questions,

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.839
we have two microphones
in the aisles.

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:07.980
I'll call on you if
you want to come up.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.771
No pressure, but they
are there if you want

00:17:09.771 --> 00:17:11.480
to talk to Pat about anything.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:11.980
But yeah.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:17.700
So, the Webbies, and
then that led to August--

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.210
and this is me trying to find
my own train of thought here.

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:21.084
PAT QUINN: I'm sorry.

00:17:21.084 --> 00:17:25.150
I mean, what happened since
last summer has been nuts.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:29.110
I mean, I've grown to
enjoy being in front

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:30.470
of people talking about this.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:35.080
When I was in school, I didn't
want to get called on anything.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.420
So the way I always
explain it is,

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.599
I have a real passion
for what I'm doing now.

00:17:39.599 --> 00:17:42.140
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Well, May was
ALS Awareness Month, correct,

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.550
so you have talked all
over the place lately.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:44.530
PAT QUINN: Yeah, yeah.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:48.520
I did a-- I'm pumping
myself here, but whatever--

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.110
I did a satellite media tour--

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:50.990
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
The floor is yours.

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:53.480
PAT QUINN: --and I sat in front
of a camera for five hours

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.260
and just did local
news broadcast

00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:01.160
after local news broadcast,
radio, for the whole morning.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.630
And the next day, I
was getting feedback

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:07.570
from all over the country
of how interested they

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:09.510
were in my story
and how they want

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:10.850
to know what we're doing next.

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:12.900
And that's why I'm here.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.210
You just keep building
on the momentum

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.250
we created last summer.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.140
And something's going to happen.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:24.804
Things change, and we're
trying to make that change now.

00:18:24.804 --> 00:18:26.970
And seriously, I mean,
there's a lot of people here.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:28.970
Don't hesitate to ask.

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:32.150
I know someone has
to break the ice--

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:33.587
I didn't mean that because I--

00:18:33.587 --> 00:18:34.920
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Yeah, you did.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.100
PAT QUINN: But I mean,
I have a unique story.

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.510
I know I'm young
for what I have,

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:43.310
so if there's something in
your head, please do ask.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:46.320
I'm very open.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.640
I just-- I'm confident
in what's going on,

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.178
so don't feel weird
asking anything.

00:18:51.178 --> 00:18:52.178
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Brian?

00:18:52.178 --> 00:18:54.635
AUDIENCE: I don't know if I'm
allowed to ask first, but--

00:18:54.635 --> 00:18:56.380
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Sure.

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:58.820
AUDIENCE: When you said that
Bill Gates did the ice bucket

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:02.860
challenge, I was thinking
about this year-- even if you

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:06.370
kind of get millions of people
to do the ice bucket challenge,

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:09.830
if you could get more Bill
Gates and Larry Pages and Mark

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.980
Zuckerbergs who would, even if
they don't do the challenge,

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.800
they also have very,
very deep pockets.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.280
Because we see-- and
how do we get more Bill

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.150
Gates to get involved with ALS?

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:23.650
And I don't know
if that's something

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:26.570
that you and your team
have thought about?

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:28.900
And it's not only
that, but I also think,

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:33.160
even if it's not resources, you
think of all these conditions

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:38.180
that-- things like hepatitis
C, which used to-- now

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.725
there's treatment
that actually can

00:19:39.725 --> 00:19:43.310
solve that in 12 weeks-- and
all these other conditions

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.290
that are out there.

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:48.700
Then if we can just get enough
resources, enough money or even

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.700
brainpower-- there's some very
smart people in this room,

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.279
and who knows what they
can be doing to help.

00:19:54.279 --> 00:19:55.570
So have you thought about that?

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:57.750
Outside of just simply
getting a lot of people

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:01.170
to do the ice bucket challenge,
how can we get some big hitters

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.697
like the Bill Gates involved?

00:20:03.697 --> 00:20:05.280
PAT QUINN: We always
think about that,

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:09.390
'cause you want to
think from the top down,

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:14.510
but I feel the more awareness
you create from any level

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.850
will draw attention
from the biggest names.

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:22.630
It did last year, and engaging
them early on this year

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.740
is a priority.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.560
I know once we start
kicking things off,

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.780
people will start
to recognize it

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.660
as long as we get the
media going again.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.890
And I mean, Bill Gates put
some real thought into his.

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:41.380
He created a whole device
that poured the ice bucket.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.680
Hopefully you're thinking
right now, Bill, because we

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.830
need another one like that.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.970
But that's a great question.

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:52.260
I mean, in my head, in my
network, we're out there now.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:55.110
And we're connecting
with everyone that will.

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:59.540
And as long as they're are
open to doing it again,

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.670
we're going to be
there for them.

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:03.860
But we're just
going to build on it

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.670
as much as we can, and
then go from there.

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.810
And like you said, there's
breakthroughs in diseases

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.470
all the time.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:15.410
And with ALS, there hasn't
been in a long time.

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:17.420
It's an orphan disease.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.730
They say approximately
30,000 people in the US

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.410
have it any given
time, but there's

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:27.290
real facts that keep
patients' voices down.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:32.640
One in particular that will
really grab your attention

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:38.610
is, every 90 minutes
there's a patient diagnosed,

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:44.150
but every 90 minutes
another patient dies of ALS.

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:45.430
Thanks, Jason.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:50.360
But it's a disease
that takes people

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.090
as quickly as they
diagnose them,

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:55.310
so the voices don't last long.

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:59.280
I think I mentioned earlier
that with the-- I don't

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.360
like to say my
progression is slower,

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.900
because my arms are weak.

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.930
I can't use them.

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:08.110
And I don't think
it's fair to say

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:11.390
someone has fast or slow
progression, kind of.

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:13.980
The disease stinks regardless.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:19.460
But I'm here talking after
two years, and I feel,

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:23.970
not obligated, but it's my
job to be here for others that

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:24.470
can't.

00:22:27.555 --> 00:22:28.680
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Yes, sir.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.260
AUDIENCE: Hey Pat, thanks so
much for being with us today.

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.950
Your story's beyond
inspirational.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:33.302
I actually have three questions.

00:22:33.302 --> 00:22:34.010
I hope that's OK.

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:34.300
PAT QUINN: Yeah.

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:35.280
AUDIENCE: I'm going to
bundle them all together

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.330
and just fire them away.

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:39.040
Answer them in whatever
order you prefer.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.970
First, you mentioned this golfer
is actually the first one who

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:42.970
poured it over his head.

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:46.330
I'm curious if you know what
catalyzed him to do something

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:48.780
really bizarre that
ended up trickling

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.790
into a worldwide phenomenon.

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:53.870
Number two is, every
August until a cure.

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:56.140
Is there anything you
want to see different

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.180
in 2015 that did not happen
last year-- either a new spin

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.470
on the challenge, or a
new goal, or new, just,

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.350
ideas that would be
different that last year?

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.599
And lastly, have you considered
celebrity endorsements

00:23:06.599 --> 00:23:08.735
such as Vanilla Ice,
Ice Cube or Ice-T?

00:23:08.735 --> 00:23:09.235
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:09.235 --> 00:23:10.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:11.934
Just throwing that out there.

00:23:11.934 --> 00:23:13.600
PAT QUINN: I'll start
with the last one.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.891
If you guys know any way of
getting in touch with them,

00:23:15.891 --> 00:23:17.434
I'd love that.

00:23:17.434 --> 00:23:20.822
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:20.822 --> 00:23:22.280
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
Well, now we know

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.657
the three people to challenge.

00:23:23.657 --> 00:23:24.573
PAT QUINN: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:30.770
The first one, the
guy, Chris-- the reason

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:35.390
why he did it was his
cousin's husband had ALS.

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:38.590
And he sent it up to
New York, in Pelham,

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:41.870
which is right next door to
where I'm from in Yonkers,

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:46.250
and like I said, we just--
everything connected

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:50.460
so perfectly that
it's almost eerie.

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:54.340
Like, why-- the way
it all happened,

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:55.370
it was meant to happen.

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:57.830
And it's really
gonna be the start

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:00.260
of the end of this disease.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.350
Because of what
happened last summer,

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:06.140
more money has come in to
support our cause than ever.

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.780
And there's stuff happening now.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.190
People have hope
in the community.

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:14.110
Like I said, I'm
young I'm out there.

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:15.430
I like to have fun.

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:16.410
So I'm proactive.

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:18.760
I don't mind telling my story.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:22.360
I mean, the first couple
weeks after diagnosis,

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:26.120
where do you go, what do you
do, how do you tell people?

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.050
You cry a lot.

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:29.880
It's not easy.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.280
But you break through
that mold, then

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.070
you come out a stronger person.

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:39.060
And ever since then,
I've been out there,

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:42.120
put my voice out there,
let people see me.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.540
Because people need
to know it's a disease

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:45.850
that doesn't discriminate.

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:47.300
I'm a young man.

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:51.450
Most people think it's an
old person's disease, which

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:52.640
is a misconception.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.070
Anybody can get this disease.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:57.550
There's more and more
patients since the ice bucket

00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:03.370
challenge that are willing to
talk about their condition.

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:08.790
It's not as rare, so they're
open to going out and building

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:09.350
support.

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:12.750
And not only does that
help their local community

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:19.062
and their comfort level, but
it builds more awareness.

00:25:19.062 --> 00:25:23.760
And I always to say, the
awareness leads to the funding,

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.950
and the funding leads
to the research.

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:30.910
Without the three,
nothing happens.

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:32.120
AUDIENCE: Thanks a lot.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.750
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Thank you.

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:34.940
Yes sir.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.170
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:37.130
Very inspirational.

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:39.480
I'm picturing pouring
ice on my head in August.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.270
It's a great idea.

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.605
One thing I'm
thinking is, as I pass

00:25:43.605 --> 00:25:46.020
that out through my network,
people are gonna say,

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.020
why again?

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:50.350
Is there a site that I could
link to in my social media

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:52.920
pages that says,
this $220 million

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.850
that we raised last August
did these wonderful things.

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:58.110
That's just the
tip of the iceberg.

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:00.260
Here's where we're
going now, right?

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.140
PAT QUINN: The ice
references don't get old.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:02.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.045
AUDIENCE: Right?

00:26:03.045 --> 00:26:04.594
[LAUGHTER] That just came out.

00:26:04.594 --> 00:26:09.620
[LAUGHTER] So then-- that
sums it up quickly to say,

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:10.455
here it is.

00:26:10.455 --> 00:26:11.740
Here's what we accomplished.

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:12.781
Here's where we're going.

00:26:12.781 --> 00:26:13.610
Does that exist?

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:16.115
PAT QUINN: I believe
there's a few infographics.

00:26:16.115 --> 00:26:19.430
The ALS Association
has one on their site.

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:23.210
I think ALSTDI has
one on theirs as well.

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:25.660
I mean, I could
explain a little.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:28.610
I read a lot about it.

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:30.810
The ice bucket challenge
through the association

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:34.120
has started five new
research programs.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:38.350
One is Project Mind,
which is genetics-based.

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:41.200
They funded the New
York Genome Center,

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.800
which is also genetic-based, and
involved in genome sequencing.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.180
What else was there?

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:57.120
The genome center,
Project Mind-- I lied.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.100
I guess I didn't
know as much as I--

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.930
but they started five new ones.

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:03.400
I believe there's infographics.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:07.460
In regards to the next--
this coming August,

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:12.850
when we hope to make it as big
as we can again-- recently,

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:16.070
because of the ice
bucket challenge,

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:18.450
for the first time ever
in the ALS community,

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:22.150
there was Collaboration
for a Cure.

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:25.670
ALS organizations--
a lot of nonprofits,

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:28.870
they usually work on their
own, for their own cause,

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:29.710
and their own path.

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:31.390
And I get that.

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:34.290
But we need teamwork
to beat this thing.

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:35.910
It's not easy.

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:38.030
So since the ice
bucket challenge,

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:41.840
we had the Collaboration for
a Cure, which brought the 18

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.920
major ALS
organizations together,

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:48.380
and we're all going to work
on the ice bucket challenge

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:49.900
together.

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.400
I'm pretty involved
with all the planning,

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:56.460
and I liked-- I guess I'm
giving the patient perspective,

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.440
keeping them from trying
to make it too corporate,

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.600
because everyone knows
last year was very organic

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:06.450
and had a real feel
for the patient.

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:10.130
And the vibe of the whole
ice bucket challenge

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:14.795
was so organic that people
were inspired by it.

00:28:14.795 --> 00:28:17.730
If you have companies
doing it first,

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:19.110
it would just throw it off.

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:22.090
So I'm really excited
to be involved

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:25.740
and to hopefully keep
this thing going.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.405
But-- I rambled
there-- but they're

00:28:27.405 --> 00:28:31.250
gonna have a microsite
that will have a link.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:34.260
Hopefully most people
will be able to use that.

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:39.020
We'll have all the organizations
listed with what they do,

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:42.170
and then you could
decide specifically

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:44.850
where your donation can go.

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:46.679
AUDIENCE: Perfect, thank you.

00:28:46.679 --> 00:28:48.720
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: So
actually-- so the ice bucket

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.136
challenge last
year, you mentioned

00:28:50.136 --> 00:28:53.362
Bill Gates made a machine
which led to a lot of people

00:28:53.362 --> 00:28:55.820
kind of get inspired to make
almost art projects out of it.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:58.070
So even Dave Grohl, he
did the "Carrie" video--

00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.020
PAT QUINN: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:59.020 --> 00:28:59.740
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
--which was really fun.

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:02.050
Is there any of
those that you really

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:05.490
enjoyed-- that you were really
impressed that someone did

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:08.140
that much trouble to be, like,
wow, they made an art piece out

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.860
of raising awareness for ALS?

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.930
PAT QUINN: I mean, it started
really simple with the bucket,

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:14.930
and then people
slowly-- by week four,

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:17.260
it was-- people were
using bulldozers,

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:19.870
and I had a friend
jump in the bucket,

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:22.820
which was completely ridiculous.

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:24.820
I mean, it just kept
getting bigger and bigger.

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:26.236
I forget the hockey
player's name,

00:29:26.236 --> 00:29:29.386
but he had the bucket
dropped from a helicopter.

00:29:29.386 --> 00:29:30.760
I mean, it probably
cost him more

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:34.650
to do it than the donation,
but it created awareness.

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:36.980
And I mean, either
way you're helping us,

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:39.410
and we appreciate that.

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:43.110
But I missed the last
gentleman's second question,

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:47.560
'cause it just clicked that
our goal is, if you did it

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.390
last year, do it different.

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:51.969
Try and mix it up a little bit.

00:29:51.969 --> 00:29:52.760
Do a little better.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.440
Do a little bigger.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.830
And we found out in the
data that a lot of people

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:59.440
didn't do it.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.010
So we're gonna try
and engage people

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:04.600
that didn't do it to
be challenged by me,

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.550
be challenged by Pete,
be challenged by someone

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:09.480
in your community that has ALS.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.230
And just go out
and do it for them.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:14.700
I mean, you have
nothing to lose,

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.490
but support of a person
that's struggling,

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:22.585
and a cause that so
desperately needs your support.

00:30:22.585 --> 00:30:24.710
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Pete, I
hope you'll challenge me.

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:26.370
I'm sorry, Pat, I hope
you'll challenge me.

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:27.830
PAT QUINN: I'll come down
here and do it with you.

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:28.996
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: All right.

00:30:28.996 --> 00:30:30.820
We'll have you on
back in August.

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:33.420
AUDIENCE: Hey Pat,
thanks for being here.

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.510
So you talk a lot about being
a voice of the ALS community

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:39.240
and for raising
awareness about ALS.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.420
How much time and
energy do you put

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:45.880
into connecting with other
patients, ALS patients,

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.460
one on one, kind of
like Pete provided

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:49.730
that support to you initially?

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:51.620
Can you just kind
of talk about that?

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:52.286
PAT QUINN: Yeah.

00:30:52.286 --> 00:30:56.290
I appreciate that question
because what he did for me,

00:30:56.290 --> 00:31:00.700
I want to do for anyone who,
pretty much, seeks it out.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:07.260
I've met with a lot of
patients-- old, young, local,

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:08.350
on Facebook.

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:11.010
People message me
all the time, and I

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:12.750
hope I got back to most of you.

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:15.730
I'm-- I'm out there.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:18.540
And I feel, like I
mentioned before, I

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.160
have a progression
that's gonna allow

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:24.502
me to be vocal for a long time,
and hopefully inspire a lot

00:31:24.502 --> 00:31:26.250
of people to get out there.

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:30.160
Not just patients, but family,
friends-- and keep this thing

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.420
going.

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:35.370
The momentum created last
summer can't be something

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:36.070
that we ignore.

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:39.410
We have to keep
building on it, and

00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:42.350
by inspiring other
patients-- or maybe not.

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:44.330
Just telling them I'm there.

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:45.280
Give me a message.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.320
Shoot me a message.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.740
I'll tell you how I'm feeling,
you tell me how you're feeling.

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:50.900
How can I help you?

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.680
I could tell you what
my experience is,

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.270
and hopefully we can
relate a little bit,

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:59.950
because this is an
orphan disease which not

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:01.610
many-- many people get here.

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:04.995
So you're not gonna just
walk down the street

00:32:04.995 --> 00:32:06.620
and find someone to talk about.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:09.790
You have to go out and look
for them, like I did with Pete,

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:13.440
and many people have done
for me, which I appreciate.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:17.990
And it's amazing what the
internet and Facebook and stuff

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:20.270
can do, because we
really got out there.

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:21.880
We connected with
a lot of people.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:26.180
And it's just a
very tough disease.

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.660
There's no treatment.

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:29.660
There's no cure.

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:31.290
There's no reason--
they can't tell me

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:34.520
why I got it, which is crazy.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.910
At least tell me
what I did, you know?

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:39.900
But that also hurts.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.700
[INAUDIBLE] you really
can't give much.

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:44.580
You give a recommendation.

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:47.210
Like, I go to physical
therapy once a week.

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:52.050
I go to PT, OT, trainers,
get stretched out,

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:53.630
because I can't move my arms.

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:57.120
I need someone to help me with
that or they'll get locked up.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.930
So there's small
vitamin regimens

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:04.680
I could recommend
that I do often.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.120
I was a pretty
militant early on,

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.980
but my swallowing has got
a little more difficult,

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:13.080
so some pills are
enormous and just

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.450
not worth dealing with anymore.

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:18.850
But like I said, there's
very little options,

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:23.380
so I think the
patient-to-patient connection

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:26.160
is where the value is.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.690
Not so much advice.

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:31.890
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:35.330
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Well
Pat, I-- one more?

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:36.690
AUDIENCE: Thanks for being here.

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:39.070
If you want to help,
how can we help you,

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:41.555
besides doing the
ice bucket challenge?

00:33:44.345 --> 00:33:45.280
PAT QUINN: Me?

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.500
Or-- no, I'm just kidding.

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:48.610
There's many ways.

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:51.830
The ALS Association does walks.

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:56.840
There's a corn toss event for
TDI, which is a research place.

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:59.610
If you go on Google--

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:01.479
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Thank you.

00:34:01.479 --> 00:34:03.020
PAT QUINN: --there's
stuff out there.

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:06.470
I mean, you could look
into your local community.

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:09.090
An ALS patient needs your help.

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:10.090
I'm very lucky.

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:12.100
I got married after diagnosis.

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:13.889
I had a great wife.

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:14.730
My dad's here.

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:16.560
My mom's been great.

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:20.580
I have family and friends
like most patients don't.

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:22.020
So I'm lucky in that regard.

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:23.480
But there's older
people that get

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:26.449
this disease that have nothing.

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:30.630
I mean, even a conversation
would probably help their day.

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:33.889
There's little
things on that level.

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:37.560
Or running fundraisers
to advance research.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:41.630
If you look into that, there's
Project ALS in Manhattan

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:46.659
here that I'm sure would
love to hear from you.

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:48.933
If I got your email I
could probably bombard you

00:34:48.933 --> 00:34:50.000
with a bunch of stuff.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.090
But it's out there.

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:53.969
You can find it.

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:55.372
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:55.372 --> 00:34:56.770
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Thank you.

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:58.170
All right, Pat.

00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:00.752
I am a big believer in
the mantra that we spend

00:35:00.752 --> 00:35:02.835
the first half of our life
trying to be successful

00:35:02.835 --> 00:35:04.826
and the second half
trying to be significant.

00:35:04.826 --> 00:35:05.575
You're doing both.

00:35:05.575 --> 00:35:06.866
It's an honor to have you here.

00:35:06.866 --> 00:35:09.050
Would you like to leave
us with anything else?

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:11.670
PAT QUINN: Sure.

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:14.410
What I have isn't easy.

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:16.400
It gets tougher and
tougher as the road goes.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:22.020
But I like to think
everyone faces adversity

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:26.404
at some point or
another in their life,

00:35:26.404 --> 00:35:32.590
and the way you face that
challenge, or that adversity,

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:33.990
is how you'll be remembered.

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:37.700
And it'll create
a legacy in a way.

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:41.910
And I'm trying to do that
now by inspiring people

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:43.470
and fighting every day.

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:48.090
And like I said, you will
face adversity if you haven't.

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:49.630
Life ain't easy.

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:55.280
It's difficult. But
as another inspiration

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.930
of mine, Steve Gleason, would
say, awesome ain't easy.

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:03.540
And we're going to keep
being awesome until we

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:06.137
figure this thing out.

00:36:06.137 --> 00:36:08.720
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Pat, thank you
for being here with us today.

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.270
[APPLAUSE]
