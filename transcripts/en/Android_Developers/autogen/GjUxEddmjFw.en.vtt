see in apps and hopefully give you some
 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.070
see in apps and hopefully give you some
ideas of the kind of elements that you

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080
ideas of the kind of elements that you
 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.450
ideas of the kind of elements that you
can include in your apps to make them

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460
can include in your apps to make them
 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.179
can include in your apps to make them
equally compelling absolutely so without

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189

so on the left here and this is a tablet

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880
so on the left here and this is a tablet
 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.490
so on the left here and this is a tablet
UI on the left you have the list of

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500
UI on the left you have the list of
 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.170
UI on the left you have the list of
search results and the right you have

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180
search results and the right you have
 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.790
search results and the right you have
this map so this is kind of a very

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800
this map so this is kind of a very
 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.480
this map so this is kind of a very
common two pane view for lists of search

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490
common two pane view for lists of search
 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.480
common two pane view for lists of search
results now the most the most

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490
results now the most the most
 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.580
results now the most the most
interesting thing here I guess is what

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590
interesting thing here I guess is what
 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.290
interesting thing here I guess is what
happens with the actual list of search

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300
happens with the actual list of search
 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.180
happens with the actual list of search
results now if you look on the left here

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190
results now if you look on the left here
 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.980
results now if you look on the left here
you'll notice that you know it's not

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990
you'll notice that you know it's not
 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.070
you'll notice that you know it's not
just the title and the category or the

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080
just the title and the category or the
 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.570
just the title and the category or the
title in the photo there's actually a

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580
title in the photo there's actually a
 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.580
title in the photo there's actually a
lot of information compressed into the

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590
lot of information compressed into the
 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.130
lot of information compressed into the
small space so for example amici's East

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140
small space so for example amici's East
 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.199
small space so for example amici's East

just next to the URL bar that I have

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:22.470
just next to the URL bar that I have
 

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.619
just next to the URL bar that I have
three tabs open so I can just go right

00:11:24.619 --> 00:11:24.629
three tabs open so I can just go right
 

00:11:24.629 --> 00:11:26.329
three tabs open so I can just go right
ahead and tap that button and I'll get

00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:26.339
ahead and tap that button and I'll get
 

00:11:26.339 --> 00:11:30.019
ahead and tap that button and I'll get
into the tab management UI but another

00:11:30.019 --> 00:11:30.029
into the tab management UI but another
 

00:11:30.029 --> 00:11:31.699
into the tab management UI but another
more interesting way of doing this is

00:11:31.699 --> 00:11:31.709
more interesting way of doing this is
 

00:11:31.709 --> 00:11:34.610
more interesting way of doing this is
using a gesture you can see that when I

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:34.620
using a gesture you can see that when I
 

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.340
using a gesture you can see that when I
tap that free the bar itself animates

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:37.350
tap that free the bar itself animates
 

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:40.400
tap that free the bar itself animates
down kind of shifts down kind of

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:40.410
down kind of shifts down kind of
 

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:43.100
down kind of shifts down kind of
implying spatially how you might kind of

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:43.110
implying spatially how you might kind of
 

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:44.809
implying spatially how you might kind of
bootstrap this the knowledge of this

00:11:44.809 --> 00:11:44.819
bootstrap this the knowledge of this
 

00:11:44.819 --> 00:11:46.699
bootstrap this the knowledge of this
gesture so what you can do is you can

00:11:46.699 --> 00:11:46.709
gesture so what you can do is you can
 

00:11:46.709 --> 00:11:48.619
gesture so what you can do is you can
drag it down and to enter the same UI

00:11:48.619 --> 00:11:48.629
drag it down and to enter the same UI
 

00:11:48.629 --> 00:11:51.679
drag it down and to enter the same UI
here from the bar so if you think about

00:11:51.679 --> 00:11:51.689
here from the bar so if you think about
 

00:11:51.689 --> 00:11:53.840
here from the bar so if you think about
how they've done this gesture I think

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:53.850
how they've done this gesture I think
 

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:57.079
how they've done this gesture I think
work really really well firstly I always

00:11:57.079 --> 00:11:57.089
work really really well firstly I always
 

00:11:57.089 --> 00:11:59.419
work really really well firstly I always
feel in control of it so as I drag down

00:11:59.419 --> 00:11:59.429
feel in control of it so as I drag down
 

00:11:59.429 --> 00:12:01.220
feel in control of it so as I drag down
it kind of tracks my finger so I can

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:01.230
it kind of tracks my finger so I can
 

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.410
it kind of tracks my finger so I can
move down and up and I always feel very

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:03.420
move down and up and I always feel very
 

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.319
move down and up and I always feel very
much in control of what's going on and

00:12:06.319 --> 00:12:06.329
much in control of what's going on and
 

00:12:06.329 --> 00:12:07.790
much in control of what's going on and
the second thing is that it's very

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800
the second thing is that it's very
 

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.710
the second thing is that it's very
contextual so if I was on say this

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:09.720
contextual so if I was on say this
 

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.590
contextual so if I was on say this
bottom tab here as I drag down it

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600
bottom tab here as I drag down it
 

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.499
bottom tab here as I drag down it
maintains the order of my tabs but

00:12:15.499 --> 00:12:15.509
maintains the order of my tabs but
 

00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:17.600
maintains the order of my tabs but
tracks my finger so again I always feel

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:17.610
tracks my finger so again I always feel
 

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.189
tracks my finger so again I always feel
very much control and it retains the

00:12:19.189 --> 00:12:19.199
very much control and it retains the
 

00:12:19.199 --> 00:12:22.819
very much control and it retains the
context of where I've come from you can

00:12:22.819 --> 00:12:22.829
context of where I've come from you can
 

00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:24.439
context of where I've come from you can
also do some things like dragging

00:12:24.439 --> 00:12:24.449
also do some things like dragging
 

00:12:24.449 --> 00:12:26.239
also do some things like dragging
sideways on it to switch the tabs here

00:12:26.239 --> 00:12:26.249
sideways on it to switch the tabs here
 

00:12:26.249 --> 00:12:28.220
sideways on it to switch the tabs here
so again it's maintaining that kind of

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:28.230
so again it's maintaining that kind of
 

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:30.650
so again it's maintaining that kind of
spatial model so I know I can move on

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:30.660
spatial model so I know I can move on
 

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:34.069
spatial model so I know I can move on
easily to them and I think my favorite

00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079

and for every day I'm just seeing kind
of that a small orange dot that

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:22.660
of that a small orange dot that
 

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:24.210
of that a small orange dot that
represents kind of what the value on

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:24.220
represents kind of what the value on
 

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.129
represents kind of what the value on
that particular particular day was and

00:14:26.129 --> 00:14:26.139
that particular particular day was and
 

00:14:26.139 --> 00:14:27.569
that particular particular day was and
they've got the gray lines connecting it

00:14:27.569 --> 00:14:27.579
they've got the gray lines connecting it
 

00:14:27.579 --> 00:14:29.850
they've got the gray lines connecting it
to the average which is a trend line

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:29.860
to the average which is a trend line
 

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.590
to the average which is a trend line
that's rolling back across several days

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600
that's rolling back across several days
 

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.230
that's rolling back across several days
of data it also does some forecasting so

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.240
of data it also does some forecasting so
 

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.179
of data it also does some forecasting so
you get you know this kind of line to

00:14:36.179 --> 00:14:36.189
you get you know this kind of line to
 

00:14:36.189 --> 00:14:38.100
you get you know this kind of line to
the right-hand side here and that's kind

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:38.110
the right-hand side here and that's kind
 

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.650
the right-hand side here and that's kind
of predicting if you continue the way

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:40.660
of predicting if you continue the way
 

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:41.910
of predicting if you continue the way
you've been doing and managing your

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920
you've been doing and managing your
 

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.980
you've been doing and managing your
meals or going to your weight should go

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:43.990
meals or going to your weight should go
 

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:46.319
meals or going to your weight should go
in that direction and what Libra does

00:14:46.319 --> 00:14:46.329
in that direction and what Libra does
 

00:14:46.329 --> 00:14:49.410
in that direction and what Libra does
that's really kind of well implemented

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:49.420
that's really kind of well implemented
 

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.869
that's really kind of well implemented
and smoothly done is if I decide to

00:14:51.869 --> 00:14:51.879
and smoothly done is if I decide to
 

00:14:51.879 --> 00:14:53.699
and smoothly done is if I decide to
shift this time scale so I want to maybe

00:14:53.699 --> 00:14:53.709
shift this time scale so I want to maybe
 

00:14:53.709 --> 00:14:55.590
shift this time scale so I want to maybe
I want to go back and I look you know

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600
I want to go back and I look you know
 

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.049
I want to go back and I look you know
across a slightly wider scope of time as

00:14:58.049 --> 00:14:58.059
across a slightly wider scope of time as
 

00:14:58.059 --> 00:15:00.629
across a slightly wider scope of time as
I do that the way that the data is being

00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639
I do that the way that the data is being
 

00:15:00.639 --> 00:15:03.600
I do that the way that the data is being
reflected actually changes so now those

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:03.610
reflected actually changes so now those
 

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:05.699
reflected actually changes so now those
orange circles have dropped away I still

00:15:05.699 --> 00:15:05.709
orange circles have dropped away I still
 

00:15:05.709 --> 00:15:07.199
orange circles have dropped away I still
have the gray bars so I can still get a

00:15:07.199 --> 00:15:07.209
have the gray bars so I can still get a
 

00:15:07.209 --> 00:15:08.639
have the gray bars so I can still get a
sense of what those individual day

00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:08.649
sense of what those individual day
 

00:15:08.649 --> 00:15:10.980
sense of what those individual day
values were but that's honestly just

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:10.990
values were but that's honestly just
 

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:13.499
values were but that's honestly just
less important in this view and if I

00:15:13.499 --> 00:15:13.509
less important in this view and if I
 

00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:16.230
less important in this view and if I
keep squeezing out a little further the

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240
keep squeezing out a little further the
 

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.970
keep squeezing out a little further the
gray lines themselves disappear and I'm

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:17.980
gray lines themselves disappear and I'm
 

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.240
gray lines themselves disappear and I'm
real

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:18.250
real
 

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:21.840
real
just looking at trend over time it also

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:21.850
just looking at trend over time it also
 

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:23.460
just looking at trend over time it also
in addition to kind of doing the two

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:23.470
in addition to kind of doing the two
 

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:26.340
in addition to kind of doing the two
finger gestures I can do tap to snap two

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:26.350
finger gestures I can do tap to snap two
 

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:28.350
finger gestures I can do tap to snap two
different time scales so tap once and

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:28.360
different time scales so tap once and
 

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.450
different time scales so tap once and
then tap again to kind of get closer and

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:30.460
then tap again to kind of get closer and
 

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.670
then tap again to kind of get closer and
closer and you'll see it moves through

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:32.680
closer and you'll see it moves through
 

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.200
closer and you'll see it moves through
those different views there's even

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:34.210
those different views there's even
 

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:36.270
those different views there's even
little shortcuts for moving to kind of

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:36.280
little shortcuts for moving to kind of
 

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.580
little shortcuts for moving to kind of
the current day view and and matching

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:38.590
the current day view and and matching
 

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:41.610
the current day view and and matching
that so a neat small app something I

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:41.620
that so a neat small app something I
 

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.980
that so a neat small app something I
maybe spend less than 30 seconds with

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:43.990
maybe spend less than 30 seconds with
 

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.950
maybe spend less than 30 seconds with
each day but still does a really good

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:46.960
each day but still does a really good
 

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.440
each day but still does a really good
job of considering kind of what the user

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:49.450
job of considering kind of what the user
 

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:51.600
job of considering kind of what the user
goals are at any instant you know if I'm

in the moment of putting in that one

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:53.950
in the moment of putting in that one

value it's giving me real detailed view

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:56.620
value it's giving me real detailed view
 

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.590
value it's giving me real detailed view
for a short range but as I start to go

00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:58.600
for a short range but as I start to go
 

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.720
for a short range but as I start to go
further and further out to look for a

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:00.730
further and further out to look for a
 

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:03.810
further and further out to look for a
wider set of data it really adapts and

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:03.820
wider set of data it really adapts and
 

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:05.550
wider set of data it really adapts and
kind of simplifies the views that only

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:05.560
kind of simplifies the views that only
 

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.200
kind of simplifies the views that only
the most pertinent things to the use are

working timely for example is a clock a

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:11.470
working timely for example is a clock a
 

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:13.949
working timely for example is a clock a
timer a stopwatch and I use it as an

00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:13.959
timer a stopwatch and I use it as an
 

00:17:13.959 --> 00:17:16.620
timer a stopwatch and I use it as an
alarm to wake me up in the morning so so

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:16.630
alarm to wake me up in the morning so so
 

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.840
alarm to wake me up in the morning so so
all that stuff behaves as expected but

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:18.850
all that stuff behaves as expected but
 

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:20.970
all that stuff behaves as expected but
it's the extra little details it's the

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:20.980
it's the extra little details it's the
 

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.250
it's the extra little details it's the
tiny animations that are just gorgeous

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:23.260
tiny animations that are just gorgeous
 

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.470
tiny animations that are just gorgeous
and the use of color the use of

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:25.480
and the use of color the use of
 

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.480
and the use of color the use of
typography throughout the app it's that

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:27.490
typography throughout the app it's that
 

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:30.120
typography throughout the app it's that
extra 1% effort that really makes a huge

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:30.130
extra 1% effort that really makes a huge
 

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:32.190
extra 1% effort that really makes a huge
difference in the overall

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:32.200
difference in the overall
 

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.529
difference in the overall
of your op experience so like I

00:17:34.529 --> 00:17:34.539
of your op experience so like I
 

00:17:34.539 --> 00:17:36.360
of your op experience so like I
mentioned it's a clock and you just if

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:36.370
mentioned it's a clock and you just if
 

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:38.129
mentioned it's a clock and you just if
you look at if you look at the the

00:17:38.129 --> 00:17:38.139
you look at if you look at the the
 

00:17:38.139 --> 00:17:39.740
you look at if you look at the the
seconds animating here and even

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:39.750
seconds animating here and even
 

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:43.320
seconds animating here and even
responding to my to my touch it's just a

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:43.330
responding to my to my touch it's just a
 

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:46.529
responding to my to my touch it's just a
perfect example in dozens of places in

00:17:46.529 --> 00:17:46.539
perfect example in dozens of places in
 

00:17:46.539 --> 00:17:49.019
perfect example in dozens of places in
this app that real objects are more fun

00:17:49.019 --> 00:17:49.029
this app that real objects are more fun
 

00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:52.680
this app that real objects are more fun
than buttons and menus so just up here I

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:52.690
than buttons and menus so just up here I
 

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:54.750
than buttons and menus so just up here I
mean we at first glance this looks like

don't have to be told explicitly what to
 

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:35.159
don't have to be told explicitly what to
do for example you just hit the play

00:18:35.159 --> 00:18:35.169
do for example you just hit the play
 

00:18:35.169 --> 00:18:37.350
do for example you just hit the play
button and it starts counting down from

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360
button and it starts counting down from
 

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.529
button and it starts counting down from
the time I set for it and if you're if

00:18:40.529 --> 00:18:40.539
the time I set for it and if you're if
 

00:18:40.539 --> 00:18:42.330

you're interacting with it and you get a

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:42.340
you're interacting with it and you get a
 

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.100
you're interacting with it and you get a
little bit off track and you and you

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:44.110
little bit off track and you and you
 

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:46.139
little bit off track and you and you
start dragging here you notice that it

00:18:46.139 --> 00:18:46.149
start dragging here you notice that it
 

00:18:46.149 --> 00:18:49.200
start dragging here you notice that it
tilts and so that's kind of curious

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:49.210
tilts and so that's kind of curious
 

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:50.610
tilts and so that's kind of curious
right and so if you go down to the the

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:50.620
right and so if you go down to the the
 

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:52.769
right and so if you go down to the the
split action bar on the bottom and tap

00:18:52.769 --> 00:18:52.779
split action bar on the bottom and tap
 

00:18:52.779 --> 00:18:54.899
split action bar on the bottom and tap
the stopwatch button you notice that the

00:18:54.899 --> 00:18:54.909
the stopwatch button you notice that the
 

00:18:54.909 --> 00:18:56.700
the stopwatch button you notice that the
timer actually flips end-over-end

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:56.710
timer actually flips end-over-end
 

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:59.070
timer actually flips end-over-end
and so that kind of gives me the cue

00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.080
and so that kind of gives me the cue
 

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.649
and so that kind of gives me the cue
that I can just flip it using a gesture

00:19:01.649 --> 00:19:01.659
that I can just flip it using a gesture
 

00:19:01.659 --> 00:19:02.940
that I can just flip it using a gesture
and I don't even have to worry about the

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:02.950
and I don't even have to worry about the
 

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:05.310
and I don't even have to worry about the
button down here and that's just a lot

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:05.320
button down here and that's just a lot
 

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:09.330
button down here and that's just a lot
more fun when there are things that are

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:09.340
more fun when there are things that are
 

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.039
more fun when there are things that are
a little bit harder to communicate to a

00:19:11.039 --> 00:19:11.049
a little bit harder to communicate to a
 

00:19:11.049 --> 00:19:14.039
a little bit harder to communicate to a
new user for example like how to drag

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120
so I think on phone in portrait they
 

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.660
so I think on phone in portrait they
just show one column but then as the

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:47.670
just show one column but then as the
 

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:49.520
just show one column but then as the
screen size get bigger they move to

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:49.530
screen size get bigger they move to
 

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:51.110
screen size get bigger they move to
multiple columns so I think it's really

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120
multiple columns so I think it's really
 

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.960
multiple columns so I think it's really
nice another thing worth mentioning is

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:53.970

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:56.240
nice another thing worth mentioning is
