&gt;&gt; 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.559
Good afternoon everyone, my name is Anthony
Ravitz, and I'm a member of Google's Real

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:12.559
Estate Workplace Services Team.
We're always working to create a healthier,

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.520
more sustainable work environment for all
of us here at Google.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:25.250
And I'm honored to have the privilege to introduce
our guest today, Ray Anderson.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:34.600
The first time I heard Ray speak was about
four years ago.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.650
The first time that I attended Green Build,
the U.S. Green Buildings Counsels -- very,

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.240
very popular annual conference in Atlanta,
Ray's home state.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.240
And Ray was a keynote speaker on the equally
inspiring Paul Hawken.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.530
This journey began about 11 years before that
in 1994 when Ray read Hawken's book, The Ecology

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:56.550
of Commerce, and experienced what he has called,
"A Spear in the Chest"

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.190
It was then that he set himself and Interface
 -- the carpet manufacturing company that

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:09.520
he had founded over 20 years earlier -- on
a completely new path to become the first

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:18.840
industrial corporation to seek sustainability.
Today, Interface calls that 'Mission Zero'

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:28.319
 -- to eliminate any negative impact on the
environment by 2020.

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:29.509
These efforts have not only transformed Interface,
but revolutionized an entire industry -- a

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.189
really large industry.
Carpet runs cover an estimated 70 percent

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:47.649
of floors in the U.S. and approximately five
million pounds of carpet are discarded every

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:55.380
year.
Just in Google's Webold San Francisco office

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:06.179
where we reused as much of the existing carpeting
as possible, we still discarded and recycled

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:16.420
over 68,000 pounds or about seven garbage
trucks full of carpet.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:27.769
That's a lot of carpet.
Ray's transformational work reaches far past

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:38.319
the carpet industry.
He published his first book, "Mid-Course Correction"

00:02:38.319 --> 00:05:14.130
in 1999.
He has been featured in a slew of documentaries

00:05:14.130 --> 00:09:54.680
including 'The Corporation' and Leonardo DiCaprio's,
the Eleventh Hour.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:11:49.940
He serves as co-chairman of the President's
Counsel on Sustainable Development under Clinton

00:11:49.940 --> 00:13:35.019
and, more recently, as an architect of the
Presidential Climate Action Plan, a hundred-day

00:13:35.019 --> 00:14:23.880
action plan on climate that was presented
to the Obama Administration.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:17:40.590
Ray has received more honors and awards for
his work than I can possibly begin to list.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:19:40.440
Most recently, he has published his second
book, "Confessions of a Radical Industrialist."

00:19:40.440 --> 00:20:34.780
Please join me in giving a warm welcome to
Ray Anderson.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:43.580
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:20:43.580 --> 00:22:20.390
Ray Anderson: Thanks very much, Anthony and
Ruben -- very generous introduction.

00:22:20.390 --> 00:23:21.990
Hello everybody, I'm Ray.
Greetings from Atlanta.

00:23:21.990 --> 00:24:41.710
Funny way of talking, but bear with me.
Get into eventually.

00:24:41.710 --> 00:25:54.190
Asked me if I'd be introducing myself.
I'm going to be saying something about I'm

00:25:54.190 --> 00:26:04.730
a husband.
Father of two daughters, grandfather of five

00:26:04.730 --> 00:27:03.990
terrific grandchildren, soon to be a great
grandfather, and I am an industrialist -- some

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:23.750
would say a radical industrialist.
And I promise you, each and every one, I am

00:27:23.750 --> 00:28:39.180
as competitive as anybody you know, as profit-minded
as anybody you know or as likely to meet.

00:28:39.180 --> 00:29:43.920
I founded my company, Interface, from absolute
scratch, from just an idea 36 years ago in

00:29:43.920 --> 00:30:21.430
1973, to produce carpet tiles in America for
the emerging office of the future.

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:42.760
Today, the office of the future is here, and
carpet tiles are used around the world in

00:30:42.760 --> 00:31:23.310
the most modern offices and hospitals and
schools and retail stores for their own use,

00:31:23.310 --> 00:32:06.210
and hotels and you name it.
Interface makes about a third of all the carpet

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:29.910
tiles used on Earth, which is
a reasonable market share.

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:31.170
&gt;&gt; [laughter]

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:45.140
Ray Anderson: That handle 'radical industrialism'
did become incorporated into the title of

00:32:45.140 --> 00:33:27.340
this book that I've just published with St.
Martin's press.

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:46.610
And I want to take a couple of themes from
the book today and develop them for these

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:54.510
remarks.
The title I would give these remarks however,

00:33:54.510 --> 00:34:18.350
is not "Confessions of a Radical Industrialist",
I would give the title "The Corporation of

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:19.350
the Future: Reinventing the Industrial System."
And that is very much what the book is about.

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:20.350
So let me begin the two well-known quotes
from 47 years ago.

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:21.350
Quote, "We stand there where two roads diverge.
But unlike the roads in Robert Frost's familiar

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:22.350
poem, they are not equally fair.
The road we've long been traveling is deceptively

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:23.350
easy, but at its end lies disaster.
The other fork in the road -- the one less

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:24.350
traveled by -- offers our last, our only chance
to reach a destination that ensures for preservation

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:25.350
of the Earth." End quote.
Rachel Carson, Silent Spring, 1962.

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:26.350
35 years later, quote.
"Sustainable element is development that meets

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:27.350
the needs of the present generation without
sacrificing future generations' ability to

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:28.350
meet their needs." End quote.
The Brundtland Commission of the United Nations

00:34:28.350 --> 00:35:07.270
1987, 22 years ago.
This afternoon, I want to expand the meaning

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:13.180
of those two quotes.
And I want to rely on the adage that "form

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:14.180
follows function", and I'm going to be ignoring
the form of the corporation of the future

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:15.180
to concentrate on its function.
There won't be anything here about legal or

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:16.180
organizational structure or governance issues.
There's no attempt to address the controversial

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:17.180
issue of personhood of the corporation, the
mischief that that might have caused through

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:18.180
the years.
I do make one assumption and that is that

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:19.180
capitalism will continue to set the framework
within which the corporation of the future

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:20.180
will function.
So I suggest that capitalism itself will have

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:37.480
to adapt.
I concentrate these comments -- as I do in

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:46.383
the book -- on corporations and big things:
What they do, and how they go about doing

00:35:46.383 --> 00:35:50.270
it.
Furthermore, my focus is on the real economy,

00:35:50.270 --> 00:36:10.750
not its rough analog, the financial markets
or their various indexes.

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:23.420
In other words, my focus is on the industrial
system, of which, we are each and every one

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:59.950
a part, either as producers or users or consumers.
For it is this industrial system -- this is

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:01.970
where the greatest challenges to environmental
sustainability lie.

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:05.250
Contemplating the corporation of the future,
one immediately is prompted to ask, "Well,

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:07.020
what future?"
Not to suggest that there won't be a future,

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:10.980
but to suggest that the future stretches far
into, well, the future.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:43.650
So the question is -- and the important question
really is -- What time horizon are we addressing

00:37:43.650 --> 00:38:25.191
when we say 'the future'?
Whether in the title of these remarks, The

00:38:25.191 --> 00:38:55.370
Corporation of the Future, or in the Brundland
Commission's definition of sustainable development.

00:38:55.370 --> 00:39:03.720
Indeed, what time horizon was the Brundtland
Commission contemplating when it offered its

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:09.620
definition of sustainable development?
Or let me frame the macro-issue of our times

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:14.820
as I see it this way.
We, individually and collectively -- that

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:56.980
is, humankind -- are an integral part of two
interrelated, intimately coexisting, global

00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:03.070
systems.
Let us call one of these the 'technosphere'.

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:07.160
The other key component of the technosphere,
besides ourselves, is the industrial system.

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:23.920
It's the way we access raw materials, and
then make, transport, use, and discard things,

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:24.920
employing technologies across the full spectrum
of technology -- electrical, mechanical, construction,

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:30.360
mining, metallurgical, textile, nuclear, agricultural,
ceramic, automotive, biotechnological as well

00:40:30.360 --> 00:41:30.800
as electronic, and semiconductor technologies
and any others that you can think of.

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:49.590
The technosphere, we, and the industrial system
coexist with the second global system -- the

00:41:49.590 --> 00:42:01.200
biosphere.
The biosphere consists of all the natural

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:06.550
systems, living systems, and the life support
systems of the earth -- the forests, the rivers,

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:08.020
the oceans, the wetlands, the atmosphere to
the ozone layer, to the aquifers, to the crop

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:09.020
lands, the grasslands, the hydrologic cycle,
the carbon cycle, including photosynthesis,

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:10.310
climate regulation, pollination, seed dispersal,
flood and insect control, and so on and so

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:11.310
forth -- and all of life on earth, including
us.

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:12.310
By the way, you might try to picture the Earth
without any one of those elements of the biosphere.

00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:55.480
So we have the technosphere, we have the biosphere,
and we have the co-existense of

00:42:55.480 --> 00:43:04.110
the two within a thin, spherical shell with
8,000 miles in diameter -- the diameter of

00:43:04.110 --> 00:44:28.120
the Earth -- and only about ten miles thick
extending from sea level, about five miles

00:44:28.120 --> 00:45:33.190
from the depths of the ocean, about five miles
into the troposphere.

00:45:33.190 --> 00:46:11.230
Notice that we humans are the common element
in both systems -- both spheres.

00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:24.720
And relatively speaking, the thin shell is
the thickness of ceramic for the basketball-sized

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:28.560
Earth.
In this context, maybe the good or better

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:36.960
definition of 'sustainability' might be -- if
I can be so bold -- "The contingent, healthy,

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:54.430
balanced coexistence into the indefinite future
of the technosphere and the biosphere within

00:46:54.430 --> 00:47:06.920
the thin shell."
Another name for the biosphere, of course,

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:19.380
is nature.
Yet, it's manifestly clear -- for anyone that

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:47.190
cares to look -- that this coexistence is
so unbalanced, so threatened, and it is not

00:47:47.190 --> 00:48:33.031
healthy -- Rachel Carson's 'wrong road'.
On a global scale, every living system is

00:48:33.031 --> 00:49:01.600
in decline -- biodiversity plummets, and extinction,
unprecedented in 65 million years, is underway

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:23.630
now.
The human footprint increases.

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:43.330
The planet's carrying capacity for humans
shrinks.

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:50.630
The planet warms.
The climate is disrupted.

00:49:50.630 --> 00:50:02.100
The weather goes nuts.
The technosphere continues to expand at nature's

00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:12.300
expense as the economy worships at the near-sacred
shrine of growth.

00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:24.070
The question arises, "How can this go on and
on and on and on into the indefinite future?"

00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:25.810
And the answer is clearly, "It cannot."
Unless we somehow miraculously find that the

00:50:25.810 --> 00:50:28.910
Earth is infinite in its ability to supply
the stuff demanded by the technosphere and

00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:33.140
infinite in its ability to absorb the poison
produced by the technosphere.

00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:47.640
This imbalance, this dysequilibrium, is a
serious problem.

00:50:47.640 --> 00:51:10.840
We've created, not only for ourselves, but
for our children and our grandchildren and

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:25.420
their grandchildren and beyond.
So how do we begin to reverse the negative

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:26.420
trends, eliminate this problem, and bring
these two systems -- technosphere and nature

00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:27.420
 -- into harmonious balance, in a way that
will last a thousand human generations, ten

00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:28.420
thousand human generations -- that is to say,
indefinitely?

00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:29.420
We should be very clear -- the longer we wait
to get started in earnest, the greater will

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:30.420
be the deficit that we and successive generations
have to overcome.

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:34.670
So I'm addressing the time horizon that extends
from now through a period of urgent, enormous,

00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:40.980
and essential transformation to a state of
global equilibrium between biosphere and technosphere

00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:48.270
in which the two will coexist in balance and
harmony, meaning the technosphere will be

00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:55.070
taking from the biosphere no more than the
biosphere can naturally and rapidly renew

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:59.930
with energy input from the sun into the indefinite
future.

00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:24.130
That, to me, is sustainability.
So how does the technosphere -- we in this

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:47.180
industrial system of ours -- move from its
present state to that ideal end state of equilibrium

00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:48.180
and remain there into the distant future?
Well, let's begin to answer that question

00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:49.180
by assessing where the industrial system is
now.

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:50.180
For starters, our society -- especially its
industrial system and essentially every corporation

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:51.180
anywhere -- is in the iron grip of Paul Andromic's
environmental impact equation.

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:52.180
I = P x B x T, from the Population Bomb, which
they published in 1997, in which I stands

00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:53.180
for 'environmental impact', a negative term
 -- the bigger, the worse.

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:54.180
P stands for population.
A for affluence, and T for technology in its

00:52:54.180 --> 00:53:03.220
broadest sense as I just described it.
This equation says that environmental impact

00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:18.990
 -- or degradation -- is caused by people
 -- the more, the worse.

00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:19.990
What they consume in their affluence -- the
more, the worse.

00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.990
And now, all of that is produced, used, and
disposed of -- the more technology, the worse.

00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.990
So at the heart of the current and ongoing
environmental decline is this take/make/waste

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.990
industrial system.
Making and supplying the stuff that we humans

00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:23.990
consume in our affluence and discard in our
thoughtlessness and technology too is a major

00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.990
part of the problem.
So our affluence and population.

00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:25.990
Population is a subject for another day, and
I make no effort here to deal with it nor

00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.990
in the book, but I will get to affluence in
a little while.

00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:29.350
But first, we must ask, What confines T to
the numerator where it contributes to the

00:53:29.350 --> 00:53:31.670
problem instead of to the solution?
Why does T multiply negative impacts?

00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:34.590
I suggest that this is because T in the numerator
accurately represents the technologists of

00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:35.940
the first Industrial Revolution. Call them
T1.

00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:38.080
We've grown up with these, and we take them
for granted.

00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:40.990
Consequently, the problem in our society and
its industrial system is they share some common

00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:42.540
attributes.
They are extractive -- they take from the

00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:43.540
Earth.
They are linear -- take/make/waste.

00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:45.930
Driven by energy from fossil fuels, wasteful
and abusive, and focused on labor productivity

00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:47.910
 -- more of everything per man hour.
So the Erlich equation could promptly be modified

00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:49.610
to read I = P x A x T1 in high-tech terms,
1.0.

00:53:49.610 --> 00:53:51.450
That describes our industrial system.
And I fairly suggest that the prevalence of

00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:53.430
T1 arises from the flawed view of reality
that underlies the industrial system -- or

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:54.430
paradigm -- that traces its roots to the earliest
days of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th

00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:55.430
century when people were the limiting factor
of production and nature was bountiful, seemingly

00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:56.430
inexhaustible.
This is a view of reality that assumes -- or

00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:57.430
acts as if it assumes -- that the Earth is
infinite in its ability to provide the stuff

00:53:57.430 --> 00:54:00.810
to feed the industrial system's metabolism
and infinite in its ability to absorb the

00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:03.220
system's waste no matter how much, no matter
how poisonous.

00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:06.610
Relevant time frames for considering the consequences
of our individual decisions are very short,

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:09.740
almost _____ beyond our own lifetimes, more
likely now beyond our working lives.

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:11.680
And business long-range planning is maybe
five years.

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:15.300
Politics and then to the election.
Earth was made for humans to conquer and rule.

00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:18.680
Homo sapiens don't really need those other
species, except for food and fiber, fuel,

00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:20.420
and maybe shade on a hot summer day.
Adam Smith, Invisible Hand in the Market,

00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:22.570
______.
Business exists to make a profit, the Milton

00:54:22.570 --> 00:54:24.960
Friedman school of thought.
Throughout ______ to increasing labor productivity,

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:28.300
more everything per man hour.
It was natural enough to think this way in

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:32.119
the 18th century when people were scarce and
nature was bountiful, Why not use nature to

00:54:32.119 --> 00:54:34.750
enhance human productivity?
It made perfect sense then, 300 years ago.

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:39.780
Technology, coupled with left-brained human
intelligence, practical, pragmatic, nonetheless

00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:42.120
driven, results-oriented will see us through.
Though the 'I' part of the equation stands

00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:43.120
in defiant contravention of this assumption.
There's more, but I expect you to get the

00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:44.120
drift.
I suggest that the view of reality represented

00:54:44.120 --> 00:55:57.490
by these beliefs is deeply flawed and it also
underlies the flawed system of economics that

00:55:57.490 --> 00:55:59.820
begins by describing the basic economic problem
that drives all economic progress as the gap

00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:01.520
between what we have and what we want -- not
need -- want.

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:04.000
This is the first lesson that Economics 101.
And economists tell us we can never close

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.470
that gap, because whatever we have, we will
always want more, and that that gap drives

00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:08.170
all economic progress.
It's also insisted that worship at the shrine

00:56:08.170 --> 00:56:10.340
of growth, without due consideration for what
should grow and what should not grow.

00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:11.340
And it is a system that ignores the externalities,
the costs to society, and innocent third parties

00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:12.340
that are inherent in so many of the transactions
that it fosters.

00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:13.340
As it establishes prices solely on the basis
of supply and demand without regard for true

00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:14.340
costs.
This, of course, renders the 'invisible hand'

00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:15.340
blind as a bat in its allocation of resources
as it stumbles along in its blindness ignoring

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:16.340
the consequences of its actions that are represented
by the externalities it creates.

00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:17.340
When we stand back and look at this system
and the mindset or the worldview that underlies

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:18.340
it, we cannot avoid the inevitable conclusion,
This system that takes from the earth whatever

00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:19.340
it wants, to produce products that quickly
end up in landfills and incinerators -- think

00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:20.340
of pollution -- wastes vast amounts of resources
all along the way, and does all of this with

00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:21.340
total indifference to society's costs simply
cannot go on and on and on.

00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:22.340
Its days of necessity are gone, because the
industrial system that stems from this worldview

00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:23.340
is destroying the biosphere that undergirds
the system itself.

00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:24.340
For you tell me, what company -- what economy
 -- can survive without air, clean water,

00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:25.340
food, energy, materials, climate regulation,
and ultraviolet radiation shield, pollination,

00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:26.340
seed dispersal, flood and insect control,
water purification and distribution, the hydrologic

00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:27.340
cycle, nutrient cycle, photo synthesis, and
more, all provided by nature?

00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:28.340
Without any one of these, there would be very
little economy at all.

00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:29.340
Nature, truly, is the goose that lays all
the golden eggs, and like the goose in Jack

00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:30.340
and the Bean Stalk, Nature is being squeezed
to death.

00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:31.340
If this is the state in which we -- the technosphere,
the industrial system, and ourselves -- find

00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:32.340
ourselves, where must we go from here, and
how?

00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:33.340
For starters, we must find a way to rewrite
the early impact equation, to break its iron

00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:34.340
grip, and move technology to the denominator.
Then technology would reduce environmental

00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:35.340
impacts and become part of the solution instead
of a major contributor to the problem.

00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:36.340
The mathematically-minded will see it immediately
 -- the bigger T becomes in the denominator,

00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:37.340
the smaller the environmental impacts become.
But what must happen in society for such a

00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:38.340
transformation to occur?
I suggest that the underlying mindset -- the

00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:39.340
paradigm, the view of reality -- must change.
And you look -- flawed view born of the 18th

00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:40.340
century, must be replaced by a new mindset
that acknowledges that the Earth is finite

00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:41.340
as a source and we can see it from space -- that
is it.

00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:42.340
Relevant time frames for considering the consequences
of our decisions are evolutionary in scale.

00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:43.340
We must grow up as a species and learn to
think beyond our individual lifetimes and

00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:44.340
our trivial self-interests.
Humankind was made for Earth, not the other

00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:45.340
way around.
The Earth doesn't belong to us; we belong

00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:46.340
to it.
And the diversity and vitality of nature are

00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:47.340
crucially important in keeping the whole realm
of life, including us, going sustainably over

00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:48.340
evolutionary time.
The blind, invisible hand of the market is

00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:49.340
a dishonest, opportunistic broker.
It will force any cost on society that an

00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:50.340
unwary or uncaring public will allow it to.
It must constantly be re-addressed to keep

00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:51.340
it honest and give it sight.
Business exists to make a profit?

00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:52.340
I beg to differ.
Business makes a profit to exist, not the

00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:53.340
other way around.
And while sure, the existence of a higher

00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:54.340
purpose, given this pervasive, global reach
in its power for good or evil, what CEO really

00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:55.340
expects to stand before her or his Maker someday
and discuss shareholder value?

00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:56.340
And what about technologies?
Technologies that are extracted, linear, take/make/waste,

00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:57.340
driven by fossil fuels, wasteful abuses, focused
on labor productivity emanating from a flawed

00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:58.340
concept are inherently unsustainable.
They do belong in the numerator where they

00:56:58.340 --> 00:56:59.340
multiply and drive environmental degradation.
To move to the denominator and become part

00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:00.340
of the solution, technologists must evolve
to become renewable, cyclical, driven by solar

00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:01.340
energy, waste-free, benign, and focused on
resource productivity -- the efficient use

00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:02.340
of all resources, not just labor.
I = [P x A] / T2.

00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:03.340
This is the new test for the viability and
suitability of technologies in the sustainable,

00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:04.340
industrial system and in the Corporation of
the Future.

00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:05.340
Do you see how T2 technologists emulate nature?
How interesting.

00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:06.340
Biomimicry at work on the very large stage
 -- cyclical, renewable, waste-free, focused

00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:07.340
on resource productivity -- that's the way
nature works.

00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:08.340
These two T2 technologies can also put people
 -- no longer scarce, but today an hopefully

00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:09.340
abundant resource -- to work in ways that
conserve nature, which is now the scarce and

00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:10.340
diminishing resource here in the 21st century.
For sure, the greatest moral and ethical and

00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:11.340
practical challenge humankind faces is lifting
the poorest among us out of grinding poverty

00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:12.340
 -- the 4 billion poorest among us out of
grinding poverty -- while simultaneously repairing

00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:13.340
an already badly damaged biosphere.
Resource efficiency.

00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:14.340
The efficient use of all the resources is
the route to abundance for all for an indefinite

00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:15.340
future on the finite Earth.
As for intelligence, what about right-brain

00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:16.340
intelligence?
-- the subjective, the caring, the nurturing,

00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:17.340
the artistic side of intelligence.
Perhaps it's a good bit more important than

00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:18.340
the left side, since it also represents the
human spirit.

00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:19.340
And therefore, the ascendancy of women in
business, in the professions, and in government

00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:20.340
is one of the most encouraging of all trends,
as women bring their right-brain nurturing

00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:21.340
nature to bear on the seemingly intractable
problems created by us left-brained men.

00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:22.340
So, if society adopts this new mindset, how
does it then shape the Corporation of the

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:23.340
Future, indeed, the industrial system of the
future that will survive and thrive as an

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:24.340
integral component of the technosphere that
is in harmony and balance with the biosphere

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:25.340
into the indefinite future?
Well, that sounds downright utopian, doesn't

00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:26.340
it?
Is it even possible?

00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:27.340
Well, the answer to the question "Is it possible?"
is found at the microlevel, and the answer

00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:28.340
is, "Yes, it is possible."
As Amory Lovins founder and chief scientist

00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:29.340
of the Rocky Mountain Institute often says,
"If something exists, it must be possible."

00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:30.340
I can quote Amory, because I speak here drawing
from the real life experiences of my company,

00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:31.340
Interface -- an example of what is coming
into existence, what is proving to be possible.

00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:32.340
And as for how -- in answer to the first question
 -- the Interface experience is the result

00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:33.340
of a plan for achieving zero environmental
footprint by the year 2020.

00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:34.340
This is the plan that is transforming a typical,
petrol-intensive company, for energy and materials

00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:35.340
of the 20th century into a prototypical sustainable
company of the 21st century.

00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:36.340
How we get there is the main focus of "Confessions."
I suggest out of strong conviction that, if

00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:37.340
Interface -- given its petroleum-intensive
nature -- can do it, any company can.

00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:38.340
If any company can, it follows that every
company can.

00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:39.340
That is to say, the entire industrial system
can.

00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:40.340
Well, how did such a conviction originate?
In 1994, as Anthony said, inspired by Paul

00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:41.340
Hawken's previous book, the Economy of Commerce,
I committed Interface to the path to sustainability

00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:42.340
and to the plan for achieving it.
Fifteen years ago -- despite the enormous

00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:43.340
challenge in having such an ambitious commitment
 -- we began at Interface, where every company

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:44.340
must begin where we were, as part of a supply
chain that took materials and energy, both

00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:45.340
fossil-derived, from the Earth, produced our
products in linear take/make/waste processes,

00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:46.340
sold those products into a marketplace where
they served their purpose typically for ten

00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:47.340
to 20 years, and then, were relegated to landfills
and incinerated -- long since forgotten by

00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:48.340
us, their maker.
We first created a schematic showing all the

00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:49.340
linkages of our company to the Earth -- it's
biosphere, it's lithosphere -- through our

00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:50.340
suppliers, our customers, the communities
in which we operated, and directly through

00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:51.340
our own people and processes and products.
I will not bore you with the details of the

00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:52.340
schematic, but we ask ourselves 15 years ago,
"What is wrong with this picture?" We asked

00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:53.340
this question when very few of any companies
anywhere were asking such a question of themselves.

00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:54.340
And out of that question came the plan for
realizing a new vision to climb a very high

00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:55.340
mountain clear to the top that pointed the
summit symbolizing 'zero impact'.

00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:56.340
We call this now 'sustainability'.
The challenge is hugely daunting.

00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:57.340
The commitment to reach the summit must be
equally unrelenting and unfaltering.

00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:58.340
The goal: To operate our petrol-intensive
company so as to take from the Earth only

00:57:58.340 --> 00:57:59.340
what the Earth can naturally and rapidly renew
and to do no harm to the biosphere.

00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:00.340
To get off oil completely.
To get off coal completely.

00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:01.340
And as we stood at this mountain for fully
a year, we identified seven faces of Mount

00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:02.340
Sustainability, and we set out to climb each
face to its own peak.

00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:03.340
And we hit the summit, which symbolizes "Zero
footprint, Zero impact by 2020." We call this

00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:04.340
"Mission Zero".
The first face of the mountain is to eliminate

00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:05.340
waste -- even the very concept of waste -- emulating
nature in our industrial processes.

00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:06.340
In nature, there's no waste.
One organism's waste is another organism's

00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:07.340
food.
The cost avoided by this effort through 2008,

00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:08.340
some $205 million to date have funded the
entire Mountain Plan, rendering sustainability

00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:09.340
self-funding.
The second face of the mountain is to ensure

00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:10.340
totally benign emissions, working upstream
with suppliers to establish the strings that

00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:11.340
eliminate all the harmful materials.
For whatever comes into our factories will

00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:12.340
go out -- as product, solid waste or liquid
effluent or gases and emissions.

00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:13.340
We will operate without smoke stacks and without
effluent pipes and for sure without toxic

00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:14.340
or greenhouse gases that contribute to climate
disruption.

00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:15.340
The third face in the mountain stop -- operate
on 100 percent renewable energy, concentrating

00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:16.340
on energy efficiency first to drive energy
usage to that irreducible minimum and then

00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:17.340
harnessing renewable sources of energy all
created verifiable offset to eliminate or

00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:18.340
neutralize all greenhouse gas contribution
to global climate disruption.

00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:19.340
The fourth face of the mountain is to close
the loophole material flows -- to capture

00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:20.340
precious, energy-intensive hydrocarbon molecules
into their first part of life and give them

00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:21.340
life after life and cyclical flows.
No more million take/make/waste processes

00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:22.340
with the cyclical processes too driven by
renewable energy.

00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:23.340
The technologies did not exist when we began
15 years ago, but now, they've fallen into

00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:24.340
place one by one.
This is not a "flavor of the month" exercise.

00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:25.340
It is a commitment of a lifetime.
The fifth face of the mountain is the transportation

00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:26.340
face -- to transport people and products in
pollution-free, resource-efficient, climate-neutral

00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:27.340
modes.
The sixth face is perhaps the most important

00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:28.340
of all -- sensitizing stakeholders.
This is the culture shift.

00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:29.340
This is changing the mindset that underlies
our presumption system -- and not just the

00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:30.340
mindset of our own people, of our suppliers
and customers and communities.

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.340
Without such a shift in mindset, no lasting
changes will occur.

00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:32.340
As Albert Einstein told us, "We cannot solve
our problems with the same thinking we used

00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:33.340
to create them."
Overcoming -- vitally necessary new thinking

00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:34.340
comes only out of a new mindset -- overcoming
the status quo.

00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:35.340
"We've always done it this way."
It's hard, but it is essential.

00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:36.340
And it does not happen without a willingness
to risk failure, but to learn from failure

00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:37.340
and try again.
The seventh face of the mountain calls for

00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:38.340
the redesign of commerce itself.
The new economy and the economy that seeks

00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:39.340
to satisfy needs rather than wants, internalizes
the externality of the prices, gets the prices

00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:40.340
right, and creates an honest, sighted market.
For many industrial companies like Interface

00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:41.340
this will eventually translate into going
to market with the services that our products

00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:42.340
rely on, rather than with the products themselves
 -- creating products as a means to an end,

00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:43.340
the end being satisfactory service delivered.
For Interface this translates into selling

00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:44.340
color and texture and design and comfort underfoot
and good ____ control and cleanliness and

00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:45.340
ambience and functionality, satisfying all
the reasons for which anyone would want our

00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:46.340
carpets in the first place, while repaying
the ownership of the means of delivery.

00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:47.340
Parenthetically, a chapter of Confessions
is devoted to each of the seven faces of the

00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:48.340
mountain -- that's just discussing how you
actually do what I have just described.

00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:49.340
Success on all seven faces of the mountain
will result in an entirely new schematic.

00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:50.340
Again, I'll spare you the tedium of the schematics.
But, you can see -- there are no linkages

00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:51.340
to the lithosphere -- to the raw materials.
And no linkages to the biosphere for waste

00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:52.340
and emissions.
How is our real-life example doing?

00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:53.340
How far has it come in 15 years on this 26-year-long
journey?

00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:54.340
Well, the following 2008 eco-metric tells
the story.

00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:55.340
Cumulative avoided waste costs, $405 million.
78 percent reduction in landfill waste, commuted

00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:56.340
production.
Water intake down 74 percent.

00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:57.340
Total energy usage down 44 percent per unit
of production.

00:58:57.340 --> 00:58:58.340
Fossil fuel intensity reduced by 60 percent.
Net greenhouse gases reduced 71 percent in

00:58:58.340 --> 00:58:59.340
absolute tonnage.
That translates into 82 percent reduction

00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:00.340
in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales.
28 percent of global energy from renewable

00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:01.340
sources.
24 percent of total raw materials recycled

00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:02.340
of bio-based materials.
One hundred percent renewable electricity

00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:03.340
in our European factories -- 89 percent worldwide.
83 million square yards of climate-neutral

00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:04.340
carpet produced since 2003, meaning climate
neutral from the well head and the mine cliff

00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:05.340
to the end of life reclamation -- the full
life cycle.

00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:06.340
Net zero on greenhouse gas emissions.
87,500 tons of reclaimed product, brought

00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:07.340
back from our reentry effort to close the
loop of material flow.

00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:08.340
So 191 million airline passenger miles offset
by the planting of some 98,000 trees, though

00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:09.340
admittedly, there's a timeline while the trees
grow.

00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:10.340
Overall footprint reduction, about 60 percent,
depending on how you weigh the individual

00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:11.340
components of it.
In case you're wondering, "Can a company do

00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:12.340
all this and not go broke?"
Save the last two metrics, sales up by 60

00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:13.340
percent over the same timeframe spanning the
deepest, longest recession in our industry's

00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:14.340
history in 2001 and 2003.
And profits double.

00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:15.340
The business case is crystal clear; costs
are down, not up -- dispelling a myth in the

00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:16.340
false ______ between the economy and the environment.
Waste elimination effort alone, $405 million,

00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:17.340
has paid the way here.
Products have not only been -- ever, sustainable

00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:18.340
design is a well-spring of innovation, especially
biomimicry.

00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:19.340
And I'll give you an example of that later.
People are galvanized around the shared purpose.

00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:20.340
You cannot beat attracting the best people
and bringing them together around a shared

00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:21.340
purpose.
Goodwill of the marketplace -- greater than

00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:22.340
any amount of advertising or clever marketing
at any cost could have created.

00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:23.340
And believe me, we know that goodwill is earned
every day by doing, not by talking.

00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:24.340
It is a better way -- a better way to bigger,
more legitimate profits -- a better business

00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:25.340
model.
Better for the planet and better for the shareholder.

00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:26.340
Now, coming back to the macro-case.
What about this sacred shrine of growth?

00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:27.340
Moving toward a sustainable society, what
should grow, and what should not grow?

00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:28.340
Well, here are some thoughts.
The lowest impact technologies -- those that

00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:29.340
belong in the denominator -- should grow.
The abusive technologies -- those that belong

00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:30.340
in the numerator -- should shrink and eventually
disappear.

00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:31.340
The sale of services should grow; the sale
of products should shrink.

00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:32.340
Applied brain power should grow; applied brute
force shrink.

00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:33.340
Market shares for the sustainable companies
should grow; for the unsustainable companies,

00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:34.340
market shares should shrink to zero.
At best, however, humanity faces a period

00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:35.340
of transition in which the equation will read
I = [P x A x T1] / T2 where T1 represents

00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:36.340
the unsustainable technologies, T2 the sustainable
technologies, and over time, T1 must give

00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:37.340
way to T2, until eventually only T2 is left.
But, can humanity realize a sustainable society,

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:38.340
even if the entire industrial system eventually
operates within the revised, _____ equations,

00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:39.340
I = [P x A] / T2?
I think not.

00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:40.340
For affluence is still represented by capital
A in that equation suggesting that affluence

00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:41.340
is an end in itself -- perhaps, the end.
And this just seems entirely too consistent

00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:42.340
with the old definition of the basic economic
problem, The gap between what you have and

00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:43.340
what you want.
What if, however, we homosapiens matured as

00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:44.340
a species to the point that the basic economic
problem were redefined as the gap between

00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:45.340
what we have and what we need?
What if that resulted from a reordering of

00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:46.340
priorities for individuals and societies so
that affluence can be represented by a lower

00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:47.340
case A instead of a capital A, suggesting
it to be a means to an end rather than an

00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:48.340
end or the end in itself?
And what if the true end we all seek, "Happiness",

00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:49.340
were injected into it and further revise early
equations?

00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:50.340
It would then read I = [P x a] / [T2 x H]
 -- more happiness with less stuff.

00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:51.340
That would redefine, not only the industrial
system but civilization itself, as well as

00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:52.340
capitalism and would open up the real possibility
for all human needs being met through a fair

00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:53.340
and efficient use of all resources, meeting
the challenge to lift the four billion poorest

00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:54.340
among us out of the grinding poverty, while
healing to the badly damaged biosphere.

00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:55.340
But can the Corporation of the Future that
I have described survive and thrive among

00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:56.340
such a reoriented set of societal priorities?
I suggest that only the Corporation of the

00:59:56.340 --> 00:59:57.340
Future as I have described -- organized and
meet needs sustainably -- can survive in such

00:59:57.340 --> 00:59:58.340
a reordered world into an indefinite future.
The typical corporation of the present will

00:59:58.340 --> 00:59:59.340
be the proverbial "fish out of water", and
will surely suffer the same fate as that unfortunate

00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:00.340
fish.
Environmental impacts must become vanishingly

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:01.340
small if humans even seven generations from
now -- much less 10,000 generations from now

01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:02.340
 -- are going to be born into a livable world.
Yet one might ask, "Isn't there a 'chicken

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:03.340
and an egg' problem here?" Will the transformed
society drive the transformation of the industrial

01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:04.340
system, or will a transformed industrial system
drive the transformation of society?

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:05.340
And the answer is "yes" and "yes", for the
critical breakthrough mutations have already

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:06.340
occurred.
The chicken -- the new species of company

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:07.340
 -- is being born right now.
So the two -- society and its new industrial

01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:08.340
system -- can co-evolve to the higher plane
where equilibrium between technosphere and

01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:09.340
biosphere is achieved at last.
And that, I believe, will create the foundation

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:10.340
for the new world order as well as the sustainable,
livable future for all generations to come.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.340
Lastly, the variable population, P, remains.
But actually, may not be as independent a

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:12.340
variable as it seems in the equation.
The forces that give rise to modify affluence

01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:13.340
and greater happiness -- in particular the
education of women around the world -- may

01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:14.340
very well influence population to a lower
level than the current even projection of

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:15.340
some nine billion people indicates.
But, as I said in the beginning, that's a

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:16.340
discussion for another day.
So let's go back again to the micro-level.

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:17.340
Perhaps you're asking, "What does this look
like on your factory floor? What's it look

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:18.340
like in your design studio?
Show me sustainability in action.

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:19.340
What changes?" Okay.
Come with me and see what sustainability looks

01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:20.340
like in just two examples in the time that's
left.

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:21.340
I tell you, engineers, production personnel,
and product designers collaborate to find

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:22.340
another way to create patterned carpet.
The conventional way -- employed for years

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:23.340
by the factory and its chief competitors -- is
to wet print carpet, wet print patterns on

01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:24.340
a plain coat of carpet base.
Wet printing is water-intensive and energy-intensive,

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:25.340
requiring an aqueous dye application, high
energy staining to fix the dye to the fabric,

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:26.340
washing to remove the excess unfixed dye,
and energy-intensive drying to remove the

01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:27.340
wash water.
Excess dye and wash water also require chemical

01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:28.340
treatment before being released into the waterways.
But new thinking -- what Einstein was talking

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:29.340
about -- suggests that the temping machine
that forms the power face of the carpet in

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:30.340
the first place as untapped potential to precisely
put tufts of yarn on selected colors that

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:31.340
form bright, intricate, and more durable patterns.
So the mode of conception is right, to burn

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:32.340
the bridges and abandon wet printing altogether
to scrap the existing strain of investment.

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:33.340
After only one means of creating patterns
which the marketplace demands, development

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:34.340
efforts resulted in entirely new families
of patented inventions giving them the factory

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:35.340
proprietary edge rather than handicap in this
marketplace.

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:36.340
Drastic reduction in resource consumption
of both water and energy.

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:37.340
One of those patented inventions arises from
the outrageous, ridiculous assignment by the

01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:38.340
head of design to his design team to go into
the forest and see how nature would design

01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:39.340
the floor covering.
"And don't come back with leaf designs," he

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:40.340
says.
"Come back with nature design principles."

01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:41.340
The head of design has read Biomimicry, by
Janine Benyus.

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:42.340
Biomimicry -- nature as teacher; nature as
inspiration; nature as mentor; nature as measure.

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:43.340
So the design team spent some days studying
on the forest floors in the stream beds, and

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:44.340
they finally come to realize, "There's total
diversity here -- even chaos.

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:45.340
No two things are alike."
No two sticks, no two leaves, no two stones,

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:46.340
no two squares yards of the forest floor are
the same.

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:47.340
Yet there's a pleasant orderliness in this
chaos.

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:48.340
So the designers go back to the design studio.
They design carpet tile such that the face

01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:49.340
designs of no two tiles are identical.
Although similar, but every one is different

01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:50.340
from all the others.
Now, how contrary is this to the prevailing,

01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:51.340
industrial paradigm that every master fiber
needs to be cookie-cutter same, six sigma,

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:52.340
in the formula?
The new product is introduced to the market

01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:53.340
with the name, "Entropy", scientific term
suggesting disorder.

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:54.340
And in a year and a half, it moves to the
top of the bestseller list, faster than any

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:55.340
other product ever has, and quickly becomes
the largest selling property tile in the district

01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:56.340
of the industries.
The advantages of breaking the old paradigm

01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:57.340
 -- this insistence on perfection and sameness
 -- are surprisingly humorous.

01:00:57.340 --> 01:00:58.340
There's almost no waste, no lost quality in
production.

01:00:58.340 --> 01:00:59.340
Inspectors cannot find defects among them.
[laughter] Deliver imperfection -- no two

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:00.340
tiles alike.
The installer can install now very quickly

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:01.340
without having to take the traditional care
to get the power map all running uniformly

01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:02.340
 -- the less uniform the better.
So he can just take tiles out of the box the

01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:03.340
way they come and install them randomly.
There's almost no scrap during installation,

01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:04.340
even a piece tile can find a place in the
installation.

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:05.340
And then, the user can actually rotate -- can
replace an individual damaged tile on the

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:06.340
floor without creating that silicon effect
that so typically comes with everything in

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:07.340
uniform and the new that's placed among the
old -- so the thumb.

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:08.340
Furthermore, there are no longer issues of
dye lots.

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:09.340
Dye lots emerged indistinguishably, which
obviates the need for shelf stock, and those

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:10.340
original tiles of the dye lot on the shelf
where you can be used.

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:11.340
And now, the user can even rotate the carpet
tiles on the floor to equalize where the way

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:12.340
you rotate tiles on my automobiles and makes
the length of replacement of damaged areas.

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:13.340
All of this is good for the environment through
increased resource efficiency.

01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:14.340
Nature, the inspiration, is anything but cookie-cutter
uniform.

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.340
She knows nothing about six sigma, yet she's
very effective and a great teacher.

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:16.340
And still, even with all of the unexpected
benefits of entropy, one wonders is there

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:17.340
still more to explain the success?
Well, perhaps there is.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.340
A speaker on the environmental speaking circuit
begins every speech by having her audience

01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:19.340
close their eyes, and in their minds' eye,
picture their own ideal place -- their own

01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:20.340
comfort zone -- that ideal place of peace
and repose and tranquility, serenity, creativity,

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:21.340
perfect comfort zone.
We might try it here. Humor me.

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:22.340
Everybody close your eyes, and in your mind's
eye, picture your ideal place of peace and

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:23.340
repose and tranquility, serenity, comfort
 -- your perfect comfort zone.

01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:24.340
You got it?
Now lift your hand high if you're somewhere

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:25.340
outdoors.
[chuckle] Look around you.

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:26.340
We humans gravitate to nature for that ideal
comfort zone.

01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:27.340
I've done this 500 times around the world,
and in no population does it vary.

01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:28.340
It's 90 percent plus of the audience raise
their hands.

01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:29.340
We humans gravitate to nature, and somehow
I think if we take outdoors/indoors in a subliminal

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:30.340
way, that is just real appeal.
Sustainability in action.

01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:31.340
I think Einstein would be pleased.
I'm out of time, and I thank you very much

01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:32.340
for being here.
You've been a terrific audience.

01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:33.340
It's time for questions.
I'm happy to take them.

01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:34.340
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:35.340
Q Thanks for letting me go outside in my mind.
I really like what you're saying here.

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:36.340
I wonder about getting there from here, of
course.

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:37.340
And something that I'm really concerned about
is the kind of -- the short-term, financial

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:38.340
decision making that can often stymie such
transformation.

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:39.340
I think you've made some good points that
there are sort of this false -- in many cases

01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:40.340
 -- assumption that sustainability equals
less profit, and that there are times where

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:41.340
you can make more profit by making more sustainable,
however, seems like a tough sell to a lot

01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:42.340
of people who manage money.
Is this compatible with our notions of fiduciary

01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:43.340
responsibility to shareholders etc.?

01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:44.340
A Show of hands is absolutely yes.
What we are learning at Interface is that,

01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:45.340
indeed, it is a better way.
And key to this better way, of course, is

01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:46.340
the support of the marketplace.
We operated in a marketplace that's heavily

01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:47.340
influenced by interior designers and architects
 -- people who really want to do the right

01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:48.340
thing.
So, in a sense, we were in a microcosm of

01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:49.340
the much larger market, but it's dominated
by people who really do want to do the right

01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:50.340
thing -- or heavily influenced.
So the name of the game is to spread that

01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:51.340
awareness that exists in the architecture/interior
design community to get to the population

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:52.340
in general.
So, ultimately, the power is with the people.

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:53.340
When Jeffrey Immelt, the CEO of General Electric,
commits to doubling his R and D from 750 million

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:54.340
a year to a billion and a half of clean technologies
expected the government's revenue from ten

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:55.340
billion to 20 billion in the sale of those
clean technologies, there's not an ounce of

01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:56.340
altruism in that.
He heard his customers.

01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:57.340
It's like, "We need these technologies."
And when the public wakes up to what a hell

01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:58.340
of a mess the Earth is in, and begins to demand
that every product, then you know, the marketplace

01:01:58.340 --> 01:01:59.340
is supporting the movement.
Deepak Chopra has a way of saying, "People

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:00.340
are doing the best they can, given their level
of awareness."

01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:01.340
This is all about raising level of awareness
and spreading that raised level of awareness

01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:02.340
throughout the population.
We're in a race against time.

01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:03.340
We literally are.
Put it this way.

01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:04.340
The First Industrial Revolution still goes
on. Okay?

01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:05.340
Extractive, abusive, waste, and that's Thomas
Newcomen's revolution.

01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:06.340
He started it in 1712 when he invented the
steam-driven pump to pump water out of the

01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:07.340
English ____ mines so miners could mine more
coal.

01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:08.340
The Second Industrial Revolution that I'm
referring to here in the comments is Rachel

01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:09.340
Carson, revolution she started in 1962.
And here we are 47 years into Rachel Carson's

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:10.340
revolution.
When we were 47 years into Thomas Newcomen's

01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:11.340
revolution, the cotton gin had not yet been
invented.

01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:12.340
So it's really early days revolution's gun
but the problem is we don't have the time.

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:13.340
We don't have the luxury of time for this
revolution to unfold.

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:14.340
It's incumbent on all of us to push the boy
as high as we can, as quickly as we can.

01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:15.340
Yes?

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:16.340
Q Thanks for your talk.
Could you tell me what you would do as a CEO

01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:17.340
in an auto industry?
Maybe name a few of the things that you'd

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:18.340
go after, examples of changes you put those
teams to work in?

01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:19.340
A Well, it clearly would have taken a new
kind of thinking ten, 15 years ago in that

01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:20.340
industry.
And I wouldn't preclude to know anything about

01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:21.340
the automobile industry, except that you can
look around and you see examples of who stole

01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:22.340
the march on whom.
And Toyota most certainly did, without going

01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:23.340
after the happening technology dominating
that field today.

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:24.340
So the things that could be done ought to
have been done 15 years ago, and now they're

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:25.340
down a deep hole and dig out of it.
It's just that simple.

01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:26.340
And I suspect that only those who are really
thinking about their business very differently

01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:27.340
will survive.
But I don't know what that different thinking

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:28.340
actually means.

01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:29.340
Q You commented about awareness being a function
of making the change and you know in ____

01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:30.340
economic system almost every economic decision
also comes down to money.

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:31.340
And if you don't have the awareness, then
sometimes price is a good substitute in order

01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:32.340
to encourage people to make that awareness.
How do you make this change relatively obvious

01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:33.340
so it scales faster?

01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:34.340
A Yeah. I really think government has a role
to play.

01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:35.340
In my mind, government's the greatest power.
It's not just regulatory power, which is vast

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:36.340
and it runs the way we are for good.
But its greatest power is its taxation and

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:37.340
subsidy power.
And we very much need for government to get

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:38.340
involved to put a price on carbon, especially
with respect to global climate disruption.

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:39.340
Carbon has had a free ride forever, and we
all know that there's no such thing as a free

01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:40.340
lunch.
So we pay for carbon, but in an indirect way.

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:41.340
It's like rising sea levels and the dikes
that have to be built to protect Miami and

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:42.340
New York City in the future.
And the price of wars in the Middle East to

01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:43.340
put back the oil in the source and so on so
forth.

01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:44.340
The externalities are there. We're paying
for them.

01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:45.340
We need to be paying for those directly through
the price of carbon.

01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:46.340
And then, that would put our minds where the
problem really is and would level the playing

01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:47.340
field between the new technologies and the
old.

01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:48.340
And you would see the new technologies surge
if there were a level playing field and fossil

01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:49.340
fuels were priced properly.

01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:50.340
Q So this is the end of Ray's talk, but if
you'd like to join us for lunch, we're going

01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:51.340
to go to Charlie's Cafe.
So with that, thank Ray for joining us today.

01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:51.341
