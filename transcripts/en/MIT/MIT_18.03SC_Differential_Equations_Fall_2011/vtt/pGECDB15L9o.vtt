00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.170
PROFESSOR: Hi everyone.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.380
Welcome back.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.310
So today, I'd like
to tackle a problem

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.550
in undetermined
coefficients, specifically

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.190
find a particular
solution to each

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.220
of the following equations
using undetermined coefficients.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.820
So for part A, we have
x dot plus 3x equals

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.760
t squared plus t.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.500
And for B, we have x dot
dot plus x dot equals t

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.857
to the four.

00:00:28.857 --> 00:00:30.440
So I'll let you work
this problem out.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.731
And I'll come back in a minute.

00:00:42.386 --> 00:00:43.490
Hi Everyone.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.570
Welcome back.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.820
So we're asked to solve this
problem using the method

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.520
of undetermined coefficients.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.950
And specifically, the
observation is if we have

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.892
a differential equation
with constant coefficients,

00:00:55.892 --> 00:00:58.100
and we have a forcing on
the right-hand side which is

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.110
a polynomial, then there's
always going to be a particular

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.260
solution, which is a polynomial,
that has the form of some

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:17.410
constant times t to the power
of r plus constant t^(r-1) plus

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:25.222
a constant c_(r-2) t^(r-2)
plus dot, dot, dot,

00:01:25.222 --> 00:01:31.100
plus c_1*t and then
possibly plus c_0.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.730
And typically, the
problem is to find out

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.560
what's the highest-order
polynomial that we

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.310
should guess.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.700
These constant c's,
they're referred to as

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.840
the undetermined coefficients.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.265
And these are the constants
that we seek to solve.

00:01:48.265 --> 00:01:49.890
So for our first
differential equation,

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:59.040
we have x dot plus 3x
equals t squared plus t.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.650
And the power that we
should guess for a solution

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.860
are, it's always going to be
at least as high as the highest

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.400
power on the right-hand side.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.259
So the right-hand side tells
us at least the largest

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.030
that we should at least
start our guess at.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.536
And then, sometimes, we have
to knock it up a few orders

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:18.410
depending on what the
lowest-order derivative

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.470
on the left-hand side is.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.450
So in this case, the term
on the left-hand side,

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.722
there's no derivative term.

00:02:27.722 --> 00:02:29.180
And so what we can
do for this case

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.680
is we can just take
r is equal to 2,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.120
the power of the polynomial
on the right-hand side.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.640
So we're going to seek
a guess or an ansatz,

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.810
which is some constant
A times t squared

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.570
plus B times t plus
some constant C.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.890
And again, I've taken
the highest polynomial

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.810
that we should guess to be 2,
because the right-hand side is

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.057
2 in this case.

00:02:57.057 --> 00:02:58.890
So now what we do is
we just substitute this

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.620
in into the
differential equation.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.420
And we choose our A, B, and C
to construct this as a solution.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.410
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:17.310
So taking its derivative, we
have 2A*t plus B. And then,

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:25.190
we have 3 times A*t
squared plus B*t plus C.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.015
And we want this to be
equal to t squared plus t.

00:03:29.015 --> 00:03:30.890
And now, the only way
that the left-hand side

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.500
is going to equal
the right-hand side

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.960
is if the coefficients in
front of each polynomial

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.420
are the same.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.150
So in the left-hand
side, we only

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.660
have one term that
has a t squared in it.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.850
And that must, therefore,
equal the t squared term

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.810
on the right-hand side.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.410
So these two terms have
to be equal to each other.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.770
So we end up getting that
3A has to be equal 1.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.330
And so A is equal to one third.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.000
And now what we do is we
collect terms with a power of t.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.790
This gives us 3B plus 2A
on the left-hand side,

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.300
so that's this
term and this term.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.470
And we want that t equal t on
the right-hand side or just 1.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.450
Now, we already know that
A is equal to one third.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:34.500
So we end up getting that
3B is equal to 1 minus 2/3,

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.880
which is equal to one third.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.800
Put 3B as one third, which
means that B is equal to 1/9.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.800
And now lastly,
to determine C, we

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.410
see that B plus 3C must be 0.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:00.980
So B plus 3C is 0, or C
is equal to negative 1/27.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.660
So notice how we always
start with the highest power.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.640
In this case, A
is the coefficient

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.420
in front of t squared.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.940
That lets us solve
for A. And then

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.970
the rest of the
undetermined coefficients,

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.920
we can solve for, almost
like a giant zipper.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.600
So the particular solution
that we just constructed,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:37.065
when the dust settles is 1/3 t
squared plus 1/9 t minus 1/27.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.770
So this concludes part A.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.250
For part B, we have the
differential equation

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:54.021
x dot dot plus x dot
equals t to the four.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.360
And in this case, we know
that the right-hand side

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.080
is a power of four.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.840
So we should guess at least
a fourth-order polynomial.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.290
However, we see that there's
no constant multiple of x.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.074
In fact, the lowest-order
derivative is 1.

00:06:12.074 --> 00:06:13.740
So what this means
is we should actually

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.040
knock the solution that we
guess up one order polynomial.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.770
So we should try and guess x is
equal to A t to the fifth plus

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:34.540
B t to the four plus C t cubed
plus D t squared plus E*t.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.340
And we can leave out an F term.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.065
We can leave out a constant.

00:06:38.065 --> 00:06:40.440
Because if we just substitute
that in the left-hand side,

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.630
we see that the x dot dot is
going to vanish, and x dot

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:45.650
is going to vanish.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.960
So we can omit
any constant term.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.980
So let's seek this
ansatz, and plug it

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.520
into the differential equation.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:00.050
And if we do that,
we get 20A t cubed.

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.400
And this is plugging
into the x dot dot term.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:21.190
This term is going to give us
12B t squared plus 6C*t plus D.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:28.550
And then the x dot term is going
to give us 5A t to the four

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:49.290
plus 4B t cubed plus 3C t
squared plus 2D*t plus E.

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:53.870
And we want the sum of these two
terms to equal t to the four.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.004
So again, what we do is we
start with the highest power.

00:08:01.004 --> 00:08:02.420
We see that on the
left-hand side,

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:07.380
we have 5A must be
equated with just 1.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:12.190
So we have 5A is equal to
1, or A is equal to 1/5.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:21.860
Secondly, we're
going to have 20A

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:28.900
plus 4B equals the 0
polynomial, or the 0 which

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.380
is the coefficient of t cubed.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:36.150
And this gives us B is
equal to negative 5A, which

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:36.890
is negative 1.

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:50.150
And now for the quadratic
terms, we have 12B plus 3C is 0.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:54.810
So C is going to equal
negative 4B, which

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:58.570
is negative 4 times negative
1, which just gives us 4.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:12.960
The linear term is going
to give us 6C plus 2D

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:20.860
equals 0, which gives us
D is equal to negative 3C,

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.880
which gives us negative 12.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:29.180
And then the last
term is D plus E

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:35.190
is 0, which gives
us E is equal to 12.

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:36.830
So at the end of
the day, we end up

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:41.260
with a particular
solution, which

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:50.210
is a polynomial of 1/5 t to
the five minus 2 to the four

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:56.190
plus C, which is 4, t cubed
plus D, which is negative 12,

00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:03.870
t squared plus E,
which is 12, times t.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.250
And by construction,
this polynomial

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.710
solves the differential
equation with a forcing of t

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.610
to the four on the
right-hand side.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:15.330
So just to recap,
when we're faced

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.670
with an undetermined coefficient
problem, what we have to do

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:21.880
is we just guess a solution,
which is a polynomial.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.370
And the main difficulty is
just guessing the highest power

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.100
of the polynomial.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.040
And that's always going to be at
least as big as the polynomial

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.420
on the right-hand side.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.360
But as we saw in
part B, we sometimes

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.480
have to knock it up a
few orders depending

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.610
on what the differential
equation actually is.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:39.940
So I'd like to conclude here.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.240
And I'll see you next time.
