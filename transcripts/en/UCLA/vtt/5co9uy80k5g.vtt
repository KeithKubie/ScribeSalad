00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.040
Listen up y’all.  No need to rush nothing on defense.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.260
Cut-off man, get out there.  Get your cut-off.
 Stop them extra bases today. No mistakes.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.140
Small mistakes, let 'em go.
Keep on rolling. Stay focused.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.900
Various: On three. 1,2,3 win.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.420
Who are we? Coast Crips,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.740
Batting order. Parnell, Tyrell, Stan, Little BK, Tiny Dog, etc…T-Dog.  Let’s go

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.660
The San Pedro baseball diamond is a neutral site
for these teams of ex-gang members.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.080
Raymond Avenue Crips, Rollin' 90s, 
Compton Santana,  East Coast

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.960
The competition will be fierce.
They all have something to prove.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:12.120
Watching intently are UCLA professor emeritus
Wellford ‘Buzz’ Wilms and former Raymond Crip Reynaldo ‘Wiz’ Reaser.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.760
Their collaboration stems from Buzz’s expertise in conflict mediation

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.800
and Rey’s desire to correct a problem from the inside-out.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.580
You know the gang life was more of a family.
More of a protection of a community itself.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.180
And at some point it just went way left.
  Just violence, senseless violence.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.060
And it was wrong.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.900
Wilms says violence, drugs and guns—
coupled with a deep mistrust of law enforcement

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.760
—have allowed street gangs to remain entrenched in their neighborhoods.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.500
A cycle that’s persisted for decades.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.100
The gangs are only a symptom of these communities 
that have been so beleaguered for so long.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.640
It’s in the fabric of the neighborhoods.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.860
But Wilms, who has spent years in South LA, also sees
what he calls ‘a new social fabric in the making.’

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.740
And it’s weaving together gang members,
 cops and UCLA students.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.360
If I had a dream, it’s we’d somehow find a way
to really connect UCLA with South LA.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.180
Because we sit here all by ourselves.
And they sit down there all by themselves

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.400
and there are very few bridges between us.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.620
For most of those students, you can say like
“we’re going to…the teacher will say we’re going to call security.”

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.260
And the kids are like, “OK ,Cool.” Because they
know exactly where they’re going

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.000
and they’d rather stay in the office
than sit in the classroom.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.140
So a big one for me was, how are we able to talk to
these kids without taking them away

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.100
from a classroom environment,
which is what they want.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.020
Well, the basics of it came from Avis in 1998.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.240
She trained me, along with 35 other people, as a mediator.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.200
Because the kind of training she did was really good,
I thought what better place for it than the schools.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.400
And then this idea—a light bulb went on in my head—Avis!

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.940
I called Avis up and I said, ‘would you be willing 
to come to UCLA to co-design and

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.800
co-teach a course with me in conflict resolution?
Basically, what you taught me.’

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:32.540
More than 500 undergrads have taken the course.
The first quarter is spent training them in mediation techniques.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:39.680
The second and the optional third quarter
 has the students
assigned to some of the toughest schools in the county.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.280
As I began to wake up to the reality of Los Angeles,

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.220
I started talking with Avis.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.520
Let’s focus on South LA because 
that’s where the need really is.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.580
Every school has the need but where the need 
is really great is in South LA.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.340
Where conflict is part of the air that people breathe.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.840
One team went to Horace Mann Middle School
near Florence and Western.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.980
Another landed at the Manchester Avenue campus
of Soledad Enrichment Action.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.040
Both schools are chaotic to a certain degree.
Because Horace Mann is just starting up

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.780
this partnership with UCLA, having lost
the vast majority of its students.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.960
So it took a while for us to get our footing there,
know who we are and what our students can do.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:45.620
On our very last day they gave us a list of students
and their conflicts.  And we’re kinda like, OK,

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.480
we don’t know what to do with this now but
we’ll hand it over to the next mediators;

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.500
so, at least they can go in and say “we’re mediators.
Can you give us the list” and they’ll have the list.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.540
Yeah, where at the beginning it was definitely was a little
bit frustrating because, ‘who do we talk to?’

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.760
And at the end it was kind of cool because
we did become the leaders of this program.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.480
To try and move forward and do things
the way we wanted to see them be done.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.840
The fact that we have backstories and stuff now
—which is great—

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.860
but also when they’re here they need to know
that this is what we’re going to do.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.400
We’re going to sit down and do introductions,
get to know each other.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.680
The team at Horace Mann found themselves doing
much more than just conflict mediation.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:35.340
They were mentors, advisors and confidants
—sometimes just doing damage control.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.540
At Soledad, which is also known as SEA,
the stakes are higher.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:48.700
And SEA is just a unique little school that operates with
less than a hundred students.  It’s a charter school.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.700
And they take the kids that have nowhere else to go.
They’ve bombed out of LAUSD.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.980
So we’re dealing with the least-advantaged
students in the whole city.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.220
Our students got experience they would get
in no other way.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.220
We discussed identity, police culture
and dealing with anger.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.460
And the dealing with anger one actually came as a result of…

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.380
there was a fight that broke out the day that
we were there on one Thursday.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.760
I was that student when people came in
and tried to do programs in the school.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.520
I was like, ‘what are you doing here, you know.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.400
You don’t know anything about me and you can’t relate
to me.  Why are you trying to impose your stuff on me.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.280
So, definitely it was just a lot of establishing yourself
as a person within the community.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.320
The second floor at SEA has areas set aside
for the mentors, mediators and interventionists

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.600
working to reduce gang crime and violence.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.320
In one room, tacked up on the bulletin board
are funeral programs.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.800
Young victims from neighborhoods
where being outside comes with risks.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:00.800
Today, Buzz is there to discuss a project with Reynaldo
and Kevin Orange—formerly a Hoover Crip.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.640
When you’re dealing with gang violence, most of
the time it starts with something that’s isolated.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.720
Between two people. They don’t have an understanding.
Or how to resolve a conflict.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:16.560
But when you have the tools of a mediator you get to
hear and listen to where you can discuss things.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:23.080
And somebody can say something anywhere that can
cause a whole community to be at war for 40 years.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:29.760
In 2016, Reynaldo organized a softball tournament with
teams entered from several different neighborhoods—

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.160
—some with a long history.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.840
The Pete Carroll Foundation picked up the costs for
uniforms, umpires and playing field rentals.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:45.160
Well I started this softball tournament to
unite a lot of different neighborhoods together.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.360
But, it’s not particularly for the gangs.
It’s for the community.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.120
Because we want the community
 relationship with the gangs.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.960
It was a good start but Reynaldo thought
it could be much more.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.160
What if each team had a trained
mediator—an ambassador,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.480
creating a pathway that would take
these skills into the neighborhoods.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:12.960
Reynaldo came to us and said, ‘would you 
be willing to train these ambassadors?’

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.360
And I thought, hmmm, here’s an
 opportunity for our students.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:23.000
And Reynaldo and I sat with them and said, 
‘would you be willing, under my supervision,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.320
to be the trainers of these ambassadors?’

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.560
These men, and one woman, they’ve all been incarcerated,

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:34.280
they’ve all been part of gangs and they want to see that end.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:43.080
It’s breaking the barriers.  As long as we keep saying
that ‘can’t go here, can’t go there’ you know.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:49.120
We will always be stuck.  We’ll always be living
that war zone mentality.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:55.040
Being trained as mediators will help us 
deal with a lot of the conflict.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.080
And like I said, the ultimate goal is to help ourselves.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:03.200
Because if we not in control of ourselves 
then we no good.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.800
Helen Keller Park sits at the southern tip of the Vermont Corridor.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.720
Law enforcement calls it ‘death alley’
due to the high homicide rate.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.360
The recklessness of these brazen murders 
and assaults shook the community to the core

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.080
as residents did not feel safe enough
to leave their own homes.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.080
It’s where the Raymond Crips would
carry out initiations and plot trouble.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.400
Today it’s a focal point for the community.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:46.000
And for five weeks it’s where the UCLA students worked with people
 like Green, Casanova, Snoop and Mott in the art of mediation.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:55.640
I need to check some ID.  Wait, hold on. (Overtalk).
Why you being so hostile?
(Overtalk)  Can I talk to you a minute officer?

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:07.760
I’m the gang interventionist over here.  They’re just having a friendly softball game. (Overtalk)

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:15.960
But I’m just saying you come over to us and (overtalk).

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:25.160
The first week, they was tensing up. Everybody was 
like, OK. Like they didn’t know what to expect.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.880
The next week they come in and they’re more relaxed.  They’re giggling.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.920
And now, we ask the same question and answer
session.  It’s ‘how do you feel today?’

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.360
‘Oh, I’m relieved. I thought it was something different.’

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:45.800
Just a stereotype.  You know, we’re not a threat
and people look at us as a threat.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:52.320
Our students gave, I think, something of great value.
But, they got something great in return,

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:57.280
which was a friendship; because that formed bonds between them.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.720
They would talk very openly and comfortably with each other.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.800
We were no longer the people from UCLA
coming down to train the people in South LA.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.880
It was a two-way street where the students were 
getting something of equal if not greater value.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:17.560
We already know how to talk to our own folks.
But, y’all showed us another way to.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.600
You know what I’m saying.  Without being so hostile,

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:25.800
with eight different communities here on a Saturday,
playing these games, how many lives we just saved.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.760
So, if the baseball games pass without incident
—which I’m pretty sure they will—

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:39.040
Then this all a path, one of many paths
to bring peace to South LA.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:46.040
With additional funding from the Pete Carroll Foundation,
they played a full slate of games throughout the summer.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.680
We got our ambassadors.  If you have any disputes,

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.960
call them to you, talk to them, get that worked out.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.840
UMP: Great.  Appreciate that.  Thanks for your support.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.640
The majority of them have been
trained as ambassadors.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.280
We have an ambassador for every neighborhood
that comes and participates.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:10.720
And everybody that comes in knows how to deal with 
issues on the field, off the field, in our community.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.320
All right home team take the field.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.560
On this Saturday, they played four games.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.360
The talent pool varied widely.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.300
There was plenty of spirited trash talking, 
but when the games ended,

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.640
it was with sportsmanship and respect.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.280
We come here each week to bring something positive
to all the different neighborhoods.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:36.520
At one time there was no way any of these neighborhoods
could have got together in this park and did anything.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:41.640
And now, you can have eight different neighborhoods
in a park at one time; having fun.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.000
We can all take a loss now and it doesn’t have to go to,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.680
“well, I’m gonna go here and get this weapon
and do something to somebody.”

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:54.000
We can say now, “all right, you got me this time.
We’ll get you next time on the field.”

00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:01.560
That way we can always come back and continue to
fight the good struggle instead of the bad struggle.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:08.920
For Buzz, there is no doubt that these 
efforts to dial down the violence are working.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.400
Crime statistics offer some evidence to back that up.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.800
And Reynaldo says there are several more 
neighborhoods that want to be a part of this.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:24.880
Putting interventionists, ambassadors and mediators
into the mix is moving the effort forward

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:29.400
with some help from the students of Restoring Civility.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:36.520
I hope that they, like me, come to a deeper understanding 
of South Los Angeles and the people in it.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.800
We don’t understand it. We’re afraid of it.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.520
It does not come naturally to most of us 
to walk in that environment.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.720
So, that when they become… some of them are
going to become teachers and counselors,

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.680
that they don’t shy away from going to those schools.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:55.080
That they actually have an understanding of
what those communities have to offer.
