00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
To answer this we're going to use this trick,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and that means we need to get p(x).

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Let's call the highly actives in our sample x to simplify our notation.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So, we need that less than 2 and that is going to be

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:34.000
equal to p(x = 0) + p(x = 1).

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Each of these is a binomial variable.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Recall what we need to figure out is the probability of the result being true--

00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the probability of getting a highly-active user--p(x) = 1000/100,000, which is 0.01.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The probability of x = 0--since this can only be arranged one way

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:22.000
we don't even need to know about binomials--is 0.99¹⁰.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The probability of x equaling 1 is going to be 10!/9!1!.  0.99⁹  0.01¹.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So, if we total this all together, we get [0.099573],

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and then we'll recall from this formula over here we wanted the opposite thing,

00:01:57.000 --> 99:59:59.000
so we just take 1 minus, this equals our answer.
