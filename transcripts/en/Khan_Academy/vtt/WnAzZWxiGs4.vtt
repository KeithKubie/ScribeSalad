00:00:00.477 --> 00:00:01.667
- [Instructor] Hello, grammarians.

00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:03.205
Continuing our journey through the world

00:00:03.205 --> 00:00:04.995
of frequently confused words,

00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:08.325
I'd like to begin with
complement with two Es

00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:11.183
and compliment with an I and an E.

00:00:11.183 --> 00:00:14.397
How the heck do we keep these separate?

00:00:14.397 --> 00:00:17.499
Well, first let's get some definitions.

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:21.516
Complement with two Es, C,
O, M, P, L, E, M, E, N, T,

00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:22.724
is a verb,

00:00:22.724 --> 00:00:27.542
and it means to match, pair,
or work well with something

00:00:27.542 --> 00:00:31.375
as in, that hat complements
your suit, Melvin.

00:00:32.296 --> 00:00:33.897
There's our guy Melvin.

00:00:33.897 --> 00:00:37.112
There's his very fine hat in
the same color as his suit,

00:00:37.112 --> 00:00:40.620
so it matches or pairs or
works well with something

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.677
'cause these are the same colors.

00:00:41.677 --> 00:00:43.412
They look nice together,

00:00:43.412 --> 00:00:46.031
maybe a little matchy matchy.

00:00:46.031 --> 00:00:48.364
Give him some gold epaulets.

00:00:49.345 --> 00:00:50.645
Shake it up a little bit, Melvin.

00:00:50.645 --> 00:00:51.702
There you go.

00:00:51.702 --> 00:00:56.555
Compliment, with an I, C,
O, M, P, L, I, M, E, N, T,

00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:59.417
is a verb that means to praise

00:00:59.417 --> 00:01:02.000
or noun that just means praise.

00:01:04.236 --> 00:01:07.962
So complement with an E is
the verb of actually matching,

00:01:07.962 --> 00:01:09.832
but when we point it out,

00:01:09.832 --> 00:01:12.553
and we say, that hat
complements your suit, Melvin,

00:01:12.553 --> 00:01:14.283
and we say, that looks
pretty good, Melvin,

00:01:14.283 --> 00:01:17.467
that in itself is a compliment.

00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:18.800
So this sentence

00:01:20.184 --> 00:01:21.414
is a compliment.

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:23.424
So Melvin would say in response,

00:01:23.424 --> 00:01:25.945
"Thank you for the compliment."

00:01:25.945 --> 00:01:28.091
So I can see how this is confusing,

00:01:28.091 --> 00:01:30.093
so when two things go together well,

00:01:30.093 --> 00:01:32.843
visually or sonically or however,

00:01:33.782 --> 00:01:35.998
you say they complement one another.

00:01:35.998 --> 00:01:37.663
When two people work well as a team,

00:01:37.663 --> 00:01:41.001
you can say their skills
complement one another,

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:42.500
and if you point that out

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.318
in a way that is praiseworthy,

00:01:44.318 --> 00:01:47.880
if you say, "Ah, Melvin,
that is a dope ensemble

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.239
"you are rocking today,"

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:51.998
that is a compliment with an I.

00:01:51.998 --> 00:01:54.076
So you are praising it.

00:01:54.076 --> 00:01:55.653
This one is a classic.

00:01:55.653 --> 00:01:58.552
So we've got desert over here

00:01:58.552 --> 00:02:01.100
and dessert over here,

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.065
so these words look a little similar,

00:02:04.065 --> 00:02:05.785
but they are pronounced differently,

00:02:05.785 --> 00:02:07.547
which is to our benefit.

00:02:07.547 --> 00:02:08.583
So these are both nouns,

00:02:08.583 --> 00:02:11.750
so desert with a zuh sound, zuh,

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.127
is dry, sandy land.

00:02:14.127 --> 00:02:17.290
So for example, this is a
depiction of the Sonoran Desert

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.369
in Arizona and Mexico.

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:22.039
Right, so this is a saguaro cactus.

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.982
That there's a barrel cactus.

00:02:24.982 --> 00:02:26.897
That's a palo verde.

00:02:26.897 --> 00:02:28.841
There's a little kit fox.

00:02:28.841 --> 00:02:31.569
So when you see desert with one S

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.113
as opposed to dessert with two Ss,

00:02:34.113 --> 00:02:36.777
what I want you to imagine is water,

00:02:36.777 --> 00:02:38.527
a long, flowing river

00:02:41.155 --> 00:02:44.397
made of Ss and that
when you're in a desert,

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:45.756
there just isn't as much.

00:02:45.756 --> 00:02:47.132
There isn't as much water.

00:02:47.132 --> 00:02:50.059
So one S means less water,

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:54.215
means cacti and little kit
foxes and gila monsters.

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:58.215
Dessert with two Ss is
like an ice cream sundae.

00:03:00.245 --> 00:03:02.285
We got some vanilla ice cream.

00:03:02.285 --> 00:03:05.216
We got some strawberry ice cream,

00:03:05.216 --> 00:03:07.695
and then this black ice
cream is licorice ice cream,

00:03:07.695 --> 00:03:08.876
which is actually delicious,

00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:10.626
and I encourage you to try it,

00:03:10.626 --> 00:03:12.709
and then this, if you
couldn't tell, is a banana.

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:13.782
So what is a dessert?

00:03:13.782 --> 00:03:15.886
So a dessert is a noun,

00:03:15.886 --> 00:03:19.094
and it is a sweet food eaten after a meal.

00:03:19.094 --> 00:03:21.534
Certainly it doesn't have
to be this banana split,

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:22.422
this ice cream sundae.

00:03:22.422 --> 00:03:24.344
It could be anything sweet,

00:03:24.344 --> 00:03:26.915
so cookies, cake, chocolate,

00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:30.181
the sorts of things that you
would not find in a desert.

00:03:30.181 --> 00:03:32.140
So keeping these two words straight,

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.823
desert and dessert, is
really one of abundance.

00:03:35.823 --> 00:03:37.068
When there's two Ss,

00:03:37.068 --> 00:03:39.493
it means, oh, times are good.

00:03:39.493 --> 00:03:40.381
We're doing so well.

00:03:40.381 --> 00:03:42.214
We can have ice cream.

00:03:43.082 --> 00:03:44.870
If you're missing that second S,

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.940
it means things are a little lean.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.636
There's not a lot of water.

00:03:49.636 --> 00:03:53.571
There's a lot of cacti and rattlesnakes.

00:03:53.571 --> 00:03:54.404
Don't get me wrong.

00:03:54.404 --> 00:03:57.785
I have had some excellent
desserts with two Ss

00:03:57.785 --> 00:03:59.631
in desert places.

00:03:59.631 --> 00:04:02.227
There happens to be a
very fine ice cream parlor

00:04:02.227 --> 00:04:03.270
in Scottsdale, Arizona,

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.739
but what I'm trying to say is

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.879
that in the landform that
we call a desert with one S,

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.254
you are unlikely to
find an ice cream sundae

00:04:11.254 --> 00:04:12.731
just sitting out.

00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:13.840
You can learn anything.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.673
David, out.
