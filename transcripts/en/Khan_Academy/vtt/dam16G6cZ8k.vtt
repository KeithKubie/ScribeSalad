00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.700
You've opened up a
shoe factory and you're

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.020
trying to figure out how many
thousands of pairs of shoes

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.980
to produce in order to
optimize your profit.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.505
And so let's let x equal the
thousands of pairs produced.

00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:21.640
Now let's think
about how much money

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.990
you're going to make per pair.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.573
Actually, let me say
how much revenue,

00:00:24.573 --> 00:00:28.079
which is how much you actually
get to sell those shoes for.

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:29.620
So let's write a
function right here.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.910
Revenue as a function of x.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.470
Well, you have a
wholesaler who's

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.720
willing to pay you $10
per pair for as many pairs

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.090
as you're willing to give him.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.100
So your revenue as a function
of x is going to be 10 times x.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.490
And since x is in thousands
of pairs produced, if x is 1,

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.500
that means 1,000 pairs produced
times 10, which means $10,000.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.980
But this will just give you 10.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.350
So this right over here is
in thousands of dollars.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.570
So if x is 1, that means
1,000 pairs produced.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.260
10 times 1 says
r is equal to 10,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.689
but that really means $10,000.

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.480
Now, it would be a nice
business if all you

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.210
had was revenue and no costs.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.465
But you do have costs.

00:01:14.465 --> 00:01:16.590
You have materials, you
have to build your factory,

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.089
have to pay your
employees, you have

00:01:18.089 --> 00:01:19.500
to pay the electricity bill.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.210
And so you hire a
bunch of consultants

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.945
to come up with what your
cost is as a function of x.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.600
And they come up
with a function.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.270
They say it is the number of the
thousands of pairs you produce

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.920
cubed minus 6 times the
thousands of pairs you produce

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.950
squared plus 15 times
the thousands of pairs

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.300
that you produce.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.580
And once again,
this is also going

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.710
to be in thousands of dollars.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.682
Now, given these functions
of x for revenue and cost,

00:01:54.682 --> 00:01:58.930
what is profit as a
function of x going to be?

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.580
Well, your profit
as a function of x

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.710
is just going to be equal to
your revenue as a function of x

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.800
minus your cost as
a function of x.

00:02:12.592 --> 00:02:14.300
If you produce a
certain amount and let's

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.330
say you bring in, I don't
know, $10,000 of revenue

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.970
and it costs you $5,000
to produce those shoes,

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.529
you'll have $5,000 in profit.

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:23.570
Those numbers aren't the
ones that would actually

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.250
you would get from
this right here.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.230
I'm just giving you an example.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.990
So this is what you
want to optimize.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:36.170
You want to optimize
p as a function of x.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.140
So what is it?

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.070
I've just said it here
in abstract terms,

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.170
but we know what r of
x is and what's c of x.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.380
This is 10x minus
all of this business.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:53.590
So minus x to the third
plus 6x squared minus 15x.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.110
I just subtracted x
squared, you subtract

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.880
6x squared it becomes positive,
you subtract a 15x it becomes

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.520
negative 15x, and then we can
simplify this as-- let's see,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.200
we have negative x
to the third plus 6x

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.370
squared minus 15x plus
10x, so that is minus 5x.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.497
Now if we want to optimize this
profit function analytically,

00:03:16.497 --> 00:03:18.080
the easiest way is
to think about what

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.240
are the critical points
of this profit function

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.740
and are any of those
critical points

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.430
minimum points or
maximum points?

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.870
And if one of them is a
maximum point, then we can say,

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.190
well, let's produce that many.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.292
That is going to be--
we will have optimized

00:03:30.292 --> 00:03:32.500
or we will figure out the
quantity we need to produce

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.020
in order to optimize our profit.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.710
So to figure out
critical points,

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.600
we essentially have to find
the derivative of our function

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.110
and figure out when does
that derivative equal 0

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.070
or when is that
derivative undefined?

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.490
That's the definition
of critical points.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.960
So p prime of x is going
to be equal to negative 3x

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.790
squared plus 12x minus 5.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.100
And so this thing is going
to be defined for all x.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.140
So the only critical
points we're going to have

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.280
is when the first derivative
right over here is equal to 0.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.470
So negative 3x squared plus 12x
minus 5 needs to be equal to 0

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.190
in order for x to
be a critical point.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.300
So now we just have
to solve for x.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.829
And so we just are essentially
solving a quadratic equation.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.860
Just so that I don't
have as many negatives,

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.820
let's multiply both
sides by negative 1.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.040
I just like to have a
clean first coefficient.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.950
So if we multiply both
sides by negative 1,

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:33.330
we get 3x squared minus
12x plus 5 is equal to 0.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.700
And now we can use the quadratic
formula to solve for x.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.960
So x is going to be equal
to negative b, which is 12,

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.910
plus or minus the square root.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.650
I always need to make my
radical signs wide enough.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.840
The square root of
b squared, which

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:56.340
is 144, minus 4 times a, which
is 3, times c, which is 5.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.020
All of that over 2a.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.830
So 2 times 3 is 6.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.250
So x is equal to
12 plus or minus

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.250
the square root of, let's see,
4 times 3 is 12 times 5 is 60.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.190
144 minus 60 is 84.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.990
All of that over 6.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.430
So x could be equal to 12 plus
the square root of 84 over 6

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:29.930
or x could be equal to 12 minus
the square root of 84 over 6.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.580
So let's figure out
what these two are.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.270
And I'll use a calculator.

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.140
I'll use the calculator
for this one.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:49.940
So I get, let's see, 12 plus the
square root of 84 divided by 6

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.810
gives me 3.5--
I'll just say 3.53.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.440
So approximately
3.-- Actually, let me

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.550
go one more digit, because
I'm talking about thousands.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:11.730
So let me say 3.528.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.050
So this would literally
be 3,528 shoes,

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.170
because this is in
thousands, or pairs of shoes.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.370
And then let's do the
situation where we subtract.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.520
And actually we can look
at our previous entry

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.220
and just change this
to a subtraction.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.570
Change that to not a
negative sign, a subtraction.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:31.530
There you go.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:37.470
And we get 0.4725.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:38.410
Let me remember that.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.810
0.4725.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:47.912
Approximately equal to 0.4725.

00:06:47.912 --> 00:06:49.370
I have a horrible
memory, so let me

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:50.828
review that I wrote
the same thing.

00:06:50.828 --> 00:06:53.860
4725.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:54.360
Yep.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.470
All right.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.275
Now these are all
we know about these,

00:06:57.275 --> 00:06:58.710
or these are both
critical points.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.530
These are points at which
our derivative is equal to 0.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.680
But we don't know whether
they're minimum points,

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.810
they're points at which
the function takes

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.930
on a minimum value, a
maximum value, or neither.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.980
To do that, I'll use the
second derivative test

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.210
to figure out if our
function is concave upwards

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.750
or concave downwards or
neither at one of these points.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.630
So let's look at the
second derivative.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.530
So p prime prime
of x is going to be

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:32.140
equal to negative 6x plus 12.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:37.440
And so if we look at-- let me
make sure I have enough space.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:44.660
So if we look at p
prime prime of 3.528.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.860
So let's see if I can
think this through.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.430
So this is between 3 and 4.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.700
So if we take the lower
value, 3 times negative 6

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.180
is negative 18 plus 12 is
going to be less than 0.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.170
And if this was 4 it'd
be even more negative,

00:07:58.170 --> 00:07:59.878
so this thing is going
to be less than 0.

00:07:59.878 --> 00:08:02.301
Don't even have to use my
calculator to evaluate it.

00:08:02.301 --> 00:08:04.050
Now what about this
thing right over here?

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.690
0.47.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.890
Well, 0.47, that's roughly 0.5.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.954
So negative 6 times
0.5 is negative 3.

00:08:12.954 --> 00:08:15.120
This is going to be nowhere
close to being negative.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.080
This is definitely
going to be positive.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:24.280
So p prime prime of
0.4725 is greater than 0.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.070
So the fact that the second
derivative is less than 0,

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:31.850
that means that my
derivative is decreasing.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.840
My first derivative
is decreasing

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.010
when x is equal to
this value, which

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.830
means that our
graph, our function,

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.590
is concave downwards here.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.650
And concave downwards means
it looks something like this.

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:52.920
And so you can see what it
looks something like that,

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.277
the slope is
constantly decreasing.

00:08:56.277 --> 00:08:58.610
So if you have an interval
where the slope is decreasing

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:02.150
and you know the point where
the slope is exactly 0, which

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:09.860
is where x is equal to
3.528, it must be a maximum.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:14.190
So we actually do take on a
maximum value when x is 3.528.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.124
On the other side we
see that over here we're

00:09:17.124 --> 00:09:17.790
concave upwards.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.751
The graph will look something
like this over here.

00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:27.000
And if the slope is 0 where
the graph looks like that,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.110
we see that that
is a local minimum.

00:09:33.199 --> 00:09:34.990
And so we definitely
don't want to do this.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:40.400
We would produce
472 and 1/2 units

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.300
if we were looking to minimize
our profit, maximize our loss.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.672
So we definitely
don't want to do this.

00:09:45.672 --> 00:09:47.130
But let's actually
think about what

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.600
our profit is going
to be if we produce

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:55.480
3.528 thousands of
shoes, or 3,528 shoes.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.570
Well, to do that we just
have to input it back

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.450
into our original profit
function right over here.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:01.780
So let's do that.

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.160
So I get my calculator out.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.090
So my original profit
function is right over there.

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:09.950
So I want to be able
to see that and that.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:24.570
So I get negative 3.528 to the
third power plus 6 times 3.528

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:32.280
squared minus 5 times
3.528 gives me--

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:39.990
and we get a drum roll now--
gives me a profit of 13.128.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:41.460
So let me write this down.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:48.570
The profit when I produce 3,528
shoes is approximately equal to

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.860
or it is equal to, if I produce
exactly that many shoes,

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:56.389
it's equal to 13.128.

00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:58.430
Or actually it's approximately,
because I'm still

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:02.310
rounding 13.128.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:07.980
So if I produce 3,528
shoes in a given period,

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.470
I'm going to have a
profit of $13,128.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.540
Remember, this right over
here is in thousands,

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.590
this right over here
is 13.128 thousands

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:21.850
of dollars in profit,
which is $13,128.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:25.811
Anyway, we are now going to
be rich shoe manufacturers.
