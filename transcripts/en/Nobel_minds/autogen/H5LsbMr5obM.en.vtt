00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
hello my name is Lavenham I'm a student

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970
hello my name is Lavenham I'm a student
 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.390
hello my name is Lavenham I'm a student
of electrical engineering and manifestly

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400
of electrical engineering and manifestly
 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.639
of electrical engineering and manifestly
in physics so just wanted to know how

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649
in physics so just wanted to know how
 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.049
in physics so just wanted to know how
could I switch over to a career in

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059
could I switch over to a career in
 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.600
could I switch over to a career in
physics from Abaddon electrical

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610
physics from Abaddon electrical
 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.570
physics from Abaddon electrical
background yes so to start a car and

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580
background yes so to start a car and
 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.210
background yes so to start a car and
physic you you have to begin with a PhD

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220
physic you you have to begin with a PhD
 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.189
physic you you have to begin with a PhD
with a desease and so you were to to

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199
with a desease and so you were to to
 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.810
with a desease and so you were to to
apply to to a supervisor for start to

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820
apply to to a supervisor for start to
 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.370
apply to to a supervisor for start to
start apparently and so we have to

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380
start apparently and so we have to
 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.400
start apparently and so we have to
convince survive either the laboratory

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410
convince survive either the laboratory
 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.000
convince survive either the laboratory
that you are motivated and so that you

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010
that you are motivated and so that you
 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.000
that you are motivated and so that you
know a lot of seeing on technical aspect

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010
know a lot of seeing on technical aspect
 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.630
know a lot of seeing on technical aspect
of physics you you are also you have to

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640
of physics you you are also you have to
 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.790
of physics you you are also you have to
want to walk on the more fundamental

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800
want to walk on the more fundamental
 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.220
want to walk on the more fundamental
aspects and finally when will be after a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230
aspects and finally when will be after a
 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.279
aspects and finally when will be after a
PhD you own the good way to to continue

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289
PhD you own the good way to to continue
 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.180
PhD you own the good way to to continue
in this session in physics
