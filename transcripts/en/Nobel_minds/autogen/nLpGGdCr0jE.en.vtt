get engaged or do you think it inspires
unnecessary competition uh-huh

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770
unnecessary competition uh-huh
 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.969
unnecessary competition uh-huh
so Angus Deaton well economists are

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979
so Angus Deaton well economists are
 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.490
so Angus Deaton well economists are
never competitive we have something

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500
never competitive we have something
 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.340
never competitive we have something
called perfect competition which

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350
called perfect competition which
 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.860
called perfect competition which
economists believe in I'm not sure the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870
economists believe in I'm not sure the
 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.259
economists believe in I'm not sure the
Nobel does much of that I've been very

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269
Nobel does much of that I've been very
 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:28.170
Nobel does much of that I've been very
impressed by how much positive just

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180
impressed by how much positive just
 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.330
impressed by how much positive just
general happiness and well-being it

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340
general happiness and well-being it
 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.890
general happiness and well-being it
seems to generate it's clear though over

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900
seems to generate it's clear though over
 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.350
seems to generate it's clear though over
the years in the past there certainly is

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360
the years in the past there certainly is
 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.050
the years in the past there certainly is
some resentment on behalf of people who

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060
some resentment on behalf of people who
 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.420
some resentment on behalf of people who
don't win I really hope you had to use

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430
don't win I really hope you had to use
 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.849
don't win I really hope you had to use
that I've never felt it personally but

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859
that I've never felt it personally but
 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.220
that I've never felt it personally but
you hear discussions blank stares when

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230
you hear discussions blank stares when
 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.190
you hear discussions blank stares when
you pass by oh I have not experienced

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200
you pass by oh I have not experienced
 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.599
you pass by oh I have not experienced
any of that I've been very fortunate

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609
any of that I've been very fortunate
 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.000
any of that I've been very fortunate
that way but I do think in the past

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010
that way but I do think in the past
 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.670
that way but I do think in the past
people have felt that a whole area you

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680
people have felt that a whole area you
 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.380
people have felt that a whole area you
know that should have been recognized

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390
know that should have been recognized
 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.960
know that should have been recognized
never was recognized for instance and

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970
never was recognized for instance and
 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.240
never was recognized for instance and
I'm sure and that's a more legitimate

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250
I'm sure and that's a more legitimate
 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.710
I'm sure and that's a more legitimate
feeling then I'm sure there are some

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720
feeling then I'm sure there are some
 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.630
feeling then I'm sure there are some
people who feel that they should have

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640
people who feel that they should have
 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.340
people who feel that they should have
been recognized them or not what a

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350
been recognized them or not what a
 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.710
been recognized them or not what a
generous man you are professor Deaton in

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720
generous man you are professor Deaton in
 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.180
generous man you are professor Deaton in
saying that but I'm sure you deserved

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190
saying that but I'm sure you deserved
 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.770

your prize but let me just see what

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780
your prize but let me just see what
 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.960
your prize but let me just see what
anybody else Paul moderator professor

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970
anybody else Paul moderator professor
 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.699
anybody else Paul moderator professor
moderate well I think it's useful in

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709
moderate well I think it's useful in
 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.210
moderate well I think it's useful in
bringing visibility to science and feel

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220
bringing visibility to science and feel
 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.610
bringing visibility to science and feel
I agree with Angus I think that there

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620
I agree with Angus I think that there
 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.880
I agree with Angus I think that there
have been instances where certain people

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890
have been instances where certain people
 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.220
have been instances where certain people
have felt certainly in in my field that

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230
have felt certainly in in my field that
 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.750
have felt certainly in in my field that
the certain areas that were worthy of a

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760
the certain areas that were worthy of a
 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.800
the certain areas that were worthy of a
prize were neglected and and so there is

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810
prize were neglected and and so there is
 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.559
prize were neglected and and so there is
a value judgement I think in selection

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569
a value judgement I think in selection
 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.479
a value judgement I think in selection
of the fields professor Campbell

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489
of the fields professor Campbell
 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.789
of the fields professor Campbell
I think it does not create competition

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799
I think it does not create competition
 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.039
I think it does not create competition
among scientists don't compete for that

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049
among scientists don't compete for that
 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.620
among scientists don't compete for that
and secondly I think it

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630
and secondly I think it
 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.920
and secondly I think it
it's inevitable and it also adds a nice

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930
it's inevitable and it also adds a nice
 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.710
it's inevitable and it also adds a nice
little bit of something special that

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720
little bit of something special that
 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.150
little bit of something special that
scientists can enjoy so I think it's

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160
scientists can enjoy so I think it's
 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.740
scientists can enjoy so I think it's
sort of inspirational and not

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750
sort of inspirational and not
 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.600
sort of inspirational and not
confrontational and certainly not

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610
confrontational and certainly not
 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.660
confrontational and certainly not
inducing not induced of competition and

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670
inducing not induced of competition and
 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.360
inducing not induced of competition and
the chemistry field we've been very

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370
the chemistry field we've been very
 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.380
the chemistry field we've been very
fortunate and that the three winners

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390
fortunate and that the three winners
 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.199
fortunate and that the three winners
worked on different mechanisms of DNA

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209
worked on different mechanisms of DNA
 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.080
worked on different mechanisms of DNA
repair and we had no competition so

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090
repair and we had no competition so
 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.060
repair and we had no competition so
we've been fortunate to have it that way

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070
we've been fortunate to have it that way
 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.150
we've been fortunate to have it that way
and so in this particular case there was

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160
and so in this particular case there was
 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.880
and so in this particular case there was
no competition round off the chemist

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890
no competition round off the chemist
 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.540
no competition round off the chemist
professor thomas Lindell yes I think

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550
professor thomas Lindell yes I think
 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.680
professor thomas Lindell yes I think
healthy competition is a good thing

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690
healthy competition is a good thing
 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.470
healthy competition is a good thing
it's excellent if and scientist goes a

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480
it's excellent if and scientist goes a
 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.470
it's excellent if and scientist goes a
little bit of astray with his ideas that

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480
little bit of astray with his ideas that
 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.760
little bit of astray with his ideas that
somebody else corrects them and I think

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770
somebody else corrects them and I think
 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.680
somebody else corrects them and I think
it would be too comfortable if there was

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690
it would be too comfortable if there was
 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.250
it would be too comfortable if there was
no competition at all huh okay it's

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260
no competition at all huh okay it's
 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.710
no competition at all huh okay it's

inequality and so what do you do if you

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:29.510
inequality and so what do you do if you
 

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.090
inequality and so what do you do if you

inequality is reach dangerous levels

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:32.690
inequality is reach dangerous levels
 

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:36.370
inequality is reach dangerous levels
which I do then I think the best thing

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:36.380
which I do then I think the best thing
 

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.650
which I do then I think the best thing
to do is is you have to participate in

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:38.660
to do is is you have to participate in
 

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.139
to do is is you have to participate in
the democratic process and persuade

00:09:41.139 --> 00:09:41.149
the democratic process and persuade
 

00:09:41.149 --> 00:09:42.850
the democratic process and persuade
other people that it's a problem for

so it is can be done you say but it's a

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:48.440
so it is can be done you say but it's a
 

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.260
so it is can be done you say but it's a
lack of political will the tools are

lack of political will the tools are
 

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:50.680
lack of political will the tools are
there

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:50.690
there

passing but just briefly outline for us
 

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.620
passing but just briefly outline for us
then what are the tools that can be used

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:56.630
then what are the tools that can be used
 

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.500
then what are the tools that can be used
to reduce inequality well there's a lot

00:09:59.500 --> 00:09:59.510
to reduce inequality well there's a lot
 

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.600
to reduce inequality well there's a lot
of tax tools I mean one of them for

of tax tools I mean one of them for
 

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.699
of tax tools I mean one of them for

example but many of us have always
 

00:10:05.329 --> 00:10:08.110
example but many of us have always
thought that you know fairly stiff

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:08.120

Nobel laureates my question is
 

00:13:03.779 --> 00:13:06.290
Nobel laureates my question is
specifically you have expressed some

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:06.300
specifically you have expressed some
 

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.990

criticism about foreign aid to poor
countries now why is that okay so let me

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600
countries now why is that okay so let me
 

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.410
countries now why is that okay so let me
start by saying that I'm not critical at

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:18.420
start by saying that I'm not critical at
 

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.019

all of the wish to help people in poor
 

00:13:21.029 --> 00:13:22.879
all of the wish to help people in poor
countries but I think a lot of what

00:13:22.879 --> 00:13:22.889
countries but I think a lot of what
 

00:13:22.889 --> 00:13:24.379
countries but I think a lot of what
we're doing in terms of foreign aid

00:13:24.379 --> 00:13:24.389
we're doing in terms of foreign aid
 

00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:26.360

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.070
people in my department for many many
years I was never asked to stop doing it

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:39.080
years I was never asked to stop doing it
 

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.289
years I was never asked to stop doing it
I never ceased to be funded for doing it

00:26:41.289 --> 00:26:41.299
I never ceased to be funded for doing it
 

00:26:41.299 --> 00:26:43.389
I never ceased to be funded for doing it
I think there are lots of discussion we

00:26:43.389 --> 00:26:43.399
I think there are lots of discussion we
 

00:26:43.399 --> 00:26:46.049
I think there are lots of discussion we
should have about that anybody pick up

00:26:46.049 --> 00:26:46.059
should have about that anybody pick up
 

00:26:46.059 --> 00:26:49.240
should have about that anybody pick up
although despite this breakthrough of

although despite this breakthrough of
 

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:51.779
although despite this breakthrough of
treating these terrible diseases

compassion was not a necessarily the
 

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:57.310
compassion was not a necessarily the
motivating factor yeah professor Lindell

we work on cancer research so people

00:26:59.919 --> 00:26:59.929
we work on cancer research so people
 

00:26:59.929 --> 00:27:01.000
we work on cancer research so people
also all the time

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:01.010
also all the time
 

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:03.370
also all the time
are you finding any new drugs for cancer

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:03.380
are you finding any new drugs for cancer
 

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.850
are you finding any new drugs for cancer
assort when can we cure cancer and I

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:06.860
assort when can we cure cancer and I
 

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.130
assort when can we cure cancer and I
hope that will be an important

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:09.140
hope that will be an important
 

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.350
hope that will be an important
consequence of what we are doing but as

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:11.360
consequence of what we are doing but as
 

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.930
consequence of what we are doing but as
I see it it's still a side effect of

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:13.940
I see it it's still a side effect of
 

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:15.159
I see it it's still a side effect of
what we are doing what we are really

00:27:15.159 --> 00:27:15.169
what we are doing what we are really
 

00:27:15.169 --> 00:27:17.830
what we are doing what we are really
trying to do is understand the world we

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840
trying to do is understand the world we
 

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.649
trying to do is understand the world we
are living in how cells function once we

00:27:20.649 --> 00:27:20.659
are living in how cells function once we
 

00:27:20.659 --> 00:27:22.750
are living in how cells function once we
know that we can develop no drugs and

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:22.760
know that we can develop no drugs and
 

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.840
know that we can develop no drugs and
all kinds of other nice things I have

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:25.850

question on your your work on repairing
 

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:37.630
question on your your work on repairing
damaged DNA Emma M Eriksen you have a

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:37.640
damaged DNA Emma M Eriksen you have a
 

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.530
damaged DNA Emma M Eriksen you have a
question do you think that the future

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:40.540
question do you think that the future
 

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:46.180
question do you think that the future
strategy of curing cancer will be to

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:46.190
strategy of curing cancer will be to
 

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:50.610
strategy of curing cancer will be to
repair the reparation systems of DNA or

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:50.620
repair the reparation systems of DNA or
 

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:54.310
repair the reparation systems of DNA or
will the changes in behavior be more

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320
will the changes in behavior be more
 

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.000
will the changes in behavior be more
important

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:55.010
important
 

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:57.720
important
so should people change their behavior

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:57.730
so should people change their behavior
 

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:00.370
so should people change their behavior
pulmonic all right yeah certain

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:00.380
pulmonic all right yeah certain
 

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:04.240
pulmonic all right yeah certain
behaviors are directly caused cancer

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:04.250
behaviors are directly caused cancer
 

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:09.760
behaviors are directly caused cancer
smoking is one out of it well I'm not

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:09.770
smoking is one out of it well I'm not
 

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:13.270
smoking is one out of it well I'm not
going to that my person you're my person

you're clearly a man who enjoys a tip
like I drink alcohol but my personal

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:17.480
like I drink alcohol but my personal
 

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.170
like I drink alcohol but my personal
belief is that had alcohol itself is not

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:20.180
belief is that had alcohol itself is not
 

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.150
belief is that had alcohol itself is not
known to be a carcinogen but one of its

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:22.160
known to be a carcinogen but one of its
 

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:26.140
known to be a carcinogen but one of its
metabolic products is and and I think

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:26.150
metabolic products is and and I think
 

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:29.020
metabolic products is and and I think
it's quite clear that certain it's

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:29.030
it's quite clear that certain it's
 

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:33.370
it's quite clear that certain it's
probable in my view that certain food

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:33.380
probable in my view that certain food
 

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:37.870
probable in my view that certain food
products may have cancer-causing could

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880
products may have cancer-causing could
 

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.670
products may have cancer-causing could
you say some food products is that

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:39.680
you say some food products is that
 

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.010
you say some food products is that
happiness of headlines I remarked yeah I

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:42.020
happiness of headlines I remarked yeah I
 

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:43.990
happiness of headlines I remarked yeah I
mean there being any of them been

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.000
mean there being any of them been
 

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.240
mean there being any of them been
addressed in the popular media and I

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:46.250
addressed in the popular media and I
 

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:50.620
addressed in the popular media and I
think the evidence is incomplete and but

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:50.630
think the evidence is incomplete and but
 

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:52.240
think the evidence is incomplete and but
I think the evidence will be forthcoming

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:52.250
I think the evidence will be forthcoming
 

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:56.620
I think the evidence will be forthcoming
and and this it I think will probably go

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:56.630
and and this it I think will probably go
 

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:58.960
and and this it I think will probably go
a long way to reducing or potentially

00:29:58.960 --> 00:29:58.970
a long way to reducing or potentially
 

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:00.760
a long way to reducing or potentially
reducing the incidence of cancer in the

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:00.770
reducing the incidence of cancer in the
 

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:02.470
reducing the incidence of cancer in the
human population so you think the

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480
human population so you think the
 

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.880
human population so you think the
evidence will come because we have

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:03.890
evidence will come because we have
 

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:05.080
evidence will come because we have
outdated

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:05.090
