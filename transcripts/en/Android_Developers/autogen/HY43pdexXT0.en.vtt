what<00:11:47.200><c> gestures</c><00:11:47.740><c> worked</c><00:11:48.040><c> like</c><00:11:48.339><c> for</c><00:11:48.550><c> example</c><00:11:48.610><c> we</c>

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:48.940 align:start position:0%
what gestures worked like for example we
 

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.750 align:start position:0%
what gestures worked like for example we
had<00:11:49.089><c> a</c><00:11:49.120><c> two</c><00:11:49.810><c> finger</c><00:11:50.019><c> rotation</c><00:11:50.980><c> thing</c><00:11:51.220><c> first</c><00:11:51.550><c> so</c>

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
had a two finger rotation thing first so
 

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.550 align:start position:0%
had a two finger rotation thing first so
you<00:11:51.850><c> swipe</c><00:11:52.120><c> left</c><00:11:52.570><c> and</c><00:11:52.750><c> right</c><00:11:52.839><c> to</c><00:11:52.990><c> rotate</c><00:11:53.440><c> the</c>

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:53.560 align:start position:0%
you swipe left and right to rotate the
 

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
you swipe left and right to rotate the
product<00:11:53.920><c> no</c><00:11:54.459><c> one</c><00:11:54.579><c> could</c><00:11:54.700><c> figure</c><00:11:54.820><c> it</c><00:11:54.940><c> out</c><00:11:55.060><c> so</c><00:11:55.930><c> we</c>

00:11:56.639 --> 00:11:56.649 align:start position:0%
product no one could figure it out so we
 

00:11:56.649 --> 00:11:58.139 align:start position:0%
product no one could figure it out so we
realized<00:11:57.040><c> like</c><00:11:57.310><c> everyone's</c><00:11:57.850><c> trying</c><00:11:58.029><c> to</c>

00:11:58.139 --> 00:11:58.149 align:start position:0%
realized like everyone's trying to
 

00:11:58.149 --> 00:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
realized like everyone's trying to
circle<00:11:58.510><c> like</c><00:11:58.600><c> do</c><00:11:58.720><c> the</c><00:11:58.870><c> circle</c><00:11:59.200><c> rotate</c><00:11:59.620><c> even</c>

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:00.130 align:start position:0%
circle like do the circle rotate even
 

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.250 align:start position:0%
circle like do the circle rotate even
though<00:12:00.220><c> it</c><00:12:00.339><c> didn't</c><00:12:00.579><c> necessarily</c><00:12:00.990><c> match</c><00:12:01.990><c> what</c>

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:02.260 align:start position:0%
though it didn't necessarily match what
 

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
though it didn't necessarily match what
we<00:12:02.380><c> were</c><00:12:02.500><c> thinking</c><00:12:02.649><c> and</c><00:12:03.250><c> when</c><00:12:03.640><c> we</c><00:12:03.730><c> switched</c><00:12:03.970><c> to</c>

00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:04.089 align:start position:0%
we were thinking and when we switched to
 

00:12:04.089 --> 00:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
we were thinking and when we switched to
that<00:12:04.120><c> we</c><00:12:04.360><c> found</c><00:12:04.390><c> that</c><00:12:04.690><c> people</c><00:12:04.959><c> naturally</c><00:12:05.290><c> got</c>

00:12:05.639 --> 00:12:05.649 align:start position:0%
that we found that people naturally got
 

00:12:05.649 --> 00:12:07.710 align:start position:0%
that we found that people naturally got
it<00:12:05.829><c> a</c><00:12:05.890><c> lot</c><00:12:06.040><c> faster</c><00:12:06.279><c> so</c><00:12:06.910><c> like</c><00:12:07.420><c> little</c><00:12:07.690><c> things</c>

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
it a lot faster so like little things
 

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
it a lot faster so like little things
like<00:12:08.050><c> that</c><00:12:08.110><c> I</c><00:12:08.290><c> think</c><00:12:08.440><c> the</c><00:12:09.190><c> user</c><00:12:09.370><c> testing</c><00:12:09.820><c> goes</c>

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:09.970 align:start position:0%
like that I think the user testing goes
 

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.030 align:start position:0%
like that I think the user testing goes
a<00:12:10.000><c> long</c><00:12:10.209><c> way</c><00:12:10.420><c> right</c><00:12:10.930><c> on</c><00:12:11.140><c> yeah</c>

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
a long way right on yeah
 

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
a long way right on yeah
Tatsu<00:12:12.399><c> I</c><00:12:12.670><c> guess</c><00:12:12.940><c> for</c><00:12:13.149><c> us</c><00:12:13.300><c> one</c><00:12:14.140><c> of</c><00:12:14.170><c> the</c><00:12:14.290><c> big</c>

00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:14.529 align:start position:0%
Tatsu I guess for us one of the big
 

00:12:14.529 --> 00:12:16.410 align:start position:0%
Tatsu I guess for us one of the big
thing<00:12:14.740><c> is</c><00:12:14.890><c> when</c><00:12:15.070><c> we</c><00:12:15.190><c> started</c><00:12:15.610><c> the</c><00:12:15.760><c> project</c><00:12:15.970><c> we</c>

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:16.420 align:start position:0%
thing is when we started the project we
 

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.210 align:start position:0%
thing is when we started the project we
thought<00:12:16.660><c> we</c><00:12:16.930><c> can</c><00:12:17.079><c> just</c><00:12:17.290><c> stop</c><00:12:17.500><c> have</c><00:12:18.070><c> the</c>

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:18.220 align:start position:0%
thought we can just stop have the

00:14:04.699 --> 00:14:04.709 align:start position:0%
think we can still improve it but uh
 

00:14:04.709 --> 00:14:10.199 align:start position:0%

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.449 align:start position:0%
doesn't and then you have to kind of
like<00:15:46.930><c> investigate</c><00:15:47.589><c> and</c><00:15:47.740><c> pick</c><00:15:47.920><c> and</c><00:15:48.100><c> poke</c><00:15:48.250><c> and</c>

working isn't working and then
 

00:15:51.819 --> 00:15:53.429 align:start position:0%
working isn't working and then
eventually<00:15:52.329><c> get</c><00:15:52.510><c> to</c><00:15:52.600><c> your</c><00:15:52.720><c> solution</c><00:15:52.930><c> that's</c>

00:15:53.429 --> 00:15:53.439 align:start position:0%

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:14.530 align:start position:0%
have 3d models now we can do AR but
 

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:16.770 align:start position:0%
have 3d models now we can do AR but
without<00:20:14.680><c> 3d</c><00:20:14.950><c> contents</c><00:20:15.640><c> in</c><00:20:15.850><c> our</c><00:20:16.060><c> case</c><00:20:16.300><c> we</c>

without 3d contents in our case we

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have really had anything and so
 

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have really had anything and so
making<00:20:19.330><c> the</c><00:20:19.510><c> app</c><00:20:19.660><c> is</c><00:20:19.840><c> one</c><00:20:19.990><c> thing</c><00:20:20.200><c> but</c>

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:20.350 align:start position:0%
making the app is one thing but

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
in some cases the larger challenge was
 

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
in some cases the larger challenge was

yeah so that was a nice aw that was
again<00:32:12.509><c> it</c><00:32:12.570><c> was</c><00:32:12.659><c> a</c><00:32:12.690><c> hand</c><00:32:12.899><c> model</c><00:32:13.049><c> actually</c><00:32:13.590><c> so</c><00:32:13.769><c> is</c>

00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039 align:start position:0%
again it was a hand model actually so is

00:32:16.519 --> 00:32:16.529 align:start position:0%
an artist that kind of put together what
 

00:32:16.529 --> 00:32:18.259 align:start position:0%
an artist that kind of put together what

00:32:18.259 --> 00:32:18.269 align:start position:0%
it looked like based on photos and you
 

00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:20.149 align:start position:0%
it looked like based on photos and you

00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
know not to discredit the modelers they
 

00:32:20.159 --> 00:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
know not to discredit the modelers they
do<00:32:20.249><c> a</c><00:32:20.279><c> great</c><00:32:20.519><c> job</c><00:32:20.730><c> of</c><00:32:20.789><c> making</c><00:32:21.119><c> the</c><00:32:21.299><c> products</c>

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:21.690 align:start position:0%
do a great job of making the products
 

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:25.099 align:start position:0%
do a great job of making the products
look<00:32:21.809><c> amazing</c><00:32:22.759><c> but</c><00:32:23.759><c> I</c><00:32:23.999><c> I</c><00:32:24.059><c> feel</c><00:32:24.659><c> like</c><00:32:24.720><c> you</c><00:32:24.989><c> know</c>

00:32:25.099 --> 00:32:25.109 align:start position:0%

00:32:25.109 --> 00:32:26.539 align:start position:0%
look amazing but I I feel like you know
one<00:32:25.289><c> of</c><00:32:25.379><c> the</c><00:32:25.470><c> big</c><00:32:25.889><c> things</c><00:32:26.129><c> we're</c><00:32:26.309><c> trying</c><00:32:26.489><c> to</c>

00:32:26.539 --> 00:32:26.549 align:start position:0%
one of the big things we're trying to

one of the big things we're trying to
push<00:32:26.700><c> is</c><00:32:26.940><c> that</c><00:32:27.210><c> super</c><00:32:27.779><c> accurate</c><00:32:27.960><c> this</c><00:32:28.409><c> thing</c>

00:32:28.639 --> 00:32:28.649 align:start position:0%
push is that super accurate this thing
 

00:32:28.649 --> 00:32:30.710 align:start position:0%
push is that super accurate this thing
is<00:32:28.889><c> exactly</c><00:32:29.399><c> how</c><00:32:29.549><c> it</c><00:32:29.669><c> fits</c><00:32:29.850><c> in</c><00:32:29.999><c> your</c><00:32:30.029><c> space</c><00:32:30.359><c> and</c>

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
is exactly how it fits in your space and
 

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
is exactly how it fits in your space and
I<00:32:31.559><c> think</c><00:32:31.739><c> you</c><00:32:31.830><c> lose</c><00:32:32.009><c> some</c><00:32:32.220><c> of</c><00:32:32.249><c> the</c><00:32:32.340><c> detail</c><00:32:32.519><c> in</c>

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:32.850 align:start position:0%
I think you lose some of the detail in
 

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:34.669 align:start position:0%
I think you lose some of the detail in
the<00:32:32.970><c> precision</c><00:32:33.450><c> by</c><00:32:33.720><c> doing</c><00:32:34.049><c> the</c><00:32:34.139><c> hand</c><00:32:34.320><c> modeling</c>

00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
the precision by doing the hand modeling
 

00:32:34.679 --> 00:32:36.409 align:start position:0%

00:32:36.419 --> 00:32:38.749 align:start position:0%

so<00:32:37.169><c> it's</c><00:32:37.499><c> one</c><00:32:38.100><c> of</c><00:32:38.190><c> those</c><00:32:38.279><c> things</c><00:32:38.519><c> that</c><00:32:38.639><c> we</c>

00:32:38.749 --> 00:32:38.759 align:start position:0%
so it's one of those things that we
 

00:32:38.759 --> 00:32:40.070 align:start position:0%
so it's one of those things that we

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:10.360 align:start position:0%
reality and virtual reality and you know
big<00:35:08.660><c> data</c><00:35:08.870><c> to</c><00:35:09.140><c> be</c><00:35:09.230><c> able</c><00:35:09.290><c> to</c><00:35:09.440><c> serve</c><00:35:09.650><c> all</c><00:35:10.040><c> of</c><00:35:10.220><c> this</c>

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:10.370 align:start position:0%
big data to be able to serve all of this
 

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:12.100 align:start position:0%
big data to be able to serve all of this
data<00:35:10.640><c> so</c><00:35:11.120><c> that</c><00:35:11.150><c> we</c><00:35:11.300><c> can</c><00:35:11.450><c> actually</c><00:35:11.600><c> get</c><00:35:11.870><c> to</c><00:35:11.930><c> that</c>

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:12.110 align:start position:0%
data so that we can actually get to that
 

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:14.210 align:start position:0%
data so that we can actually get to that
point<00:35:12.260><c> that</c><00:35:12.950><c> sounds</c><00:35:13.280><c> awesome</c>

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
point that sounds awesome
 

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:18.140 align:start position:0%
point that sounds awesome
so<00:35:14.400><c> yeah</c><00:35:15.150><c> I</c><00:35:15.840><c> think</c><00:35:16.470><c> like</c><00:35:16.619><c> the</c><00:35:17.040><c> technology</c><00:35:18.000><c> is</c>

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:18.150 align:start position:0%
so yeah I think like the technology is
 

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.390 align:start position:0%
so yeah I think like the technology is
just<00:35:18.210><c> emerging</c><00:35:18.660><c> right</c><00:35:19.109><c> now</c><00:35:19.260><c> the</c><00:35:19.830><c> tango</c><00:35:20.250><c> is</c>

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
just emerging right now the tango is
 

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
just emerging right now the tango is

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:22.770 align:start position:0%
coming out in next year's I guess we'll
 

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:24.680 align:start position:0%
coming out in next year's I guess we'll
there<00:35:22.890><c> will</c><00:35:22.980><c> be</c><00:35:23.010><c> new</c><00:35:23.310><c> devices</c><00:35:23.670><c> coming</c><00:35:24.240><c> out</c><00:35:24.420><c> but</c>

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:24.690 align:start position:0%
there will be new devices coming out but
 

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
there will be new devices coming out but
even<00:35:24.750><c> going</c><00:35:25.470><c> a</c><00:35:25.650><c> lot</c><00:35:25.950><c> further</c><00:35:26.750><c> eventually</c><00:35:27.750><c> or</c>

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:28.050 align:start position:0%
even going a lot further eventually or
 

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:30.380 align:start position:0%
even going a lot further eventually or
and<00:35:28.740><c> hopefully</c><00:35:29.250><c> I</c><00:35:29.280><c> think</c><00:35:29.640><c> you</c><00:35:30.090><c> know</c><00:35:30.180><c> the</c>

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:30.390 align:start position:0%
