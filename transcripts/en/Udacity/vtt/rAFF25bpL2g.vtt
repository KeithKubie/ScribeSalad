00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So let's say that we've put in these 3 parsing rules into Python.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We are trying to get back to parsing HTML.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We want to understand how to parse Web pages

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and turn them into abstract syntax trees.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And a Web page is just a list of elements.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So it's either an element, followed by More

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
or We're Done Now.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And elements could be a number of things, like tags or maybe--

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
more simply, just words.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Suppose our input is two words: Rama's Journey.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
What I'd like you to do, as a quiz,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
is submit, via the Interpreter:

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Define a variable that holds the final parse tree for this input.

00:00:37.000 --> 09:59:59.000
And again, the input is 2 words: Rama's Journey.
