00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.620
Welcome back.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.710
And I will now do that same
problem in a much easier way.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.400
Let me clear it a little bit.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.810
So the original problem we said,
you know, we apply some

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:19.330
force to m sub 0 and
that gives some

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.340
acceleration, a sub 0.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.090
And then we said when we apply
the same force to a

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:32.310
combination of m sub 0 and
m sub 1, we get 1/5 the

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.560
acceleration.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.900
And we worked it through
with all the variables.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.390
What I'll show you is you can
actually do this type of

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.680
problem just by substituting
numbers.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.610
This is kind of quick and dirty,
but it's good to do a

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.740
reality check.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.720
And oftentimes, you can solve
the problem without having to

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.360
go through all the
variable mess.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.930
So I can just pick some
numbers here.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.060
So I could say, well what if F
sub 0 is equal to 10 Newtons,

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:02.070
m sub 0 is equal to-- I don't
know-- 2 kilograms. Than a sub

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.320
0 is equal to-- well, it would
be 10 divided by 2.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.200
Because force is equal to
mass times acceleration.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.940
So it'd be 5 meters per
second squared.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.810
And then in this case, this
would be 10 Newtons.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.250
1/5 a sub 0?

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.540
Well that will be 1/5 this.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.940
So it would be 1 meters
per second squared.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.030
And then we could solve for
what the new mass is.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.860
How would we do that?

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.030
Well we have force, which is
10 Newtons, is equal to the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.120
sum of the masses.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.600
So m1 plus m sub 0.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.060
But m sub 0 we already learned
is 2 kilograms. Times the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.810
acceleration.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.110
Times 1/5 a sub 0, which is 1
meter per second squared.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.650
So then we have-- this 1, we
could ignore it essentially.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.200
So then we essentially have that
10-- and since all of our

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.490
units are right, we can kind of
drop the units because we

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.530
know they work out.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.220
10 is equal to m1 plus 2.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.550
So you get m1 is equal to 8.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.550
And then once again, if we want
to know the ratio of m

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.290
sub 0 to m sub 1, we can just
substitute the numbers.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.440
m sub 0 is 2 kilograms. m
sub 1 is 8 kilograms. So

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.970
the ratio is 1:4.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.450
You probably find that
a little bit easier.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.700
Let's do another problem.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.610
Whoops.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.570
Invert colors.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.820
OK.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.230
This next problem I think
you'll find interesting.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.860
So let's say I have a sky diver
and he's in his sky

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.820
diver position, falling
towards the ground.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.120
And let's say he weighs 70
kilograms. So his mass is

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.340
equal to 70 kilograms. Let's say
that the terminal velocity

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.080
is 120 miles per hour.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.330
So he's moving downward at 120
miles per hour, which is

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.260
actually accurate.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.450
I've gone sky diving.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.560
And if we convert that-- you
could convert that for fun

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.690
into the metric system.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.270
But I'll do that for you.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.660
But it's good to know just so
you have a sense of how fast

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.140
you fall when you sky dive
before the parachute opens.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.910
This translates to about
53.6 meters per second.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.790
I'm reading this from a problem
from a website at the

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.090
University of Oregon.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.030
But anyway, they are asking
us, what force does air

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.870
resistance exert on
the sky diver?

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.350
So let's be clear
a couple things.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.960
This 120 miles per hour,
this is the sky

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.500
diver's terminal velocity.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.880
And if you're not familiar with
what terminal velocity

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.010
is, I will now explain
it to you.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.610
So when you fall from a plane,
you have a bunch of wind

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.510
pushing on you.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.100
You have a lot of
wind resistance.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.480
It causes friction; it slows you
down as you can imagine.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.900
I mean that's how a
parachute works.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.600
It creates a lot more resistance
from the wind and

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.600
then you slow down.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.760
So the terminal velocity is the
velocity at which you no

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.230
longer go faster than.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.420
So it's the velocity at which
you stop accelerating or it's

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.690
the velocity you reach and you
don't go any faster than that.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.940
It's basically based on
your wind resistance.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.560
So at the terminal velocity
your acceleration is 0.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.180
So what we know is, is that
the force of the air-- we

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.720
could call that the air force.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.460
So we know that the force of
the air is exactly equal to

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.710
the force of gravity.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.620
And how do we know that?

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.370
Because the guy's not
accelerating.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.660
It's his terminal velocity.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.070
He's at a very high speed.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.060
He had accelerated all the
way to this point.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.160
But the more he accelerated
and the faster he got, the

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.250
more resistance the wind
provided up to a point where

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.810
the wind provided so much
resistance that he stopped

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:06.790
going any faster.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.010
And that's the terminal
velocity.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.680
So at terminal velocity, the
force of the air is equal to

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.120
the force of gravity.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.640
What's the force of gravity?

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.250
Well the force of gravity is
just the guy's weight.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.490
So the force of gravity is equal
to the guy's mass, 70

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.240
kilograms. And we have
our units right.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.580
70 kilograms. Times the
acceleration of gravity.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.940
Well the acceleration of gravity
is 9.8 roughly meters

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.580
per second squared.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.940
We could use a calculator
to calculate this.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:41.540
I feel cheap now.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.790
I could have done it
by hand anyway.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.840
686.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:52.760
So it equals 686 Newtons.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.140
The second part of the
question-- and this is

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.650
interesting.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.060
If a sky diver pulls in their
arm and aims their body

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.010
downward, so now the sky diver
looks more like this and he

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.500
pulled in his arms and he
aimed his body down.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.770
So he's diving, really.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.810
The terminal velocity can be
increased to about 180 miles

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.070
per hour or 80.5 meters
per second.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.680
They give us this.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.310
We could've figured
it out though.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.400
So now he's going
a lot faster.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.850
Roughly 50% faster than he
was, or maybe-- well, 30%

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.830
faster than he was
going before.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.040
He's going a lot faster
and why is that?

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.960
Because he's more
aerodynamic now.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.760
We'll do more on pressure later,
but I want you to get

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.110
the intuition that when you're
laying flat there's just a lot

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.470
of wind pressing against
your body.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.560
You have a lot of surface area
exposed to the wind.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.970
But when you're diving in this
situation, like the sky diver

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.660
is, he has a lot less
exposed to the wind.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.450
Really just his head.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.420
His head is breaking the
wind and nothing else.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:07:00.760
And that's why it takes a lot
more speed for the force of

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.420
the wind resistance to match
the force of gravity.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.270
So the question is asking, if
the sky diver pulls in their

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.310
arms and aims their body
downward, the terminal

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.510
velocity can be increased to
about 80.5 meters per second

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:15.880
or 180 miles per hour.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.140
So he's going very fast.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:22.720
What force does air resistance
now exert on the sky diver?

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.460
And I'll let you think about
that for a second.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.580
Maybe you want to pause it
and think of it yourself.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.120
And now that you've unpaused it,
I'll tell you that this is

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.290
a trick question.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.810
Because once again, the sky
diver has reached a new

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.270
terminal velocity.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.500
By definition, at the terminal
velocity, the sky diver is no

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.960
longer accelerating.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.940
The sky diver is not going any
faster because the wind

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.713
resistance is so strong that
it completely matches the

00:07:46.713 --> 00:07:47.920
force of gravity.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.950
So once again, the wind
resistance, the force of the

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.430
air or the force of the
wind, is equal to

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.250
the force of gravity.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:56.620
And what is the force
of gravity?

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:57.770
Well that's his weight.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:58.890
And we already figured
that out.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.720
That was 686 Newtons.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.640
And I know what you're
thinking.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.560
You're saying, Sal, this
doesn't make sense.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:11.070
He's now going so much faster,
doesn't the air exert more

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.410
force on him?

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:13.810
Well no.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.640
The air is exerting
the same force.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.990
If he was going that same speed,
but he was flattened

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.940
out, I would agree with you.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.680
The air would be exerting
more force on him.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.820
But what's happened now is that
he's once again reached a

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.970
state where his acceleration
is 0.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.870
It's at a higher velocity
and I want you

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:33.980
think a lot about this.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.250
He's at a much higher
velocity now.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.330
On his head, for example,
there's a lot

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.360
more wind going by.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.200
But it's pressing on a
smaller surface area.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.520
And I'm not going to go too
much into detail of

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.560
pressure right now.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.730
But I want you to get
that intuition.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:56.360
So although the wind is going a
lot faster, it's going a lot

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.460
faster on a smaller area.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.390
And its actual force is
the exact same thing.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.850
And we know that because he's
not accelerating anymore.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.060
Because he's at his
terminal velocity.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.070
So think about that a bit.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.000
It's a bit of a trick question,
but I think it gives

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.890
you a good intuition on what
acceleration means, what

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.370
terminal velocity means, and
it'll start to give you a
