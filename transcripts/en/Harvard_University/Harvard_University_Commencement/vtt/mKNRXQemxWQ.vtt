00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.360
Well I marched through the storm, and I marched
through the rain.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.860
And I marched through some sickness and some
heartache and pain.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.680
And I laid on the ground, and I looked up
at the sky,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.859
and I prayed to Lord up above and asked why.

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.100
But oh no, I'm not tired, I'm not through
marching yet,

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.180
and I'ma march until I die, oh children: this
you can bet.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:22.700
So we say I'm gonna sing out, I'm gonna march on.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:32.520
I'm gonna sing out, I'm gonna march on.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.240
Gonna put one foot in front of the other foot yes I am

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:45.400
I'm gonna sing out, I'm gonna march on.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:57.000
I'm gonna sing out, I'm gonna march on.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.320
Oh, well my grandmomma marched, and 
my granddaddy too.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.740
And I never thought it'd be something that
I'd have to do.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.520
But I'll march if I must.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.019
I got a mission, you see.

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.510
And I'll be damned if my children have to
march for me.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.540
Now, I believe in the power of raising my
voice.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.689
And I believe in the power of making some
noise.

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:38.420
If I die I can't sing, and if I can't sing
I'll die.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:45.400
So we should sing for one another now let's give it a try.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:03:42.460
I'm gonna sing out, I'm gonna march on.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:53.240
[Applause]

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.240
John Lewis

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:04.860
An extraordinary honor for both the students and John Lewis himself

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.980
What a beautiful, beautiful tribute to him

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.380
I was only 18 when I heard him at the March on Washington
