application that is a based on the
 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.680
application that is a based on the
module concept for modern concept I mean

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690
module concept for modern concept I mean
 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.510
module concept for modern concept I mean
that the base application must be able

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.659
to lowered external library enjoy I
would like it to ask if there is any

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669
would like it to ask if there is any
 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.820
would like it to ask if there is any
suggestion from you guys how to

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830

then we will supply the download link of

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419
then we will supply the download link of

then we will supply the download link of
the child library and then the app would

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:27.070
the child library and then the app would
be able to load at runtime this model

kind of what you're trying to do with
 

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.390
kind of what you're trying to do with
that one but my gut instinct would be it

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:00.400
that one but my gut instinct would be it
 

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.890
that one but my gut instinct would be it
kind of sounds like you want to just

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:01.900
kind of sounds like you want to just
 

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.020
kind of sounds like you want to just
have something in a relative layout at

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:04.030
have something in a relative layout at
 

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.540
have something in a relative layout at
the activity layer and then essentially

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:06.550
the activity layer and then essentially
 

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:08.310

add the fragments within that and just

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320
add the fragments within that and just
 

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.440
add the fragments within that and just
make sure that the window element is

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:10.450
make sure that the window element is
 

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.670
make sure that the window element is

good idea but ultimately it kind of

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:22.090

yeah
 

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:35.220
yeah
that's what I do relative layout at the

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:35.230
that's what I do relative layout at the
 

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:40.830
that's what I do relative layout at the
activity then trial pretty yeah you

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:40.840
activity then trial pretty yeah you
 

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.600
activity then trial pretty yeah you
could do a download and customize it

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:42.610
could do a download and customize it
 

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:44.510
could do a download and customize it
there'll be another way of doing it that

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:44.520
there'll be another way of doing it that
 

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.680
there'll be another way of doing it that
