I believe that we've been living in a we

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950
I believe that we've been living in a we
 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.010
I believe that we've been living in a we
live in a technological society but we

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:13.020
live in a technological society but we
 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.510
live in a technological society but we
constantly act as though it as a

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:14.520
constantly act as though it as a
 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.050
constantly act as though it as a
financial society everything that is

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060
financial society everything that is
 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.310
financial society everything that is
going to be of critical importance in

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320
going to be of critical importance in
 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.680
going to be of critical importance in
the next 20 30 years is whether there is

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:21.690
the next 20 30 years is whether there is
 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.720
the next 20 30 years is whether there is
a lot of progress in technology and

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730
a lot of progress in technology and
 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.690
a lot of progress in technology and
science and yet our priorities are

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700
science and yet our priorities are
 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.089
science and yet our priorities are
massively geared towards saving the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099
massively geared towards saving the
 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.249
massively geared towards saving the
financial system rather than making sure

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259
financial system rather than making sure
 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.440
financial system rather than making sure
the technological system works better

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450
the technological system works better
 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.870
the technological system works better
and so for example we had a seven

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880
and so for example we had a seven
 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.520
and so for example we had a seven
hundred billion dollar bailout for the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530
hundred billion dollar bailout for the
 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.830
hundred billion dollar bailout for the
banks in late 2008

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840
banks in late 2008
 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.790
banks in late 2008
even though it would have been

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800
even though it would have been
 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.320
even though it would have been
unthinkable to give seven hundred

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330
unthinkable to give seven hundred
 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.060
unthinkable to give seven hundred
billion dollars to Internet companies in

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070
billion dollars to Internet companies in
 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.390
billion dollars to Internet companies in
2000 or 2001 and I think that's sort of

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400
2000 or 2001 and I think that's sort of
 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.320
2000 or 2001 and I think that's sort of
a double standard reflects the ways in

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330
a double standard reflects the ways in
 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.020
a double standard reflects the ways in
which our priorities are skewed towards

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030
which our priorities are skewed towards
 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.260
which our priorities are skewed towards
finance and away from technology even

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270
finance and away from technology even
 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.390
finance and away from technology even
though it should be the other way around

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400
 
 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.760
 
nothing has changed in the last year

nothing has changed in the last year

financial innovation and technological
innovation are both good to the extent

innovation are both good to the extent
 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.200
innovation are both good to the extent
they involve real innovation and bad at

they involve real innovation and bad at

innovation the thing that is very tricky
 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.900
innovation the thing that is very tricky
about financial innovation is that it's

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910
about financial innovation is that it's
 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.970
about financial innovation is that it's
often hard to know whether it's

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980
often hard to know whether it's
 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.410
often hard to know whether it's
innovation or whether it's something

that's dependent on some kind of

that's dependent on some kind of

that's dependent on some kind of
temporary and unsustainable

temporary and unsustainable
 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.810

unsustainable trajectory so innovation

around that was probably ultimately
 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.690

well so if you have some innovation that

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130
well so if you have some innovation that
 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.090
well so if you have some innovation that
leads to an extraordinary environmental

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100
leads to an extraordinary environmental

damage it may look like you're making a
lot of progress but it turns out not to

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180
lot of progress but it turns out not to
 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.360
lot of progress but it turns out not to
have sort of long-term compounding

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370

innovation have involved misallocation
 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.040

people are being scapegoated a bit too

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850
people are being scapegoated a bit too
 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.630
people are being scapegoated a bit too
much in the finance industry and I think

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640
much in the finance industry and I think
 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.400
much in the finance industry and I think
the question we need to be asking is not

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410
the question we need to be asking is not
 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.130
the question we need to be asking is not
whether there's been too much financial

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140
whether there's been too much financial
 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.080
whether there's been too much financial
innovation but why there has been so

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090
innovation but why there has been so
 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.230
innovation but why there has been so
little innovation in other areas

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240
 
 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.280
 
well financial innovation true financial

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290
well financial innovation true financial
 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.280
well financial innovation true financial
innovation I think ultimately helps many

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290
innovation I think ultimately helps many
 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.690

different aspects of society creates

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700
different aspects of society creates
 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.590
different aspects of society creates
deeper capital markets makes make some

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600
deeper capital markets makes make some
 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.500
deeper capital markets makes make some
money accessible - and capital

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510
money accessible - and capital
 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.000
money accessible - and capital
accessible to people who otherwise would

accessible to people who otherwise would
 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.060
accessible to people who otherwise would
not have it so I think I think true

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070
not have it so I think I think true
 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.610
not have it so I think I think true
financial innovation actually helps a

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620
financial innovation actually helps a
 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.800
financial innovation actually helps a
lot of people again I think the critical

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810
lot of people again I think the critical
 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.330
lot of people again I think the critical
question one needs to ask is whether

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340
question one needs to ask is whether
 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.240
question one needs to ask is whether
we've been seeing genuine innovation or

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250
we've been seeing genuine innovation or
 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.140
we've been seeing genuine innovation or
this temporary detour driven by policies

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150
this temporary detour driven by policies
 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.370
this temporary detour driven by policies
and a culture that had a preference for

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380
and a culture that had a preference for
 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.200
and a culture that had a preference for
ever increasing debt and leverage

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.140
 
I think it is far too early to tell what

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150
I think it is far too early to tell what
 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.480
I think it is far too early to tell what
kinds of innovations are going to be are

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490
kinds of innovations are going to be are
 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.190

going to come out of this crisis I'm not
personally convinced that crisis or

certain kinds of business models have

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010
certain kinds of business models have
 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.510
certain kinds of business models have
been discredited or thrown into question

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520
been discredited or thrown into question
 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.180

that's that's obviously um that

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190
that's that's obviously um that
 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.130
that's that's obviously um that
obviously may open the door for other

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140
obviously may open the door for other
 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.710
obviously may open the door for other
things to be done but I think I think

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720
things to be done but I think I think
 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.630
things to be done but I think I think
that we will we will not only know the

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640
that we will we will not only know the
 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.090
that we will we will not only know the
answer the question of what exactly is

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100
answer the question of what exactly is
 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.790
answer the question of what exactly is
being created as a result this crisis in

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:18.800
being created as a result this crisis in
 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.069
being created as a result this crisis in
twenty years time

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079
 
 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.890
 
the question about what sorts of

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900
the question about what sorts of
 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.210
the question about what sorts of
innovations were likely to see in the

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220
innovations were likely to see in the
 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.249
innovations were likely to see in the
next 10 or 20 years depends a great deal

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:28.259
next 10 or 20 years depends a great deal
 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:31.610
next 10 or 20 years depends a great deal
on what people do the pessimistic view

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620
on what people do the pessimistic view
 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.219
on what people do the pessimistic view
is that we are living in a society that

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229
is that we are living in a society that
 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.469
is that we are living in a society that
depends on innovation and science and

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479
depends on innovation and science and
 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.499
depends on innovation and science and
technology but that is is actually not

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509
technology but that is is actually not
 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:41.899
technology but that is is actually not
focusing on these things nearly enough

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:41.909
focusing on these things nearly enough
 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:44.119
focusing on these things nearly enough
and that as a result we are headed

00:04:44.119 --> 00:04:44.129
and that as a result we are headed
 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:46.909
and that as a result we are headed
towards a extended period of stagnation

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919
towards a extended period of stagnation
 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.450
towards a extended period of stagnation
and very slow growth in throughout all

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460
and very slow growth in throughout all
 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.580
and very slow growth in throughout all
the nations of the developed world the

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590
the nations of the developed world the
 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.430
the nations of the developed world the
more optimistic view is that we somehow

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440
more optimistic view is that we somehow
 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.480
more optimistic view is that we somehow
figure out a way to to restart the

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490
figure out a way to to restart the
 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.249
figure out a way to to restart the
innovative engine that's probably got

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259
innovative engine that's probably got
 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.129
innovative engine that's probably got
installed and and my version of this

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139
installed and and my version of this
 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.080
installed and and my version of this
would be that we go back to where the

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090
would be that we go back to where the
 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.719
would be that we go back to where the
50s and 60s ended and look back at the

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729
50s and 60s ended and look back at the
 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.520
50s and 60s ended and look back at the
great technologies people were pursuing

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530
great technologies people were pursuing
 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.120
great technologies people were pursuing
the time space robots artificial

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130
the time space robots artificial
 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.550
the time space robots artificial
intelligence the next generation of

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560
intelligence the next generation of
 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.370
intelligence the next generation of
biotechnology and and you sort of look

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380
biotechnology and and you sort of look
 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.860
biotechnology and and you sort of look
at where people thought the future of

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870
at where people thought the future of
 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.640
at where people thought the future of
the world was going to be in 1968 and we

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650
the world was going to be in 1968 and we
 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.580
the world was going to be in 1968 and we
try to take off from where where things

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590
try to take off from where where things
 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.789
try to take off from where where things
got detoured around that time
