00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.370
Let us continue this exercise a little bit further.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.060
Imagine that the teacher gives this as a third example to the AI program.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.380
This time again you have three bricks, but the two vertical bricks

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.780
are touching each other. So here is a representation of this input example.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.630
Three bricks, the two vertical bricks are supporting this brick at the top,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.910
however, the two bricks are touching each other. Recall, this is the current

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.870
concept definition that the AI program has. It mus support links here.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.720
And here is the representation of the new example. And the AI program knows that

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.900
this is a negative example. How might the AI program refine or

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.020
specialize this particular current definition, so that this negative example is

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.930
excluded? Well, AI program may say that the current definition can be devised in

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.460
such a way that for these two bricks, where one is left of the other one,

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.580
these two bricks cannot touch each other. This particular symbol means not.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.570
So it is saying that this brick does not touch that one. And

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.670
we have bi-datashield links. Because this one cannot touch the other one, and

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.880
that one cannot touch this one. This is called a forbid-link heuristic. So,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.330
here some particular link, in this particular case touches, is being forbidden.
