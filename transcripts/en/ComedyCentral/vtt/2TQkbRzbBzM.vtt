00:00:01.602 --> 00:00:03.770
- TAKE A WALK, DERS.

00:00:03.804 --> 00:00:05.305
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO KICK
YOUR ASS.

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.508
- OKAY, ADAM,
THIS IS SO DUMB, ALL RIGHT?

00:00:07.541 --> 00:00:09.176
I'D LIKE TO GET
TO THIS PHOTO SHOOT ON TIME.

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:10.244
TRY BEING A PACIFIST.

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:12.179
- OH, I'LL BE A PACIFIST.

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:14.014
I'LL PASS MY FIST
THROUGH YOUR FACE.

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:15.415
- THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:16.483
- OH, ISN'T IT?

00:00:16.517 --> 00:00:17.551
IS THAT POSSIBLE?
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:18.886
I'M SERIOUS.
- IS THIS POSSIBLE?

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:20.053
[horn blaring]

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:22.022
[dramatic chord]

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:24.525
- DROPPED 30 SPOTS
IN THE RANKINGS...

00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:26.393
BECAUSE OF YOU.

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.195
YEAH, CLAUDE-O-GRAPH'S GONE.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.898
FEEL LIKE I THREW AWAY
MY WHOLE EARLY 20s.

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:32.432
FOR <i>NOTHING!</i>
- THAT SUCKS FOR YOU.

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.400
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:34.668
IT'S ABOUT ME AND THIS CHUMP!

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:37.804
- NO, ADAM,
YOU'RE NOT FIGHTING DERS.

00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:41.909
YOU'RE FIGHTING ME.

00:00:41.942 --> 00:00:43.243
[whispering]
GOOD LUCK.
