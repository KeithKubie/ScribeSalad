00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.460
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.280
is talk about the two major ideologies

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.190
you will hear about in the United States,

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.220
and that's the Liberal ideology

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.500
and the Conservative ideology.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.270
And the Liberal ideology
is often associated

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.380
with the Democratic party,
and the Conservative ideology

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.260
is often associated with the Republicans.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.670
But be very careful.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.580
This does not mean that every Democrat

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.700
will have a stereotypically Liberal view

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.470
on every major issue,
or that every Republican

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.510
would have a stereotypically
Conservative view

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.410
on every issue.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.860
We're all individuals,
and many of us will have

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.680
different opinions on these issues,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.620
and might lean Conservative on some,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.163
and might lean Liberal on others.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.700
But just to get a sense of
what Liberal and Conservative

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.920
tend to mean in the United States,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.970
on issues that you will hear about,

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.740
let's go through this list of issues.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.280
And I encourage you to pause this video,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.450
and have your own go at what do you think

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.720
would be the Liberal or
the Conservative viewpoint

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.870
on each of these issues.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.300
So let's start with arguably
one of the most contentious

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.090
issues in the United States,
and that's of abortion.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.820
A Liberal would view this as
a reproductive rights issue.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.500
They view this as the
right of a woman to choose

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.220
what to do with her body.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.540
So they tend to be pro
the right of a woman

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.860
to have an abortion, to
choose to have an abortion,

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.453
and will self-label themselves pro-choice.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.820
Conservatives on the other hand,

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.120
will often view this as a life issue,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.030
that they view the
developing fetus as a life,

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.080
and like any life, has certain rights.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.700
And so they would typically
be against abortion,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.210
and would self-label themselves pro-life.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.170
Affirmative action is
another contentious issue.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.690
This is the idea, and we've
talked about it in other videos,

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.540
that proactive measures should be taken

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.810
in order to address wrongs of the past,

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.660
or in order to address inequality today,

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.210
or discrimination today.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.480
And it often takes form
in, can race be considered

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.020
as a part of admissions
into, say, higher education?

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.280
Liberals tend to be in
favor of affirmative action,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.763
while Conservatives tend to be against it.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.070
The Liberal point of view is yes,

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.620
we have a very unequal society,

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.320
there's a lot of discrimination,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.410
race should be considered a factor

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.000
in order to ease that discrimination.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.030
A Conservative today might argue,

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.380
wait a second, we wanna be
a racially blind society,

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.833
and so we do not want race to be a factor.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.310
Guns is another very contentious issue.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.710
Liberals will often cite
guns as a major factor

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.430
in a lot of the crime and
shootings in the United States,

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.573
and they would tend to be pro gun control.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.530
Conservatives on the other hand,

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.520
will often cite the Second Amendment,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.540
the right to bear arms,
and they would say,

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.430
look, when we see mass shootings or crime,

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.890
it's not a gun issue,
there's other issues at play.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.890
And so they would be more pro gun rights.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.340
They would generally
be against gun control,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.770
and want more rights for gun owners.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.270
On a related note, on crime,

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.100
Liberals tend to view
it as a social issue.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.670
What are the underlying causes,

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.120
say, poverty or something
else that is causing crime?

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.610
They would also be very concerned
with defendants' rights,

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.670
citing examples where
certain ethnic groups,

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.790
certain races might be
disproportionately accused,

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.640
or disproportionately punished.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.150
Conservatives on the other hand,

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.023
tend to favor tougher
policing and tougher laws,

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.090
saying that okay, it's interesting

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.210
to look at the social issues,

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.050
and yes we do need certain rights,

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.940
but at the end of the day,

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.960
you don't wanna be too easy on crime.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.440
So tougher policing, and tougher laws.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.800
Moving into the economic sphere,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.200
the Liberal view on taxes
is generally that it's okay,

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.730
and some Liberals will even view it

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.130
as a tool for building social equality.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.963
They would say hey look,

00:04:05.963 --> 00:04:07.220
if someone's gotta pay for something,

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.550
maybe it should be the rich.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.970
They can afford to pay more,

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.410
and it'll help level the
playing field a little bit.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.700
And so okay, especially on, and
I'll put the rich in quotes,

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.910
because different people
would have different standards

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.730
for what it means to be rich.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.333
And Conservatives generally
are not okay with taxes.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.500
They would say that it is
a disincentive to work.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.030
They would say that it's
a friction on the economy.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.400
They would say that it
would reduce investment

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.380
that could create jobs.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.240
The Liberal and Conservative
views on spending

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.970
is related to that on taxes.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.940
A stereotypical view of Liberals

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.760
is that, hey they might like
to tax, especially on the rich,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.500
and then spend it, especially
on social programs.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.153
Okay, especially on social programs.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.170
Maybe welfare system, or free healthcare,

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.420
these would all be things
that a Liberal point of view

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.600
would more likely to support.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.680
A Conservative viewpoint is not okay

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.710
with government spending,

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.890
that the government should
be as small as possible,

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.890
and spend as little as possible.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.980
Perhaps the only exception,
or one of the few exceptions,

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.630
would be except on military spending.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.630
Except on military, where a
Conservative might be in favor

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.150
of more spending there in order to have

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.820
a strong and muscular military.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.880
Now related to this idea
on the size of government,

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.470
is that of regulation.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.390
Liberals tend to be in
favor of regulation,

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.260
especially if they're in regards

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.030
to things like preserving the environment.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.490
Conservatives tend to
be against regulation,

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.540
saying that okay, maybe some
baseline regulation is okay,

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.880
but it needs to be minimal,

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.710
because the more regulations you have,

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.830
once again, these are
frictions on the economy.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.570
It makes it harder to start a business,

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.070
it makes it harder to grow,

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.280
it makes it more expensive to do things.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.313
So they tend to be against regulation.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.220
Last but not least, and
this is just a survey

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.050
of some of the big issues
you will hear about

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.060
in the United States, is the military.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.490
And I already touched on it.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.900
A Liberal is likely to want a military,

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.860
but they would probably want something

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.210
that does just the base services

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.630
of what you would expect from a military.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.480
If people are invading our borders,

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.200
that the military is there to protect us.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.200
So maybe we could call it basic military.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:23.900
While a Conservative would say,

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.240
hey, you can't get complacent.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.780
Even if we're in a time of peace,

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.010
even if people haven't crossed
our borders in a long time,

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.940
you don't know what's around the corner.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.480
Look at history, there's all sorts

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.630
of complacent societies
that eventually get overrun.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.110
And so they would want a
strong and muscular military.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.370
And they'll make the argument

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.730
that the stronger your military is,

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.360
perhaps maybe the less likely
that you would have to use it,

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.900
because people would not
even want to mess with you.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.910
They wouldn't even wanna
think about messing with you

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.070
if you have a strong and muscular posture.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.490
So I'll leave you there
on these general ideas,

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.020
and once again, these
are stereotypical views.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.360
You will meet many people,
including yourself,

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.220
you might have a mix of these views.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.430
For example, it would not be too difficult

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.000
to find a Democrat who for
example might be pro-choice,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.820
but against affirmative action,

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.240
who is pro gun control,
who is maybe someplace

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.470
in the middle here on crime,

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:23.110
who is economically Conservative,
who's not okay with taxes,

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.050
who wants them to be
as little as possible,

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.540
who is not okay with government spending,

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.280
who's maybe middle of
the road on regulation,

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.350
and maybe they like a
strong muscular military.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.340
And likewise, you could find Republicans

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.963
who similarly have a mix of viewpoints.
