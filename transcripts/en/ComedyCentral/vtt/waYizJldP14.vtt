00:00:01.502 --> 00:00:03.804
As we go to our next game,

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:06.306
Dog Time. Dog Time.

00:00:11.545 --> 00:00:14.181
Photobombs, like everything
in life, are always better

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:15.649
when they involve dogs. Always.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.818
We found a delightful bunch
of dogs photobombing pictures

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.219
on DogTime.com.

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:21.622
For example, here's a classic.

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:25.626
Uh...

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.228
Got the dog
with the tat sleeves there.

00:00:28.262 --> 00:00:30.497
He's probably driving a hybrid.
It's a Labradoodle.

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:33.000
Um, now, as wonderful
as that is, I have to admit,

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.868
I was a little disappointed
to learn that DogTime

00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:37.204
wasn't just <i>Time</i> magazine
for dogs.

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:40.207
I mean, think of all
the hard-hitting dog news.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.476
So, comedians, since I can make
you do whatever I want

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:44.811
on my program, I would like you
to list as many articles

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:48.081
as you can that might appear
in <i>Time</i> magazine for dogs.

00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:50.684
Uh, examples might be
"This year's best tennis balls

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:53.153
rated for chewiness"
or "Why your farts

00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:54.955
shouldn't startle you." Uh,

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.990
I'm gonna put 60 seconds
on the clock. And begin.

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:59.326
-Jenny.
-"Are you a basic bitch?"

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.595
Points. Points.

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:03.263
Affion.

00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:05.866
"How to bark all the time
like an asshole

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.201
when you live
in an apartment building."

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:09.536
Points. Jenny.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.072
"Five things you should know
before you eat that chocolate."

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.540
All right, points.

00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:14.942
Marlon Wayans.

00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:16.476
"How to break up
with your owner."

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.812
Points. Affion.

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:22.115
"The top ten porches it would be
perfect for you to die under."

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.450
Points.

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:24.785
Jenny.

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:27.454
"Ten hot celebrity legs
perfect for humping."

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:29.456
Yes, points. Marlon.

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:31.692
"Squirrel-on-squirrel action."

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:36.930
Squirrels, squirrels, squirrels!

00:01:36.964 --> 00:01:39.333
Points. Affion.

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:41.869
"Your owner--
really your best friend

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:44.538
or some asshole who lost money
on you in a dog fight?"

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:45.873
Points.

00:01:45.906 --> 00:01:47.140
Jenny.

00:01:47.174 --> 00:01:49.142
"How to bring that spark back
into the bedroom

00:01:49.176 --> 00:01:49.243
when you've lost your balls."
