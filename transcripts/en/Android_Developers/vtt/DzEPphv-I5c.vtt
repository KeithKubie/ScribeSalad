EUNICE KIM: We
launched a new section

00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:05.070
on the Google Play Store
filled with really awesome kids

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.260
and family apps.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.260
Those apps are part of our
design for families program.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.060
And for the past
12 months, we've

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.140
been continuing to build on the
suite of features and services

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.580
that we offer to
families who cross play,

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.470
and I wanted to briefly
recap some of our most

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.467
recent launches before
we get into the meat

00:00:21.467 --> 00:00:22.300
of the presentation.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.750
So first of all,
we've been working

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.690
on refining our understanding
of parents as a user segment,

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.610
and finding ways
both big and small

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.660
to personalize their
experiences on Google Play.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.300
I'll just give you one
small example of this.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.065
This is the family
category quick link

00:00:40.065 --> 00:00:41.440
that you're seeing
on the screen.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.910
This is the little
green family button,

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.640
and we've made this more visible
for the parent user segment

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.750
by placing it front and
center on the Play homepage.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.300
This small change resulted in
a really substantial uplift

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.570
for family apps on Google Play.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.190
We've also added on to our most
popular feature for families:

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.150
browsing by character.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.220
In the last 12 months
since our launch,

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.870
we've added another 34 beloved
characters on the Play Store

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.520
globally, including one that
I think everyone in the room

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.210
will recognize, and this
is Angry Birds, of course.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.650
And character painted
pages-- they show off

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.160
a curated collection of movies,
TV shows, apps and games,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.900
books, and even music albums
associated with the character.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.650
So I don't know if anyone here's
excited to see Angry Birds

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.240
the Movie in a couple of days.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.510
I know that my kids are.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.090
They've been watching the
release date pretty closely.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.620
And when Angry Birds the Movie
comes out on Google Play,

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.640
you'll be able to find
it all in one place here

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.770
on the character page.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.270
And we're making this
page far more discoverable

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.050
through search,
through featuring,

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.070
et cetera, all across
the Play Store.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.040
Now beyond the store,
we've also been

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.480
spending more time
thinking deeply

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.450
about how to offer families
more premium services,

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.080
and better support family
interactions across Android.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.650
So last December, we launched
the Google Play Music family

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.540
plan.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.450
This is a subscription
that gives up

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.950
to six people in your family
unlimited music for just

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.815
$14.99 a month.

00:02:09.815 --> 00:02:11.440
Now, if you were
buying this separately

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.240
for each family member, that
would actually cost you $60,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.340
so it's actually a
pretty great value.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.350
And we throw in YouTube
Red on top of that,

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.530
so your whole family can
enjoy YouTube ads free.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.300
This is obviously-- here,
you guys are app developers.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.897
Why am I talking to you
about this music plan?

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:29.480
Now when you lift
up the hood, there's

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.320
something really
important going on here

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.690
that's relevant for our
app developer community.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.970
When you actually get into
these premium services,

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.830
you need to create
a family group,

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.530
so we start understanding
who's in your family.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.250
And the eligibility for these
types of family services

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.780
are anchored around a shared
family payment method.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.400
Now, this really opens up
some interesting possibilities

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.190
in terms of interactions
around payments on Google.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.840
As we all know, it's
really difficult

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.110
to get users to put
their credit card down,

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.690
and a lot of our audience,
children and younger audiences,

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.780
they don't necessarily
have access to credit,

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.160
or the existing options wouldn't
have been particularly secure

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.900
for them.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.540
So with the family
payment method,

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.590
family members can buy almost
anything on Google Play,

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.260
including paid apps,
in app purchases,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.730
and other kinds of
digital content.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.650
So how does that work exactly?

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.720
This is something that's live,
you could test it out yourself.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.140
Let's take a closer
look at this scenario.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.040
Imagine my teenager is playing
Transformers Rescue Bots,

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.025
and he wants to buy the
two bots bundle for $5.

00:03:35.025 --> 00:03:37.230
Well he doesn't have
a credit card yet,

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.680
he used up his
Play gift card that

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.580
is grandmother gave
him a month ago,

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.420
and instead of
abandoning the purchase,

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.190
or worse yet, heckling
me for my credit card,

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.410
where I have to add
that to his account,

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.930
he can actually use the
family payment method.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.040
For in-app purchases, we
provide the family manager

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.530
with a feature called
purchase approvals.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.110
This means that I have to
actually approve the purchase

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.690
before it goes through.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.816
Now if it was my husband
making the purchase,

00:04:01.816 --> 00:04:03.940
well I don't really want
to bother with all of that

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.290
because I do trust him,
so I have the option

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.290
of turning this setting off.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.550
And note that the family payment
method is an optional feature

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.190
for families.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.344
No one is forced to use it.

00:04:13.344 --> 00:04:14.760
Even when you're
part of a family,

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.140
it's just one more
additional payment method

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.550
that is available for
your family members.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.839
So the family group and
the family payment method

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:25.460
are things we'll be continuing
to build on this year,

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.010
and you probably saw a
little note in your inbox

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.902
yesterday about family
library, which is coming.

00:04:31.902 --> 00:04:34.110
I don't have more to share
about that at this moment,

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.290
but you can expect a
little bit more news

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.140
on this in a few months.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.590
So with that, let's pivot to
our main topic today, which

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.770
is about building
family-friendly apps

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.552
and a family-friendly
business on Google Play.

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:48.510
Now we know all of you
sitting in the audience,

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.310
you're developers of
kids and family apps.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.597
Some of you are educators.

00:04:51.597 --> 00:04:53.430
Some of you are here
because you're parents,

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.760
or you're just still
young at heart.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.710
You hear about all the great
Android and Google APIs,

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.304
and you're wondering to
yourself can I use that service?

00:05:01.304 --> 00:05:02.970
Is there a right way
to use that service

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.462
as a kids' app developer?

00:05:04.462 --> 00:05:05.920
We know it's hard
to figure out how

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.870
to navigate the intersection
of Google and kids apps,

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.070
so we wanted to give you
some helpful tips on how

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.250
to use our services and APIs.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.920
So, first of all, let's
talk about your apps.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.920
Your app probably falls
into one of these 2 buckets.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.440
Either you're making an app
that's developed primarily

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.640
for kids, or you're
making an app

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.900
that's meant to be enjoyed
by both kids and adults.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.385
Now, if your app doesn't
fall into either of these two

00:05:30.385 --> 00:05:32.132
buckets, then you
probably don't need

00:05:32.132 --> 00:05:34.340
to be sitting in this session
unless you're just here

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.837
for the air conditioning.

00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:37.420
Let's move on.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.200
Just keep it in mind which
type of app you have.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.985
Now, if you have an app that's
designed for kids and families,

00:05:45.985 --> 00:05:47.360
here's the easiest
tip of the day

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.470
that we'll give you, which
is joining the Design

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.780
for Families program.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.447
Why?

00:05:51.447 --> 00:05:53.280
Well it's better for
your apps and it's also

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.850
better for our users.

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.880
So most of you already
know about the benefits

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.840
of this program, but I'll
just quickly recap it.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.210
You have an opportunity to
be featured in the family

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.940
category on Google Play.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.230
You get to rank and top
chart your family apps,

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.390
in addition to regular
top charts in the games

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.030
or the apps section.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.060
You can be discovered in
search queries relating

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.160
to kids content.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.457
We boost you up.

00:06:15.457 --> 00:06:17.790
And you get recognized in the
store with the family star

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.160
badge, which is something
that our users look

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.350
for to understand whether or
not your app is family friendly.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.600
We also collect more
information about the target age

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.460
of your app, the specific
category that you're targeting.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.690
This actually helps us
do more on the back end

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.140
to make sure that we're
actually pushing the right apps

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.230
to the right types of users.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.970
Now, whether you're part of
the Design for Families program

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.750
or not, the way
that kids interact

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.126
with Google and
Android APIs does

00:06:45.126 --> 00:06:46.500
require some
additional tweaking,

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.020
so we're going to dive
into that a bit right now.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.270
OK, so let's talk about ads.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.520
This is probably the
area that most of you

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.060
want to know the most about.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.159
Now, if your app is targeting
kids as part of its audience,

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:03.450
you probably know there are
a lot of legal requirements

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.890
for respecting child privacy in
different parts of the world.

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.790
And if you're using Admob
as one of your ad networks,

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:14.020
then Admob actually offers an
option for dealing with this.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.880
And this is a
pretty simple thing.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.700
When you basically go to
request an ad from Admob,

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.990
you just tag the ad request
in your app with a tag

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.920
that we call TFCD, and
that stands for Tag

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.850
For Child Directed Treatment.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.830
This basically turns off
interest-based advertising

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.054
and re-marketing
in the ad request.

00:07:34.054 --> 00:07:35.470
There's another
common requirement

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:37.320
in many parts of
the world, and this

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.410
is that the ad content you need
to display inside a kids' app

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.900
needs to be age appropriate.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.530
When you need a
kid-friendly ad, Admob

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.880
does offer an option
for this as well.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.310
This is what we call KFA, which
stands for Kid Friendly Ad.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.790
So again, all you simply
do is tag your ad request

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.280
with this particular
tag and we'll actually

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:03.042
deliver kid friendly content in
the advertisement to your app.

00:08:03.042 --> 00:08:04.750
Now if you're
participating in the Design

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.730
for Families program, and
your primarily targeting kids,

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:09.830
Google will automatically
tag your ad requests,

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.750
so you don't have to do
that work on your end.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.660
But otherwise, you'll
need to make sure

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:20.370
that you're actually adding this
into your ad request directly.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:22.810
Now, you may have noticed
that we also recently started

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:26.620
displaying this little label
on the details pages for apps.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.960
And this is a little
label that tells

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.386
users hey, my app
actually contains ads,

00:08:32.386 --> 00:08:34.344
because this is one of
our top feature requests

00:08:34.344 --> 00:08:38.409
from parents on the Play Store.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:40.799
Since this past January,
in Developer Console

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:43.559
you'll notice that there's a
section where you can actually

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:46.800
tell us yes, my app does
in fact contain ads,

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.150
and this will actually help
speed up your review process.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.890
We know that everyone
is always eager

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.900
to get their apps on to the
store as soon as possible,

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.300
so make sure that
you're actually

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.125
checking this box if your app in
fact does contain advertising.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:05.370
Now let's talk about
Google Play Games services.

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.920
Has anyone here tried out
the auto login feature

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.581
that we recently
launched in February?

00:09:10.581 --> 00:09:11.080
No?

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:11.730
Maybe not.

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:12.230
OK.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.120
Well you should check it out.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.390
Play Games, as you
know, offers a variety

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:19.250
of features like leader
boards, achievements,

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:23.000
multi-player games, and even
video recording inside the app.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.650
Now unfortunately,
we can't necessarily

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:28.420
offer these features to
children under the age of 13,

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.700
since Google accounts are made
for children ages 13 and up,

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.240
or users aged 13 and up

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.650
So here's really
the key takeaway

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.530
for developers of kids' apps.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:40.470
First, if your app is really
primarily targeting just

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.180
children, you shouldn't
integrate the game service.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.690
Really, really basic.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.930
Now, if your app is targeting
both kids and adults,

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:50.280
you can integrate the
Play Games service,

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.257
you just need to make
sure that it's optional.

00:09:52.257 --> 00:09:54.090
There's two different
implementation options

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.392
when you read through
this in our documentation.

00:09:56.392 --> 00:09:57.850
You just need to
make sure that you

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.450
choose the optional
implementation rather

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:01.710
than the auto login version.

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:08.090
Another really great
feature for kids is speech,

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:10.110
and using voice-based
applications

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:14.150
makes a lot of sense for kids'
apps because a lot of our users

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.640
they don't [INAUDIBLE]
yet, they don't necessarily

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.050
know how to spell well and
they're probably not typing

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:22.820
that proficiently on a device.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.400
So, as you know, Android
offers a world class speech

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.480
API which can be used to power
things like voice search,

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.010
like we have here in
our YouTube kid's app.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:33.890
Now, audio recording is
a sensitive privacy area

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.730
for kids' apps, and
we know some of you

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.150
may be wary about adding
these types of features

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.670
because you didn't know
how to go about it.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:43.830
Well, I'm happy to tell you that
the Android speech API actually

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:47.240
offers a way for
you to tell us when

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.710
you want us to treat the voice
search requests in your app

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:52.310
with more sensitivity.

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.960
Similar to the ad situation,
all you need to do

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.200
is send a special tag
with your request,

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.450
and if you're part of the
Design for Families program,

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.760
again, we take care
of this for you

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.440
and we're actually tagging
all of your voice requests

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.880
on your behalf on the back end.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.672
Finally, the most important
tip of the day: you

00:11:10.672 --> 00:11:12.380
don't have to keep
this all in your head.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.820
You don't have to furiously
scribble down notes.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.920
We'll be including all of
this material in a new section

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.450
in our Developer
Policy Center that's

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.970
called Kids and Families This is
coming in June, and all of this

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.350
will be covered in detail
with obviously a lot more

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:30.520
technical instruction on how to
do the ad tagging, et cetera.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.540
So with that, I'm going
to hand it over to Shazia,

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.110
because we've discussed how
to build your app in a family

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.220
friendly way.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.340
Now let's talk about how
to build your business

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.270
on Google Play as a kids' app.

00:11:44.234 --> 00:11:46.704
SHAZIA MAKHDUMI: Thanks.
[APPLAUSE] Nice job,

00:11:46.704 --> 00:11:50.240
[INAUDIBLE] Hi everyone,
I'm Shazia Makhdumi,

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.360
and for those I haven't met, I
lead our BD team for Families

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.170
and Education,
which means I work

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.190
with a lot of the
developers in the audience.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:01.790
How many family or
kids' apps and games

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:03.910
developers in the
audience today?

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.865
OK, cool, excellent.

00:12:05.865 --> 00:12:07.990
For those who have been to
any of my presentations,

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:09.550
I like to keep it
interactive and ask

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.980
you questions because
I get bored of hearing

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.380
myself speak all the time.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.850
By the way, before we
start, how many people

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:22.162
prefer-- who have been to I/O
at Moscone in past years--

00:12:22.162 --> 00:12:24.620
raise your hand if you've been
to I/O before at the Moscone

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.440
Center.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.270
Of these, how many
prefer this location?

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.030
I share your sentiments.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:39.590
OK, that was a quick poll for
feedback to the events team,

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:41.000
but anyway.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:41.770
We'll get started.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:48.250
Eunice talked a lot about
some of the policies designed

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:49.020
for families.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:53.430
As you think about building
family, mixed age, or purely

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.000
kids directed apps,
we want to share

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.810
some feedback we've gotten from
more developers and from users.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:02.420
So tablet optimization is
really important as something

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.150
we've heard, and in
fact 60% of our spend

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.940
for family apps
in the Play Store

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.604
comes from tablets, which is
unlike any other category.

00:13:10.604 --> 00:13:12.270
And this is not a
surprise, because when

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:15.460
you think about it, your
parents have phones, which

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.450
yes is a very personal device.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:19.590
They may give it to their
kid at a restaurant,

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:23.350
but your tablet is kind of your
family or living room device,

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:24.070
we've seen.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.600
In fact, a recent poll we
conducted of kids, especially

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.910
younger kids, they actually
say they prefer playing

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:32.070
on tablets than on phones.

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.070
We have a tablet
optimization checklist

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.640
on android.developer.com,
so you should definitely

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.350
check that out to make sure that
you are ready for-- your app is

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:43.590
optimized for tablets.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:45.340
One of my favorite questions.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:49.950
How many people here have
used alpha and beta testing?

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:52.750
It's still a low percentage,
though better than the two

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.870
hands I typically get.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:56.840
And out of those, how
many-- have you guys

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.310
used open beta at all, which is
something we launched recently?

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:01.130
OK.

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:02.450
Closed beta?

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:03.810
OK, cool.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.290
So basically for those
who may not be familiar,

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:09.910
alpha and beta testing is
a way for you to check out

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.790
new app features you
may be launching,

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:17.790
or even your new app, to a
smaller group of select users

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.025
before you launch it out
to the world in general.

00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:21.400
And this allows
them to check it,

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.490
to give you feedback, for you
to catch bugs and fix them

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:27.330
before it's released into
kind of the big wide world

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.630
and any bugs affect your rating.

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:35.160
So with an open beta, it can be
open to pretty much anyone who

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.970
wants it, though you can
cap the amount of people.

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:40.930
You don't have to worry about
creating that beta community.

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:44.620
But if you only want to use
it for a specific audience,

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.725
then you have the option of
creating a closed community

00:14:47.725 --> 00:14:53.150
with the list of emails to be
beta testers off your content.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:15:00.700
And in fact, at I/O, we
launched the ability for you to,

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.330
if you have an
open beta, for user

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.934
to sign into that from
the store listing itself.

00:15:06.934 --> 00:15:08.350
So if I go into
the store listing,

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:14.140
and an app has an open beta,
I can select to beta the app.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.230
For a select group
of apps, we'll

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.270
be featuring them in
a collection, called

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.260
an early access
collection, to expose

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.290
our users to really promising
open betas that are not

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.640
in production yet.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.270
Another audience question.

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.790
Who's used promo codes so far?

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:37.350
OK, cool.

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:40.036
Who knows about promo codes?

00:15:40.036 --> 00:15:41.660
I'm going to assume
everyone else wants

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.220
to know about promo codes, so
I'm going to talk about that.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.920
So basically promo
codes is something

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.260
we launched a couple
of months ago,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:52.950
and it's the ability for you
to create up to 500 promo codes

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:57.480
and have a self-serve
promo code campaign.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.260
Instead of having
to work with Google

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.160
and figure out how to get
promo codes in front of users,

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.340
for up to 500 users, you
can create a promo code

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:09.530
and send it out so they can
experience your app or part

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.320
of the content for free.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.070
So this would be really
useful for things

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:16.790
like, if there's a certain group
of influencers who you want

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:20.140
to get your app out to, or
a group of let's say parent

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.820
evangelists, or even if there's
a marketing campaign you're

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.752
doing to a target set of users.

00:16:24.752 --> 00:16:26.460
So you can basically
run this on your own

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.590
from the developer console.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:31.945
And then store
listening experiments--

00:16:31.945 --> 00:16:33.570
actually I won't ask
about this since I

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.370
do know that 70% of
our top developers

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.560
are using store
listing experiments

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.580
and this has been an
extremely popular feature.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.220
With this, what you
can do as you know,

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.430
is change the text, the
graphics, icons, et cetera,

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:50.210
to see what do users respond to.

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:52.680
We've actually gotten
feedback, especially

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.690
from kids and the
developers of kids' apps,

00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:00.500
that kids love icons and
colors, and that's typically

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.670
the first thing they gravitate
towards when they select

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:05.700
an app to purchase or download.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.230
And so getting that right
is really important.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.484
One of our top
partners, Baby First,

00:17:10.484 --> 00:17:12.400
experimented with a
couple of different icons,

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.710
and they found that using a
different icon for their app

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.819
actually increase
the installs by 10%.

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:21.900
And so they ended up
converting to that icon.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.750
Rovio has tried a bunch
of different experiments,

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:27.839
and in fact now, all of their
launches are soft launches.

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:30.680
They get the A/B testing
to get their listing right,

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.270
and then they launch their
app to the general public.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:37.420
We also recently, I think
it was as soon as last week,

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.660
announced that you can actually
run up to five store listing

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:41.740
experiments at a time.

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:47.260
Reviews and ratings
are really important.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.950
How many people have
responded to user reviews?

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:52.240
OK, good.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.710
So reviews and ratings
matter in the family space

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:56.170
more than other categories.

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:59.730
Reason being, and I see
this in myself as a parent,

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:02.340
parents look to other
parents for ideas,

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:06.600
inspiration, things on
what to get their kids,

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.770
stuff that will help their kids.

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:12.920
One of the main things they
go to is ratings and reviews.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.970
But these are two
way streets, right?

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:19.130
So you want to help build up
that community so people will

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:20.880
engage with your app,
leave reviews, tell

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.350
their friends about it.

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:24.600
And we also recently had
announced the ability for you

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.530
to respond to reviews,
which I'm glad

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:28.900
quite a few people are
availing themselves of.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.330
One of the things
we saw that when,

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.720
especially if you
have low reviews,

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:38.620
and you respond
to those reviews,

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.970
quite a few users end up
then changing their rating.

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.580
And they end up
raising the rating

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.970
by an average of
about 0.7 stars,

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:48.050
which is enough to get you over
maybe into the next star rating

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:49.470
category.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:53.070
And star rating really
matters, because people equate

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.950
star rating with quality.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:58.440
We've seen a very strong
correlation between quality

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.750
and revenue, so getting
that rating important

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:04.030
and doing whatever it
takes is really important.

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:06.440
Because we recognize that,
we've done a lot of stuff

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.010
on that in the
developer console.

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:11.200
So there's the ability to
look at ratings and reviews

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.320
by time segment, by country.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.890
In fact, one of my favorites
is review highlights,

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.590
so you can see what are the
top themes that people are

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:22.574
talking about your app or game.

00:19:22.574 --> 00:19:23.990
It may be very
different from what

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:26.050
you thought your app
or game was about,

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:28.000
and people are responding
to something else.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.020
And that helps you change your
marketing campaign, or think

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:35.190
about an audience you
may have not considered.

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:40.920
We also recently released
review benchmarks,

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:45.500
which lets you compare your
app to other similar apps

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.230
in your category
across common topics,

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:51.560
like speed or
stability, et cetera,

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.110
so you can see how your
app compares to those-- how

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:58.060
do your ratings compare
to other similar apps

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.000
across those dimensions,
and make any fixes.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.140
We also allow you
the ability to be

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:07.620
able to measure your rating on
topics specific to your app,

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:12.120
and see where it is that
you are falling behind

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.130
so you can make improvements.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.580
We recognize how important
ratings and reviews are,

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.390
so there will be a
lot of effort made

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:23.140
to help you understand
them and make them go up.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.482
So switching gears a
little bit, how many people

00:20:25.482 --> 00:20:28.670
here use subscription
as a business model?

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:30.530
OK, cool.

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:33.710
So this chart actually shows
the growth in subscriptions

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:35.400
on Google Play.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.120
There are a lot
more apps and games

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.330
that are using this
as a business model.

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:42.090
We have been doing
a lot of stuff

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:45.490
on our end to make sure
it's easy for developers

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:48.090
to be able to run a
subscription business.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.940
So things like the period, a
weekly, monthly, quarterly,

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:55.090
annual subscription, the ability
to have grace periods, goodwill

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.454
credits, et cetera.

00:20:57.454 --> 00:20:59.120
Yesterday, I was
talking to a developer.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.536
One of the best
compliments we got

00:21:00.536 --> 00:21:03.890
was when they mentioned
that our subscription

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:08.210
product and the way to
manage subscriptions on Play

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:10.965
is head and shoulders
above other platforms.

00:21:10.965 --> 00:21:14.770
I was very happy to hear that.

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:17.480
Freemium is another
model that actually

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.800
is pretty popular on Play.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:25.100
Among the kids' developers here,
how many people use Freemium?

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.440
OK.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.810
So one may think you know
what, in app purchases, kids,

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:30.980
is that really appropriate?

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:34.060
Should we really be showing
kids in app purchases?

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.220
Well, Story Toys is one
of our top partners.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.940
When they launched
Chuggington, they

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:43.240
saw that for Chug Patrol,
on the Freemium version,

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.550
they actually got about 250x
more downloads, and 3x more

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:49.320
revenue than the
premium version, which

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.500
led them to actually then launch
their new app, My Very Hungry

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.520
Caterpillar, as
Freemium on Play.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.110
And it's seen strong
revenue and downloads.

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:01.970
Barry can chat more with you on
that if you have any questions.

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:05.160
And I also want to point out,
we don't have any restrictions

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:09.190
on having IAP in the kid's
section, on family section,

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:11.160
and in Google Play.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.510
What we do have, though, as
Eunice mentioned earlier,

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:19.700
is the ability for password
protection for IAP purchases,

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.790
so we can make sure it's
parents who are approving

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:25.220
the purchase and not kids.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.240
OK, so we went over
quite a few things,

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.020
and you'll hear a
lot more hopefully

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:32.060
at I/O. In fact, I think
the next session here--

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.040
next session in the
amphitheater at 11:00

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.960
is about what's new
in Google Play, which

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.850
we go into more detail
on some of the things

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:39.740
I've talked about.
