00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.300
I've drawn an arbitrary
triangle right over here,

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.210
and I've also drawn its three
medians: median EB, median FC,

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.990
and median AD.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.400
And we know that where the three
medians intersect at point G

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.309
right over here, we
call that the centroid.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.710
What I want to do in this
video is prove to you

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.520
that the centroid is exactly 2/3
along the way of each median.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.130
Or another way to
think about it,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.804
we can pick any one
of these medians,

00:00:27.804 --> 00:00:28.970
and let's say let's pick EB.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.860
What I want to do
is I want to prove

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:38.230
that EG is equal to 2 times GB.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.900
So whatever distance this is
it's twice this distance there.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.290
Or another way to
think about it is EG

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.090
is 2/3 along the way of EB.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.240
And the logic that I'm
using to prove this you

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.060
can use for any of
the medians to show

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.780
that the centroid is exactly
2/3 along the way of any median,

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.290
or divides it into
a segment that's

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.320
twice as long as
the other segment.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.570
And to do that, let's focus--
I want to focus on triangle ABE

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.240
right over here.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.996
And I'm going to draw this
median as essentially the base.

00:01:11.996 --> 00:01:13.120
So let me draw it that way.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.920
I'm going to try to
color code it similarly.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.110
So we draw it a little
bit flatter than that.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.480
So it's like that.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.182
And then we have the
two yellow sides,

00:01:25.182 --> 00:01:28.070
so it looks something like this.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.250
It looks something like that.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.520
And then we have the
centroid, right over here

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.830
at G. That is our
centroid, and then we

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.780
have this magenta
line going to A.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.000
Let me draw it a little
bit neater than that.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.100
We have that line
going to A, and then we

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.700
have this blue line going
to F right over here.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.650
And let me label all the points.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.040
Go back to the orange color.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.660
So this is going to be
E, this is going to be B,

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.046
this is going to be A, this is
going to be F right over here.

00:02:05.046 --> 00:02:07.420
And just to make sure we have
all the same markings, that

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.170
little marking there is that
marking, these two markings,

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.120
these two markings are on
this side right over there.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.070
And the whole way that I'm
going to prove that EG is twice

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.690
as long as GB is just
refer to the result

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.380
that we did, I think,
a couple of videos

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.080
ago that the medians divide
this triangle into six smaller

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.140
triangles that all
have equal area.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.617
So another way to think about
it is each of these three

00:02:32.617 --> 00:02:33.950
small triangles have equal area.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.190
These are three of the total
of six smaller triangles.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.530
So these three all
have equal area.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.480
So let's think about this
triangle right over here.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.330
Let's think about this
triangle, triangle AGB.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.590
This is triangle AGB
right over there.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.920
Those are the same triangles.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.020
And let's compare that to
triangle EAG right over here.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.910
Let's compare it
to this triangle,

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.300
which is this triangle
right over here

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.410
on the original drawing.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.580
Now, they both have
the exact same height.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.880
If you view EG as their base--
or I the guess their shared

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.440
base, they don't have
the exact same base.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.690
The smaller triangle
has the base E-- sorry,

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.720
the smaller orange triangle
has GB as it's base.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.260
The larger blue triangle
has EG as its base,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.310
but they definitely both have
the same height, or altitude,

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.140
when you draw it this way.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.610
So their height, in both
cases, is this right over here.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.660
Now the other thing
that we do know

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.010
is that this blue
triangle EAG has

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.260
twice the area of
the orange triangle.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.310
How do we know that?

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.300
Because it's got two of
these triangles in it.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.060
So one way to think about it
is if this orange triangle has

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.144
area x, actually let
me call it a-- well

00:03:51.144 --> 00:03:53.060
I already used a, so I'm
going to call it area

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.090
x-- then each of these
blue triangles have area x.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:05.520
Or you could say this entire
blue region has area 2x.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.210
So if you look at this blue
triangle right over here,

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.880
we know that 1/2 times base
times height is equal to area.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.670
So we get 1/2-- the base is EG.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.839
1/2-- I'll do that
in the green color--

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:27.940
1/2 EG times height times
this yellow height is

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.200
going to be equal to 2x.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.170
I'm just applying the formula
for area of a triangle.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.320
1/2 base times height
is equal to area.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.720
This is our area.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.020
Now, let's do the same thing
for this orange triangle.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.120
1/2-- let me scroll over a
little bit to the right--

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:56.060
we have 1/2 GB times
the yellow height is

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.585
going to be equal to x.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.730
Well we can substitute it.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.520
If this is equal to x, we can
place this entire expression

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.880
right over here for x.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.770
So let's do that.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.730
We get 1/2-- and
you might already

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.520
see where this is going, but
I won't skip any steps here--

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:28.982
we get 1/2 times EG times
h is equal to 2 times x.

00:05:28.982 --> 00:05:30.940
But instead of x, I'm
going to write this here.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:38.370
Is equal to 2 times 1/2
times GB times this length--

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.570
times the base of the
smaller triangle times h.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.950
And now we can
just simplify this.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.620
We have 2 times 1/2
is just going to be 1.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.950
You can divide both
sides by h, and we

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.190
are left with 1/2
EG is equal to GB.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.329
Or we could write EG
over 2 is equal to-- let

00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:01.870
me do it in the same
color since I've

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.840
gone this far with
the same colors.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:12.855
So we can write 1/2
EG is equal to GB.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.420
And we're done.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.116
This is essentially saying
that GB is half of EG.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.430
So for example, if EG is
2, this is going to be 1.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.610
If EG is 4, this
is going to be 2.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.111
So we've actually
proven our result.

00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:31.693
Well actually, let's
go back to-- this

00:06:31.693 --> 00:06:33.110
is the result we
wanted to prove.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.800
To get to there we just multiply
both sides of this equation

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.410
by 2.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.960
You multiply this, the
left-hand side by 2, you get EG.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.880
You multiply the right-hand
side by 2, you get GB.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.800
So we've proven that
EG is twice GB .

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.580
And you can apply the same
logic to any of the medians

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.310
to show that the
centroid is exactly

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.741
2/3 along the way of the median.
