- [Voiceover] And as I was like
shitting in this Tupperware

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:11.611
I just felt so close
to my dad, you know?

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:13.446
I was like, oh my God and just

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:15.382
(fart noise)

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:17.951
(techno music)

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:38.038
(applause)

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:41.174
- Here's the show,
it's very simple.

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:42.409
It's just a bunch
of funny people

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.077 align:start size:84% position:16%
who are all telling
true stories.

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:45.278
She's a great story teller.

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:46.780 align:start size:84% position:16%
You guys will
absolutely love her.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.415
She has her own one-woman
show called Bad Bride.

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.784
Ladies and gentleman, Ms.
Giulia Rozzi everybody.

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:51.618
Let her hear it.

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:54.254
(applause)

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:55.789
- So I live in New York

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.792
and New York is gross and
beautiful as we all know

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:02.328
and I've experienced a lot
of disgusting things there

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:05.765 align:start size:97% position:3%
such as one time I was
eating pizza in a pizzeria,

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:07.067
and as I was eating pizza

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.536 align:start size:81% position:19%
one of the ceiling
tiles opened up

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:13.673 align:start size:94% position:6%
and a rat fell out of
the ceiling, a living rat

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:16.576
and it wasn't one of
those like cute rats

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:18.178
with like the hat and the sass

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:20.547 align:start size:84% position:16%
from Muppets Take
Manhattan, you know?

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:21.915 align:start size:94% position:6%
Because one of those rats,
I would have been like

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:23.583
all right cool rat, you know?

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:26.920
But it was just a nasty
like Syphilis-filled rat

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.522 align:start size:81% position:19%
and it (thunk)
fell on the ground

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:33.827
20 pounds, whatever it
was, like an infant.

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:35.962 align:start size:84% position:16%
It fell and I, just
without even thinking,

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:38.765
instinctually I just
jumped on the table

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.834
and then I threw my pizza at it

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:43.269
'cuz that's what you
do in an animal attack

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:46.039
you give it food immediately.

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.273
And then someone opened the door

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:48.908 align:start size:84% position:16%
to walk into the
pizzeria and the rat

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:51.711
was like such a city
rat, it ran right out.

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:53.847 align:start size:97% position:3%
It was like, "I have a meeting
on the upper westside,"

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:56.850
you know it was just
like, wearing like

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.685
you know Manolo Blahniks

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:00.653 align:start size:84% position:16%
and drinking a
martini or whatever.

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:02.322
I said to the guy
behind the counter,

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:05.892 align:start size:88% position:13%
I go hey a rat just
fell out of the ceiling.

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:09.229
And he goes, "That's
New York, for you."

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.598
I was like, what?

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:14.100
Why do we live here?
But it's wonderful.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.602
So that happens and then

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:17.170
the other thing that happens
when you live there for awhile

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.539 align:start size:88% position:13%
not only do you get used
to disgusting things,

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:22.575
but you yourself kinda
become a little grosser

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:25.145 align:start size:94% position:6%
than most people in other
parts of the country.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:26.613
Like I've done some gross things

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:28.314 align:start size:84% position:16%
and the grossest
thing I've ever done

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.150
was about eight years ago and

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.886 align:start size:84% position:16%
my toilet was broken
in my apartment.

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:35.221
And my boyfriend at
the time went out

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:38.057
to go get a plunger
and I couldn't wait

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:41.094 align:start size:84% position:16%
because I'd already
had coffee and

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:42.295
I shat in a Tupperware.

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:45.265
(laughter)

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:49.169
A brand new Tupperware,
hadn't been used before

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:52.939
and as I was shitting
over the Tupperware,

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.942 align:start size:84% position:16%
I was standing
over the tub just--

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:57.944 align:start size:97% position:3%
I had drank the night
before, it was just a mess.

00:02:57.944 --> 00:02:59.546
(laughter)

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:02.615 align:start size:88% position:13%
Yeah, you should.
Everyone should hate me.

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:04.918
So I am shitting
in this Tupperware

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:07.086
feeling so ashamed and
all I could think about

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:09.189
was my parents were
immigrants from Italy

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.457
and how my dad would
always tell the story

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:13.693 align:start size:94% position:6%
of how when he immigrated
here he was on a boat

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:14.961
and he traveled all these miles

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:16.796
and he had to poop in a bucket.

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:19.165 align:start size:94% position:6%
And as I was like shitting
in this Tupperware

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:22.569
I just felt so close
to my dad, you know?

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:24.938
I was like oh my God and just

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:27.340
(fart noise)

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:30.677 align:start size:88% position:13%
And then when I
realized what I had done

00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:32.612 align:start size:84% position:16%
like after, and it was
like a quart-sized,

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:34.013
it was like a big container, I

00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:38.952
put it in multiple trash
bags to hide my shame,

00:03:38.952 --> 00:03:41.354
and then I shoved it in
the garbage downstairs,

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:42.855
and I buried it in there deep

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:44.557
'cuz I was terrified
that a homeless person

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:47.660
was gonna walk by and be
like, "cake," you know

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.332
and just, so I hid it in there,

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:54.901 align:start size:97% position:3%
and then I went back upstairs
and I sat on the couch

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:57.103
just in silence and like
my boyfriend walks in--

00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:59.105
again five minutes,
this all happened--

00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:01.207
with a plunger and
just sees my face,

00:04:01.207 --> 00:04:02.809
sees like the guilty puppy look,

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:05.011
and is like, "What did you do?"

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:06.379
And I was like (groans).

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.948
So, I am guilty of
disgusting things,

00:04:08.948 --> 00:04:11.951
but nothing, nothing
could have prepared me

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:14.354 align:start size:84% position:16%
for what happened
to me two years ago.

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:16.256 align:start size:81% position:19%
When I was getting
off the subway,

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.191
and I was walking up the steps,

00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:20.126 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I just innocently
grabbed onto the railing

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:23.196 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I felt something
wet on my hand.

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:25.665
And I looked down
and it was brown.

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:27.333
(laughter)

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:30.370
And it was clumpy brown
and I thought to myself

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.538
Oh this is just chocolate.

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.441
Someone was eating a candy bar

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:37.477
and just smeared it right?

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:39.879
That can't be what
I thought it was.

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:42.148
And I didn't wanna react, right?

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:46.252 align:start size:97% position:3%
I didn't wanna like smell
my hand right then and there

00:04:46.252 --> 00:04:48.488
and confirm or deny
what was going on.

00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:50.123 align:start size:84% position:16%
Instead, what I wanted
to do is I wanted

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.357
to get out of the subway station

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:52.625
and I wanted to
get to a bathroom

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:55.828
where I could wash my
hand and scrub my hand

00:04:55.828 --> 00:04:58.731 align:start size:84% position:16%
and cut off my
fucking hand, right?

00:04:58.731 --> 00:05:00.199
(laughter)

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:03.136
That's what I wanted to do.

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:05.872
So instead of ...
so I kinda walked

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:07.440
out of the subway station

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.411 align:start size:94% position:6%
like carrying an imaginary
tray of drinks, right?

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:12.845
Just doing this.

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:15.348
But the smell had
a mind of its own.

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:16.582 align:start size:84% position:16%
The smell was like,
"Ah naw bitch,

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:17.850
you're gonna smell me now."

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.686
(laughter)

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:21.187
It sort of, like do you
remember in cartoons

00:05:21.187 --> 00:05:24.324 align:start size:97% position:3%
when a smell would
personify into sort of like

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:26.993
smoke, like a sexy
lady smoky hand?

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:30.063
It was like (hums)

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:31.564
Shit. It was shit!

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:34.534
I mentioned I was in a
subway station, right?

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:36.369
And when it, the smell, hit me

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:39.372
I just sort of fell
like Nancy Kerrigan

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:43.009
like, "Whyyyy? Why?"

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.243
New York had just given me

00:05:44.243 --> 00:05:46.546 align:start size:84% position:16%
the most disgusting
high five in the world

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:49.382
is what had just happened.

00:05:50.316 --> 00:05:52.051
How on the railing?

00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:53.252
(sputters)

00:05:53.252 --> 00:05:54.454
How does that happen?

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:55.688 align:start size:84% position:16%
Either somebody
took off their pants

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:57.390
and slid down the
railing, right?

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.658
(laughter)

00:05:58.658 --> 00:06:00.626
Or somebody had
diarrhea and they

00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:03.329 align:start size:84% position:16%
were doing jumping
jacks on the platform.

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:04.597
I don't know which one it was,

00:06:04.597 --> 00:06:07.300
all I know is it was
on my fucking hand.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.568
I get out of the subway station

00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:10.737
and I'm kinda like
walking like this,

00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:12.238
and people are like
dodging my hand,

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:13.239
and I'm like it's not mine,

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:14.540
like I was just freaking out.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.775
(laughter)

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:19.078
And it's just there and
so I get to a bathroom

00:06:19.078 --> 00:06:21.914 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I wash my hands
like 100 times,

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:24.117 align:start size:84% position:16%
I put hand sanitizer,
I just cleaned,

00:06:24.117 --> 00:06:26.986
baptizing myself
in hand sanitizer.

00:06:26.986 --> 00:06:29.822 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm feeling slightly
better as one can

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:33.159 align:start size:84% position:16%
when they have to
amputate their fingers

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:34.594
and then I did what I always do

00:06:34.594 --> 00:06:36.195
when anything happens to you:

00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:37.930
I immediately went on Facebook

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.732
when I got home, right?

00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:41.634
And I just sort of
casually posted like

00:06:41.634 --> 00:06:45.271
oh my God, got shit on my
hand on the subway today.

00:06:45.271 --> 00:06:46.773
(laughter)

00:06:46.773 --> 00:06:49.809
Very casual, it was like an
off-hours, like four p.m.

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:51.244
You know like, I didn't think

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:53.880
anyone was going to
see it, no big deal.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.450
I gotta say, if you ever want
to get a lot of validation

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.318 align:start size:84% position:16%
and attention, write
that you got shit

00:06:59.318 --> 00:07:01.354
on your hand on the subway.

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:04.757
The love and support

00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:06.025
that I got that day

00:07:06.025 --> 00:07:08.127
from my fake internet community,

00:07:08.127 --> 00:07:11.097
It was-- it melts my
heart to this day--

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:13.666 align:start size:88% position:13%
it was like, people
were just freaking out,

00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:15.935 align:start size:97% position:3%
like guys I had hooked up
with who never texted me back

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:18.871
were like, "Are you
okay?" You know?

00:07:18.871 --> 00:07:20.373 align:start size:84% position:16%
Like all the cool
kids from high school

00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:22.608
were like, "We should've
invited you to our party."

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:25.778
People felt so bad--and
like this is the thing,

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:28.080
I didn't even think it was
a sympathy status, right?

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.882
Like I didn't think
that I was seeking--

00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:31.384
'cuz I hate sympathy statuses.

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:34.720
Side note: anyone who posts
one of those vague like,

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.724
"Hey guys, having
a really hard day.

00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:39.959 align:start size:81% position:19%
Not gonna tell you
what it is, but

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.828
thoughts and prayers
would be appreciated."

00:07:41.828 --> 00:07:43.362
It's like, fuck you okay?

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:44.597
(laughter)

00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:46.666
No, you do not get my
thoughts and prayers

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:49.635
unless I get specifics,
you pathetic asshole.

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:50.470
No, okay?

00:07:51.704 --> 00:07:52.939
I had to get shit on my hand

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:55.007
to get over 100 likes, right?

00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:58.778 align:start size:94% position:6%
I had to work really
hard for all those likes.

00:07:58.778 --> 00:08:00.713
So, I'm feeling better because

00:08:00.713 --> 00:08:02.348
people are giving me attention

00:08:02.348 --> 00:08:03.983
as that always feels good,

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:05.685
and I'm feeling better,

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:08.254
and then this one woman writes,

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:13.926
"As a mom..." and I
was like (groans).

00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:16.996
What? What, Facebook Mom?

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:19.332 align:start size:97% position:3%
What, lady who I don't even
know what you look like

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:22.268 align:start size:88% position:13%
'cuz all of your photos
are of this baby.

00:08:22.268 --> 00:08:23.669
Who am I mad at right now?

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:27.106
An adult or a baby with
a sailor hat on, okay?

00:08:27.106 --> 00:08:28.541
What do you have to say?

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:29.942
All you do is talk
about being a mom.

00:08:29.942 --> 00:08:30.977
What do you want to say?

00:08:30.977 --> 00:08:33.346
She's like, "Um, as a mom,

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:35.882
I don't really see
what the big deal is.

00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:39.318
I mean, every time
I change my baby,

00:08:39.318 --> 00:08:41.754
I get poop all over my hand."

00:08:43.856 --> 00:08:45.725
Everybody in the world agrees

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:47.460 align:start size:81% position:19%
that is not the
same thing, right?

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:51.097 align:start size:88% position:13%
We all are in
agreement, not the same.

00:08:51.097 --> 00:08:55.268
Adorable baby poop from a
baby that you made: sweet.

00:08:56.636 --> 00:08:58.638
Shit hand from stranger:

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.775
kill yourself.

00:09:02.775 --> 00:09:04.010 align:start size:84% position:16%
Throw yourself on
the tracks and kill--

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.445
not the same, like when you have

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:08.814
a baby, right, like you
give her to the baby,

00:09:08.814 --> 00:09:10.883
you go change the baby,
you go in changing a baby

00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:12.752
being like you know today I
might get poop on my hand.

00:09:12.752 --> 00:09:15.221
Like you know that is a
casualty of being parent.

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:17.890 align:start size:84% position:16%
Also, if I got
my--if I had a baby,

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.358
and I got its poop on my hand,

00:09:19.358 --> 00:09:21.394 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'd be like whatever, it's
like my poop you know?

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:24.263 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's got like my
personality, it's like awww

00:09:24.263 --> 00:09:25.698
this is just like my poop.

00:09:25.698 --> 00:09:28.401 align:start size:94% position:6%
You know, it's like
cute, not the same thing.

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:31.003
More importantly
than all of that,

00:09:31.003 --> 00:09:33.873
what is this woman
doing to her baby

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:36.442
that every time she changes it,

00:09:37.376 --> 00:09:40.613
she gets shit all over her hand?

00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:44.150
It's a baby, not
a puppet like what

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.585
(laughter)

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:48.287
are you some--call
the Facebook police.

00:09:48.287 --> 00:09:50.156
Like this woman

00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:53.259 align:start size:97% position:3%
is doing something
horribly wrong to her baby.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:55.728 align:start size:94% position:6%
Here's the thing: maybe
she had a point, you know?

00:09:55.728 --> 00:09:56.896
Maybe it's not a big deal.

00:09:56.896 --> 00:09:58.531 align:start size:84% position:16%
We've all had
accidents, you know?

00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:01.834
I shared my accident earlier

00:10:01.834 --> 00:10:04.003
except here's the thing:
when I had my accident

00:10:04.003 --> 00:10:08.240
I had the human decency
to do it in a Tupperware.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.077
You know, like a goddamn lady.

00:10:11.077 --> 00:10:12.211
(laughter)

00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:13.512
Thank you.

00:10:13.512 --> 00:10:15.781
(applause)

00:10:16.816 --> 00:10:19.418
(techno music)
