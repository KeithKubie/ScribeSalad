00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.750
With so much important stuff on your phone,
companies have gone to great lengths to make

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.750
them secure.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.500
They’ve taken steps to keep hackers from
breaking into your phone, either physically

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.690
or digitally, but what about audibly?

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.139
Researchers from the University of Michigan
and the University of South Carolina have

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.710
found it’s possible to hack your phone using
sound.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.570
The process works by tricking the phone's
accelerometer, the hardware that senses movement

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.630
and a word you’re going to hate by the end
of this episode.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.440
You know when you flip your phone sideways
and it switches to landscape mode?

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.559
That’s because of the accelerometer.

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.569
That’s twice we said it already.

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:40.379
The researchers tested 20 accelerometer models
from 5 different manufacturers by playing

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.929
certain sounds over a cheap speaker.

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:47.229
They found 65% of them could be manipulated
with a sonic attack.

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:52.589
This isn’t an entirely new concept; previous
research has demonstrated that sound waves

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:55.239
could be used to disable accelerometers entirely.

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.399
What this research shows is that accelerometers
can be finely controlled with sound too, not

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:01.870
just shut down.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.820
The vulnerability comes from a simple oversight:
manufacturers didn’t expect anybody to monkey

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.979
with the accelerometer, so the software that
interprets the input takes it as gospel.

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.340
Of course an attack like this can only affect
software that relies on the accelerometer,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.469
so it can’t be used to steal your personal
info or anything like that.

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:23.829
The scientists demonstrated that sound could
be used to drive an radio controlled car that

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.970
was controlled by a phone, or hack a fitbit
into counting steps while it was sitting still.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.430
Just be lazy but tell yourself you worked.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.579
Awright so that doesn’t sound that alarming,
but this could go beyond just phones.

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.040
Self driving cars rely on a suite of sensors
including accelerometers and so they could

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.100
be at risk.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.280
You don’t want somebody meddling with how
your car drives in any circumstance, but doubly

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.340
so when you’re not steering it.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.369
The researchers imagined other nefarious uses
for this exploit.

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.260
For example, if an insulin pump relies on
an accelerometer to automate dosage, tampering

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.840
with it could be fatal.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.600
The good news is most of these attacks can
be thwarted with software rather than hardware,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.620
and the researchers contacted the manufacturers
of the accelerometers with recommendations

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.350
on how to fix the flaws in their designs.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.080
This technique was also only tested on one
of the major types of accelerometers, called

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.690
a capacitance accelerometer, which works by
moving small masses around.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.190
The most common technology relies on piezoelectric
accelerometers instead, where microscopic

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.260
crystals become stressed by acceleration and
create a voltage that is interpreted by a

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.260
chip.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.770
The researchers say sound waves could move
the small masses inside a capacitance accelerometer,

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.540
but it's unclear if the same trick would work
on these crystals.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.630
Hacking phones with sound actually has a long
and illustrious history.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.610
Starting in the 1950s people who called themselves
phreakers with (a “PH”) figured out how

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.430
to game the telephone system to make free
calls using nothing but sound.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.570
Telephone systems used precise frequencies
to route calls, it’s why your phone’s

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.730
buttons make specific tones when you press
them.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.990
So by playing the right frequencies into the
receiver, phreakers could connect to whomever

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.120
they liked.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.670
These people were like proto-hackers, with
anonymous personas and everything.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.900
Two phreakers who would later become famous
were a couple teenagers named Steve Wozniak

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.900
and Steve Jobs.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.330
Long before Apple, the two experimented with
creating digital circuits that could create

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.430
tones to hack phones.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.730
One of their first business ventures was selling
homemade phreaking boxes, which actually caught

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.680
the attention of the FBI, though they never
caught the Steves.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.840
It’s a bit ironic that 40 years after Steve
Jobs toyed around with phreaking, people might

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.540
be figuring out how to use sound to hack the
phones he helped create.

Ok I know I said accelerometer a lot, but
I couldn’t help it, there is literally no

synonym for accelerometer.
