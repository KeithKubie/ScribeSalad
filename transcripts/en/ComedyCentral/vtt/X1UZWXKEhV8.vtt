00:00:00.701 --> 00:00:03.403
BUT I WANT TO TALK AGAIN
ABOUT OBVIOUSLY THE TRAGEDY THAT

00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:07.374
HAPPENED.

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:08.976
THIS WEEK, THE EMERGENCE OF
DYLANN ROOF'S WHITE POWER

00:00:08.976 --> 00:00:11.578
MANIFESTO AND HATE-STAGRAM
PHOTOS DID LITTLE TO ALLEVIATE 

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:12.679
ANY CONFUSION ABOUT WHY HE DID
IT.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.650
ABOUT WHY THIS WHITE
RACIST'S RACIST RACE EVASIONS

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.386
FOR ASSASINATING NINE
CHURCHGOERS WHILE RACISTING

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:20.621
RACE-ORIC.

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:25.759
I GUESS WE'LL JUST NEVER
KNOW WHY HE DID IT.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.995
NOW YOU MAY THINK A TRAGEDY
SUCH AS THIS WOULD BE AN

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:31.632
OPPORTUNE TIME TO DISCUSS
THE COMPLEX VARIETY OF DEEP

00:00:31.632 --> 00:00:37.170
SEEDED, UNEXAMINED ISSUES AND
FAILING THAT PERMEATE AMERICAN

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.972
CULTURE LIKE A SUBTERRANEAN
FAULT LINE THAT MOST ONLY NOTICE

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:43.043
UPON SEISMIC ERUPTIONS, ABOVE A
SIX OR SEVEN ON THE RICHTER

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:44.077
SCALE.

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:47.247
IT TURNS OUT, THIS IS NOT A GOOD
TIME.

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:48.982
&gt;&gt; THE RACE TO POLITICIZE
THE SENSELESS SOUTH CAROLINA

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:50.417
CHURCH SHOOTING TRAGEDY.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:51.752
&gt;&gt; SO THEY COULDN'T WAIT?

00:00:51.752 --> 00:00:53.754
&gt;&gt; YOU COULD HAVE WAITED FOR
SOME OF THIS.

00:00:53.754 --> 00:00:55.155
WE HAVEN'T EVEN BURIED OUR
DEAD YET.

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:56.256
&gt;&gt; BEFORE THE BODIES HAVE EVEN
BEEN BURIED.

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:57.724
&gt;&gt; THEY TRY AND BLAME GUNS
AND DO EVERYTHING BUT IT IS

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.126
MISDIRECTED.

00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:00.694
&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT, HE IS BLAMING
GUNS, LIBERALS POLITICIZEING

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:02.195
THIS.

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:05.065
&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT GENERALLY
DEALS WITH THIS WHOLE ISSUE

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.734
POLITICALLY  RATHER THAN
SUBSTANTIVELY.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.770
&gt;&gt; THE BODIES AREN'T COLD
AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE TRYING

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.972
TO SCORE POLITICAL POINTS OF IT,
AND IT'S FANKLY DISGUSTING.

00:01:11.972 --> 00:01:16.209
&gt;&gt; IT'S ALMOST LIKE A
SICKNESS LIKE, OH, WAIT. TRAGEDY

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:17.210
HAPPENS.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.746
LET'S SEE HOW WE CAN ADVANCE OUR
NARRATIVE.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:26.853
&gt;&gt; Jon: YES, IT'S A SICKNESS,
THIS RUSH TO USE TRAGEDY TO

00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:32.292
ADVANCE YOUR NARRATIVE.

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:36.430
COMBINE THAT WITH AN INABLILTY
FOR SELF-EXAMINATION, AND

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.299
ALMOST COMICAL DEGREE OF
SELF-EXCULPABLE RHETORIC,

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.904
FLAG PINS, A LITTLE BIT OF
LEG AND A COMPLETE IMMUNITY
39
00:01:43,904 --&gt; 00:00:00,000
TO IRONY, YOU GOT YOURSELF A
FULL BLOWN CASE OF FOXABETES.
