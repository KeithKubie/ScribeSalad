[ PANTING ]

00:00:03.534 --> 00:00:05.767
Narrator:
YEAH, MIKE AND ADAM HAVE
OBVIOUSLY BEEN WORKING TO HARD.

00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:08.834
BUT WHY IS DOSH PANTING
LIKE A STEAM TRAIN?

00:00:08.834 --> 00:00:12.667
WHEN MAMMALS GET TOO HOT,
THEIR MAIN WAY OF COOLING OFF

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:15.667
IS THROUGH A PROCESS CALLED
EVAPORATIVE COOLING.

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:17.300
AND THIS IS
ESSENTIALLY THE PROCESS

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.400
THAT TURNS WATER
FROM A LIQUID TO A VAPOR,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.968
ABSORBING ENERGY WITH IT
AS IT DOES IT.

00:00:22.968 --> 00:00:26.434
IN HUMANS, EVAPORATIVE COOLING
TAKES PLACE ON OUR SKIN,

00:00:26.434 --> 00:00:28.601
WHERE SWEAT GLANDS PRODUCE SWEAT

00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:31.501
WHICH THEN EVAPORATES
TO COOL US DOWN.

00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:33.801
BECAUSE HUMANS CAN SWEAT,
THIS EVAPORATIVE COOLING

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:35.801
TAKES PLACE
ALL OVER OUR BODIES.

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:37.701
BUT WITH DOGS,
IT ONLY TAKES PLACE

00:00:37.701 --> 00:00:39.200
IN A COUPLE TINY SPOTS

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.968
ON THEIR PAWS WHERE
THEY HAVE SWEAT GLANDS.

00:00:40.968 --> 00:00:44.133
SO THEY HAVE TO FIND
OTHER MOIST SURFACES

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.634
TO EVAPORATE WATER FROM,

00:00:45.634 --> 00:00:47.601
WHICH WOULD BE THEIR MOUTH,

00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:49.834
THEIR TONGUE,
AND THEIR NASAL PASSAGES.

00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:52.367
THOSE LOCATIONS HAVE
A LOT OF BLOOD VESSELS.

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:53.667
SO WHAT HE'S COOLING DOWN

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:55.434
IS THE BLOOD INSIDE
THOSE VESSELS

00:00:55.434 --> 00:00:57.167
WHICH CIRCULATES
THROUGHOUT HIS WHOLE BODY,

00:00:57.167 --> 00:00:59.234
THUS COOLING HIM OFF.

00:00:59.234 --> 00:01:00.801
Narrator:
WHEN IT COMES TO CHILLING OUT,

00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:03.634
DOSH HAS IT LICKED, NO SWEAT.
