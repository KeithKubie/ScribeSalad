is that the earliest domestic animal the

dog is not commonly sacrificed it is
 

00:31:25.929 --> 00:31:29.250
dog is not commonly sacrificed it is
from time to time sacrificed so the

occasional mentions of dog sacrifice but
for example in the Hittite exam the

for example in the Hittite exam the
 

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:44.700

constitutes qualification for sacrifice
 

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:50.790
constitutes qualification for sacrifice
and you say well it's at a certain

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800
and you say well it's at a certain
 

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.940
and you say well it's at a certain
period of development in the society

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:53.950
period of development in the society
 

00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:57.040

that the animal sacrifice comes into

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:57.050
that the animal sacrifice comes into
 

00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:59.410
that the animal sacrifice comes into
being and if you have an animal that

00:34:59.410 --> 00:34:59.420
being and if you have an animal that
 

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:03.430
being and if you have an animal that
enters into some sort of domestic

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440
enters into some sort of domestic
 

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.500
enters into some sort of domestic
situation and becomes useful in the

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:05.510
situation and becomes useful in the
 

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:10.480
situation and becomes useful in the
society before that after that period it

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:10.490
society before that after that period it
 

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:14.370

doesn't get on the on the sacrifice list

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:14.380
doesn't get on the on the sacrifice list
 

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:17.140
doesn't get on the on the sacrifice list
so wild animals aren't on the sacrifice

00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:17.150
so wild animals aren't on the sacrifice
 

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:20.560
so wild animals aren't on the sacrifice
list and late domesticus are not on a

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:20.570
list and late domesticus are not on a
 

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:23.260
list and late domesticus are not on a
sacrifice list so again you have a

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:23.270
sacrifice list so again you have a
 

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:25.410
sacrifice list so again you have a
suggestion a suggestion that you have a

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:25.420
suggestion a suggestion that you have a
 

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:30.010
suggestion a suggestion that you have a
an evolutionary thing in which societies

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:30.020
an evolutionary thing in which societies
 

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:36.210
an evolutionary thing in which societies
go through stages of complexity or

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:36.220
go through stages of complexity or
 

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:40.600
go through stages of complexity or
conceptualization of matters spiritual

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:40.610
conceptualization of matters spiritual
 

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:44.830
conceptualization of matters spiritual
that make it you know first no sacrifice

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:44.840
that make it you know first no sacrifice
 

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:48.480
that make it you know first no sacrifice
then sacrificing humans then sacrificing

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:48.490
then sacrificing humans then sacrificing
 

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:52.060
then sacrificing humans then sacrificing
domestic animals and then no longer

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:52.070
domestic animals and then no longer
 

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:54.490
domestic animals and then no longer
sacrifice candles but whether using

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:54.500
sacrifice candles but whether using
 

00:35:54.500 --> 00:36:06.620
sacrifice candles but whether using
symbolic sacrifice yeah

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:06.630
 
 

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:13.620
 
yes that's right no maybe they probably

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:13.630
yes that's right no maybe they probably
 

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:15.900
yes that's right no maybe they probably
sacrifice children before they sacrifice

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:15.910
sacrifice children before they sacrifice
 

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:20.160
sacrifice children before they sacrifice
llamas right so so you probably have a

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:20.170
llamas right so so you probably have a
 

00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:22.590
llamas right so so you probably have a
phasing out business

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:22.600
phasing out business
 

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:25.859
phasing out business
I mean we've actually excavated the

00:36:25.859 --> 00:36:25.869
I mean we've actually excavated the
 

00:36:25.869 --> 00:36:29.310
I mean we've actually excavated the
mummies of sacrificed children but in

goes back to the Iliad again where you

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:08.970
goes back to the Iliad again where you
 

00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:11.510
goes back to the Iliad again where you
have the funeral games that are held in

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520
have the funeral games that are held in
 

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:14.810
have the funeral games that are held in
honor of Petro closed and you have

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:14.820
honor of Petro closed and you have
 

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:21.440
honor of Petro closed and you have
wrestling and other you know man demand

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:21.450
wrestling and other you know man demand
 

00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:26.270
wrestling and other you know man demand
things but they're the primary game is

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.280
things but they're the primary game is
 

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:30.100
things but they're the primary game is
the chariot race and so chariot racing

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:30.110
the chariot race and so chariot racing
 

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:32.660
the chariot race and so chariot racing
you know the gladiatorial games which

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:32.670
you know the gladiatorial games which
 

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:41.930
you know the gladiatorial games which
are lethal and they're makan bat of man

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:41.940
are lethal and they're makan bat of man
 

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:44.460
are lethal and they're makan bat of man
against man but also man against animal

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:44.470
against man but also man against animal
 

00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:48.410
against man but also man against animal
and this I think is a very early notion

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:48.420
and this I think is a very early notion
 

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:50.940
and this I think is a very early notion
but then you have the chariot race that

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:50.950
but then you have the chariot race that
 

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:53.520
but then you have the chariot race that
initially is funeral and becomes the

that becomes transformed into a public

that becomes transformed into a public
 

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:16.530
that becomes transformed into a public
entertainment and that is the segue to

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:16.540

human sacrifice and animal sacrifice are

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:31.390
human sacrifice and animal sacrifice are
 

00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:34.980
human sacrifice and animal sacrifice are
a common denominator if so I think

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:34.990
a common denominator if so I think
 

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:38.040
a common denominator if so I think
they're a denominator that reflect a

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:38.050
they're a denominator that reflect a
 

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:42.089
they're a denominator that reflect a

certain stage of societal development
 

00:44:42.099 --> 00:44:46.800
certain stage of societal development
and that that stage normally disappears

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:46.810
and that that stage normally disappears
 

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:51.170

interesting question is something that I
mentioned last time and that is the

mentioned last time and that is the

01:03:41.019 --> 01:03:44.230
 
it's very difficult to speak about the

it's very difficult to speak about the

narrative that that was the question so
 

01:04:26.359 --> 01:04:32.620
narrative that that was the question so
we end up with a with a narrative that

the Andes in modern times the argument

01:04:58.310 --> 01:04:58.320
the Andes in modern times the argument
 

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:01.640
the Andes in modern times the argument
can be made that well these were just

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:01.650
can be made that well these were just
 

01:05:01.650 --> 01:05:05.060
can be made that well these were just
not very numerous populations and that

01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:05.070
not very numerous populations and that
 

01:05:05.070 --> 01:05:07.849
not very numerous populations and that
therefore maybe just on the on the basis

of population size it's warranted not to

of population size it's warranted not to
talk about them much but that of course

01:05:13.849 --> 01:05:13.859
talk about them much but that of course
 

01:05:13.859 --> 01:05:18.530
