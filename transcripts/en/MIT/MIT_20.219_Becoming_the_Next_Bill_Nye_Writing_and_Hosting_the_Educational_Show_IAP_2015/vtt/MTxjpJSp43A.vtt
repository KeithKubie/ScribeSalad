00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.290
JOSHUA GUNN: One
thing I thought was

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.120
effective was the way
that Chris, I think,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.080
on the first day I attended and

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.210
watched, you kind
of laid out a sort

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.910
of more theoretical framework
you know about storytelling

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.610
and that sort of thing.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.710
And I think that was
nice because, for me, I

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.760
think it's effective.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.034
I'm just one kind of
learner, but sort of

00:00:28.034 --> 00:00:32.479
have a sort of theory laid out
first, and then practice later.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:36.060
I got the big idea
of the why and then

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.400
it felt to me like the course
dove into some of the details

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.940
of how.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.420
So it was was like a theory
practice kind of structure,

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.530
which would have been
quite useful to me

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.279
had I taken the whole course.

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:52.320
CHRIS BOEBEL: One of the
big challenges, I think,

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.090
with any kind of media
course or film, video, is it

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.980
that the technical stuff is
so overwhelming, potentially,

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.876
for people who are new.

00:01:03.876 --> 00:01:05.250
There's such a
big learning curve

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.720
that you can get lost in
those details really fast.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.230
And you go, oh my God,
I'll never learn Final Cut

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.230
and why does everything
I shoot suck?

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.830
Oh, this is terrible,
I'm a failure.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.890
And if you kind of go,
well, those aren't really

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.350
the learning objectives, which
you very clearly articulated,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.230
then it's kind of
a bigger un-clench.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.700
It's like, OK, what I'm
really learning here is to be

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.200
a communicator, be a
storyteller, carry myself,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.180
understand this medium,
and maybe someday I'll be

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.930
a terrific editor,
or maybe I won't.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.825
But either waw--

00:01:37.825 --> 00:01:39.285
JOSHUA GUNN: Maybe you'll
plug into the processes

00:01:39.285 --> 00:01:39.910
in some other way.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:40.670
CHRIS BOEBEL: In some other way.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.810
Exactly, yeah.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.995
But you have to understand
the whole process.

00:01:43.995 --> 00:01:45.620
ELIZABETH CHOE: I
remember when I first

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.480
proposed like-- because
you were like, what

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.500
do you want me to do?

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.660
Because I was just like, can
you be involved in this somehow?

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.410
And it was sort of
like, well, maybe

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.050
you could cover
the actual basics

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.500
of shooting and everything.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.990
You said something like, they
seem like a technical things.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.160
And I was like, oh
shoot, this is terrible.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.820
I'm doing the thing that
I tell people not to do.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.479
So we made a very
conscious decision

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.669
to take all this
technical elements.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:15.790
We did not teach how to edit
on Final Cut or anything.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.090
Instead, MIT has free
Window licensing.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.100
And honestly, their videos
teach it better than I do.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.320
I don't know Final Cut
well enough to teach it.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.240
And not all the
students used it,

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.620
so we said, for all the
technical learning stuff,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.321
it was all on digital
blended learning.

00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:37.945
Flip Classroom.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.620
Thank you.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.260
And class time was really about
teaching big picture stuff,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.910
and then work shopping specific
examples, and specific things

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.479
they came up with.

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:54.020
CHRIS BOEBEL: Because
time is limited

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.330
and it's so daunting
to become a director,

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.260
on camera host, writer,
editor, camera person, all

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.940
in a few weeks.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:03.980
And it's just not
going to happen.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.355
JOSHUA GUNN: Just
the expectation

00:03:05.355 --> 00:03:07.440
that they come out with
the notion of storytelling

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.884
would be sufficient.

00:03:08.884 --> 00:03:10.300
ELIZABETH CHOE:
It really ended up

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.010
being a class on pre-production.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.520
It was like two weeks of
intense scripting and planning

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.520
and the rest just
sort of happened

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.530
in the last couple days.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.030
The just had to figure
out how to film.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.630
JOSHUA GUNN: That's great, I
mean the technical execution

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:32.230
gets pushed to the margin,
and the more creative stuff

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.650
takes precedence.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.740
ELIZABETH CHOE: I mean
it's a different class.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.347
There were a couple
people who dropped

00:03:38.347 --> 00:03:40.680
because they came in thinking,
like, this is going to be

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.740
a class on how to make a video.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.650
And it's not exactly about that.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.380
Because there are
other classes like that

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.046
that already exist
on campus, so there's

00:03:50.046 --> 00:03:52.324
no reason for us to redo that.

00:03:52.324 --> 00:03:53.740
GEORGE ZAIDAN: And
you learn stuff

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.740
by like shooting your own
stuff and screwing up.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.210
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.700
JOSHUA GUNN: Yeah, exactly.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.580
ELIZABETH CHOE: But
if someone's going

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.250
to watch this class on
OpenCourseWare, for instance,

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.800
they're not necessarily going
to pick up the practical skills

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.470
that they might be expecting to.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.420
GEORGE ZAIDAN: We don't teach
you how to light, sorry.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.120
ELIZABETH CHOE:
But like a teacher

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.170
who might be watching this
might be like, how do I

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.820
teach a video production class?

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.240
And I'm not sure this is
necessarily exactly that.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.860
Sorry.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.270
CHRIS BOEBEL: Oops.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.390
But it is hopefully maybe
a conceptual framework

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.247
that you could then plug-in
production modules into.

00:04:36.247 --> 00:04:37.580
JOSHUA GUNN: Or a larger course.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.630
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah,
it was so short.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.870
It felt like a sprint.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.286
JOSHUA GUNN: Yeah
what can you do?

00:04:41.286 --> 00:04:43.250
What can you accomplish
in that time?

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.780
I was impressed by
how ambitious it was.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.990
CHRIS BOEBEL: It was very
ambitious, I thought.
