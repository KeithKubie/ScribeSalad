constantly so food timing is very

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090
constantly so food timing is very
 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.039
constantly so food timing is very
important and not only that but how much

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049
important and not only that but how much
 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.559
important and not only that but how much
we eat is very important so when we

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569
we eat is very important so when we
 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.089
we eat is very important so when we
consume food we've got to break it down

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099
consume food we've got to break it down
 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.720
consume food we've got to break it down
right we oxidize the food which creates

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730
right we oxidize the food which creates
 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.720
right we oxidize the food which creates
oxidative stress so okay

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730
oxidative stress so okay
 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.210
oxidative stress so okay
the less food we eat within a reason

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220
the less food we eat within a reason

we're not trying to starve ourselves but

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260
we're not trying to starve ourselves but
 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.080
we're not trying to starve ourselves but
we also don't want to eat too much food

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090
we also don't want to eat too much food
 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.119
we also don't want to eat too much food
and we put this in a place of what I

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129
and we put this in a place of what I
 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.580
and we put this in a place of what I
call calorie restriction so calorie

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590
call calorie restriction so calorie
 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.009
call calorie restriction so calorie
surplus you're at a healthy weight and

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019
surplus you're at a healthy weight and
 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.930
surplus you're at a healthy weight and
you're eating more than you burn in a

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940
you're eating more than you burn in a
 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.849
you're eating more than you burn in a
day that's too much food we need to

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859
day that's too much food we need to
 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.460
day that's too much food we need to
restrict that and match calories in with

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470
restrict that and match calories in with
 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.020
restrict that and match calories in with
calories out so it's the simple law of

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030
calories out so it's the simple law of
 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.629

but what's most responsible for that
 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.890
but what's most responsible for that
expression is your epigenome so your

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900
expression is your epigenome so your
 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:56.970
expression is your epigenome so your
epigenome is kind of like that

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980

information what's telling this cell to
 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.640
information what's telling this cell to
become a bone cell or that cell to

become a bone cell or that cell to
 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.470
become a bone cell or that cell to
become an immunity cell and so on well

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:07.480
become an immunity cell and so on well
 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.680
become an immunity cell and so on well
that's your epigenome and what's choking

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690
that's your epigenome and what's choking
 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.750
that's your epigenome and what's choking
off certain parts of your DNA and

express this component choke off that
 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.900
express this component choke off that
component and we can make this work for

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910
component and we can make this work for
 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.510

are showing us that our epigenome is

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160
are showing us that our epigenome is
 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.150
are showing us that our epigenome is
actually affecting what we're passing

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160
actually affecting what we're passing
 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.570
actually affecting what we're passing
off to our offspring so there was a

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580
off to our offspring so there was a
 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.720
off to our offspring so there was a
study on Holocaust survivors and it was

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:33.730
study on Holocaust survivors and it was
 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.700
study on Holocaust survivors and it was
found that their offspring their

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710
found that their offspring their
 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.840
found that their offspring their
children have a better resistance or

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850
children have a better resistance or
 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.580
children have a better resistance or
more resilience to emotional stress

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.590
more resilience to emotional stress
 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.070
more resilience to emotional stress
so again this can be a super wonderful
