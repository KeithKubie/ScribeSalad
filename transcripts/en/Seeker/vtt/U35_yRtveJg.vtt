This episode of DNews is brought to you by
the all-new G Flex 2, from LG.

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:04.959
Life’s Good

00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:07.610
You know what’s almost as annoying as losing
your keys?

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.080
Forgetting your passwords...

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.660
Hey guys, Amy on the Internet with DNews today,
and I’m not the only one online.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.140
We live a lot of our lives online, which means
we end up having a lot of accounts requiring

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.000
passwords, anything from email and online
banking to that one time you had to create

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.550
an account just to buy an amazing pair of
shoes.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.620
So it’s maybe unsurprising that we tend
to get a little lazy with our passwords, even

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.230
though every password-protected account holds
personal data we wouldn’t want made public.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.590
Every year passwords are leaked, and SplashData
pulled together the 25 most common passwords

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.000
of 2014, out of 3.3 million that were leaked,
and it shows just how lazy we are.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.020
A lot of people pick things they type quickly
and easily based on the arrangement of the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.020
key board.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.350
Numbers in sequential order are common, as
are letters in the order they appear on the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.350
keyboard.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.080
“qwerty” it turns out, it a pretty common
password.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.719
Obvious combinations like “abc123” or
“111111” are also common, and so are words

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.990
like “superman,” “batman,” “football,”
and “dragon.”

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.289
But what if a password wasn't your only way
into your online accounts?

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:13.020
What if the way you type your password was
part of the password?

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.380
A team of scientists led by Jun Chen of the
Georgia Institute of Technology say they’ve

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.609
developed a self-cleaning, self-powered smart
keyboard that can identify computer users

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:25.299
by the way they type, which could help prevent
unauthorized users from accessing your accounts.

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.060
Their research was published in the journal
ACS Nano and funded by the U.S. Department

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.060
of Energy.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.859
The team’s smart keyboard was designed to
sense typing patterns, including typing speed

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:35.349
and strength of keystroke.

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:39.140
These physical characteristics vary from person
to person, meaning the smart keyboard can

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.820
distinguish between users.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.670
Someone could know your password, but if they
try to type it on a smart keyboard it wouldn’t

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.670
work.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.180
Sensing the specific keystrokes of its owner,
it would lock the attempted intruder out,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.310
alerting you to the attempted breach while
also recording and identifying the intruder.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.789
And this keyboard even has some bonus smart
features.

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.880
It can harness the energy generated from typing,
converting the mechanical stimuli applied

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.849
to the keyboard into electronic signals that
can power either the keyboard itself or another

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:04.169
small device.

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:07.240
Another bonus: its surface coating actually
repels first and grime!

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.370
But it’s possible that passwords, even those
typed on a smart keyboard, will soon become

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.370
a thing of the past.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.540
At CES this year in Las Vegas, Biometric IT
devices were touted as the hottest new thing

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.120
in online security.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.440
Some cell phones already unlock with fingerprint
recognition instead of a password, a technology

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.099
some companies are incorporating into biometric
digital wallets from companies like HyprKey.

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.959
So while this smart keyboard is still just
a prototype with no clear timeline for commercial

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.690
availability, it’s still a pretty amazing
entry in the growing field of biometric security.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.400
So what do you guys think about smart keyboards?

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.400
Cool or creepy?

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.099
