I'm B.F. Skinner, and Hippocrates and Mendel have done some nice work, but

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:05.900
are missing how important the environment can

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.680
be in shaping traits, particularly behavioral ones.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.630
&gt;&gt; So are you referring to that classic phrase, nature versus nurture?

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah, somewhat. When I was at Harvard in grad school

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.160
in the early 1930s I came up with this whole experiment that

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.010
tested the influence in the environment through conditioning. For example, I can

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.910
put a rat in this chamber, and then flash the green light.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.520
If the rat pushes the lever, it gets food. But if

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.010
the rat pushes the lever whenever the red light is up,

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.610
it gets a mild electric shock instead. Over time, the rat

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.930
learns only to push the lever when the green light is on.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.394
&gt;&gt; So you're talking about behavioral traits, where

00:00:39.394 --> 00:00:41.888
reward and punishment play a significant role. And

00:00:41.888 --> 00:00:43.391
this is any type of trait, right? Like

00:00:43.391 --> 00:00:46.055
aggression or even behaviors. Like, interacting with other people.

00:00:46.055 --> 00:00:48.953
&gt;&gt; That's right. Understanding the stimuli is really important

00:00:48.953 --> 00:00:51.373
if we're going to understand the complex traits and

00:00:51.373 --> 00:00:53.697
the hereditary and environmental components.

00:00:53.697 --> 00:00:55.263
&gt;&gt; If you're interested in learning

00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:57.639
