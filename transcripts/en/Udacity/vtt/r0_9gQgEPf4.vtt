00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.364
Let's go through the same sort of thought
process that we did for the previous quiz.

00:00:05.474 --> 00:00:10.826
Since the entire whole number circle is
inside of the integer circle, we know that

00:00:10.838 --> 00:00:16.068
all whole numbers are integers. By the
same token, some, but not all integers are

00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:21.500
whole numbers. We also then know that not
all integers are whole numbers, so this

00:00:21.512 --> 00:00:26.925
answer can't be right. In this same way,
not all integers are natural numbers since

00:00:26.937 --> 00:00:32.150
the natural numbers circle is inside the
whole number circle. This also means

00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:37.350
though, that all natural numbers are
integers. I hope this is helped you to see

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:42.750
a bit more clearly how these different
sets of numbers are related to one another

00:00:42.762 --> 00:00:44.925
and fit together in this diagram.
