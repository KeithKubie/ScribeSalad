00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.420
All newborns have this so called Guthrie test.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.509
Now I've got an example to show you here.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.800
Which we're grateful for the Great Ormond
Street people for giving us.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.180
You see, you take just a heel prick,

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.580
a little blood from the newborn baby.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.360
And you put it on a bit of blotting paper
like this.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.039
And you can have the patient's name and all
the information there.

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.580
And when the blotting paper is dry, it can
just be sent through the post.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.050
Because what you're testing for in this blood,

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.830
is the level of that aminoacid that can't
be metabolised.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.039
And that survives the post perfectly well.

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:36.960
So what you do is, when it goes to the testing
laboratory,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.010
you punch out a little bit of that paper that
has the blood sample in it.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.069
And then what you do, is you put that bit
of paper

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:47.549
onto bacteria on a plate.

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:50.899
And I've got a sample plate here.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.989
And the bacteria are treated in such a way

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.940
that they'll only grow if they're given phenylalanine.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.010
So they'll only grow around the bit of paper

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.829
that has phenylalanine in it.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.239
Now these are test spots here.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.780
And you can see that halo of growth of the
bacteria there.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.829
Those are the test ones.

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:14.600
And can you see one positive result on that
plate?

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.689
You see that one?

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:18.000
That one there?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.090
See it there?

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.020
That's a positive result.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.119
The amino acid from that little bit of filter
paper

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.219
has spread around and allowed the bacteria
to grow.

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:33.590
It's a very simple straightforward test that's
done on everybody now.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.360
It's been done since the 1960s.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.249
So all newborns can be screened to see

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:42.930
whether they've got that disease.
