00:00:00.338 --> 00:00:02.515
- [Instructor] In other
videos we introduce ourselves

00:00:02.515 --> 00:00:04.659
to the idea of a density curve,

00:00:04.659 --> 00:00:06.547
which is a summary of a distribution,

00:00:06.547 --> 00:00:08.601
a distribution of data, and in the future

00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:11.428
we'll also look at things
like probability density.

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:13.881
But what I want to talk
about in this video is

00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:16.169
think about what we can glean from them,

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:19.532
the properties, how we can
describe density curves

00:00:19.532 --> 00:00:22.964
and the distributions they represent.

00:00:22.964 --> 00:00:25.051
And we have four of them right over here,

00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:27.113
and the first thing I
want to think about is

00:00:27.113 --> 00:00:30.883
if we can approximate what value would be

00:00:30.883 --> 00:00:33.666
the middle value or the
median for the data set

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.499
described by these density curves.

00:00:37.477 --> 00:00:41.306
So just to remind ourselves,
if we have a set of numbers

00:00:41.306 --> 00:00:43.723
and we order them from least to greatest,

00:00:43.723 --> 00:00:46.146
the median would be the middle value,

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:49.602
or the midway between
the middle two values.

00:00:49.602 --> 00:00:52.203
In a case like this, we
want to find the value

00:00:52.203 --> 00:00:55.898
for which half of the
values are above that value

00:00:55.898 --> 00:00:57.708
and half of the values are below.

00:00:57.708 --> 00:00:59.436
So in looking at a density curve,

00:00:59.436 --> 00:01:01.380
you'd want to look at the area,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.699
and you'd want to say, OK, at what value

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.243
do we have equal area
above and below that value?

00:01:08.243 --> 00:01:10.618
And so for this one, just eyeballing it,

00:01:10.618 --> 00:01:14.535
this value right over
here would be the median.

00:01:15.794 --> 00:01:17.836
And in general, if you have a symmetric

00:01:17.836 --> 00:01:20.810
distribution like this, the median will be

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.434
right along that line of symmetry.

00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:27.243
Here we have a slightly
more unusual distribution,

00:01:27.243 --> 00:01:29.729
this would be called
a bimodal distribution

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.672
where you have two major lumps right

00:01:31.672 --> 00:01:33.891
over here, but it is symmetric.

00:01:33.891 --> 00:01:38.435
And that point of symmetry
is right over here,

00:01:38.435 --> 00:01:42.483
and so this value, once
again, would be the median.

00:01:42.483 --> 00:01:43.714
Another way to think about it is,

00:01:43.714 --> 00:01:47.121
the area to the left of that value

00:01:47.121 --> 00:01:48.754
is equal to the area to the right

00:01:48.754 --> 00:01:52.225
of that value, making it the median.

00:01:52.225 --> 00:01:55.458
But what if we're dealing with
non-symmetric distributions?

00:01:55.458 --> 00:01:57.449
Well we'd want to do the same principle.

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:59.714
We would want to think,
at what value is the area

00:01:59.714 --> 00:02:03.201
on the right and the
area on the left equal?

00:02:03.201 --> 00:02:05.279
And once again this isn't
going to be super exact,

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:07.746
but I'm going to try to approximate it.

00:02:07.746 --> 00:02:09.130
You might be tempted
to go right at the top

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.811
of this lump right over here,
but if I were to do that

00:02:11.811 --> 00:02:14.026
it's pretty clear, even eyeballing it,

00:02:14.026 --> 00:02:16.435
that the right area right over here

00:02:16.435 --> 00:02:18.570
is larger than the left area.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.682
So that would not be the median.

00:02:21.682 --> 00:02:24.611
If I move the median a
little bit over to the right,

00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:28.778
this maybe right around here,
this looks a lot closer.

00:02:30.321 --> 00:02:32.115
Once again, I'm approximating it,

00:02:32.115 --> 00:02:34.626
but it's reasonable to
say that the area here

00:02:34.626 --> 00:02:38.137
looks pretty close to the
area right over there.

00:02:38.137 --> 00:02:39.401
And if that is the case,

00:02:39.401 --> 00:02:42.401
then this is going to be the median.

00:02:44.562 --> 00:02:46.649
Similarly, on this one right over here,

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:49.732
maybe right over here, and once again

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:56.492
I'm just approximating it,
but that seems reasonable,

00:02:56.492 --> 00:02:57.919
that this area is equal to that one,

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:00.069
even though this is
longer it's much lower,

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.698
this part of the curve is much higher

00:03:01.698 --> 00:03:05.018
even though it goes on less to the right.

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:07.371
So that's the median for well behaved

00:03:07.371 --> 00:03:09.986
continuous distributions like this,

00:03:09.986 --> 00:03:12.509
it's going to be the value
for which the area to the left

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:15.433
and the area to the right are equal.

00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:17.765
But what about the mean?

00:03:17.765 --> 00:03:21.356
Well the mean is, you take
each of the possible values

00:03:21.356 --> 00:03:25.102
and you weight it by their frequencies,

00:03:25.102 --> 00:03:26.372
you weight it by their frequencies

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:28.862
and you add all of that up.

00:03:28.862 --> 00:03:32.617
And so for symmetric distributions
your mean and your median

00:03:32.617 --> 00:03:35.418
are actually going to be the same.

00:03:35.418 --> 00:03:37.441
So this is going to be your mean as well,

00:03:37.441 --> 00:03:40.034
this is going to be your mean as well.

00:03:40.034 --> 00:03:42.052
If you want to think about
it in terms of physics,

00:03:42.052 --> 00:03:44.115
the mean would be your balancing point,

00:03:44.115 --> 00:03:45.650
the point at which you would want to put

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.067
a little fulcrum and you would

00:03:47.067 --> 00:03:49.159
want to balance the distribution.

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:50.503
And so you could put a little fulcrum here

00:03:50.503 --> 00:03:51.866
and you could imagine that this thing

00:03:51.866 --> 00:03:55.882
would balance, this thing would balance.

00:03:55.882 --> 00:03:57.682
And that all comes out of this idea of the

00:03:57.682 --> 00:04:02.507
weighted average of all
of these possible values.

00:04:02.507 --> 00:04:05.602
What about for these less
symmetric distributions?

00:04:05.602 --> 00:04:07.732
Well let's think about it over here.

00:04:07.732 --> 00:04:09.372
Where would I have to put
the fulcrum, or what does

00:04:09.372 --> 00:04:13.529
our intuition say if we
wanted to balance this?

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:16.834
Well, we have equal areas on either side,

00:04:16.834 --> 00:04:19.201
but when you have this long tail

00:04:19.201 --> 00:04:22.258
to the right it's going to pull the mean

00:04:22.258 --> 00:04:25.373
to the right of the median in this case.

00:04:25.373 --> 00:04:27.874
And so our balance point is probably

00:04:27.874 --> 00:04:30.434
going to be something closer to that.

00:04:30.434 --> 00:04:32.675
And once again, this
is me approximating it,

00:04:32.675 --> 00:04:35.592
but this would roughly be our mean.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.794
It would sit, in this case,
to the right of our median.

00:04:39.794 --> 00:04:42.410
Let me make it clear, this
median is referring to that,

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.691
the mean is referring to this.

00:04:44.691 --> 00:04:47.099
In this case, because
I have this long tail

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.155
to the left, it's likely
that I would have to

00:04:49.155 --> 00:04:52.244
balance it out right over here.

00:04:52.244 --> 00:04:56.411
So the mean would be this
value, right over there.

00:04:57.785 --> 00:04:59.418
And there's actually a term for these

00:04:59.418 --> 00:05:02.549
non-symmetric distributions where

00:05:02.549 --> 00:05:05.891
the mean is varying from the median.

00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:10.058
Distributions like this are
referred to as being skewed.

00:05:13.038 --> 00:05:15.753
And this distribution,
where you have the mean

00:05:15.753 --> 00:05:17.994
to the right of the median, where you have

00:05:17.994 --> 00:05:22.161
this long tail to the right,
this is called right skewed.

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:28.202
Now, the technical idea
of skewness can get

00:05:28.202 --> 00:05:31.106
quite complicated, but generally speaking,

00:05:31.106 --> 00:05:33.007
you can spot it out when you have

00:05:33.007 --> 00:05:35.507
a long tail on one direction,

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.603
that's the direction in
which it will be skewed,

00:05:39.603 --> 00:05:42.612
or if the mean is to that
direction of the median.

00:05:42.612 --> 00:05:44.046
So the mean is to the right of the median,

00:05:44.046 --> 00:05:45.796
so generally speaking, that's going

00:05:45.796 --> 00:05:48.629
to be a right skewed distribution.

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:51.413
So the opposite of that,
here the mean is to the left

00:05:51.413 --> 00:05:53.911
of the median and we have this long tail

00:05:53.911 --> 00:05:57.465
on the left of our distribution,
so generally speaking

00:05:57.465 --> 00:06:01.632
we will describe these as
left skewed distributions.
