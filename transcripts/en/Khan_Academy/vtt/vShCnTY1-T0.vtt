00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
Sal: In the last video, we
learned that if you just leave

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.470
water to itself,
it autoionizes.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.320
So let me see.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.330
I have molecules of water.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.420
There's some probability, and
it's an equilibrium, that one

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.520
of the hydrogens on one of the
waters bumps off and just

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.760
joins the other one.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.880
So you could end up with
a hydronium ion.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.460
It's an ion because it has
an extra hydrogen.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.110
So I'll put a plus
charge there.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.230
And obviously, everything
you hear is

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.340
in an aqueous solution.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.440
I could write aqueous
everywhere.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.025
aq.

00:00:30.025 --> 00:00:31.320
I could write aq.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.700
It's kind of obvious.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.720
Water is obviously an
aqueous solution.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.070
It's obviously dissolved
in water.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.010
And then plus a hydroxide ion.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.300
This is the water molecule that
lost its hydrogen atom,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.370
or its proton.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.930
Because we know that a hydrogen
atom-- or at least a

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.640
hydrogen ion-- if you get rid of
its electron, all you have

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.810
left is a proton.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.490
And that's also in an
aqueous solution.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.030
And we learned that people
really care--

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.370
We learned about
the equilibrium

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.720
constant of this reaction.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.250
And we also learned that people
really care about the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.569
concentration of this
right here.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:06.230
Of the hydronium.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.720
And let me write this again.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.560
And I went over this
in the last video.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.140
But sometimes the same exact
autoionization reaction will

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.710
be written like this.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.110
H2O, disassociating in itself,
really, into a hydrogen ion in

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.570
an aqueous solution plus a
hydroxide anion in an aqueous

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.700
solution or a negative ion.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.540
These are the same thing, and
I write it this way because

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.200
this is actually the
state that happens.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.450
That you don't actually have
these protons just

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.760
independently, they actually
do join onto another water

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.470
molecule and form
a hydronium ion.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.630
But these are the same
exact concept.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.530
But we learned in the last video
that people really care

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.750
about the concentration
of-- you could pick

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:50.420
one of these two.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.250
They normally write this
one, right here.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.550
So people really care about
the concentration of your

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.380
hydrogen ions.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.180
And we learned in the last video
that just pure water at

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.060
25 degrees Celsius, which
is room temperature.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.750
So let me write that.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.830
At 25 degrees Celsius.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.700
The concentration of your
hydrogen protons-- because

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.840
that's really what they are,
or hydrogen ions-- is 10 to

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.360
the minus 7 molars.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.110
And then we even said, hey,
chemists, for whatever reason,

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.010
don't like dealing with
negative exponents.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:35.770
So they defined the pH as equal
to the minus log base 10

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.020
of your hydrogen
concentration.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:47.540
And of course, that's equal to
minus log base 10 of 10 to the

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.550
minus 7 for pure water, at 25
degrees, which is equal to 7.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.730
Fair enough.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.670
And you can probably imagine, if
people took the trouble of

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.350
constructing this pH thing and
saying it's the negative log,

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.580
they must really care about
what the hydrogen

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.090
concentration of water is.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.670
And it does matter to-- in a
whole bunch of-- especially

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.430
actually biological systems--
all the time, people worry

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.920
about the pH of this or that.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.540
And obviously I talked
in the last video

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.270
about pH-balanced cosmetics.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.920
All sorts of bad things might
happen to your skin if the pH

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.660
of the cosmetic is different
than your skin.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.240
I don't know if that's a fact,
but I guess that's the that's

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.150
the theory behind it.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.490
So there's obviously things in
the world that change the

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:30.940
hydrogen concentration.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.630
That change this
concentration.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.640
So, when we learned about Le
Chatelier's Principle, we said

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.910
hey, maybe if we add more
hydrogen on this side, the

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.620
equilibrium will change and this
concentration will go up.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.270
And so we have more hydrogen
concentration.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.160
I guess on the other side, you
could add more hydroxide and

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.670
then you would have more OH
concentration, and maybe a

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.220
little less hydrogen
concentration.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.700
So if you if you care about
things that are going to do

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.260
that to this reaction,
you probably want to

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.790
have a name for them.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.350
And the name for them
is acids and bases.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.260
And I'm sure you've heard both
of these words before.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.850
So, let me write
them both down.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.920
Acid and base.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.224
Now.

00:04:19.224 --> 00:04:23.155
Just to over-complicate your
life a little bit more, there

00:04:23.155 --> 00:04:26.010
are actually multiple
definitions of an acid and

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.450
multiple definitions
of a base.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.940
And they kind of become
more and more broad

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.720
in what they imply.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.870
The definition that you're
probably going to use the

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.750
most-- the definition that I
always use in my head whenever

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.760
someone says an acid-- is
it increases hydrogen

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.900
concentration when you
place it in water.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.940
And a base is something that
increases your hydroxide

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.950
concentration in water.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.010
This is the definition that
you're probably going to see

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.680
in 90%-- especially in a first
year chemistry class.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.410
And this is called the Arrhenius
acid or base.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.050
I hope I get his
spelling right.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.200
You should never take any
of the my spelling

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.860
words at face value.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.210
You should look them up because
I'm clearly not a

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.500
master speller.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.130
Arrhenius.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.230
Arrhenius, with an H.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.150
These are Arrhenius acid,
Arrhenius base.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.190
Let me give you an example.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:38.280
If I were to take some
hydrochloric acid-- that's

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.150
actually what it's called, but
you could say hydrogen

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.840
chloride-- in an aqueous
solution.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.140
It actually disassociates
completely.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.830
This is not an equilibrium
reaction.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.130
So let me put it in
this nice-- let me

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.610
use a bolder color.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.000
This nice one-way arrow, which
says, hey, this isn't one of

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.780
these wishy-washy reactions that
go in both directions.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.965
This is a strong acid.

00:06:00.965 --> 00:06:05.740
It completely disassociates in
water into-- let me put the

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.010
hydrogen in a different color.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.210
It completely disassociates in
water into a hydrogen ion.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:20.440
An aqueous solution
plus chloride.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.000
So it's just a chloride
negative ion

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.050
in an aqueous solution.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.070
And they just float in there.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.410
So you could imagine if you
place hydrogen chloride in

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.470
water, you're going to increase
its overall hydrogen

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:33.450
concentration.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.560
And the same exact reaction
could have been

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.760
written like this.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.570
Just to hit the point home.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:45.510
Hydrogen chloride in an
aqueous solution.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.504
And then you can say plus
h-- let me do it

00:06:49.504 --> 00:06:50.420
in a different color.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.085
Plus H2O.

00:06:54.085 --> 00:06:55.690
It's a one-way reaction.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.106
And then you end up with, and
I think you understand.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:11.460
Obviously not all 3 of them
are-- H3O, that's too dark.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:16.220
H3O plus-- it donated
its hydrogen proton

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.390
to this water molecule.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:23.610
And then you have plus
the chloride anion

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.690
in an aqueous solution.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.560
And these acids that completely
disassociate-- in

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.140
future videos, we're going to
look at ones that are a little

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.150
bit more wishy-washy.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.220
That don't completely
diaassociate.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.930
But these acids that completely
disassociate are

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.300
called strong acids.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.170
And strong isn't just
a nice word

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:44.100
that they use in chemistry.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.770
It literally means-- when
someone says a strong acid,

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.000
something that completely
disassociates into water.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.310
It's a one-way reaction.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.340
And all of a strong acids-- you
could probably even guess

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.020
based on their chemical
make-up.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.830
But hydrochloric acid
is one of them.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.190
You also have hydrogen
bromide.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.430
Another strong acid.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:06.680
Hydrogen iodide.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.380
You have nitric acid.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.300
I think I showed you that
in a previous--

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.090
All of these, when you when you
put them into water, this

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.910
little h is going to pop off.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.490
You join another water molecule,
form hydronium.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:24.070
And then this molecule right
here, in these cases-- well,

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:27.160
in the case of chloride--
these are halogens.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.260
But they're going to go and
form negative ions.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.250
Whatever's left over.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.320
Nitric acid.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.049
Then you have sulfuric acid.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:35.230
You've probably heard of that.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.870
Very strong acid.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:40.820
Sulfuric acid and then
perchloric acid.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.370
These are the strong acids.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:46.330
O4.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.660
And these are good to know,
because if you see them on a

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.590
chemistry exam, you know that
these are going to completely

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:52.480
disassociate.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.710
And remember, we keep using
this word acid.

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:55.830
What does acid mean?

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.650
It means that these
are strong acids.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:59.530
These completely disassociate.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:04.990
If you like Arrhenius's
definition of what an acid is,

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.860
they increase your hydrogen
concentration.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.730
Because obviously when you throw
this in some water, all

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:14.320
of these new hydronium ions are
going to be formed, and

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.720
they're going to overall
increase your

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.580
concentration of them.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.650
And that's why they're
called an acid.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:22.720
And now if you went on the
strong base side, by

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:29.350
Arrhenius's definition, the base
is something that creates

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:34.360
hydroxide ions, or
anions in water.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:39.130
If you look at the periodic
table, any of your group 1

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:43.230
elements, and group 1 elements
are your alkali earth metals.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:46.880
Your alkali earth metals are
bonded with hydroxide.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.990
If you put them in water,
the hydroxide pops off.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:54.130
So let me just-- has to do
with lithium or sodium.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.030
So for example, these
are strong bases.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:10:06.750
So if I take some lithium
the hydroxide

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:08.060
in an aqueous solution.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.290
This completely disassociates.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.490
No equilibrium here.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:19.100
This is a strong base.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.790
So what's it going to
disassociate to?

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:24.990
Well the little hydroxide
ion is going to pop off.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.010
That's going to be a minus.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:28.850
It's in water still.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:36.170
Plus a lithium ion.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:37.300
Right there.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.320
So this will always disassociate
in water.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.085
The same thing is if
you have sodium.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:50.910
Sodium's going to do
the same thing.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:53.830
Sodium hydroxide in an
aqueous solution.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:54.860
One-way reaction.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:11:00.950
You produce hydroxide and
some sodium cations.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:03.040
And so you imagine, when you
put these in water, this

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.400
concentration is
going to go up.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.960
It's just like what we did in
Le Chetalier's Principal.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.720
Where we said, oh, what if you
add some of this or some of

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.720
that to an equilibrium
reaction.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.980
Well, how do you add it?

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.290
Well, in this case, you
can add a strong

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:16.200
acid or a strong base.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.200
Now, everything I've done so
far-- this is the Arrhenius

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.760
definition-- where an acid
increases your hydrogen

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:27.130
concentration, a base increases
your hydroxide

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:28.480
concentration.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.680
Now that is what you're going
to see 90% of the time.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.410
But there is a slightly broader
definition out there.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:37.930
And I don't know the correct--
I always say

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.640
just Bronsted, but.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.840
If you don't have fancy fonts,
it's spelled like this.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:50.720
Bronsted-Lowry acid or base.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.720
If you if you have good fonts,
there's usually this little

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.480
cross at the o.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.130
So I don't know.

00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:59.060
Well, Bronsted-Lowry acid.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.480
And all of these would also
be Bronsted-Lowry acid.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:08.810
But the broadening of the
definition is an acid is a

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.060
proton donor.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:22.630
And a base is a proton
acceptor.

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.290
So let's look at this definition
in the context of

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:29.720
everything we've just
done so far.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.370
So if you live buy the
Bronsted-Lowry definition,

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.310
what is a proton donor here?

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.070
Well, this hydrochloric acid
is-- let me look at this

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:40.390
reaction right here.

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.600
This hydrochloric acid is
donating a proton to this

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.980
water molecule, right?

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.510
A hydrogen atom is
just a proton.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:50.300
That's an important thing to
remember, because it had-- a

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.250
hydrogen ion.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.700
Because if you get rid of its
electron, it has no neutron.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.300
It's just a proton
sitting in space.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.650
So this hydrochloric acid is
donating a proton to this

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:02.560
water molecule to make a
hydronium molecule, and it

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.490
gave it away.

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:06.050
So this is a Bronsted-Lowry
acid as well.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.190
Just as it was an
Arrhenius acid.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:12.120
Let's see the Bronsted-Lowry
version of a base.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:12.500
OK.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.870
A base is someone who--
proton acceptor.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:20.820
So this guy, he had this nice
little relationship with this

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.050
hydroxide ion.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:27.380
The hydroxide ion got
disassociated, and it becomes

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.750
a little bit fungible
right here.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:33.450
You can kind of say hey,
this guy accepted

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:36.250
this positive charge.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.110
And, you know, it's a little
bit wishy-washy here.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:44.340
Because it's not like someone
gave it a proton.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.690
You can kind of think
of it as he

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:48.160
actually gave away electrons.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.080
But if you just look at
the final product.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.990
OK, he's got a positive charge
when everything was done.

00:13:53.990 --> 00:14:00.010
So you say OK, maybe that's
a Bronsted-Lowry base.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.940
Now you're saying, OK well, why
did people even make the

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:06.880
trouble of defining a
Bronsted-Lowry base when all

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.540
of the Arrhenius acids and
bases could also be

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.020
Bronsted-Lowry.

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.690
Well that's because Arrhenius
is always--

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:13.850
You're always dealing
with water.

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:15.380
Everything's in an
aqueous solution.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:19.290
But I drew an example here
of a Bronsted-Lowry base.

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:21.270
It doesn't have to be
an aqueous solution.

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:23.870
So if you have acetic
acid right here--

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.180
that's what's in vinegar.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:30.020
Plus ammonia-- it doesn't have
to be in an aqueous solution--

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.160
what happens?

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.410
This hydrogen gets
donated to the

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:35.470
ammonia ion to make ammonium.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.290
So this becomes positive,
this because negative.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:42.360
It donated this proton.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.400
And Arrhenius has nothing
to say for this.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.320
Because everything he deals with
is hydronium and water.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.710
But the Bronsted-Lowry
definition

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.310
works in the situation.

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:58.940
Now the broadest definition--
although they're all these

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.370
definitions, but you're going to
be 90% of the time good if

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:03.380
you just know the Arrhenius
definition and just know the

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.280
Bronsted-Lowry and what
I'm about to say

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.430
right now also exists.

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:09.000
And that's Lewis acids
and bases.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.780
Now Lewis cares about
electrons.

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.340
Bronsted-Lowry cared
about protons.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:25.090
So Lewis, instead of saying an
acid is a proton donor, Lewis

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:27.320
acid says it's an electron
acceptor.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:37.712
And a base is an
electron donor.

00:15:37.712 --> 00:15:40.090
Now, let's us look at in the
context of everything we've

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:41.340
done so far.

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:45.770
If this is really an
acid, it should

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.320
be an electron acceptor.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.190
And the way you can kind of
think of it is you had

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:56.840
hydrochloric acid before, when
this guy gave away this atom

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.370
or this proton right there.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.200
He kind of kept his elecron.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.850
So he was kind of an
electron acceptor.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.580
It's a little bit of
a grey area there.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.250
It's not like he took an
electron from somebody else.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.740
But this would be considered
still a Lewis acid.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:15.380
And if you think about a Lewis
base, a Lewis base is what?

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:19.495
It's an electron donor, right?

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:28.890
So if you have it right
here, Lewis base

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:30.235
is an electron donor.

00:16:30.235 --> 00:16:33.870
This lithium hydroxide, when it
goes into water-- There's a

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:34.840
couple of ways to think of it.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.800
You can say hey, it's donating
this OH, which has these 2

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:44.520
extra-- this negative charge,
so it's an electron donor.

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.150
I don't lik it.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:48.050
It's kind of squishy that way,
so I'm not a big fan of that

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:49.230
definition.

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.270
In my mind, Arrhenius makes
the most sense.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:52.770
It's kind of the purist thing.

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:54.980
Are you creating hydronium
or not?

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.990
Or are you creating
hydroxide or not?

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:01.870
But just to show that the Lewis
acid base definition is

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:03.070
the broadest definition.

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:06.930
Here's a case of a Lewis
acid base reaction.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:12.170
That would not be considered
either a Bronsted-Lowry or an

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:13.150
Arrhenius base.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:14.720
Because this doesn't have
to happen in water.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.349
And what you have here is boron
trifluoride, with a

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:19.960
fluoride anion.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.920
It has a negative charge.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.140
It has this little extra
electron here.

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:28.150
In this situation, this fluoride
right here, or this

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:32.940
fluorine anion can donate
these 2 electrons.

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:36.810
So let's say that this
one right here is

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:37.780
this one right here.

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:43.370
And what it does is, it donates
these 2 electrons to

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:46.280
this boron complex right here.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.770
And so if it's the electron
donor, what is it?

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.550
The fluoride is the base.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:56.510
So this is Lewis base.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.970
And then the electron acceptor
is the Lewis acid.

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:02.860
So this right here is
the Lewis Acid.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:05.210
It's good to know that these
definitions exist, and

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:08.040
especially so you don't get
confused in the future.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.730
But for a first-year chemistry
class, if you know the

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:15.560
Arrhenius definition
really well, you'll

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.690
do very, very well.

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:18.840
And frankly in my mind, that's
the easiest one to

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.570
contemplate.

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.750
And that's the one that's going
to matter in most of the

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:26.590
reactions where you deal with
the changes in pH to water.

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:28.680
Because that's what all the
acids and bases do, especially

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.020
in the Arrhenius case.

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.040
Anyway, see you in the next
video and watch as we do some

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.970
math, figuring out the changes
in pH due to some acid.
