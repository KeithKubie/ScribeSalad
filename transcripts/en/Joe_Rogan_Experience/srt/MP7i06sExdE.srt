Huh.

50
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,330
Wow. Pretty intense, right?
That's good shit. Yeah.

51
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,860
That's Adam Freeland and the
song is we want your soul. Fuck.

52
00:05:48,861 --> 00:05:52,190
That's apocalyptic man. That, that
song scares the shit out of me.

53
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,070
That's a brilliant song, man. It's Google.

54
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,100
That thing scared the fuck out

55
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,390
of me. They definitely summed it all up,
dude. It was brilliant. It was brilliant.

56
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,070
That was brilliant.
The funny thing about it is though,

57
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,550
like if there was a way to
authentically sell your soul,

58
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,610
there wouldn't have to be any
trickery involved in that.

59
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,940
Like people would just do it. Some
people would definitely do it. Well,

60
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:20,270
there's people out there
called bug chasers that are
gay guys that are trying to

61
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:25,100
get HIV. Trying to, yeah, I know. Trying
to find sick guys to bang them in the ass.

62
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,020
Yeah,
they have bug chaser parties.

63
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,490
What the fuck you just told me about
this last time I hung out with them.

64
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,010
Surreal Shit, man. It's real shit. Well,

65
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:39,011
it's because apparently if you're gay
and you are having unprotected sex,

66
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,280
then there's this always this paranoia.

67
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,750
It's kind of floating around you that
you might have aids because isn't it?

68
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,970
I don't know that how it works.
But when you get aids,

69
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,700
it doesn't it take some time
that show up or something.

70
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:56,510
Like sometimes he doesn't show.
It's a very, very complicated virus.

71
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,690
It's a very controversial,
you know, I've never heard,

72
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:03,920
there's no major virus that I've ever
heard anybody say is fake except for aids.

73
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,440
Have you ever heard them? No
one's ever said that. You know,

74
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,370
I mean if you ever heard like the
gonorrhea is fake. You've heard the,

75
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,080
the AIDS is the only one that I've ever
heard. Like this is not a real thing.

76
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,350
Yeah, that's right. You can't get aids
with a flashlight. And it's a tricky,

77
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,660
it's a tricky one because yeah,

78
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:20,720
we're sponsored by the fleshlight fuck
a flashlight instead of letting people

79
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:25,210
with aids. Fuck you. So you can get a
bug. That's ridiculous. But, well, I did.

80
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,840
The idea is that you have HIV first and
that HIV causes AIDS, right? That's,

81
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,930
that's the, that's what
they're saying. Yes. So it's,

82
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:36,730
but how come it's not like one thing?
Why isn't it like, you know, you,

83
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,940
you get boom, you get syphilis
areas, their syphilis.

84
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,560
Why is it this tricky thing where you
know, you, you know, you're, you're sick.

85
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,280
Oh No. You know what I'm saying? Like
you get HIV and the HIV becomes aids.

86
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:51,520
It's like, aren't you dying
of HIV then? Like what do you,

87
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,840
I don't know why they do,
they describe it in two ways.

88
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,120
There is a thing that I saw how it,

89
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:01,070
there's different ways to define whether
you have aids cause there's a certain,

90
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,000
isn't it like the eye you're with aids
means is your immune system is broken

91
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:06,550
down, right? Right. Does the in that,

92
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:10,340
is that possible that you can get that
from both the, from different things.

93
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,950
So it's like what they're
saying is HIV causes AIDS,

94
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,920
but it's not the only cause of aids.
Is that where they're saying, well,

95
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:19,850
I mean like maybe some other
immune system breakdown type shit.

96
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,430
Like there's other people that
argue for like, there's a guy named,

97
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:27,920
what the fuck is his name? Uh, he's
uh, we'll, I'll look it up real quick.

98
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,880
But to Peter Duesberg, Peter Duesberg,
and he seems to be like this,

99
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:35,930
like really credible biologists from the
University of California Berkeley and

100
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:40,931
he's got this crazy theory that aids
isn't real and that what it is is a

101
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:45,320
conglomeration of a bunch of other
diseases and apparently he's been totally

102
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:46,550
discredited.
And you know,

103
00:08:46,551 --> 00:08:51,080
all the mainstream time Tiffin studies
have pointed to know there is a very real

104
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:54,740
connection between HIV and aids and this
is very irresponsible what he's doing.

105
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,980
But this guy's still deal in it.

106
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,490
Like you still saying it and he's got
like all these papers that he's written on

107
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:01,350
it.
It's like it's such a weird fucking,

108
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,840
you know that's a tricky
ass topic made sure is.

109
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:05,850
And it's tricky to cut through the,

110
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,870
you know all the information sources you
have about it. You have to think, okay,

111
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:14,400
are these information sources that
came from pharmaceutical companies,

112
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:18,120
manufacturing drugs does happen.
Oh hell yeah.

113
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,240
I just read this thing that there
is a famous book by an advertiser,

114
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,260
I can't remember his name,

115
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:26,910
but it's supposedly like the one of
the old bibles of advertising. And he,

116
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,380
he said that rather than just selling
a product, don't be ridiculous.

117
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:34,140
What you should do is create a demand,

118
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:39,530
create the demand first and then create
demand for something that doesn't exist

119
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:43,080
yet. Create a mythology around
the thing you're selling.

120
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:45,390
So I'm kind of describing
it in a clumsy way,

121
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:49,810
but he said what he did is he
started advertising and papers, um,

122
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,200
pianos, no, not pianist.

123
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,790
He started in papers putting articles
about how it's popular right now for

124
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,200
families to,
uh,

125
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,250
be learning music and taking music
lessons in their living rooms that,

126
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,870
but he ran a piano company.

127
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,290
So the idea was instead of
just selling pianos flat out,

128
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:12,010
he created this new thing in
society and in the, in, in the, uh,

129
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,950
Zeitgeists, which is that, you know,

130
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:16,530
a really good family does have
a piano in their living room.

131
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,550
And so then people naturally
decided to start buying the pianos.

132
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:25,551
So in the same way with aids
or with a swine flu or with,

133
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,270
uh, you know, God,

134
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:30,930
it's so funny to watch
like the pharmaceutical
commercials cause it'll be like

135
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,750
some problem you've never
heard of in your fucking life.

136
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:38,700
Like do you have minor ankle inflammation
or one thing I saw was like a,

137
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:43,500
do you have particularly heavy bleeding
on the 31st month of your menstruation

138
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:47,190
cycle? You might be a double heavy
bleeder. You know, like they said,

139
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:49,620
they come up with this
thing in all of history.

140
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:51,840
You've never heard of
a double heavy bleeder,

141
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,700
but like they just invent this thing.
It just start selling the drug. And so,

142
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,100
you know, thinking, I don't know,
you're probably not a hypochondriac.

143
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,270
I'm a bit of a hyper contract.

144
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:05,130
So think if like you're a woman and you
have noticed like a little more flow

145
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:09,360
than normal, you're like, I might be a
double heavy bleeder. That's a real quote.

146
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,850
You're being serious. Yes sir.
Yeah, that's true. The real costs.

147
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,400
All you were just joking about the piano
thing. No, but the double heavy bleeders,

148
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,570
no, it's, that's not that
scientific name for it.

149
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:19,950
They have a different name for it,
but it is.

150
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,480
She fucking double heavy bleeder.

151
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:29,070
They is the worst name for anything
but it like a triple heavy flow.

152
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,960
It's got a weird name for it. It's so
ridiculous. But yeah. So aids, you know,

153
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,160
this information you're getting,

154
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:38,730
is this coming from Pharma pharmaceutical
companies selling bullshit medicine or

155
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,850
is it coming from actual scientists
who weren't hired by the pharmaceutical

156
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:46,670
companies to prove that their medicine
is necessary? It's confusing you.

157
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:50,100
Do you think there's that much corruption
that they really get a chance to

158
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:54,070
influence studies and findings
as you really think there's

159
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,930
that much corruption? I think it's
cynical to say that when you live in,

160
00:11:56,931 --> 00:11:59,860
it's an interesting idea though, right?
Like how much corruption is there really?

161
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:03,190
We know there's definitely
some corruption. Well, they
saved us from swine flu.

162
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,930
I remember how bad that
was. Such an industry, man.

163
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:12,460
That's the tricky thing is you people
don't understand like there are billions

164
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:17,070
of dollars to be made and so the idea
that someone would invent a disease, no,

165
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:19,570
well that's ridiculous.
I'm not going to invent a disease,

166
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,890
but they might make a much bigger deal
out of something that really needs to be.

167
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,570
It's like, you know, all of the sudden,
you know, it was a particular type of flu.

168
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,770
It was connected to a pig and you know,
some people died from it.

169
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:35,890
Like it's a strong flow, but there's
strong fluids every fucking year.

170
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,280
People die from the flu every year.
Flues are terrible. Yeah. But it's a,

171
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,640
that's a thing that's, you know, they all
come from livestock. No, I didn't want,

172
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:45,281
not all of them,

173
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:48,430
but a lot of them come from birds and
pigs and like that's where they come from.

174
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:52,540
They come from, they come from our farm
animals man. Fucking living together in,

175
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:55,130
in, in, in terrible conditions. Yeah.

176
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,000
I think it might be making that up.

177
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,820
That's what it is. Because, I mean,

178
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:05,350
if you look at some of the video of
slaughter houses are like the really bad

179
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:09,390
cattle farms. That's the 10th
circle of hell there, man. So,

180
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:12,790
so strange how we're evolving as a,
as a being,

181
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:17,710
but so we have disconnected our own
personal lives from the murder of animals

182
00:13:17,711 --> 00:13:21,520
for food. Like the connection between
eating animals and having food totally,

183
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:24,760
completely removed. Like I know so
many people that love cheeseburgers,

184
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,520
but you say, hey, you want to go
hunting? And they'll look at you like,

185
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,120
Oh fuck that are you are redneck?
Yeah. What are you going to do?

186
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:35,830
You're going to kill an animal.
Like, oh my God. Like, you
know? Yeah. The, the, the,

187
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:38,620
they'll look at you like
you're a piece of shit. Yeah,

188
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,960
but they'll have bacon on there.
Their cheeseburger.

189
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,480
I love thinking it's a
double murder sandwich.

190
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,490
Cow and pig slaughtered,
by the way,

191
00:13:48,491 --> 00:13:50,950
if you are like,
if you run into someone who's a hunter,

192
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:55,240
that negative stigma attached to being a
hunter is, is pretty intense. It's like,

193
00:13:55,270 --> 00:14:00,100
Oh really? JETHRO, do you go out
there and hunt deer out in the forest?

194
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:02,290
You fucking barbaric man.

195
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,700
And meanwhile you're stuffing your
face full of mystery meat from Bhagwan

196
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:11,560
yesterday. What the fuck it is.
Yeah. Burger king meet. Yeah, it's,

197
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:15,870
it's just, it is a very curious thing.
And also the other thing of it and that,

198
00:14:15,871 --> 00:14:17,140
you know, I've, I've really,

199
00:14:17,141 --> 00:14:20,300
I've got Terrence McKinnon the brain right
now because I've been reading food or

200
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:25,080
the food of the gods. Fuck
man. Um, credible book now,

201
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,200
incredible staff ideas behind
it. So fascinating. The idea,

202
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,550
the big one is the mushroom,

203
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,030
the stoned ape theory for the folks
who haven't heard us. We've talked to,

204
00:14:34,031 --> 00:14:36,150
and we've talked about this before,
but turns for Ken,

205
00:14:36,151 --> 00:14:40,300
his theory was that the reason why the
human brain size doubled over a period of

206
00:14:40,301 --> 00:14:41,260
2 million years,

207
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,350
it's like one of the biggest
mysteries in the entire fossil record.

208
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:49,660
And he equates it to the time where the
climate changed and rain forest receded

209
00:14:49,661 --> 00:14:54,080
into grasslands and monkeys climbed down
from trees and start experimenting with

210
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:58,130
new food sources and they would flip
over cow patties to find like bugs and

211
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:59,780
beetles and shit.
And like they do that today.

212
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,780
And when they saw mushrooms
growing in the cow patties,

213
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,610
certain groups of these monkeys started
eating these mushrooms and two things

214
00:15:07,611 --> 00:15:08,211
happen.
One,

215
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:11,540
it increased their visual acuity and
made them be able to see much better.

216
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,970
And then the other thing that
happened is it made them horny.

217
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:17,900
So here you have these better hunters
because they can see things better.

218
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,471
There are probably,

219
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:21,740
they can throw things and they're
more accurate and then they're horny.

220
00:15:21,741 --> 00:15:23,510
So they're going to fuck.
And then of course,

221
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,790
if they're eating plates
of these fucking things,

222
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:29,000
they're going to have
psychedelic experiences.
Sure. Even if you're a monkey,

223
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:31,520
maybe. And if you have psychedelic
experiences like every day,

224
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:36,100
maybe it's just like, it's like a
forced fed, you know, evolution thing.

225
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:40,750
Well, can I throw a crazy idea? He so,

226
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,690
and he has a very scientific
mind and I think he,

227
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:46,240
I mean he hated mentioning
the idea of Sa. Oh, he did.

228
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:49,000
I don't think he hated mentioning
about if you look at his live lectures,

229
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,290
he always like at one point he said he
would much rather look at what happened

230
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:56,290
to him when he was in the Amazon and
figured out the thing about the eating,

231
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,610
I don't know the exact
quote but he said um,

232
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,070
he would much rather be able to call it
psychosis then channeling because he was

233
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,800
so anti the new age stuff
and the new age movement.

234
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:09,250
But if we kind of talked about this
the last time I was on here and I don't

235
00:16:09,251 --> 00:16:11,350
think we ever like the answered it,

236
00:16:11,351 --> 00:16:14,590
which is the question is when you're
having a psychedelic experience,

237
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,900
are you just seeing a hallucination
or are you tuning in with some higher

238
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,690
vibratory,
higher intelligence?

239
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:27,580
Some higher force of Mackinac talked about
extra terrestrials and if you've ever

240
00:16:27,581 --> 00:16:32,170
been in on a psychedelic and sometimes
you do experience something that you

241
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:35,500
would think is extra terrestrial.
So this is where it gets weird.

242
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:40,650
You know how people say aliens like landed
some ship and dabbled with the DNA of

243
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:43,600
the apes and that's what
caused the super evolution.

244
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,020
What if it wasn't dabbling
with the DNA the aliens did?

245
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,910
What if it was the communication,

246
00:16:48,911 --> 00:16:51,610
like Mckenna said was
coming through the mushroom.

247
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,730
The way they were communicating with
these apes that were eating them was like,

248
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,240
oh wait, hold on. We've got
some potential here. These,

249
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:01,510
they have brains that could develop their
kind of tuning into us a little bit.

250
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,090
Let's start feeding them some information.
It's like,

251
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:08,560
imagine if some primitive species on some
other planet found a transistor radio

252
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,220
and they could kind of in
some way understand the
communication coming from it.

253
00:17:12,221 --> 00:17:14,600
They were still super primitive,
but there's some way.

254
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:17,830
Maybe there was a video thing on it and
you could show them how to make a fire,

255
00:17:17,831 --> 00:17:19,690
like just hit Flint together.

256
00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:23,500
You can make a fire if you
had the intention of like
speeding up their evolution.

257
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,560
Maybe it's the same thing, only
happened organically, you know? Yeah.

258
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,600
I would think the same.
I would think that

259
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,920
more than the other way.

260
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,420
I would definitely think that there'll
be much more willing to travel that way

261
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:37,420
than by ships. Why? Why do we think that?

262
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:41,830
If we figured out eventually that
we are all one thing, you know,

263
00:17:41,831 --> 00:17:44,830
if we figured out eventually that all
life in the air and space and everything

264
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:47,710
combined is all really
connected in some sort of a,

265
00:17:47,711 --> 00:17:51,270
a strange way that we
don't totally understand,

266
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,590
but there's some sort of a connection.

267
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,510
Well then these little like
we're these spores, you know,

268
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:01,770
these spores are all like they
can go in a vacuum in space,

269
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,010
they can travel in extreme
cold and extreme heat.

270
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,490
They can absorb radiation and not get
damaged and they can travel from other

271
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:09,270
planets.
Like if,

272
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:14,270
if a meteor hits a chunk of this planet
can get knocked off and that gets sent

273
00:18:15,091 --> 00:18:18,810
flying into space and it lands on
another planet and those spores,

274
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:23,280
all of a sudden that we're in this rock
get to give birth on this planet and

275
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:25,530
just communicate with all
the animals that are here.

276
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,820
That's it. That's the idea. That's
the idea. Yeah. That they're trying,

277
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:33,730
that they're a transmission devices of
some higher intelligence and they're not

278
00:18:33,731 --> 00:18:38,680
causing your,
I just am so over that notion that uh,

279
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:43,510
hallucinating or being stoned as
an artificial experience, you know,

280
00:18:43,511 --> 00:18:44,301
like,
cause I,

281
00:18:44,301 --> 00:18:47,170
I realized like I was really high the
other day and I was walking down the

282
00:18:47,171 --> 00:18:51,220
street and I was like, man, this is
fucking beautiful. It's a beautiful day.

283
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:55,840
I feel great. And then another part of
my brain snuck in and it's like, yeah,

284
00:18:55,841 --> 00:18:59,410
but you're stoned. You're stone.
This isn't real happiness.

285
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:04,360
Real happiness can only come without the
influence of a truck and that is such

286
00:19:04,361 --> 00:19:07,990
fucking conditioning. I realized, oh
that's conditioning. This is a valid,

287
00:19:07,991 --> 00:19:11,230
perfectly normal, good
experience. Yes. Yeah,

288
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,380
absolutely. And why, why is,
why is it a good experience?

289
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:18,640
I think one of the reasons is because
your body is tuning in to this plant.

290
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,380
I think marijuana in,

291
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,070
in as the psilocybin has
a plant intelligence.

292
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,250
And I think when you absorb it into your
body, it gives you something different.

293
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:32,410
It's not just you because
you, you what? You are flat.
All right, you're a receiver.

294
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,480
And when you put things into your body,

295
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:38,350
there are certain things that you put
into your body that have a very extreme

296
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:42,640
result. A very, the, the, the, they
bring about a very extreme condition.

297
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:44,560
Mushrooms are one of them,
right? Marijuana is one of them.

298
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,610
We have to assume that there's,
it's not just go, Whoa,

299
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,880
you're just tweaking your brain. You're
just screwing with your chemicals. Maybe,

300
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:56,110
or maybe you're tuning in to another
frequency, maybe allowing, you know,

301
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,030
eating these mushrooms,
eating marijuana,

302
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,250
all this different shit
that you do pay AOD.

303
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:04,120
Maybe it allows you to just
tune in to their frequency.

304
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:08,400
Yeah. And, and, and
maybe it's not just, um,

305
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,040
a real experience.
Maybe it's a better,

306
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,360
more advanced experience than whatever
the normal non stone state of being is.

307
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,480
I was just talking

308
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:20,400
sometimes, but sometimes not. I mean,
when you, when you smoke like heavy,

309
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:23,490
like oh Gee Kush type weed
and it turns you into a moron.

310
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,520
That stuff's not that good for the cause.
But if you follow that,

311
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,940
if you call it uses, you remembered
the, hold on a second though.

312
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:33,690
Do you remember the time we were all in
Houston and we smoked Joey's we'd, yeah,

313
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,360
and Joey is smoke sativas now. But back
then he was smoking the deep indicas.

314
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,240
This was 400 pound Joey.
This was,

315
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:43,970
he would go with the old g Kush dog visit.
That's all I, that's all I roll with.

316
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:48,970
And you, we smoked it. We were all in
the car and we smoke Joey's and when we,

317
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:52,240
when we got to the hotel room,
we were all standing in the lobby going,

318
00:20:52,241 --> 00:20:53,560
what the fuck

319
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,720
can, can I, do you remember what happened
before it got to the hotel room? No,

320
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,270
cause it's the only time that's
ever happened in my life.

321
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:03,950
We went up train tracks. Do you remember
that? We were driving on train tracks.

322
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,620
Do you remember that?
Oh yeah.

323
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,870
You were on the very right and you were
on the train check lane like Oh yeah.

324
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:14,460
It was very confusing.
Yeah. Yeah. We were fucking,

325
00:21:14,461 --> 00:21:18,150
thank God I was sober while I was
driving. Yeah. Yeah. No, I know.

326
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,100
But like just a weird wrong turn.

327
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:22,040
Yeah.

328
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,330
The real problem with that weed is that
it is your fucking crushes your memory.

329
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,800
Like you don't remember what you were
talking about five seconds ago like we

330
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:34,670
were standing there. Just be dazzled
going, what the fuck man? What's wrong?

331
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,860
And then somebody said it,
I don't know who said it.

332
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,030
We smoked Joey's weed and they were like,
yeah,

333
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,380
Oh shit. Yeah, I know
that stuff is narcotic.

334
00:21:43,381 --> 00:21:47,820
That shit is cough syrup is
narcotic. It is. And Cough Syrup.

335
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:52,650
It puts you in this car.
It feels like you're taking
like, uh, they got that shake.

336
00:21:52,651 --> 00:21:54,520
It enters. Yeah. It's not good

337
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,460
people in leg, extreme pain, I
guess. It's probably really good,

338
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,610
but some of it is not good and you never
know what the fuck you're going to get,

339
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:05,120
man. You know, that's the thing, unless
you're, you're going to a dispensary,

340
00:22:05,121 --> 00:22:06,200
unless you're like,
you know,

341
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:09,530
talking to the people that work there
that are professional stoners, you know,

342
00:22:09,531 --> 00:22:10,071
you never know.

343
00:22:10,071 --> 00:22:12,470
What the hell are you going to get if
you're just buying weed from some dude,

344
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,380
you don't know. You get a
Goddamn crap shooting your hands.

345
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:16,580
You can get that coma weed.

346
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,720
Yep. Not to mention, I mean, well
I guess it's true at all week,

347
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,430
but it's like where did
it fucking come from?

348
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:26,990
Like I wish he could just see with every
weed you could just rewind and watch

349
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,110
from inception to like
making it into your pocket.

350
00:22:30,111 --> 00:22:32,450
Cause it's such a funny
journey that stuff has to take.

351
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,800
Marijuana is a fascinating plant.
And what's more fascinating?

352
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,420
The fact that it's illegal.
I mean that's of course fascinating.

353
00:22:38,421 --> 00:22:42,170
But what's really fascinating is that
it's one of the most useful plants in the

354
00:22:42,171 --> 00:22:43,760
world and it's illegal.

355
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,800
Like just forget about the psychoactive
effect just for nutrition and for use to

356
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:52,580
make it a far superior paper,
far superior cloth.

357
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,220
And it's illegal to grow at eve.
It's illegal to grow.

358
00:22:55,221 --> 00:22:59,780
Even the shit that is non psychoactive.
Yeah. You can't even grow hemp.

359
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:02,530
Like the stuff that can't get you
high at all. You can't grow them

360
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,440
but what,
but you think like him,

361
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:08,040
you can grow in Canada and Canada's
not like food school and crazy.

362
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:10,590
Everyone's coming, you know, making
a shitload of money on him. You know,

363
00:23:10,591 --> 00:23:14,970
went in it be like, I mean,
couldn't we judge what hemp growing,

364
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,910
you know,
financial shit would be by Candace.

365
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,460
Yeah, but it's not really a not, but it's
not based on logic. That's all thing.

366
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,120
It's like the moment you think that.

367
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,590
No, he makes a good point. I mean,
you know, it's not like they're,

368
00:23:25,591 --> 00:23:28,810
they're fucking never hear the
lease oil barons. Right. Shit.

369
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,060
Look at dollar Ham bitches and
may box and shit and diamonds.

370
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:39,040
It's bullshit. It's hemp empire bitches.
This is how we roll here at him. Socks.

371
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:42,840
Not that good and cognitive
are way better, but is it
really? Yeah. Try Him closer.

372
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:43,250
Great.
Yeah.

373
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,220
Can you give a a Chica hemp. Roz.
She's going to have bloody nipples

374
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,240
at the end of this kind of stinky feet.
What's good about him? It's stinky feet.

375
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,040
You found out the girl that I had
brought him like how bad your feet sweat.

376
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:57,170
Great candle at your feet.
Smell you stink. You little
bitch. You the best candle.

377
00:23:57,171 --> 00:24:00,410
Fucking hippie bitch. The best
candle collection ever though. Yeah.

378
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:02,420
With your flower paint on your face.

379
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:07,190
Oh Man. What is that? Or
the dragon fly on this fine.

380
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:12,470
Oh, that old girl. Why do your feet stink?

381
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,820
Wasn't it, wait, wasn't that a
Donovan Song? Why do your feet stink?

382
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:17,683
Damn girl,

383
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:24,050
could you imagine if you're living in
the 60s when people just discovered like

384
00:24:24,051 --> 00:24:27,230
drugs and marijuana and the
whole culture completely shifted.

385
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,210
You imagine being a part of that time.
You know,

386
00:24:29,211 --> 00:24:31,880
we kind of accept the fact
that LSD has been around. Yeah.

387
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,920
And we were in high school.
We all knew some guy who fucked up.

388
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:36,680
It took too much LSD.
Now we imagine in the 50s man,

389
00:24:36,681 --> 00:24:39,500
from the 50 to the sixties what
a giant transition that yes.

390
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:44,390
Straight after the forties right after
that sweet Hoffman made that wonderful

391
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,170
experiment in the laboratory
and it exploded into culture.

392
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:52,240
And then before the CIA could start trying
to beat it back into the bottle, like,

393
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,640
oh fuck, we gotta get this shit back
in there. People are growing beards.

394
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:56,720
Nobody wants to fight.

395
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,490
But before that could happen when it
was just billowing out and just Ginsburg

396
00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:05,210
was giving speeches in front of
just thousands and thousand people,

397
00:25:05,211 --> 00:25:07,880
not Justin Bieber singing about bullshit,

398
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:13,030
but some bearded gay dude reading poetry
in front of thousands and thousands and

399
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:17,440
thousands of people on acid and Timothy
weary doing experiments with Rom Dawson.

400
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,950
It was just this incredible moment.

401
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:24,140
And then the fucking CIA got involved and
the government got involved and all of

402
00:25:24,141 --> 00:25:27,440
a sudden that's when they started pumping
shit into the zeitgeists where it's

403
00:25:27,441 --> 00:25:30,950
like, Oh yeah, Smoking Pot,
Huh? It makes you lazy.

404
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:34,490
LSD will drive you insane mushrooms.

405
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,940
That's what communists eat. Who
knows what it all is. But yeah,

406
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,420
all the shows that you're saying, they
did this through what newspaper articles?

407
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:45,190
The Reagan administration. Look at what
the Reagans did. Now it's 10 years after.

408
00:25:45,191 --> 00:25:49,000
It was like a, uh, it took, uh, it
took some time. But this is your brain.

409
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,530
This is your brain on
drugs. It's like, oh,

410
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,620
really? So you think that like
the sweeping act of the wood,

411
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:58,460
the 1970s psychedelics,
when when they made everything,

412
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:02,720
whatever the act was that
made Lsd, mushrooms made all
that stuff scheduled ones.

413
00:26:02,721 --> 00:26:03,290
Yeah.

414
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:07,850
So clearly that was because they saw
there was a big culture shift that was a

415
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:09,110
culture shift decision,

416
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,580
right? Absolutely. Yeah.
You cause you can't, it's,

417
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:16,610
you cannot successfully pull off the
level of conditioning that is omnipresent

418
00:26:17,371 --> 00:26:19,920
in this country or in any tyranny.
Uh,

419
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:23,160
if people are taking psychedelics where
they're communicating with some higher

420
00:26:23,161 --> 00:26:26,490
intelligence, whatever you want to call
it, plugging into the plenum, uh, okay.

421
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:29,380
Murder even accelerating your
mind to a higher frequency.

422
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:31,180
That's the other argument
that maybe it's not,

423
00:26:31,181 --> 00:26:34,380
you're not taking in an alien
intelligence when you share a dog,

424
00:26:34,381 --> 00:26:38,080
but you're just pumping your own brain up.
Like it's like taking caffeine.

425
00:26:38,081 --> 00:26:41,860
Does that give you a super intelligence?
No. It just makes you accelerate.

426
00:26:41,861 --> 00:26:44,430
It makes you more, you, you have
more, you know, you're, you're,

427
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:45,264
you're getting amped up.

428
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,080
If you're on a site,
it could be that.

429
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:51,670
Imagine taking a powerful psychedelic
and sitting down on your couch to watch

430
00:26:51,671 --> 00:26:54,790
your nightly Fox News and
why I want a psychedelic.

431
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:59,140
You see a Fox News reporter talk about
someone who won the medal of honor and

432
00:26:59,141 --> 00:27:04,090
the Fox News reporter says he died
fighting for our freedoms and Afghanistan.

433
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:08,650
Now maybe if you're just some diluted
alcoholic redneck in a trailer and

434
00:27:08,651 --> 00:27:11,830
somebody says, somebody died
fighting for our freedoms already.

435
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:14,710
Freedom is a very mysterious word,

436
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,620
but someone's fighting for
our freedoms and Afghanistan.

437
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,110
Maybe you can hear that and be like,
God damn it.

438
00:27:20,111 --> 00:27:22,270
I don't know how our
freedom got to Afghanistan,

439
00:27:22,271 --> 00:27:24,340
but someone needs to
protect it over there.

440
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:28,090
But if you're on a psychedelic
and you hear someone say that,

441
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:33,340
you're going to be like, wait,
hold on. What the fuck is freedom?

442
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:36,940
What is freedom? Is that something
you can even really fight for?

443
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:41,590
And Afghanistan? Wait, terrorists
are supposed to be in Afghanistan.

444
00:27:41,591 --> 00:27:45,370
You mean that's the only place you can
plan terrorist attacks and the rugged

445
00:27:45,371 --> 00:27:49,900
country of Afghanistan. You can't do
that in China, Japan, Europe, France,

446
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,240
any place where there's a hotel
room with an Internet connection.

447
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:57,580
Are you serious that we have to be over
there fighting some s Cobra commander

448
00:27:57,581 --> 00:28:02,581
when in any part of the grid you can
eat just a 12 year old with some fucking

449
00:28:02,771 --> 00:28:06,400
matches can do some pretty heavy
damage to the infrastructure man.

450
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,720
Are you seriously expecting me to believe
that soldiers are right somehow in

451
00:28:10,721 --> 00:28:14,860
Afghanistan fighting offs, some kind of
imminent threat that isn't anywhere else.

452
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:18,490
Cause if I was a terrorist and there
were a shitload of American train death

453
00:28:18,491 --> 00:28:22,090
machines in my country and I wanted to
plan a terrorist attack without getting

454
00:28:22,091 --> 00:28:26,320
interrupted by machine gun fire,
I'd probably just head somewhere else.

455
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,820
Just get on a bus and go somewhere where
I'm not going to get shot at while I

456
00:28:30,821 --> 00:28:34,300
plan my nuclear attack on
the New York subway system.

457
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:40,030
So emotional right now. Wow. I'm
sorry. I'm Sarah Pailin gave a speech.

458
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,740
You Sarah Pailin recently.

459
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,030
And in the speech she was talking about
Pat Tillman cause she was like in Pat

460
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:49,380
Tillman's town. She was
talking about Pat Tillman. Uh,

461
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,960
sacrificing his life for
our freedom and you know,

462
00:28:53,961 --> 00:28:57,830
and she actually quoted that in a speech
and it's like, it's really well known.

463
00:28:57,831 --> 00:28:58,341
Two things.

464
00:28:58,341 --> 00:29:02,210
One that Pat Tillman was
extremely disenchanted with
the military once you got

465
00:29:02,211 --> 00:29:03,920
in it and realize how disorganized it was,

466
00:29:03,921 --> 00:29:08,720
how fucking chaotic and fucked up it was
to the point where some people on the

467
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:11,930
Internet speculated that they even killed
them on purpose cause he was talking

468
00:29:11,931 --> 00:29:15,410
to them, you know, let me know.
That's probably Wacko talk.

469
00:29:15,411 --> 00:29:18,050
But it's just the fact that
he was very vocal about it.

470
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:20,810
And the second thing being he
was killed by friendly fire.

471
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:24,350
He was not killed defending the enemy
and they tried to lie about it and they

472
00:29:24,351 --> 00:29:27,830
tried to lie about it for a long time
and it eventually got out that he was

473
00:29:27,831 --> 00:29:28,880
killed by friendly fire.

474
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:31,790
But they tried to make it seem
like he died in this heroic attack.

475
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:36,170
I know he was killed by an American
and a cluster fighting for freedom.

476
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,680
It's a cluster fuck man.
These poor fucking kids, man,

477
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,070
that you imagine being 19

478
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,610
being talked into doing this shit for a
bunch of blood thirsty motherfuckers who

479
00:29:45,611 --> 00:29:47,920
just are trying to get whatever
they're trying to get over there.

480
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,480
Whatever the fuck it is, whether it's
lithium, you know, whether it's, you know,

481
00:29:52,481 --> 00:29:55,200
minerals in the mountains that
they use to make cell phones,

482
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,260
whether it's 90% plus of
the world's opium supply.

483
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,890
90 fucking percent. I mean, God dammit.

484
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,680
Heroin is absolutely
addictive. Okay? Yeah.

485
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:11,170
People who try heroin get hooked.
Heroin is everywhere. Okay,

486
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:15,340
so you need to sell it. Someone's selling
it. Who's selling it? I don't know.

487
00:30:15,341 --> 00:30:19,000
But 90% of it comes from this one place
where we have to be to save our freedoms.

488
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:23,650
Yeah. Like really? What the fuck
man? Yeah. What the fuck? And that's,

489
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,950
that's the thing, man. And that's
what's so frustrating and it's not,

490
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,690
here's the thing,
I just want to say this.

491
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:33,790
You can't criticize it because if
you criticize it, you're a shithead.

492
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,950
You don't appreciate the troops
and what they're doing for you.

493
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:37,030
And that's not the case at all.

494
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:42,280
I just don't like the idea of these
fucking people leading us in any direction

495
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:44,940
where you need to sacrifice your life.
Well,

496
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,930
I don't believe it if
I don't believe them.

497
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,490
Every time I meet anyone
who's been in the military,

498
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,700
they're authentically fucking
good people. Are you very, I've,

499
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:55,090
I have

500
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,580
yet.
I want to let someone know why.

501
00:30:56,581 --> 00:30:59,550
Because they're warriors and warriors
have discipline and the things that they

502
00:30:59,551 --> 00:31:03,900
go through. I feel the same
way. Most military guys that
I know are cool as fuck.

503
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:07,950
Yeah. Cause the, first of all, they get
broken down in training. You go through,

504
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,311
once you,

505
00:31:08,311 --> 00:31:11,910
once you go through all the fucking
physical reserve rigors of basic training.

506
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,010
Yeah. That's brutal to,
to the average person.

507
00:31:14,011 --> 00:31:17,460
And then you become a part of a group
that has a code and you feel honored to be

508
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:21,090
there and it elevates you as a human
being. Yeah. It elevates them together.

509
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:24,480
You know, it removes a lot of your ego.
You know, there's a lot of like the,

510
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,580
the regimen of the
discipline they did develop,

511
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,430
they can apply that to the rest
of their life. Like very easy.

512
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:33,990
That is why it becomes
incredibly infuriating when you,

513
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,900
they're being used against trapped in
a meat grinder for no reason for and

514
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:41,080
reasons dropping.
Like some of the coolest,

515
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,020
most fascinating brave is to rope
people in a fucking meat grinders in the

516
00:31:45,021 --> 00:31:48,580
military. Industrial Complex can
sustain itself on their blood.

517
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:52,360
Right when there's been so many fucking
lies. I mean, the more you look it up,

518
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:56,350
the more they may go go into any of
the stories on the weapons of mass

519
00:31:56,351 --> 00:31:57,990
destruction before we invaded and,

520
00:31:57,991 --> 00:32:01,360
and compare them to what we actually
know that they really knew when they said

521
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:03,430
that.
It's like they did it on purpose.

522
00:32:03,431 --> 00:32:06,370
They wanted to get in there for
whatever fucking reason. Yeah.

523
00:32:06,371 --> 00:32:09,670
And if it's some crazy, the world
is gonna end. If we don't stop this,

524
00:32:09,671 --> 00:32:12,590
but we can't tell you shit. Like
I would love to believe you. Yeah,

525
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,570
I would love to. I would love to
believe that the reason why you're a,

526
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:18,910
you're not telling us exactly what the
fuck is going on is because you're really

527
00:32:18,911 --> 00:32:22,570
protecting us from some insanely evil
thing that if we knew about it, it would,

528
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:25,420
society would collapse.
But our strong, brave,

529
00:32:25,421 --> 00:32:28,810
powerful leaders are going to
guide us without our knowledge.

530
00:32:28,811 --> 00:32:31,750
I would love to believe you if
you weren't all full of Shit,

531
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:36,130
if she weren't all getting busted left
and Ryan cheating on your wives stealing

532
00:32:36,131 --> 00:32:40,100
money, jerking off on babies at the
Bohemian Grove, you worship the owl

533
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,890
God molec he's that slow

534
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,140
having gay sex.
I mean,

535
00:32:44,141 --> 00:32:47,260
how many of these fucking guys in
the Bush administration where day,

536
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,040
how many of them did? There was a
ton of them. You know how you know?

537
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,170
Because there was a guy who
was an embedded reporter
named Jeff Gannon, right?

538
00:32:54,171 --> 00:32:58,060
Jeff Gannon ran a website
that was all dedicated to gay,

539
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:03,070
like military men. It was like military
studs would like, did have dog tags on it,

540
00:33:03,071 --> 00:33:06,250
a little towel over their cock and it
was like a gay escort service and this

541
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:09,070
fucking guy was running it.
And he was an embedded reporter.

542
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:13,000
He was in the White House throwing all
these lob questions at the pleasure of

543
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:16,990
the president. Like, when
are these Democrats going to
come to their senses, sir?

544
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:20,050
Like, like what kind of a fucking
question is that? You know,

545
00:33:20,051 --> 00:33:23,860
like that kind of Shit and me why I was
just sucking cock sleeped in the White

546
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:23,861
House,

547
00:33:23,861 --> 00:33:28,420
slept in the fucking White House and at
least one occasion like what the fuck

548
00:33:28,421 --> 00:33:29,080
man,

549
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,930
he's not, I mean it's the
funny thing about it is what,

550
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:36,490
the only thing that's surprising about
it rather it becomes extremely surprising

551
00:33:36,491 --> 00:33:39,250
according to how conditioned
you are a [inaudible].

552
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,550
And one of the first things you have
to realize in any country that you're

553
00:33:42,551 --> 00:33:46,060
living in is there some percentage of
your mind is filled with information that

554
00:33:46,061 --> 00:33:48,520
has been placed there intentionally
to make you a good citizen.

555
00:33:48,521 --> 00:33:50,030
You are conditioned.
Uh,

556
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:55,060
I just say Great National Geographic
documentary on North Korea and everyone

557
00:33:55,481 --> 00:33:58,150
should watch that. It's on
Netflix instead of view. Watch it.

558
00:33:58,151 --> 00:34:01,150
And the reason you should watch it is
because you get a very extreme case of

559
00:34:01,151 --> 00:34:04,240
conditioning. And the way these
people act. And uh, you know,

560
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:07,080
it's basically the way they got
in there as they followed. Uh,

561
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:12,250
a doctor was removing cataracts,
uh, of North Koreans and um,

562
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:16,610
they told them that the camera crew was
there just to monitor the, all right,

563
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:21,520
what he's doing, they didn't tell North
Korea it was national geographic. So they,

564
00:34:21,521 --> 00:34:25,390
you know, at the end of the thing that
people who can see stand up in this room,

565
00:34:25,391 --> 00:34:28,150
they're pulling the bandages
off their eyes and they can see.

566
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:31,120
And the first thing they do, they don't
think the doctor that helped them,

567
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:35,110
they stand up. There's a picture of
Kim Jong Il and they go, oh, thank you,

568
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,120
great heater.

569
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:40,960
I will work five times harder
in the salt mines for you.

570
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:45,940
It's, yeah, I saw them say
that. It's true. That's real.
That's the conditioning.

571
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:49,660
That's conditioning. And it's, if
you think as an American citizen,

572
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:53,200
you don't have some of that in your
fucking brain. You're out of your mind.

573
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,860
You're conditioned. We all are in
it. Because when you're growing up,

574
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,040
that's what they do. What do you do? Use.

575
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,320
And it's also that we would
like to believe that there
is some sort of a higher

576
00:35:01,321 --> 00:35:01,831
ideal.

577
00:35:01,831 --> 00:35:04,860
We would like to believe that America
is something that's above everything and

578
00:35:04,861 --> 00:35:06,180
we are noble and brave.

579
00:35:06,181 --> 00:35:09,180
We do do the right things and we are the
police force for the world because we

580
00:35:09,181 --> 00:35:11,270
are the only good Christian nation that,
you know,

581
00:35:11,271 --> 00:35:14,860
is here to support the right values.
Yes, we have. Everyone's good in mind.

582
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:18,120
The conditioning. Yeah. I mean, but
there's a lot of pride behind that.

583
00:35:18,121 --> 00:35:21,480
It's like it's, it's similar to
the idea of being in the military.

584
00:35:21,481 --> 00:35:24,930
It's like you're a part of
something bigger and greater
and more noble condition.

585
00:35:24,931 --> 00:35:27,690
And so the whole, that's like military
is like the highest level of that.

586
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:29,370
And then being a proud citizen,

587
00:35:29,371 --> 00:35:33,180
it's just just slightly below them and
that's all. But it's also an ideal,

588
00:35:33,181 --> 00:35:36,030
I mean it's also like it is
conditioning, but it's also like, wow,

589
00:35:36,031 --> 00:35:37,260
wouldn't it be ideal?

590
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:42,300
We all did have a moral code that was
like really responsible and we were really

591
00:35:42,301 --> 00:35:45,630
cool to each other and we were really
disciplined and we did the right thing.

592
00:35:45,631 --> 00:35:49,540
And we didn't, you know, I mean if
the codes, you know, it'd be the,

593
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:52,590
they exist on paper so that
they are an ideal, right?

594
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,620
So if we're all proud of that ideal
and we subscribed to that ideal,

595
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,000
that does kind of elevate us.

596
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,730
Well. I think that, um,

597
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:01,950
it's, I think it's better. I honestly,
I do think it's conditioning,

598
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:06,000
but I do think that framework of
conditioning is better than a wild,

599
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:07,020
like free for all.

600
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,670
The thing is not that the, I mean I
think that if you look at a beehive,

601
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,820
there's conditioning happening
with Carmen's from the queen.

602
00:36:13,821 --> 00:36:17,890
I was around the Bi to be,
it's not to say that like, uh,

603
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:22,900
we should allow society to fragment
into like individual units that are all

604
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:28,110
running around screaming that there is
nothing to believe in. It's just, uh,

605
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:32,590
the idea is that yeah, of
course, man at the, the eye,

606
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:37,400
the human ideal. The ideal of making
sure that, you know, if you hear it,

607
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:41,840
if you hear about life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness,

608
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:46,970
if you really think about that ideal, the
pursuit of happiness, life, your health,

609
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:51,620
and being healthy and being able
to evolve and be strong, liberty,

610
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,920
your freedom, your ability to do
whatever you want and to do that,

611
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:59,090
to pursue whatever happiness that you
want with that liberty, that's amazing.

612
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:03,320
If this country really stood up for those
ideals and people were really fighting

613
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:06,920
for those ideals, we will be in
some kind of like techno utopia.

614
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:11,960
There'd be Cordova milk bars and masculine
cocktails that you could drink and

615
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:15,350
perfectly, perfectly, uh, uh,

616
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,740
engineered pharmaceuticals
to enhance your intelligence.

617
00:37:18,741 --> 00:37:20,540
Because in the 60s,

618
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:23,960
they didn't cut off all research on
psychedelics and they would have made the

619
00:37:23,961 --> 00:37:27,590
leap into really why it was working and
why it helps people who are depressed,

620
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:30,860
why it helps people who are alcoholics
white helps people who are dying.

621
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,190
They wouldn't have gone underground and
we would have so much more research,

622
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:37,910
but the very fact that psychedelics
are illegal marijuana is illegal.

623
00:37:37,911 --> 00:37:42,470
The very fact that the, that we are
not allowed to put into our body.

624
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:46,820
Anything that we want shows us that
those ideas that you're talking about are

625
00:37:46,821 --> 00:37:48,710
not being upheld but suppressed

626
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:53,300
right now.
What's behind that meets the man man.

627
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,330
What is the machine behind it?
How does it happen?

628
00:37:56,870 --> 00:38:01,870
How is it in the same situation today as
it was in 1970 with all the information

629
00:38:02,091 --> 00:38:05,270
that we have, you would think that 40
years would go by. Well that's ridiculous.

630
00:38:05,271 --> 00:38:08,450
That's a long ass time with all
this information that we have.

631
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:11,780
There's so much work that needs to be
cleaned up and there's so many assumptions

632
00:38:11,781 --> 00:38:15,230
that we had made in the past about so
many different things in our society that

633
00:38:15,231 --> 00:38:18,290
we have found through the age
of the Internet to be not true.

634
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,310
And one of them is everyone can access
marijuana studies. Now, when I was a kid,

635
00:38:22,311 --> 00:38:25,340
I thought marijuana gave you brain damage.
I heard all kinds of crazy shit.

636
00:38:25,341 --> 00:38:27,800
I thought for sure you could probably
die from marijuana. You know,

637
00:38:27,801 --> 00:38:30,800
you can o d on it, you know, there
was so much misinformation. Yeah.

638
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:35,220
But now we know now it's all very clear
now it's everywhere online kind of. He,

639
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:39,640
the only way we can trust the government
is if you amend shit when the shit that

640
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:43,800
doesn't make sense anymore
is inapplicable. You know,
the, the, the, the, the,

641
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:47,380
these drug laws that were put into place
when people didn't have the Internet

642
00:38:47,381 --> 00:38:51,370
where you couldn't go research all the
positive benefits of siliciden mushrooms,

643
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,320
how many people have quit,
you know,

644
00:38:53,321 --> 00:38:57,340
like really like they've had like
people that were like lifelong cigarette

645
00:38:57,341 --> 00:38:59,910
smokers, one cigarette,
you know, uh, they,

646
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,650
they are one mushroom trip rather and
they never smoked a cigarette again.

647
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,320
They realize like what the fuck
they're doing to their body.

648
00:39:05,321 --> 00:39:07,570
They think about the whole situation,
how ridiculous it is,

649
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,540
how they get sucked into it and they
never smoke another cigarette ever again.

650
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,510
There's nothing that has that kind
of success rate like Ibogaine.

651
00:39:13,511 --> 00:39:16,660
It's another one that's
another psychedelic that
does that. Heroin addicts,

652
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,270
people who get hooked on pills,
they go and do it. Bam. They,

653
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,270
they completely dropped their addiction.

654
00:39:22,271 --> 00:39:25,240
Have a totally different way
of looking at life. Well, yeah,

655
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,630
cause it's a blue stopping it.
How does it get stopped?

656
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,550
It's a, um, I mean,

657
00:39:30,551 --> 00:39:35,551
I think a Terence Mckenna sums it up by
talking about the dominator culture and

658
00:39:37,361 --> 00:39:40,120
the partnership. Uh, but it's gone

659
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:43,800
ignorance on the part of the people
that are in the position of power.

660
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:47,910
It must be ignorant as to the effects of
the psychedelics because if it wasn't,

661
00:39:47,911 --> 00:39:48,900
and they were doing them,

662
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,350
if they were doing it and they knew how
powerful psychedelics are for elevating

663
00:39:52,351 --> 00:39:53,041
your consciousness,

664
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:55,830
if they knew that there's all this
potential that you could take it in a

665
00:39:55,831 --> 00:39:59,220
shamonic fashion if you were,
if you do it intelligently and you do it,

666
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,430
it's like a massive vehicle for,
for human growth.

667
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:06,030
If they didn't know this or I,
then they're, they're acting on,

668
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,820
they're acting on ignorance because
if they were experiencing it,

669
00:40:08,821 --> 00:40:12,030
if they were doing this, they would
change everything. They change everything.

670
00:40:12,031 --> 00:40:12,930
I firmly,

671
00:40:12,931 --> 00:40:17,430
absolutely believe that of all the people
in charge were doing like weekly and

672
00:40:17,431 --> 00:40:21,700
monthly mushroom rituals,
they would completely rethink every fat,

673
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:25,530
everything. So you know, they're not doing
it right. They're not. So they're key.

674
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,340
Whoever is in charge of Cape, me
keeping things on the schedule one list,

675
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,340
you know,
whoever is the person who informs the Dea,

676
00:40:32,341 --> 00:40:35,520
like there's these are things we want to
concentrate on. This is, you know, blah,

677
00:40:35,521 --> 00:40:37,010
blah, blah, chase after
this, go after that.

678
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,700
Whoever's doing that
clearly isn't experiencing

679
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:42,120
follow the money.
That's how you find out who's doing it,

680
00:40:42,121 --> 00:40:45,000
that people are doing it are the people
who make money enforcing the law. Right.

681
00:40:45,001 --> 00:40:48,690
But my point is we need to get
those people on mushrooms. Well,

682
00:40:48,691 --> 00:40:51,210
that's really what needs to happen.
Yeah. I mean, that sounds crazy,

683
00:40:51,211 --> 00:40:54,960
but that might be the way to fix the world
as a way to fix the world might be to

684
00:40:54,961 --> 00:40:58,200
get all the leaders on mushrooms. I
think that I, I've thought about this,

685
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,930
fuck yeah. For Real. It sounds like Hokey,

686
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:04,500
16 year old parking lot
bullshit. Yeah, man,

687
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:09,250
we need to [inaudible] mushrooms,
Bro. But it's not just,

688
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:13,890
it's not just a really, I mean, how much
is mushrooms helped you? Yeah, but I,

689
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:16,560
I don't, I think I would've been fine
if I didn't have my showrooms. You know,

690
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:19,920
you're not fine now kid, you
know? But seriously, like, yeah,

691
00:41:19,921 --> 00:41:23,580
I think I like the wet mushrooms
did to me, but if I didn't do it,

692
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:25,710
I don't think I'll be
fucking like freaked out.

693
00:41:25,711 --> 00:41:30,470
My drawings just wouldn't be as good,
you know? Oh, I think you're discrediting

694
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,160
the information that you get when you have
a good trip. When you have a good trip

695
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,700
and you come back, you're like, Oh
God, I'm such an idiot. You come back.

696
00:41:37,701 --> 00:41:40,050
You're like, wow. Yeah, so
humbled. You know? I'm just like,

697
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:43,580
I was thinking so foolishly and
now I see it all. It's like, why?

698
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:47,770
Why wasn't it here to me before? It's
like I was just out of my grasp and yeah,

699
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,370
I have this elevated,
uh,

700
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:52,880
point of view and it lasts as long
as you can hold onto those ideals.

701
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:55,550
It's like as time goes
on in between trips,

702
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:59,030
they slowly became more and
more ether all, you know,

703
00:41:59,031 --> 00:42:03,690
they slowly became more missed. Like you
can't quite grasp onto that feeling of,

704
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,740
of being connected. It's like,
you're like, Huh, it's running out.

705
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:11,330
You're going to have to go in there
again. Is there a library card? Yeah.

706
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:15,810
Go into the store to store
your store settings. Yeah.

707
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:20,730
And, and, and, and I think that, um, what
you're talking about is absolutely true.

708
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,610
And I was thinking like,
you know what,

709
00:42:23,611 --> 00:42:28,611
if somebody engineered a virus that
somehow was like gap gave people a

710
00:42:30,661 --> 00:42:34,200
psychedelic experience that was
contagious, that if you sneeze,

711
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:39,590
the person you sneeze on is going to trip
out so that there's sort of like wave

712
00:42:39,781 --> 00:42:44,250
of people tripping from some
kind of bizarre new virus
spread across the country

713
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:48,450
and, and induce the state that you're
talking about. It's gotta be possible.

714
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,760
That's, look, I think, you know, like if,

715
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:53,870
if animals can spray toxins
out and kill you. Yeah.

716
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:59,060
And animals also excrete
psychedelic compounds like
toads that have five Meo DMT

717
00:42:59,581 --> 00:43:02,640
on their back. Right. They secrete
it, you know, if that's possible.

718
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:05,610
So we know they can spit and we know
that they can screen psychedelics.

719
00:43:05,611 --> 00:43:07,490
Well sure they can spit psychedelics at.
Yeah.

720
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,110
That would be nuts,
man.

721
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:14,130
A fucking frog that just jumps in front
of you and crazy and makes you trip out.

722
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:18,960
Could you imagine mood ITTO the dad
too. It just hops on you. It's a frog.

723
00:43:18,961 --> 00:43:21,930
Like you're chilling with your boys.
You guys are like having lunch and shit,

724
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:25,980
fishing, whatever, and all of a sudden the
frog jumps on you or you're like, dude,

725
00:43:25,981 --> 00:43:30,870
he got zapped in the kid's like gone for
like five hours to doon doon doon dude.

726
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:32,370
Do you remember what town?

727
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,190
Do you remember when aids first came
out and there was that whole thing with

728
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:38,960
miskitos having aids blood. You
remember that there was like, oh no,

729
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:42,310
the eighth mosquitoes I
do. Yeah, it's true. Right

730
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:46,860
work and be like, dude, I got zapped
by a trip and frog. I can't come

731
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:50,630
repping [inaudible] you'd have
to have your mom calling for you.

732
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:52,910
You wouldn't be able to
pick up the phone man.

733
00:43:52,911 --> 00:43:54,560
You'd be wrestling with that thing.
You know what?

734
00:43:54,561 --> 00:43:59,120
I figured that the frogs Jack
to the frogs have like a smile.

735
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:04,120
They're like a smiley frowny face.
It just jumped patio [inaudible] came.

736
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:07,330
Don't, don't, don't you always hear
that? Seems like you don't know.

737
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:10,820
Can we do and do you find yourself
falling into the fucking die?

738
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:15,320
That's what it's Chirp would be. It
would be that song if I did it. Yeah.

739
00:44:15,321 --> 00:44:19,610
You hear about in the field.
Ah, been waiting so long.

740
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,100
They get fucking sing in the car.
Your grandma gets hit with it once.

741
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:29,480
Who Scrambles Song? Where's the song
coming from? God, that was great.

742
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,860
I'm go, what the fuck man. I'm hearing
singing that you hearing that jump up.

743
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,130
Oh Dude, I have an important
man. Don't, don't, don't,

744
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:45,090
don't tell me.
Yeah man.

745
00:44:45,091 --> 00:44:48,930
For sure. That's possible for sure. That
happened to me know. I was thinking,

746
00:44:48,931 --> 00:44:50,940
this is a weird thing that I
was thinking the other day.

747
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:56,040
What was life like before
eyesight was invented? Okay.

748
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:58,140
Because there was life before ice,
right?

749
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,710
The first life was like single celled
organisms. Yeah. And then it, you know,

750
00:45:01,711 --> 00:45:05,870
they started combining and mutating. Yeah.
And then eventually they picked up the,

751
00:45:05,871 --> 00:45:10,871
the ability to see how fucking insane
most of the world been when there was no

752
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:15,060
eyesight. Yes. Something
that someone developed that,

753
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,800
but stop and think
about that for a second.

754
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,520
Organisms developed this
ability to see things, right.

755
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:23,910
To recognize the space in front of them.
If we didn't have that,

756
00:45:23,911 --> 00:45:28,400
if no organisms had that, yeah. This
would never have taken place. Right. The,

757
00:45:28,401 --> 00:45:31,440
the evolution of human beings,
the ability to do what we do,

758
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:33,310
we have to be able to see
things and touch things. Sure.

759
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:36,110
You falling in a forest did it
really fall? If no one has solid,

760
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:40,770
you know what I'm saying is what if
there's other senses that we easily could

761
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:44,100
develop just like eyesight. They just
haven't gotten here yet. Yeah. Yeah.

762
00:45:44,101 --> 00:45:46,980
That's it. That's totally, yeah.
I mean, if we're, we're okay.

763
00:45:46,981 --> 00:45:50,850
The idea is we'd like to think that we're
the most evolved things ever because

764
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:53,010
we are for earth,
we're the most of all things,

765
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:56,970
but we're not as evolved as we're
gonna get. Okay. If like if you,

766
00:45:56,971 --> 00:46:01,680
if there seems to be, if you look
at like the way life has evolved,

767
00:46:01,681 --> 00:46:06,420
just seems to be things just keep getting
more and more complicated and seem

768
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,450
like there's like it gets
like accelerates, right? Yeah.

769
00:46:09,451 --> 00:46:12,660
And whether or not you believe that
there is some sort of a magic man who

770
00:46:12,661 --> 00:46:17,300
created the whole world or some sort
of a, an all knowing, you know, uh,

771
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:21,710
intelligent design entity
that's, you know, and you know,

772
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,820
non visual.
That's a part of everything.

773
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,450
Whether or not you believe in any
of that stuff. I mean you, you,

774
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,590
you still have to look at the
whole picture and go there. It's a,

775
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,620
it's a very strange existence,
you know?

776
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:32,860
Yeah.
And you know,

777
00:46:32,861 --> 00:46:37,861
what was weird is back in the primordial
past when blind things were wandering

778
00:46:37,901 --> 00:46:40,510
around, you could have three keys,
we can be a bunch of other shit.

779
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:43,870
They could talk that blind things
back then if they could talk.

780
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:48,340
And the ones that just started to see
looked around and they were like a John,

781
00:46:48,341 --> 00:46:49,930
I don't want to sound crazy man,

782
00:46:49,931 --> 00:46:53,950
but we're surrounded by water and
what appears if he coral reefs, like,

783
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:56,680
what's fucking wrong with you,
man? Larry went insane. Juniors,

784
00:46:56,681 --> 00:47:00,220
nonsense dog about the coral reefs
in the water would fucking idiot.

785
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:01,960
It's the same thing now.

786
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:05,770
People start having these
visionary experiences and
they're like, you know what?

787
00:47:05,771 --> 00:47:09,610
I think we might be surrounded by a
matrix of infinite intelligence that likes

788
00:47:09,611 --> 00:47:12,700
to personify itself in the form of extra
mentionable entities that seemed to

789
00:47:12,701 --> 00:47:17,020
look like Elvis. People are
like, dude, shut the fuck up.

790
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:21,490
You sound great. You sound
like a retard, retard.

791
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,040
Um, but you know, as we advance, you know,

792
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:29,041
maybe that is what we will begin to see
in some way without having to smoke.

793
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,040
Well,
it's gotta

794
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,680
be something next. There's
gotta be something next. I mean,

795
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:36,670
human beings evolved out of the lower
primates and the lower primates would make

796
00:47:36,671 --> 00:47:39,420
noises and gestures. And then
eventually we figured out language,

797
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:41,470
then written language,
recorded history,

798
00:47:41,471 --> 00:47:44,170
and then we evolved to where
we can communicate. Today.

799
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:47,350
It's got to keep going as to,
it's accelerating.

800
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:49,760
The changes are happening quicker
and quicker than before. Yeah,

801
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:53,560
I think you're going to eventually
get born with Bluetooth. You know,

802
00:47:53,561 --> 00:47:56,890
like your body's just going to have
some kind of robot electronic in it now.

803
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:00,310
All the signals that we send out, you
know what I mean? When you think about it,

804
00:48:00,311 --> 00:48:03,430
signals are relatively recent
in terms of human history,

805
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,820
the history of the human biology,
you know,

806
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:08,480
I mean signals have only been
around like radios for awhile,

807
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,940
a couple of hundred years
or something like that.

808
00:48:09,941 --> 00:48:10,990
Like how long has radio been around?

809
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,880
1920s wasn't really something
like that Saturdays,

810
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:17,740
but whatever it was in the 1800 yeah,

811
00:48:17,741 --> 00:48:21,790
so before that there was nothing man you
didn't know signals in the air and then

812
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:26,820
it was radio and then it was CB radio
and cell phones and satellite there

813
00:48:28,661 --> 00:48:32,440
satellite sending signals or
signals all over the fucking place.

814
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:37,420
What if we start evolving the ability to
pick up these new things called signals?

815
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:38,171
Like what have,

816
00:48:38,171 --> 00:48:41,470
the only reason why human beings needed
eyesight was because they had a climb

817
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:45,340
out of the primordial Malkin and figure
out their way around and it was easier

818
00:48:45,341 --> 00:48:47,860
to not fall off cliffs.
You can see where the fucking cliff was,

819
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:50,530
so they started to develop this
like what if that's what's going on?

820
00:48:50,531 --> 00:48:53,530
What if we are going to develop the
ability to tune into signals? No,

821
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,060
I don't think it's going to be genetic,

822
00:48:55,061 --> 00:48:58,270
but I think you're going to be able to
talk to each other without saying words

823
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,030
like the more we start getting an
advanced with computers and we're doing

824
00:49:01,031 --> 00:49:02,170
symbols and signs,

825
00:49:02,171 --> 00:49:04,990
I think pretty soon we're going to be
able to start communicating without

826
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:08,780
talking. Like kind of like I could just
sit there and like look at you in a tent.

827
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:09,940
You know what I mean?

828
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:12,970
I think that's the sense that's
DM come when you have a DMT trip.

829
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,960
That's what it feels like.

830
00:49:13,961 --> 00:49:18,730
It feels like communication without
within intent but with no words so I

831
00:49:18,731 --> 00:49:21,400
understand exactly what you're saying.
I understand.

832
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,880
I understand it more of like as a,
like a wave,

833
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:29,680
like blocks of numbers and letters is no
blocks or number of numbers and letters.

834
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:30,910
The communication is like,

835
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:34,870
it's like a very clear and
obvious wave of information.

836
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,780
That thing. Yeah, that's it. Yeah.
I know what you're talking about.

837
00:49:37,781 --> 00:49:40,810
Whatever that wave is that it'll talk to
you in your own language because that's

838
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:44,450
what you need to hear. But you realize
while this is happening a while, it's,

839
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,960
it's talking that you're,
no, that's not your job.

840
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:50,740
You're just interpreting what it's saying
and, and relaying it back into English.

841
00:49:50,741 --> 00:49:52,010
That's what you're doing.
Yeah.

842
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:55,570
Your fax machine is picking it up and
printing out and yeah. Well you just,

843
00:49:55,571 --> 00:49:58,900
you can't, it's like, remember
when you used to have um, uh,

844
00:49:58,901 --> 00:50:03,600
an emulator for windows you had back
and sort of opened up in a window? Yeah.

845
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,370
Like it was all like junky and
didn't want, that's exactly,

846
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:09,820
that's what's going on. Yeah. You can't
quite understand what they're saying.

847
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:12,190
So you have to do it through
an emulator software.

848
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:15,640
You have to like run it
through your own vocabulary,

849
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,230
but you're getting pure intent from them.
You know? That's why like when I, I saw,

850
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:24,970
um, the, one of the Times I had
this DMT trip, the DMT things,

851
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,560
um, they always, they always
say a bunch of the same things.

852
00:50:27,561 --> 00:50:31,760
So one of the things they say is relax
and don't give into astonishment.

853
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,500
And when I heard that,

854
00:50:33,501 --> 00:50:37,850
I didn't know if the reason why the
said that to me was because I had heard

855
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:41,360
Terence Mckenna say that. They said
that I didn't know. I was like, fuck,

856
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:42,710
like what is this?

857
00:50:42,711 --> 00:50:46,130
And are they saying this to me because I
knew they were going to say this to me.

858
00:50:46,131 --> 00:50:50,330
So they're like reinforcing it or is
this just something replaying in my head

859
00:50:50,331 --> 00:50:53,390
because I expected it.
Maybe it's a total hallucination,

860
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:57,680
but it seemed like what they're doing
is trying to say that they're trying to

861
00:50:57,681 --> 00:50:58,221
say that,

862
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:02,750
but they're saying it with pure intent
and you put it into the words that you

863
00:51:02,751 --> 00:51:03,584
would use.

864
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:06,870
And the words that I would use was the
words that Mckenna would you have used

865
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:11,270
[inaudible] so it's like they're saying
to you, relax and try to take this in.

866
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:13,940
But they're not using words and
they're saying, look at this.

867
00:51:13,941 --> 00:51:15,980
Like they're showing you things like that.

868
00:51:15,981 --> 00:51:19,250
Keep showing like more and more complex,
crazy images.

869
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,670
And as they're showing you these different
things, they're saying, look at this,

870
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,840
look at this. But you don't
really hear it. It's like,
you know, they're saying it,

871
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:31,760
but you don't really hear it. That's
the next shit man. Right. Pure intent.

872
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,070
Pure intent with no mouth.

873
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:37,250
Yeah. That's really good. I like that.
Cause I always, as you guys were talking,

874
00:51:37,251 --> 00:51:40,430
I was thinking about like, well yeah, I
mean I'm sure there's going to be, uh,

875
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:44,000
you know, through technology and ability
to transmit thoughts in some way.

876
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:47,930
But yeah, what you're saying is tuning
into something else, which is, uh,

877
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,690
something bigger than
like human communication.

878
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:54,440
It's tuning into what a Mackinac cause,
uh,

879
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:59,360
like the guy in my mind or like the
mind of the earth and mine of the earth,

880
00:51:59,361 --> 00:52:00,500
tuning more into that.

881
00:52:00,501 --> 00:52:05,210
And like hearing what that message
is or even more tuning into the, uh,

882
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:06,321
the,
you know,

883
00:52:06,321 --> 00:52:09,800
universal consciousness or the thing
that connects you to all things and,

884
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,040
and you know, what would be awesome,
man, and this is another part of it,

885
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:15,230
and I don't mean to keep going
back to the conditioning bro,

886
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:19,970
but it would be so awesome to be able
to have the experience you had and just

887
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:22,940
accept that it was real to not
have to go back through your head.

888
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:25,720
Well, no, I think it's important to
question whether or not it's real.

889
00:52:25,721 --> 00:52:28,660
I think it's important to question whether
or not it's just a pure hallucination.

890
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:32,030
Yeah. It's just your brain
is been dumped with a,

891
00:52:32,031 --> 00:52:33,820
an extreme amount of
chemicals that are usually,

892
00:52:33,821 --> 00:52:37,180
they're in small doses and your
brain is hit with is Overwatch.

893
00:52:37,181 --> 00:52:40,990
And because of all these synapses go
off and it creates these beautiful

894
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:44,040
hallucinations. Yeah,
it's possible. I'm not,

895
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:47,590
I'm not absolutely convinced that
what's happening when you have a DMT

896
00:52:47,591 --> 00:52:50,530
experience is that your,
you're going into an actual,

897
00:52:50,531 --> 00:52:52,780
another dimension and communicate
with actual other entities.

898
00:52:52,781 --> 00:52:54,010
I know it feels like that,

899
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:58,040
but he could be that my imagination
is on fucking hyperdrive. Yeah.

900
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:02,980
It's a possibility that you have to
consider as unlikely as it is or rather as

901
00:53:02,981 --> 00:53:06,030
unappealing as it is to me. Yeah. I
would love to think that like it's,

902
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,470
it would be way cooler if there's
a drug that your brain makes.

903
00:53:08,471 --> 00:53:11,170
It lets you talk to aliens.
Yeah. That's way cooler. Yeah.

904
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:13,160
It's possible that it's not,
that's not what's going on.

905
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,740
Your brain is just getting like walked.

906
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:17,730
But if Duncan came to you and said,
I believe my dreams,

907
00:53:17,731 --> 00:53:21,000
I think my dreams are trying to commute,
can communicate with me,

908
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:24,420
you have to at least think
that maybe that's possible too.

909
00:53:24,421 --> 00:53:25,560
That's kind of like same.

910
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,840
You know that your dreams are
trying to communicate with. Yeah.

911
00:53:27,841 --> 00:53:32,010
That's the other thing of you're a dream
master of like push things into the

912
00:53:32,011 --> 00:53:35,040
back of their mind and then in their
dreams they're trying to work out those

913
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:37,500
issues and those issues come popping up.
That's,

914
00:53:37,501 --> 00:53:39,090
that happens sometimes
people in their dreams,

915
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,430
well I have a variety of
different types of dreams.

916
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:45,330
Some dreams clearly or whatever
just happened. Like you know,

917
00:53:45,331 --> 00:53:50,331
like Glenn back is like
having a conversation with
me about a pasta because I

918
00:53:50,611 --> 00:53:54,660
ate pasta while I was watching Glenn Beck
and fell asleep. There's, there's that,

919
00:53:54,661 --> 00:53:55,770
those kinds of dreams,
right?

920
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:58,980
And then there's the other kind of
dreams and the other kinds of dreams,

921
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:02,580
if you're lucky enough to remember them,
are much bigger than that.

922
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:05,160
Like sometimes I'll wake up and I can,

923
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:09,540
it's almost like I'm waking up from a
lecture where somebody in like an almost

924
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:11,580
like monotone voice is like,

925
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:16,610
and then the true reason for loving other
people creates a unified consciousness

926
00:54:17,071 --> 00:54:19,920
that allows the furthering of the
evolution. You know, when you wake up,

927
00:54:19,921 --> 00:54:23,850
like what the fuck was that? But like I
think you're kind of like, you're sinking,

928
00:54:23,851 --> 00:54:25,470
you gotta talk more into
the microphone cause your,

929
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:28,110
your volume is all over the road.
I think you're kind of sinking.

930
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:31,170
They're pulling their iPods would just go,
fuck sorry guys.

931
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:33,660
I think I just got a little
too casual. Their fellow, my,

932
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,510
for the last time I did this podcast,
we have shitty likes last time.

933
00:54:36,511 --> 00:54:38,370
These are way better.
They pick you up way better,

934
00:54:38,371 --> 00:54:42,810
but you adjusted and moved away for the
top. I wasn't talking about the mix,

935
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:45,240
but the last,
the last time I did this podcast,

936
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:49,620
I got contacted by some of the coolest
fucking people have ever been contacted

937
00:54:49,621 --> 00:54:52,560
by an internet like mind blowing people.

938
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:57,390
Like people were sending me their art
on Facebook that was like insanely

939
00:54:57,391 --> 00:54:59,370
psychedelic and like I got real,

940
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,480
I got a flood of like the most mind
melting youtube videos of different people

941
00:55:03,481 --> 00:55:06,990
giving lectures. And one of them, and I
can't remember the guy's name, dammit,

942
00:55:06,991 --> 00:55:09,600
which isn't fair to the person who sent
it, but I wish I could remember it.

943
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:13,500
He was talking about how they're
finding out that in, in, um,

944
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:17,730
there's no such thing as empty space.
It's just filled with intelligence.

945
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:18,210
It's just,

946
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:23,210
it's condensed information in every
single quantum molecule of the universe is

947
00:55:24,031 --> 00:55:27,090
just pure information.
And like what,

948
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:30,600
what my theory is right now,
um,

949
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:32,400
is that maybe when you're getting high,

950
00:55:32,401 --> 00:55:36,270
you're tuning into that information
field and it's some kind of extra

951
00:55:36,271 --> 00:55:39,050
terrestrial and library that,
uh,

952
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:44,060
where the books transform into a words
and letters and ideas that you've

953
00:55:45,841 --> 00:55:50,130
experienced in the past because
there's no other, you know,

954
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:51,870
there's no other grammar for it.

955
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:55,260
There's no way to communicate the
information to you because it's outside

956
00:55:55,261 --> 00:55:59,310
language. It's pre language, right? So
it's shaping and according to, you know,

957
00:55:59,311 --> 00:56:03,180
for you, like you said, you Mckenna
talked about don't give into astonishment.

958
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,980
And so that's what you read or saw as
this wave of intent was coming to you.

959
00:56:07,981 --> 00:56:12,150
But to me to dismiss that wave of intent,
uh,

960
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:16,860
as a hallucination is,
and I know you're doing it speculatively,

961
00:56:16,861 --> 00:56:20,820
I think that you are,
I feel like maybe you're just saying that,

962
00:56:20,821 --> 00:56:23,980
but I think you may have made a
decision about it already. I know, you

963
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,570
know, I honestly, I have and I haven't,

964
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:29,060
I'm still open to the possibility
that this is all horse shit. Yeah.

965
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:29,920
But everything is horseshit.

966
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,830
But I absolutely believe that
there's a benefit to this horse shit.

967
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:35,740
There's a benefit to the quality
of life for the person that's,

968
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:37,210
that's done it and had the experience.

969
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,520
I think there's a benefit to
the people that are around him,

970
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:42,310
the people that he interacts with
or she interacts with that you'll,

971
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:46,000
you'll create more positive energy and
you'll have like a better base to operate

972
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:46,440
under.

973
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,630
Like the thing you said about like all
these cool people contacting you in the

974
00:56:49,631 --> 00:56:53,840
Internet. Yeah Dude, I have
so many fucking cool fans
on my message board and on,

975
00:56:53,841 --> 00:56:57,550
on Twitter. There's a lot of cool
motherfuckers out there, cool people.

976
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:00,490
And one of the things that I'm finding
when I'm talking and all these people

977
00:57:00,491 --> 00:57:02,200
that I'm running into,
like we did the, uh,

978
00:57:02,201 --> 00:57:07,180
these shows in England and
a huge percentage of the
people in the audience were

979
00:57:07,181 --> 00:57:10,390
podcast listeners. A huge
percentage. When I yelled out like,

980
00:57:10,391 --> 00:57:13,780
how many guys watch podcasts? Fuck,
they went fucking crazy. That's awesome.

981
00:57:13,781 --> 00:57:17,290
So I'm thinking, you know, wow, this
is nuts. Like this. It's so cool.

982
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:19,150
They could just download
it all over the world.

983
00:57:19,151 --> 00:57:21,370
But it's so free and open and out there.
Right.

984
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:25,330
And I was talking to this kid afterwards
and they were telling me how like

985
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,150
there's no one who talks like
this near them, you know,

986
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:31,550
they're like four for two
hours every week or you know,

987
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:33,850
if you do two of them
four hours every week,

988
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:38,290
we get to sit down and talk and listen
to people talk that we don't know anybody

989
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:42,060
like that. We don't know anybody who
just considers all the different, uh,

990
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,680
options in an argument.
And it has these weird,

991
00:57:44,681 --> 00:57:47,740
bizarre topics that they talk about
and puts themselves out there and it's

992
00:57:47,741 --> 00:57:50,380
really honest about shit like this.
And these dudes are like, dude,

993
00:57:50,381 --> 00:57:53,650
you're change in the way we look at
the whole world. And I'm like, whoa.

994
00:57:53,651 --> 00:57:54,730
I thought about that.
And I'm like,

995
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:58,680
I wish I had something like that when I
was young. I wish I had something where,

996
00:57:58,681 --> 00:58:01,150
where there was just some,
I could communicate,

997
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:04,370
basically sit and listened to people,
communicate with anyone,

998
00:58:04,371 --> 00:58:08,020
law and sit and learn. It's almost like
sitting at a table with your, your,

999
00:58:08,021 --> 00:58:11,260
your fucking, you know, you're cool
dad. And his friends, you know,

1000
00:58:11,261 --> 00:58:13,530
when you're a little kid, if
you, if you had a cool dad.

1001
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:17,380
And My stepdad was really cool guy and I
would sit around with his friends and I

1002
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:19,660
listened to them talk and I was like,
you know,

1003
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:22,780
12 or 13 and they would let me stay
up and you know, and they would,

1004
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:25,870
they would be sitting around talking and
there's all these architects and shit

1005
00:58:25,871 --> 00:58:30,460
and like really intelligent, interesting
guys. And I was like, wow. I'm like, yeah,

1006
00:58:30,461 --> 00:58:32,170
I'm kind of thinking in how they think.

1007
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:35,530
And I was like tuning into the way they
thought and it was like helping me,

1008
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:39,250
it was like helping me like see things
like a little differently than being

1009
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:42,190
around a bunch of other 12 year
olds. You know what I'm saying? Yeah.

1010
00:58:42,191 --> 00:58:45,070
I totally know what you're, so for a lot
of these people, like they're like, dude,

1011
00:58:45,071 --> 00:58:47,700
we don't know anybody like you. We don't
have anybody like you in our town over.

1012
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:50,980
Everybody's thinking inside the box and
everybody wants you to just get a good

1013
00:58:50,981 --> 00:58:51,980
job and,
and,

1014
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:55,810
and just move on and get a family and
don't consider anything to go to church to

1015
00:58:55,811 --> 00:58:58,660
be a good person. And you know, there's
a lot of people that we're talking to,

1016
00:58:58,661 --> 00:59:00,310
they're like,
they're starting to look at this thing.

1017
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:02,980
They're starting to back up and they're
starting to look up at the sky and

1018
00:59:02,981 --> 00:59:05,680
they're starting to look to the left
and look to the right and go, Whoa,

1019
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:09,790
what the fuck is this?
What is this thing we're doing here?

1020
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:14,320
Because this isn't just, we're
living life. In the beginning,

1021
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:18,880
Bob was a baby. Bob went to
high school, then college.

1022
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:21,980
He played a bit of
football before down with

1023
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,530
his lovely, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no. That's not what it is.

1024
00:59:24,531 --> 00:59:27,230
That's just some shit we made up to
make ourselves ourselves feel more

1025
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:29,720
comfortable. I mean, those
events are actually taking place.

1026
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:32,720
Probably is going to school. Bob Is,
but that doesn't mean shit. Okay?

1027
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:36,470
What really means something is we're
flying through the fucking universe.

1028
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:41,900
We are in space. We are in a
ship. It's an organic ship, right?

1029
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:45,270
We're not, we're not on the ground. Okay.
We're thinking we're on the ground now.

1030
00:59:45,271 --> 00:59:48,860
We're flying. Oh, am free to
be in space. In a space ship.

1031
00:59:48,861 --> 00:59:51,920
You're on a spaceship right now.
It's just fucking huge.

1032
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:57,020
It's a 24,000 mile across space
ship. Yeah. Okay. It's a spaceship.

1033
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:59,810
That's what it is. We're
not, we're not grounded.

1034
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,950
It's not like the universe is a
solid mass and we're sitting on it.

1035
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:07,940
We're flying.
We are right now holing,

1036
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:11,000
and we're spinning a
thousand miles an hour. Yep.

1037
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:16,060
Spinning a thousand miles around
around a massive nuclear explosion for

1038
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:19,040
work.
Fuck,

1039
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:24,500
I've got to get my blockbuster video back.
I am Meg Whitman polite.

1040
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:29,560
I am going to clean up California
with conservative thinking and values.

1041
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:33,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1042
01:00:33,271 --> 01:00:38,271
We're caught in a massive field
of time were being carried on the,

1043
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:44,110
on the river of time towards some unified
future where either we get blasted by

1044
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:48,410
a nuclear holocaust or something happens
where you all merge into the, the,

1045
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:53,060
the universe through technology or
skynet goes live or skynet goes live. Oh,

1046
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:55,610
that was fucking Japanese dolls too.

1047
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:58,640
We were talking about that before the
podcast. The Japanese doll that sings.

1048
01:00:58,641 --> 01:01:00,620
It was a new job. Oh wait,
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1049
01:01:00,621 --> 01:01:03,470
Can I make one more point about where
you're just talking about and then we'll,

1050
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:07,310
we'll talk about fucking
robots. Uh, but, uh, but, um,

1051
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:13,660
the thing that I was thinking to address
the point of like doing a podcast and

1052
01:01:14,661 --> 01:01:19,370
getting these kinds of ideas out into
the places where they might normally get,

1053
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:23,150
it's like there's two, two
points. One is this technology,

1054
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:28,460
this technology is only existed for a
very short time. Yeah. Like the 93, right.

1055
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,450
[inaudible] became accessible by them.
Yeah.

1056
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:35,180
To have the money to get this kind of
a gear together and then put it on the

1057
01:01:35,181 --> 01:01:37,770
Internet. It costs so much less
than it used to cost. Yeah.

1058
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:42,620
So anyone can create these little nodes
transmitting the information. Number two,

1059
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:47,870
this is what I was thinking. Um, there
is an idea coming, I don't know what the,

1060
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:52,040
like when Tesla had his idea
for a alternating current, uh,

1061
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:54,350
this idea came to him in a vision,
right.

1062
01:01:54,351 --> 01:01:58,250
So there's an idea coming and that idea
just transformed society and there's

1063
01:01:58,251 --> 01:02:01,970
been so many ideas like that
that transforms society.
There is an idea coming,

1064
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:06,950
I don't know what the fucking ideas, it
could be a drug, it could be a machine,

1065
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:11,000
it could be an movie. We don't know
what it is, but there's an idea coming.

1066
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:16,210
That might be the next transformative
idea in the last transformative idea that

1067
01:02:16,371 --> 01:02:19,390
finally pushes is outside of uh,
um,

1068
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:22,910
being stuck in the ego structure and
becoming part of everything else.

1069
01:02:22,911 --> 01:02:26,020
And I dunno what the fuck
it is, but um, what we're,

1070
01:02:26,021 --> 01:02:29,790
what you're doing here by like
putting information like this out in,

1071
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:32,460
anytime you put information that
goes against the conditioning,

1072
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:36,690
what you're doing is like sending out
little messages in bottles and eventually

1073
01:02:36,691 --> 01:02:41,610
one of those things might wash up on
some super intelligent person. Sure.

1074
01:02:41,611 --> 01:02:46,290
And they might open it up and be
like, wait a minute. Holy Shit. Wow.

1075
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:50,700
I just thought of whatever it is.
They're non 49.

1076
01:02:50,701 --> 01:02:54,960
The device that opens up a portal into
the future and creates the machine

1077
01:02:54,961 --> 01:02:56,040
Mckenna talked about.

1078
01:02:56,190 --> 01:03:00,690
It's like the idea of spreading this
information is to crew is still lay the

1079
01:03:00,691 --> 01:03:05,691
framework so that whatever this fucking
thing is that we all know is in the

1080
01:03:05,731 --> 01:03:09,660
works and it's a lot more
than a sweet Asian android.

1081
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:11,790
You can fuck in the mouth,
whatever this idea,

1082
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:17,760
whatever this idea is,
it's like snuck in the end.

1083
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:19,600
There's a lot of what people have to,

1084
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:22,070
people have to realize
it's not going to end did.

1085
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:25,450
The real thing is we're living our lives,
we're going through this,

1086
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:30,510
what we think is a predetermined pattern
of behavior following the same roads to

1087
01:03:30,671 --> 01:03:33,400
get to work every day and we're
thinking that it makes sense,

1088
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,060
but all the while we're doing this,
we're supporting technology.

1089
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:39,580
[inaudible] technology is developing,
developing at a far,

1090
01:03:39,581 --> 01:03:42,460
far faster rate than
our biology can process.

1091
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:45,730
You know what I've always said about
movies and songs and everything that it

1092
01:03:45,731 --> 01:03:48,320
kind of freaks me out. How
much they get to me. I call,

1093
01:03:48,321 --> 01:03:50,980
it kind of freaks me out when I see
like Avatar and I'm like this fucking

1094
01:03:50,981 --> 01:03:54,220
amazing and they're like
ropes me in and I'm like, God,

1095
01:03:54,221 --> 01:03:58,180
I want everybody to be okay. Fuck those
assholes and want to fuck up your planet.

1096
01:03:58,180 --> 01:04:01,200
And you know, you get roped into it and
then you leave like in this like, Gee,

1097
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:03,280
I just went through like a journey.
You know what I'm saying?

1098
01:04:03,281 --> 01:04:04,420
My brain and all my room,

1099
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:09,190
my reward systems got hijacked and I
went through this journey and it felt

1100
01:04:09,191 --> 01:04:12,310
really good and it felt really cool and
everything. But I was thinking about it.

1101
01:04:12,311 --> 01:04:12,790
I'm just like,

1102
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:16,420
that's one of the reasons why people are
so fucking child like and delusional.

1103
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:19,660
And it's not because there's some grand
program or that's trying to keep us in

1104
01:04:19,661 --> 01:04:22,600
line.
It's because the media itself,

1105
01:04:22,601 --> 01:04:25,300
the ability to create movies
that are super satisfying,

1106
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:28,240
the ability to create these happy endings,
that's what we want to see.

1107
01:04:28,241 --> 01:04:31,000
That's like, even though, right,
that's not what happens every day.

1108
01:04:31,001 --> 01:04:35,860
That's really what we appreciate cause
that's, that's the highest rewards ratio,

1109
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,500
you know, that we can get from,
from watching it. Performance. What,

1110
01:04:38,501 --> 01:04:43,330
we're not set up the process that we're
set up to process real events and we're

1111
01:04:43,331 --> 01:04:45,220
set up to imitate successful behavior.

1112
01:04:45,221 --> 01:04:48,520
We see the one monkey that's a bad mother
fucker that knows where the snakes are.

1113
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,550
Any beats a snake with a stick and
everybody runs away. I want to fall back.

1114
01:04:51,551 --> 01:04:53,110
Guy He rides with a fucking snakes are,

1115
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:56,610
that guy's cool and you imitate his
behavior. You whacked us the ground.

1116
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:58,120
Find out where the snakes are.
You know what I mean?

1117
01:04:58,121 --> 01:05:02,020
It's like they pick it up from the leader.
They get your information. You know, we,

1118
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:05,080
we need to think about
it that way I think.

1119
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:09,210
Yeah. So like what the information coming
from the media now is what it's like.

1120
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:13,350
If I just can't find a man to love me,

1121
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:17,920
you know what I mean? It's like how many
movies there based on some, some woman

1122
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:21,430
either having to choose between
two guys and she can't pay her.

1123
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:24,790
The marriage isn't going that well,
but she meets her or lover from the,

1124
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:28,000
it's all about where their reproductive
cycle it's are the movies are all about

1125
01:05:28,001 --> 01:05:32,380
like the, the great conclusion is
a successful reproductive cycle.

1126
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:35,290
Yeah. These, these things
hijacking our reward systems,

1127
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:38,860
these meet music and everything and,
and you know, the, the beauty of music,

1128
01:05:38,861 --> 01:05:41,980
it's like the beauty of birds chirping,
you know, get to appreciate nature.

1129
01:05:41,981 --> 01:05:45,310
It's like we have this built in beauty
of recognizing rhythm, you know,

1130
01:05:45,311 --> 01:05:47,290
thumping on things and
tapping on the ground.

1131
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:51,460
But when you hear a real song that moves
you with beautiful lyrics and fucking

1132
01:05:51,461 --> 01:05:54,610
mute like God, it changes your
whole state of consciousness. Yeah.

1133
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,370
And it just completely
hijacks your reward system.

1134
01:05:57,371 --> 01:06:00,940
And what I'm thinking is that
these things, these, these, these,

1135
01:06:00,941 --> 01:06:04,480
these things like songs and movies and
all these brilliant things that people

1136
01:06:04,481 --> 01:06:09,280
create, what they're doing
is just accelerating the
need to make cooler shit even

1137
01:06:09,281 --> 01:06:12,250
faster. It's like, here's
your award. You want to,

1138
01:06:12,251 --> 01:06:14,650
you don't want to make new technology,
make new technology.

1139
01:06:14,651 --> 01:06:18,520
And I'll give you Bluetooth image. Oh,
so bright. You give you more reward.

1140
01:06:18,521 --> 01:06:23,440
Brain juice, stuff flows down.
Make you happy. Avatar. So blue,

1141
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:28,210
look at skin gold. So high
resolution, more love,

1142
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:31,570
more love. So for that, I need
to get the latest loved thing.

1143
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:35,500
They'll ne latest lovebox Bro.
It's 90 fucking inches across each.

1144
01:06:35,501 --> 01:06:38,880
Amazing Three d you don't need
glasses. And it's like, wow,

1145
01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:40,420
they got to develop the next.
What's the next thing?

1146
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:42,790
You have to kick it to another level.
We're going Hologram folks,

1147
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:44,920
we're going Hologram. No more screens.
We don't need a fucking screen.

1148
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:47,500
What you need to do is just shut your
lights off and I'm going to have a fucking

1149
01:06:47,501 --> 01:06:49,960
play.
It's going to go on in your house.

1150
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:52,540
You're gonna just don't move
because you'll ruin the illusion.

1151
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,450
You're going to see it all take place
right in front of you. Turn to the left,

1152
01:06:55,451 --> 01:06:58,350
turned to the right. It's all
around you all the time. You know,

1153
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:01,180
they'll start off going to get right back
to theater. Yeah, they'll start it off.

1154
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:04,090
It'll be almost just like a projector
on one wall and eventually it'll be

1155
01:07:04,091 --> 01:07:08,800
immersed in reality shows. Yeah. Returns.
Well, you know, they to keep going.

1156
01:07:08,801 --> 01:07:11,990
I really like what you were saying about
hijacking. What'd you say? Hi Jackie.

1157
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:14,770
Reward system for love
and for honor and for,

1158
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:18,010
for lost and passion and
all these different things
that are set up to make sure

1159
01:07:18,011 --> 01:07:20,880
that you're successful. There's like
this, I'm sure you've seen it yet because

1160
01:07:20,890 --> 01:07:25,590
it's fucking awesome. I fluid. If you
ever seen Ferra flew, yeah, fair fluid.

1161
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,500
If you look it up,
it's so cool looking at ah,

1162
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:31,450
this kind of magnetic fluid where if
you play certain sound frequencies that

1163
01:07:31,451 --> 01:07:34,420
ferrofluid forms into these
awesome shapes and patterns.

1164
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:38,810
And there's a way you can do it
by putting a, I don't know what,

1165
01:07:38,811 --> 01:07:40,120
what the material is,

1166
01:07:40,121 --> 01:07:43,040
but if you put stuff on a speaker and
you have it set up just right and play

1167
01:07:43,041 --> 01:07:47,800
certain tones, the material we'll take
on geometric formation automatically.

1168
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:50,380
And I,
I don't know the physics behind this,

1169
01:07:50,381 --> 01:07:54,000
but I think that with your mind,
uh,

1170
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,570
what your mind does is,

1171
01:07:55,780 --> 01:08:00,780
are there certain patterns that are either
or electronic neurological interface

1172
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:05,800
of your mind temporarily takes according
to external stimuli. So, for example, uh,

1173
01:08:05,801 --> 01:08:08,710
if you see something moved from behind
you really fast, what do you do?

1174
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:11,470
You automatically turn around. You
just look, you don't think about that.

1175
01:08:11,471 --> 01:08:13,210
You don't think, you know what
I should look. You just look,

1176
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:17,360
because that stimulus is activating
something in your brain and creating an

1177
01:08:17,361 --> 01:08:21,320
automatic pattern. Like if you've
ever dropped a cup or drop something,

1178
01:08:21,321 --> 01:08:22,820
I don't know if you've done
that and you just snatch it,

1179
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:25,220
you didn't think about it. I'm like,
fuck, I'm like Spiderman. I just,

1180
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,410
how'd I do that?
I didn't think about that at all.

1181
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:30,260
That's a pattern electronic
pattern that your brain took.

1182
01:08:30,261 --> 01:08:34,370
So in the same way these movies and songs,
when you hear them,

1183
01:08:34,371 --> 01:08:39,290
they're literally causing the temporary
neurological state of your mind to take

1184
01:08:39,291 --> 01:08:42,830
these, these forms to take
on these forms. And um,

1185
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:45,110
that's very addictive, I think. You know,

1186
01:08:45,111 --> 01:08:47,600
because there's certain
of those forms that you,

1187
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:50,540
that are more enjoyable than others.
For example,

1188
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:54,500
like the form your brain takes when
you're on a beautiful woman, like,

1189
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:56,720
you know what I mean? You're,
everything shifts in your mind.

1190
01:08:56,721 --> 01:08:59,210
Suddenly everything changes.
The, the whatever it is,

1191
01:08:59,211 --> 01:09:01,580
whatever environment you're in,
you could be shitting,

1192
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:05,720
you could be sitting on a giant Turd and
a beautiful woman walks in and all of a

1193
01:09:05,721 --> 01:09:08,030
sudden things aren't quite so bad.
It's like,

1194
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:11,630
that's because your mind is the
pattern of your mind is transformed.

1195
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:15,440
And it's like, that's what
these, that's what movies are
doing. And that's what, uh,

1196
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:15,951
you know,

1197
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:18,950
I think people have gotten really good
at understanding how that primate,

1198
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:21,590
neurological geometry works
and they really get it,

1199
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:25,850
activating it in certain ways,
you know, via Fox News, you know,

1200
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:30,050
like you turn off Fox News and it's
like everything's trying to kill you.

1201
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:38,110
Yeah. Um, well for sure.

1202
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:41,590
That's one of the reasons why Fox News
is a huge problem is cause, you know,

1203
01:09:41,591 --> 01:09:45,130
propaganda. Even though it's funny, like
Fox News propaganda always makes me go,

1204
01:09:45,131 --> 01:09:46,780
well,
you have to be an idiot to believe that,

1205
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:49,820
but there's a lot of idiots out
there, you know? And you know,

1206
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,370
even though I mean look,
propaganda,

1207
01:09:51,371 --> 01:09:54,370
the real problem with it is if you're
not telling the truth and you're in

1208
01:09:54,371 --> 01:09:57,220
control, the media, that's a
giant responsibility. Sure you've,

1209
01:09:57,221 --> 01:09:58,330
you've done some horrible,

1210
01:09:58,331 --> 01:10:02,920
horrible disservice to mankind
because you're broadcasting confusion.

1211
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,950
You're fucking things up. Even
little fuck ups. They do, like,

1212
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,360
we've talked about this before,

1213
01:10:07,361 --> 01:10:11,320
where whenever a politician gets
busted for a sex crime, anything crazy,

1214
01:10:11,321 --> 01:10:15,520
sexual hookers, whatever, there's
always a d next to his name.

1215
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:17,530
It doesn't matter if he's
a republican or not on Fox,

1216
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:21,790
they put d right next to his name.
Right. And then if you ask them, oh,

1217
01:10:21,791 --> 01:10:24,130
it was just a slip up, but
you know, something like that,

1218
01:10:24,131 --> 01:10:28,120
we just assumed it was a democrat.
Yeah, it's a joke. They make a joke.

1219
01:10:28,121 --> 01:10:29,620
I make a joke out of it.
But meanwhile,

1220
01:10:29,621 --> 01:10:32,770
what they're doing is they're causing a
lot of people who may be on the fence,

1221
01:10:33,010 --> 01:10:36,760
you know, to go one way or
another. So whatever. I mean,
whether or not it matters,

1222
01:10:36,790 --> 01:10:37,510
you know?

1223
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:41,200
No, I mean, it matters because the real
thing that Fox is doing, I mean, I,

1224
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:42,550
it's not like fun,
I don't think.

1225
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:46,240
I think part of Fox is disseminate
conservatives conservative ideals,

1226
01:10:46,241 --> 01:10:49,510
but really it's like you
want to understand Fox,
don't watch their reporters,

1227
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:54,220
watch the commercials in
between and that'll teach
you everything about Fox News

1228
01:10:54,221 --> 01:10:58,060
because it's like they're selling
geriatric diapers. Maybe have seen that.

1229
01:10:58,061 --> 01:11:00,150
The one fucking commercial that's like,
uh,

1230
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:04,420
shows like some happy old lady driving
around a moped and our living room and

1231
01:11:04,421 --> 01:11:07,190
they're like, you could have
one of these for free. I can't,

1232
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:11,860
that's not fights.
Not Young people listening to Fox.

1233
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:14,340
It's just old in geriatrics

1234
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:19,080
and their living rooms on their mopeds
to two fucking steps away from death bill

1235
01:11:19,081 --> 01:11:21,660
O'Reilly to give them the
real deal and keep them safe.

1236
01:11:21,661 --> 01:11:26,450
If he's telling the truth,
he's fine. He's, I love bill
O'Reilly. Oh, poor Mitzia.

1237
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:28,120
She would just,
she would fucking watch.

1238
01:11:28,121 --> 01:11:31,070
She would watch that and that and if we
all tried to get her to stop because was

1239
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:35,680
always about helping her mental state,
but it's like, dude, I watch terrace. Ah,

1240
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:38,910
they're going to get us off. I
used to watch, I watched that.

1241
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:42,000
I still watch a fucking Glenn Beck,
ironically.

1242
01:11:42,001 --> 01:11:46,530
But if you interesting to watch every
now and then because it's sometimes I

1243
01:11:46,531 --> 01:11:48,750
agree with him 30% no,

1244
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:52,770
sometimes he makes good points and
then he wraps him up in nonsense.

1245
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:56,490
Then you know, oh, then you go,
this guy's just an actor. Yes.

1246
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,290
He's like putting on an
act like what he's doing.

1247
01:11:58,290 --> 01:12:01,590
He's developed this conservative act.
He used to be on a morning zoo.

1248
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:02,280
You know what I mean?

1249
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,440
And I think maybe he believes
some of the stuff that he says,

1250
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:08,190
but there's a lot of what
he's doing. That's the atrics.
Oh, that's Sarah Pailin.

1251
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:10,200
Shit man.
He's a nut dude.

1252
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:12,150
When he had Sarah Palin who
was interviewing her saying,

1253
01:12:12,151 --> 01:12:15,870
she might be the only hope for this
country. Oh, sorry. What did you just do?

1254
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,370
We could die like people.

1255
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:20,460
It's almost like he decided he was
going to make it so ridiculous.

1256
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:22,770
Let's see if we can pull this off.
Like they probably had an argument,

1257
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:26,610
like don't say that, man. If you say that
she's the only hope for this country,

1258
01:12:26,611 --> 01:12:29,610
everybody's going to know you're, you're
fucking with her. I think I can do it.

1259
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:33,960
I think I'm sincere enough.
Ah, he is a God damn,

1260
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:37,530
that guy snaps next.
I don't know whose or when,

1261
01:12:37,531 --> 01:12:41,100
but late at night guys snaps
you. Oh, you're so strange.

1262
01:12:41,101 --> 01:12:45,960
He works all the time too. He doesn't
just do his TV show, which he does that.

1263
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:50,250
He also writes like a book
every two months and he also
goes on tour and he does

1264
01:12:50,251 --> 01:12:53,580
like live performances and he
was doing comedy for a while.

1265
01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:57,160
He was doing like the Glenn Beck like
live comedy performance thing where you

1266
01:12:57,161 --> 01:13:00,940
would talk about who crazy
government and he would do like,

1267
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:03,780
like a live sort of a stand up thing.
But that didn't go so well.

1268
01:13:03,781 --> 01:13:06,600
So now he just gives like these
kind of like live speeches.

1269
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:11,520
So the motherfuckers just like raking in
money. He's obsessed, he's making bank.

1270
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:15,120
But if you've seen that, I don't know
when this was, it was recently released,

1271
01:13:15,121 --> 01:13:19,110
it was from his podcast and he's got some
kind of sickness and I don't know what

1272
01:13:19,111 --> 01:13:22,640
the thickness is, but he's crazy.
He broke it heart. It's crazy.

1273
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:24,750
Quickly broken,
hurt.

1274
01:13:24,990 --> 01:13:28,850
He's telling his flock about this sickness
and it'd be so sweet of Glenn Beck

1275
01:13:28,851 --> 01:13:32,210
cod boats getting stuck sucked. Of
course it's going to happen. Oh,

1276
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:35,040
well you know what though? He's
not a perfect guy. He admits it.

1277
01:13:35,041 --> 01:13:37,350
He had done drugs and drank and stuff.

1278
01:13:37,351 --> 01:13:39,180
Didn't he like had a problem with
booze or something like that?

1279
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:42,660
Well that's the thing that televangelists
always say when they get caught with

1280
01:13:42,661 --> 01:13:46,590
that with getting their dick sucked.
But like that, that black televangelist,

1281
01:13:46,591 --> 01:13:51,330
when they're asking these logs, Keisha
did you or did, did you whatever.

1282
01:13:51,331 --> 01:13:54,810
And he's like, what was he saying? What
did he say? He said, um, he's like,

1283
01:13:54,811 --> 01:13:59,130
none of us are perfect. That
means yes, that means you, well,

1284
01:13:59,131 --> 01:14:02,790
there's a lot of evidence. Apparently
he's fucked Eddie Long. That guy. Yeah.

1285
01:14:02,850 --> 01:14:06,270
Evidence is that anytime anybody goes
to a bunch of people saying it too,

1286
01:14:06,271 --> 01:14:10,170
it's not just one person any long
his name as the fucking evidence.

1287
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:16,110
It's not going to log. That totally got
pimples from Oakland and he would sell.

1288
01:14:16,111 --> 01:14:20,810
I go fucking minister. Weird Shit.
Like lick their face and oh no,

1289
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:21,950
weird.
He's like,

1290
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:25,600
he's like in a hotel room with some young
kid who thinks he's a messenger of God

1291
01:14:25,601 --> 01:14:27,980
and he's like, look, your face Giamo,

1292
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:34,320
I just like licking your lips of
Moses used to the lips of sheep.

1293
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:36,071
There was,
it was.

1294
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:39,390
It's a Christian thing to lick the
lips of someone who loves here.

1295
01:14:41,470 --> 01:14:46,020
Brian ruining the whole erotic cap.
My husband etic atmosphere.

1296
01:14:46,021 --> 01:14:47,090
Just strange moaning.

1297
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:54,490
Parliament starts playing.
He puts his Bible down.

1298
01:14:54,491 --> 01:14:58,990
I'm Simpson's Pan is like
the biggest travesty. Yeah,

1299
01:14:59,030 --> 01:15:02,950
the the the biggest like
crime against humanity.

1300
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:08,290
The idea that you can take children and
pretend that you're religious and fuck

1301
01:15:08,291 --> 01:15:13,180
them. Yeah. That's the, that's
the, that's definitely getting,

1302
01:15:13,181 --> 01:15:14,520
I mean that might be one.
I mean,

1303
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:17,590
but besides murder and rape and all the
other horrible things that people do.

1304
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:21,520
Yeah. That's one that's really
underlooked you really ruined a life.

1305
01:15:21,790 --> 01:15:24,700
How the fuck you going to get
over the fact that big fat,

1306
01:15:24,701 --> 01:15:28,390
sweaty guy who smells like your
car just fucked you in the ass.

1307
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:32,130
He smells like Dzhokhar and barbecue
sauce and it just fucked you there.

1308
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:36,160
Not only that, but don't forget that
this man is a representative of Jesus.

1309
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:40,010
When your mind is the greatest person
on the planet. So the, it's, it's like,

1310
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:43,750
it's like someone's assistant
molesting you and you're like, Oh God,

1311
01:15:43,751 --> 01:15:44,830
they must be bad too.

1312
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:49,860
He smells like Jerry curl juice and
communion wafers as loads smell the Viagra

1313
01:15:52,571 --> 01:15:56,590
on his breath.
Eight like 20 them in between ceremony.

1314
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:59,560
Red Table wine is all about
fucking people's kids.

1315
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:05,820
God Damn, that's crazy thing. It's
amazing that one priest could get allowed,

1316
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:09,550
would be no one priest comes
out and does that. And you know,

1317
01:16:09,551 --> 01:16:13,290
and people should be like, well that's
just one guy's just fucked up and yeah,

1318
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:16,390
it's understandable. This guy is just,
he's, you know, we didn't see it coming.

1319
01:16:16,391 --> 01:16:19,840
It's crazy. But if you've got like
hundreds of thousands of cases,

1320
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:21,250
like all over the world,

1321
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:26,560
like at what point in time does everybody
step in and start like thoroughly

1322
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:30,490
investigating churches, like having
like security there at all times.

1323
01:16:30,491 --> 01:16:33,970
Having cops there at all times
looking for inappropriate shit.

1324
01:16:33,971 --> 01:16:37,090
Like this is a scene of a crime.
How many crimes had been committed here?

1325
01:16:37,091 --> 01:16:37,924
Who knows these,

1326
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:40,690
we've got a hundred kids saying that
someone made them suck the deck.

1327
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:44,320
Just to put it in context with, oh,
that's a crime scene. God dammit.

1328
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:48,850
Let's imagine that Kmart for example,
now let's say Walmart, let's say Walmart,

1329
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:53,680
all of a sudden word got out that all
these Walmarts all across the country,

1330
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:56,920
the manager was fucking little kids.
It would be what,

1331
01:16:56,921 --> 01:17:00,130
one week before the government to send
it on all the Walmarts. There we go.

1332
01:17:00,131 --> 01:17:02,440
What is this? Well, it turns
out ladies and gentlemen,

1333
01:17:02,441 --> 01:17:05,950
what we had here was a pedophile
ring disguised as a business.

1334
01:17:05,951 --> 01:17:09,260
There was actually a Typo in
the training manual that to

1335
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:14,480
for whatever it is like you wouldn't,
you wouldn't,

1336
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:19,070
you would investigate that
because the Catholic church
is so powerful. Uh, no one,

1337
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:21,950
no one's fucking with it. No one's
fucking with it. And that's the,

1338
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:23,210
that's kind of the problem.

1339
01:17:23,211 --> 01:17:28,211
And the Goddamn primate hive is we are
not good at dealing with obvious truths.

1340
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:32,480
We're not good at addressing things
and it just want to correct. Yeah,

1341
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:36,670
establish a new viewpoint. That's,
that's one thing we don't want to do.

1342
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:37,970
Once we have opinions on things,

1343
01:17:38,210 --> 01:17:41,420
very difficult to get someone who really
just abandoned that opinion and then

1344
01:17:41,421 --> 01:17:44,870
recognize the opinion as wrong and
then move on. Very hard for us to do.

1345
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:47,180
And that's one of the,
one of the reasons as primates,

1346
01:17:47,181 --> 01:17:50,450
we get stuck in certain types of behavior
because it's comforting, you know,

1347
01:17:50,451 --> 01:17:51,950
instead of just being alone on your own,

1348
01:17:51,951 --> 01:17:54,320
not knowing whether or not you're doing
the right thing or the wrong thing in

1349
01:17:54,321 --> 01:17:57,680
life, you know, you're just literally
working around on guesswork instead,

1350
01:17:57,681 --> 01:17:59,690
you know, you have a confidence in, well,

1351
01:17:59,691 --> 01:18:03,140
I've always done it this way and this is
how I am and this is right and fuck the

1352
01:18:03,141 --> 01:18:03,974
terrorists.

1353
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:06,650
Now we've got to fight them over there so
we don't fight him over here. You know,

1354
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:07,500
and you know,
you,

1355
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:09,860
you have these things and you don't want
to let those things go because you've

1356
01:18:09,861 --> 01:18:12,260
argued for those things forever.
Like,

1357
01:18:12,261 --> 01:18:17,261
have you ever seen the documentary on the
Sphinx where I'm doctor Robert Schoch,

1358
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:21,680
he's from the Boston University, Boston
University, I think, or University of, uh,

1359
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:25,370
one of the mass, either University of
Massachusetts. No, no, no. It's Boston.

1360
01:18:25,371 --> 01:18:28,010
I think it's boss, maybe
Boston College. Anyway, um,

1361
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:31,850
very well respected geologists goes
to Egypt, looks at the Sphinx. Okay.

1362
01:18:31,851 --> 01:18:36,130
And notices that there's all this erosion
on the Sphinx and on the Sphinx and

1363
01:18:36,131 --> 01:18:41,060
closure that can only be attributed to
rainfall for thousands of years. Well,

1364
01:18:41,061 --> 01:18:44,210
the only problem is the last time
they had rainfall and the Nile Valley,

1365
01:18:44,211 --> 01:18:47,990
it was 7,000 BC. So
it's was like, you know,

1366
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:49,670
that's like 9,000 years ago.

1367
01:18:49,671 --> 01:18:53,300
So that predates where they thought the
construction of the pyramids sat in,

1368
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:57,470
buy something somewhere around 5,000
years. That's like impossible. I mean,

1369
01:18:57,471 --> 01:19:02,090
that's like as far away from us as you
know, like 5,000 years ago, you know,

1370
01:19:02,091 --> 01:19:04,340
think about 5,000 years for us.
That's ancient Egypt.

1371
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,730
So it's as far away from them
as ancient Egypt is to us.

1372
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:11,540
So he's saying we have a situation
where it's at least that old,

1373
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:15,890
and it might be far older
than that because this is
thousands of years of rain.

1374
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:20,450
This has been cut out and thousands of
years of rain has caused it to do this.

1375
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:22,640
So it had to be older,
even still.

1376
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:26,270
So there's a bunch of people
that are theorizing 10,500 BC.

1377
01:19:26,271 --> 01:19:30,410
There's people that want to go 34,000
BC cause you add up all the dates of the

1378
01:19:30,411 --> 01:19:32,860
pharaohs. So these guys,
John Anthony West, who's a,

1379
01:19:32,861 --> 01:19:35,690
an egyptologist who's been studying
all this shit his whole life,

1380
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:39,920
he's one of the ones that's convinced
that the ancient Egyptian history is a a

1381
01:19:39,921 --> 01:19:43,040
rich long history.
Not of 5,000 years,

1382
01:19:43,041 --> 01:19:47,840
none of 2,500 BC but 34,000 years.
He says it goes back far.

1383
01:19:47,841 --> 01:19:48,051
You know,

1384
01:19:48,051 --> 01:19:50,810
you just have to recognize
it and understand it and
appreciate it and you can

1385
01:19:50,811 --> 01:19:52,820
show the different construction methods.
He's like,

1386
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:54,140
they've got like very clear evidence.

1387
01:19:54,141 --> 01:19:56,390
Like this is their building
things very differently here.

1388
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:59,180
And this is below what was on top of it.

1389
01:19:59,270 --> 01:20:01,490
So we're talking about something
that was buried in sand.

1390
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:06,560
So they built on top of something that
was far older than what's right here.

1391
01:20:06,561 --> 01:20:09,660
And so he has all this shit
explained out and then he shows,

1392
01:20:09,661 --> 01:20:13,790
the geologist shows all these fissures
in the water and they explained that this

1393
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:14,211
are in the,

1394
01:20:14,211 --> 01:20:17,370
in the walls that's only caused by
water and they explained to all these

1395
01:20:17,371 --> 01:20:19,890
conventional Egyptologists
like this has got to be,

1396
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:23,400
we have to reconsider the age of this.
Maybe it's just a bunch of bird p.

1397
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:27,510
So when the the Egyptologists look
at him, the egyptologist goes, well,

1398
01:20:27,511 --> 01:20:28,830
what's the evidence of this culture?

1399
01:20:28,831 --> 01:20:32,940
You're asking us to consider a culture
from 10,500 BC? Where's the evidence?

1400
01:20:32,941 --> 01:20:36,840
This culture? Like what the fuck are you
talking about? What is this? What is this?

1401
01:20:36,990 --> 01:20:41,190
They don't want to admit that they've
been teaching for a hundred years.

1402
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:42,830
Some shit that's incorrect.
Yeah.

1403
01:20:42,930 --> 01:20:46,200
They want to attribute it to Khufu and
all these different guys that they can

1404
01:20:46,201 --> 01:20:48,330
know. Well, this guy existed
at this point in time.

1405
01:20:48,331 --> 01:20:51,300
It's documented and taught Moses
the third. This is the guy.

1406
01:20:51,301 --> 01:20:53,430
We attributed it to this.
He was around at this point in time.

1407
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:55,170
They don't want to admit the possibility.

1408
01:20:55,171 --> 01:21:00,171
That shit goes back thousands
and thousands of years
earlier and they deny him.

1409
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:01,950
He shows all this geology.

1410
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:05,430
He's got over a hundred geologists from
all over the country that have signed

1411
01:21:05,431 --> 01:21:08,850
off on this that they have looked at
the erosion and say this is very clearly

1412
01:21:08,851 --> 01:21:12,090
water erosion of thousands of
years. Yeah, and they don't care.

1413
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:14,060
They don't give a fuck. They don't
even want to talk about it. Yeah.

1414
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:18,090
Egyptologist only want to consider it.
Well, yeah, that but in a lot of them is,

1415
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:21,180
it's an because it would embarrass
them. Yeah, it wasn't exactly,

1416
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:22,830
it's like they're in
charge of information.

1417
01:21:22,831 --> 01:21:24,330
They're in charge of
disseminating information.

1418
01:21:24,331 --> 01:21:27,210
You have the clearest information
you could ever have as geology.

1419
01:21:27,211 --> 01:21:30,540
It's fucking rocks, man. It's like, what
is this? That is slate. That's provable.

1420
01:21:30,541 --> 01:21:33,090
What is this? That's granted. Yeah,
it's fucking, it's rocks. Okay.

1421
01:21:33,091 --> 01:21:37,440
You got rocks with deep fishers
for their looks like water.

1422
01:21:37,441 --> 01:21:41,370
It's smooth. It goes down just like water
would do. It's not like sand erosion.

1423
01:21:41,371 --> 01:21:45,420
He shows this doctor Ron shock shows a
difference between Sandra Rojan and water

1424
01:21:45,421 --> 01:21:45,780
erosion.

1425
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:48,630
It's interesting. Isn't very clear
difference what you are talking about,

1426
01:21:48,631 --> 01:21:53,631
how like bizarre it is that priests are
pedophiles have embedded themselves into

1427
01:21:54,721 --> 01:21:56,140
the priesthood,
uh,

1428
01:21:56,150 --> 01:22:00,360
and are doing the exact opposite of
what some pre your think of priesthood

1429
01:22:00,361 --> 01:22:03,510
should do or what,
why they're always protecting the priests.

1430
01:22:03,511 --> 01:22:06,330
So then you look at Egyptology
and it's curious. Oh look,

1431
01:22:06,331 --> 01:22:10,470
there's the exact same structure and
Egyptology w instead of somebody being a

1432
01:22:10,471 --> 01:22:14,580
true as store and being like,
wow, good work. Holy Shit,

1433
01:22:14,581 --> 01:22:18,240
this is going to transform everything.
That's amazing right there. Like,

1434
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:22,500
you know what? That's a lot of
ink to rewrite all this history.

1435
01:22:22,890 --> 01:22:27,270
Let's not waste our time. Yeah, look, why
don't you go investigate that arrowhead.

1436
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:27,540
Okay.

1437
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:30,360
This is the dumbest thing that guy said.
Where's the evidence of this culture?

1438
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:34,380
How much evidence do you think would
be there after 10,000 fucking years?

1439
01:22:34,590 --> 01:22:38,790
Nothing, man. It would all be eaten up,
especially houses like American houses,

1440
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,840
like a regular house with drywall and
shit and the roof tile, that shit's gone.

1441
01:22:43,110 --> 01:22:44,620
Earth is going to swallow that up.
It's

1442
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:47,350
fucking hard, man. Because
if you think about it,

1443
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:52,270
just to empathize with that asshole
egyptologist if you think about it,

1444
01:22:52,271 --> 01:22:57,271
I can think of specific times I've gotten
in a fight with someone and known in

1445
01:22:57,791 --> 01:23:00,670
my head that I am wrong
in the midst of the fight.

1446
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:05,650
I just know I'm wrong and I just
keep pushing on, pushing through,

1447
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:06,130
even though

1448
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:09,310
I know I'm wrong in clearly
in a, in a, in a, in my head.

1449
01:23:09,430 --> 01:23:11,110
And that's just some dumb little fight.

1450
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:15,490
Imagine Egyptologists who stayed his
entire career on the fucking thing.

1451
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:16,060
It's like,

1452
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:20,500
and to epidemics saying you're wrong
about something that you mean being wrong,

1453
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:23,990
being proven wrong on something that's
devastating because that just shows it

1454
01:23:23,991 --> 01:23:27,280
like you didn't consider everything
and you have a flaw in your thinking.

1455
01:23:27,450 --> 01:23:29,710
Like you had dated this and
you were clearly incorrect.

1456
01:23:29,711 --> 01:23:32,530
So the hieroglyphs that you read that
you attributed to all these various guys

1457
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:36,610
saying this is when we built this as well.
Like the Sphinx itself,

1458
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:39,250
like one of the guys I forgot,
I think it's taught Moses the third,

1459
01:23:39,251 --> 01:23:43,210
whoever's accredited with the, no, that's
not him. The fuck is accredited with the,

1460
01:23:43,211 --> 01:23:47,560
uh, building of the Sphinx. It's not
Khufu Khufu was the guy who was a cat,

1461
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:52,090
made the, he was credited with
the Great Pyramid. Um, anyway,

1462
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:57,330
whoever it was, the, the hieroglyph the
way it said, the way it was, uh, you know,

1463
01:23:57,340 --> 01:23:57,450
the,

1464
01:23:57,450 --> 01:24:00,280
what the reason why they attributed to
him is because he said that he was told

1465
01:24:00,281 --> 01:24:05,020
in a dream that if he uncovered
this, thinks that he would,
uh, get to be pharaoh.

1466
01:24:05,530 --> 01:24:10,290
But the problem is it's the word is
uncover. Like if, if it's uncovered,

1467
01:24:10,291 --> 01:24:13,480
if that's the real translation, then
you're saying that it was there. Ready.

1468
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:17,710
I don't know how, how clear it is
to translate hieroglyphs though.

1469
01:24:17,890 --> 01:24:18,461
You know what I'm saying?

1470
01:24:18,461 --> 01:24:21,490
Like if you're reading something and
hieroglyphic how much of that is open to

1471
01:24:21,491 --> 01:24:24,610
interpretation because it's
such an alien language. I mean,

1472
01:24:24,611 --> 01:24:29,220
it's so different than English to put it
into English words and to put it in, in,

1473
01:24:29,221 --> 01:24:33,190
in the context of we're going to recognize
as me having a certain intent. I mean,

1474
01:24:33,191 --> 01:24:38,130
God, it's so hard, man. I just
saw this thing called, what am I,

1475
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:39,190
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1476
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:42,850
The point is that all it says is that
he was there when the Spinks was built.

1477
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,880
That's all you know for sure. You know
it just cause it's written somewhere.

1478
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:50,050
You know, I rocked this sphinx and
you know I built La, I built a shit.

1479
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:53,350
And then scientists, you know, a thousand
years to know, oh, Joe Rogan built La.

1480
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:55,870
It's written right here. That
doesn't mean anything, man.

1481
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:59,860
It's a fucking giant structure. Yeah. You
say you built it. Where's the drawings,

1482
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:01,570
man? You don't even have
any fucking directions.

1483
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:05,650
Is this pictures of you assholes with
plates on your heads with fruit and

1484
01:25:05,651 --> 01:25:08,170
there's no pictures of you
building the fucking parents? None.

1485
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:11,200
Not a single high rigor roof represents
the construction of the pyramids.

1486
01:25:11,530 --> 01:25:12,820
You think,
why would you write that down?

1487
01:25:12,890 --> 01:25:16,060
What's really important is how do you
make bread? Oh, it's fucking crazy.

1488
01:25:16,061 --> 01:25:20,820
Yo a fire and we got to
fuck with some flour. Yeah.

1489
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:23,500
They have all this different things that
they have written down about their life

1490
01:25:23,501 --> 01:25:25,360
and their culture and war and space.

1491
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:29,830
Somebody sketching a pyramid on the
wall and like they're like boring.

1492
01:25:29,831 --> 01:25:32,770
Why are you sketching that thing?
We just built it. Forget about it.

1493
01:25:32,771 --> 01:25:34,180
Let's talk about 2 million,

1494
01:25:34,181 --> 01:25:39,181
300,000 stones connected so perfectly
like in like the king's chamber and all

1495
01:25:39,401 --> 01:25:42,790
these stones inside. You can't get a razor
blade in between a man. Well, I mean,

1496
01:25:42,910 --> 01:25:47,560
yeah, so I think that, why would you write
down how you made that? Yeah, fuck it.

1497
01:25:48,530 --> 01:25:51,940
Just fucking boring. It's just rocks
and stones. It's probably like,

1498
01:25:52,030 --> 01:25:55,690
it's a simple way we just haven't
thought of yet. Let's draw me. No,

1499
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:58,810
it's probably something that's
so basic and you're like, oh Duh.

1500
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:02,960
They wouldn't want to draw that
dough. No, there's no way. No,

1501
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:07,070
there's no way. Just the
numbers, the numbers of stones,

1502
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:09,680
they don't know whether or not the
stones were caught or whether or not they

1503
01:26:09,681 --> 01:26:10,321
were poured.

1504
01:26:10,321 --> 01:26:14,390
There's a separate argument that they
were made out of limestone and it's fairly

1505
01:26:14,391 --> 01:26:17,930
convincing and it's another one that's
going to fuck with Eg Egyptologists for

1506
01:26:17,931 --> 01:26:22,400
sure. Because the theory is that
they made those stones with like,

1507
01:26:22,401 --> 01:26:26,390
they made a concrete out of limestone
and they mixed it and then like set them

1508
01:26:26,391 --> 01:26:29,790
in place. So it wasn't that they
moved all these stones is a,

1509
01:26:29,791 --> 01:26:34,040
they made concrete and made
these blocks like in place.

1510
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:35,750
Um,
well I think that,

1511
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:37,570
well that doesn't make any sense
either, right? Because if you,

1512
01:26:37,571 --> 01:26:40,240
even if you make concrete blocks, then
you've got to pick them up and move him.

1513
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:44,460
I mean, I don't know. Your mind gets more
detailed than mine does in these things.

1514
01:26:44,461 --> 01:26:48,270
These things. Did you like you try
to like figure it out? I, I, I'm,

1515
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:50,130
I don't know man. I just look at it. I'm,

1516
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:54,630
I think that maybe I have lazy thinking
and this says that I will just let

1517
01:26:54,631 --> 01:26:59,170
myself believe that. Like
I've had, uh, uh, alien crane.

1518
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:03,350
It's just too much work,
right? Yeah. I don't need you.

1519
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,580
I don't go into the number
of stones and stuff back,

1520
01:27:05,610 --> 01:27:10,470
but I do think whatever it is and the
way it was built is for whether it's the

1521
01:27:10,471 --> 01:27:11,370
most mundane,

1522
01:27:11,371 --> 01:27:14,640
it's just a shitload of people figured
out how to do it or whether the thing

1523
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:19,680
just teleported in from some uh,
Sumerian dimension or or whatever.

1524
01:27:19,830 --> 01:27:20,840
I still think it's a,

1525
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:25,080
it's like awe inspiring that things like
that exist and I think that there is

1526
01:27:25,081 --> 01:27:30,081
the tendency in science to
try to minimalize things
for some reason and remove

1527
01:27:30,931 --> 01:27:34,320
that, that feeling of like,
Holy Shit, what is that?

1528
01:27:34,321 --> 01:27:38,100
It's by the time Egyptologists get down
with everything and it's just like a

1529
01:27:38,101 --> 01:27:39,690
snore fast out there.

1530
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:44,810
You've got this ancient insane pyramid
that appears to somehow is a, is Ivan,

1531
01:27:44,830 --> 01:27:47,640
and I think I've heard you say this
somehow at some time of the year

1532
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:51,070
lies the summer solstice. Yeah. To visit.

1533
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:54,860
There's a like shafts inside that
point to certain constellations.

1534
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:59,390
There's a bunch of design where when the
sun is rising at a certain time of the

1535
01:27:59,390 --> 01:28:02,450
year, it goes like in the temple in
man. It goes like up the shock rose.

1536
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:04,880
It's like there, it's been
crazy, incredible shed.

1537
01:28:04,881 --> 01:28:07,610
Like there's so much of what
they did and even the Mayans,

1538
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:11,270
the Mayans had some visual effect on the
side of one of their pyramids that as

1539
01:28:11,271 --> 01:28:12,350
the sun would rise,

1540
01:28:12,470 --> 01:28:16,070
it would look like a snake was moving up
the side of their pyramid. And you know,

1541
01:28:16,071 --> 01:28:21,020
they read worship Wetzel Quad, Alicia's
the feathered plumed serpent. A flying,

1542
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:21,920
flying snake.

1543
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:25,060
Yeah, I've seen the video of the
sheets. Snake Shadow. It's okay. It's

1544
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:28,300
pretty dope. But you know, you think
about these ancient ancient civilizations,

1545
01:28:28,301 --> 01:28:28,780
I mean,

1546
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:33,730
how much room for error do you have when
you're moving 2000 fucking pound stones

1547
01:28:34,030 --> 01:28:37,240
and you know, you're doing it in
your barefoot with fucking, you know,

1548
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:40,480
a goofy thong on pushing
these giant stones.

1549
01:28:40,510 --> 01:28:44,210
Maybe it was just an extinct animal
that used to love to build pyramids.

1550
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:49,120
You know, dinosaurs,
irritating pyramid dinosaur,

1551
01:28:49,121 --> 01:28:53,080
right? I look, Eric goes, he's just
shits a mountain nakeds pyramid ever.

1552
01:28:53,081 --> 01:28:57,170
That's his, that's his, that's
his beehive. Yeah. Why does
he like to eat clay? So,

1553
01:28:57,530 --> 01:29:02,070
yeah, no, it makes a really complicated
Ann Hill. There's only one of them.

1554
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:05,160
They existed and then he died
and he turned it into a pyramid.

1555
01:29:05,970 --> 01:29:09,480
So it looks complicated.
Sphinxes it looks complicated,

1556
01:29:09,481 --> 01:29:12,840
but it's just nature manifesting
itself through Dung. Well, you know,

1557
01:29:12,841 --> 01:29:16,320
we don't know. I mean, I think
are, I'm like, you know, when you,

1558
01:29:16,410 --> 01:29:19,250
what I was thinking is if you could paint,
if like you,

1559
01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:23,580
you are some primitive person and you
knew that whatever you painted on a wall

1560
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:27,450
was going to get super scrutinized by
anthropologists who are going to look at

1561
01:29:27,451 --> 01:29:31,650
the thing and be like, oh, this means
that they worshiped the cow. God. Right.

1562
01:29:31,690 --> 01:29:36,570
Maybe you're not I to draw a
cow. Right. Well, I mean, yeah,

1563
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:38,440
makes sense that they would draw cows.
I mean,

1564
01:29:38,450 --> 01:29:40,900
that's what they needed to
stay alive, you know? I mean,

1565
01:29:40,901 --> 01:29:43,850
it was very important to them. You know,
when people talk about, why did you know,

1566
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:47,530
why did animals worship cattle?
Well, there's two reasons for sure,

1567
01:29:47,650 --> 01:29:51,220
but the Indian region doesn't make
sense. There's two reasons. One,

1568
01:29:51,221 --> 01:29:53,110
they did like a lot of ancient cultures.

1569
01:29:53,111 --> 01:29:57,250
They were embedded in cow cattle worship.
They were like, yeah. What is it called?

1570
01:29:57,251 --> 01:30:00,150
Choctaw? He, do you know how to say
that one? No, I just read him seconds.

1571
01:30:00,370 --> 01:30:04,660
That was the one that Mckenna talked
about and he shows all these images from

1572
01:30:04,690 --> 01:30:07,000
like all the different shit
that they were like had the,

1573
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:08,530
that was in honor of the cow.

1574
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:13,120
They had horns and they were showing
cows and then the idea is that the reason

1575
01:30:13,121 --> 01:30:16,680
why people worship cows,
his idea is that there was mushrooms,

1576
01:30:16,690 --> 01:30:20,680
it was growing off cow shit and they were
eating them and they were having these

1577
01:30:20,681 --> 01:30:21,700
psychedelic experiences,

1578
01:30:21,850 --> 01:30:26,560
which makes sense except they also
needed them to stay alive. You know,

1579
01:30:26,590 --> 01:30:30,040
you have to look at the fact that if
you're the first time that they invented

1580
01:30:30,041 --> 01:30:32,500
culture, the first time that
they invented civilization,

1581
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:35,380
they had to figure out a way to stay put.
Right. That's what I had to do. So they,

1582
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:37,240
they had to figure out a
way to corral the animals.

1583
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:40,180
So wants to corral the animals like,
oh, we got 'em they, they worship on,

1584
01:30:40,181 --> 01:30:42,670
they put the horns up like, oh,
this is what keeps us sustaining.

1585
01:30:42,820 --> 01:30:45,610
This is what allows us to stay here.
This is what keeps us alive. You know,

1586
01:30:45,611 --> 01:30:49,420
they have a big supply of these animals
and then keep slaughtering them. I mean,

1587
01:30:49,421 --> 01:30:53,410
if you're a family of four and you
have a full farm just for yourself,

1588
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:56,290
let me think about that man. You
got up full farm with, you know,

1589
01:30:56,291 --> 01:30:58,780
30 cows and you've got all these chickens.
You,

1590
01:30:58,850 --> 01:31:02,680
you should account and you get a side of
beef. That's all a lot of fucking food.

1591
01:31:02,830 --> 01:31:05,090
That shit will last you a long ass time.
Yeah.

1592
01:31:05,110 --> 01:31:07,750
And you've got all this corn that you're
growing and all these vegetables that

1593
01:31:07,751 --> 01:31:10,000
you growing, you don't need
anything else. You know, you could,

1594
01:31:10,001 --> 01:31:12,400
you could do it all there. You're,
you're totally self sustaining.

1595
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:16,820
Yeah. And it's, yeah, it's
safer. You're, if you have to
go out hunting all the time,

1596
01:31:16,821 --> 01:31:20,270
you're going to get attacked
by lions and shit. It's, yeah,

1597
01:31:20,690 --> 01:31:23,900
but I don't think it's all
about the mushroom. I don't
think, I mean it's, yeah,

1598
01:31:23,901 --> 01:31:28,550
it's more, I mean, they, in
India they can, I've, I've read,

1599
01:31:28,551 --> 01:31:32,420
they consider a cow dung to be antiseptic.
Yeah.

1600
01:31:32,690 --> 01:31:33,261
Yeah. The, the,

1601
01:31:33,261 --> 01:31:35,960
the Indian thing I was saying that didn't
make sense is that the Indians didn't

1602
01:31:35,961 --> 01:31:39,080
even eat them. So if they don't eat
them, if they worshiped him as God's,

1603
01:31:39,081 --> 01:31:40,130
then what happened there?

1604
01:31:40,131 --> 01:31:43,380
Because I understand the idea that the
cattle keep you alive and that's why you

1605
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:47,900
worship, but you eat them. You know, the,
the Choctaw, he, okay. I think those guys,

1606
01:31:47,901 --> 01:31:52,430
I think they were like at the time where
everybody ate animals. Yeah. You know,

1607
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:55,520
there was no, there was no, no, like
sacred animals where he couldn't eat it.

1608
01:31:55,521 --> 01:31:57,590
Like you got to eat everything
that was there. You know,

1609
01:31:57,630 --> 01:31:59,680
you don't have that much choice.

1610
01:31:59,990 --> 01:32:04,150
But India people are starving,
but they won't go after the cows.

1611
01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:07,990
Well, yeah, they, yeah, they, there are,

1612
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:12,070
they do kill some cows in India. There's
some people don't fly that way anymore.

1613
01:32:12,090 --> 01:32:16,420
Right. But in, you know, in the Hindu
religion, right. Our cow sacred.

1614
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:18,550
Oh yeah, you, when I was in India,

1615
01:32:18,551 --> 01:32:23,080
you would go down the street and
just pass a cow and you can pet it.

1616
01:32:23,230 --> 01:32:26,140
Cows are like dogs,
they are sweet.

1617
01:32:26,141 --> 01:32:29,590
You are of them and they like it now
lick your hand and they're just really

1618
01:32:29,591 --> 01:32:33,970
sweet animals. That's the thing. It's
like, you know, we were like wow,

1619
01:32:34,590 --> 01:32:38,260
bowls.
Those people in China eating those dogs,

1620
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:41,800
how could they do that?
Pass the stake honey. Um,

1621
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:46,930
you're eating a gentle, very
sweet creature. That's, I mean,

1622
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:50,740
I'm not saying it doesn't taste good.
I'm not a vegetarian. I eat them.

1623
01:32:50,741 --> 01:32:53,950
But you have to recognize when you're
eating that thing, it is a very,

1624
01:32:54,190 --> 01:32:58,990
very sweet animal. Cows, cows
are like really gentle, sweet,

1625
01:32:59,260 --> 01:33:03,100
not entirely dumb animals.
They, especially if you like,

1626
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:06,700
I mean when you see a cow in the wild
or a cow at a slaughter house or a cow

1627
01:33:06,701 --> 01:33:09,970
that's being harvested now you're
seeing something that was a,

1628
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:13,910
that's being treated in the most
horrific way. You know, it's,

1629
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:18,190
it's not in its natural habitat and
I'm not glorifying the way cows or any

1630
01:33:18,191 --> 01:33:22,540
animals are treated in India. But I think
that any animal that you shall love to,

1631
01:33:22,541 --> 01:33:26,470
it's going to become sweet and
domesticated and seem kind of smart.

1632
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:29,720
You do you understand that Joe
wants to kill tigers? It was,

1633
01:33:29,721 --> 01:33:34,720
we should kill tigers. Yeah.
Until everything that kills you.

1634
01:33:34,721 --> 01:33:38,560
That's why I'm not done for bowls roaming
the streets either. You know? Well,

1635
01:33:38,561 --> 01:33:42,250
I mean, yeah. It's like that's
a, that's an interesting point.

1636
01:33:42,251 --> 01:33:44,460
And by just done an off note,
uh,

1637
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:49,950
what is more satisfying than watching
a lion tamer get chomped by align the

1638
01:33:51,521 --> 01:33:54,220
Russian video. Any video.
When you see somebody,

1639
01:33:54,221 --> 01:33:57,510
you've gotten a lion cage getting
mauled by a lion, there's all,

1640
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:01,540
it's like the one time you can watch
violence without having to feel too bad

1641
01:34:01,541 --> 01:34:04,630
because this is a person who was enslaved
and animal that's not meant to be

1642
01:34:04,631 --> 01:34:08,650
enslaved or put in a cage prodding and
poking it and getting the inevitable

1643
01:34:08,651 --> 01:34:11,950
result. But it's disturbing,
dude. Have you seen the one that,

1644
01:34:11,951 --> 01:34:14,770
not the one that just happened where
the guy at, were they like, did the,

1645
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:18,400
I don't know what you call it, did some
worldwide wrestling move on? I'm like,

1646
01:34:18,401 --> 01:34:21,310
they both grabbed him and stretched
his arms out for a second.

1647
01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:24,310
There are about to rip his arms
off. No, I did see that. Yeah,

1648
01:34:24,311 --> 01:34:25,660
it looks like they going
to tear his arms off,

1649
01:34:25,661 --> 01:34:28,620
but the hose kept them all got
so close to being the greatest.

1650
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:30,850
I thought it was going to be.
I thought it was totally going to be deaf.

1651
01:34:30,851 --> 01:34:33,430
I thought it was going to be arms
come off death. That was a, yeah,

1652
01:34:33,431 --> 01:34:36,940
it was about to be like death for that
was amazing that he was still okay.

1653
01:34:36,941 --> 01:34:40,210
It was like walking around and got fucked
up. I'm sure there's blood everywhere.

1654
01:34:40,211 --> 01:34:42,250
There was blood all over the line.
It wasn't a blood.

1655
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:43,900
There was a jacket that's blood,

1656
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:48,130
but there's a lion attack video on
your website and by the way, man,

1657
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:51,760
why do people on your website
keep posting these death videos?

1658
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:54,040
What the fuck dude?
You get like every,

1659
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:58,250
there's so many like death videos and
like I have a problem not watching

1660
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:01,850
them
and it gets stuck in my head,

1661
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,670
but there was just there on the Internet
if they're on the Internet and it's

1662
01:35:04,671 --> 01:35:08,270
interesting it's going to
be on my website. I know,
I know. It's not a choice.

1663
01:35:08,271 --> 01:35:10,970
You want to have to make
Derek need to see this. Yeah,

1664
01:35:11,010 --> 01:35:15,870
I'm gonna well maybe it's not that bad.
Let me see. Oh my God, it's terrible.

1665
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:20,850
Stop. No more debt. Smart
video on your website of,

1666
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:26,060
I think it's Russia and its Elian
finishing the job and it's like,

1667
01:35:26,211 --> 01:35:27,410
Geez. It's like, you know,

1668
01:35:27,411 --> 01:35:30,770
first the guy's got his arm in the
cage and he's in the lions kind of like

1669
01:35:30,771 --> 01:35:34,580
holding onto his arm a little bit and
it almost looks, it's kind of femme fun.

1670
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:36,860
The lines just having a little bit of fun.
The guys got,

1671
01:35:37,010 --> 01:35:38,810
the guy's indicates with one arm out,

1672
01:35:38,870 --> 01:35:40,520
there's somebody there
kind of holding onto them.

1673
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:43,970
The lions like you're not cats play
with their food and she's kind of like

1674
01:35:43,971 --> 01:35:46,880
chilling out looking at the guy and the
guy's like they're in the first second.

1675
01:35:46,881 --> 01:35:50,750
It looks like you might get out of this
and then the line for whatever reason

1676
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:54,290
just pulls him into the
cage and chomps down.

1677
01:35:54,291 --> 01:35:57,830
I think on his neck you can't really tell
cause the lines on top of him and you

1678
01:35:57,831 --> 01:35:59,150
just see that thing that happens.

1679
01:35:59,151 --> 01:36:03,080
You know if you've ever been bitten by
a dog or a cat when it just bites in and

1680
01:36:03,081 --> 01:36:05,810
it's, it's in for the real
bite. It's doing that.

1681
01:36:05,811 --> 01:36:10,811
It's just biding deep and all of a sudden
the guy's body does this convulsive

1682
01:36:11,331 --> 01:36:11,751
thing,

1683
01:36:11,751 --> 01:36:16,160
which is kind of the last like little
like adrenaline pump before he dies and

1684
01:36:16,161 --> 01:36:21,140
it's just this awful seizure and then
some guy in like a military helmet or a

1685
01:36:21,141 --> 01:36:25,100
military hat or I don't know, police
officer comes and shoots the fucking line,

1686
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:26,780
which is the saddest part of that.

1687
01:36:28,820 --> 01:36:33,320
The lion bellows out is it's
being shot like what the fuck?

1688
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:38,630
What do you expect? What did you think
was going to happen? What can we say?

1689
01:36:38,631 --> 01:36:42,740
It's authentic surprise. Like, oh and
that, and that's the end of the line.

1690
01:36:42,741 --> 01:36:45,170
The line was doing everything
it was supposed to do.

1691
01:36:46,010 --> 01:36:48,140
The lion was passing the lion test.

1692
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:51,980
When the fucking monkey comes and starts
poking, you are washing your cage,

1693
01:36:51,981 --> 01:36:54,350
you eat it.
That's how it's works.

1694
01:36:54,351 --> 01:36:55,880
That's how it's worked
from the beginning of time.

1695
01:36:56,030 --> 01:36:59,090
How long did you think he tricked
up thing and to trick them,

1696
01:36:59,091 --> 01:37:02,720
you have to be on them all day. Every day.
Yeah. Those guys are handled big cats.

1697
01:37:02,721 --> 01:37:06,380
Those motherfuckers get very intimate
with those cats because you have to, you,

1698
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:08,690
you can't like tell you a couple
months off and go to Sweden.

1699
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:12,290
I came back from the Alps to tell you
what to eat and to talk. I was like,

1700
01:37:12,291 --> 01:37:15,760
why the fuck was I listening to you
again, bitch, get over here just yeah,

1701
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:18,560
crack you in the, wait a
minute. You know the fuck.

1702
01:37:18,561 --> 01:37:21,140
Wait a minute and here's
my dumb hippie point.

1703
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:26,440
That effect of the lion handler
manipulating this powerful lion.

1704
01:37:26,780 --> 01:37:30,050
That is exactly what oppressive
governments do to the people.

1705
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:33,210
And it's the exact same thing
where you have the clear powers,

1706
01:37:33,230 --> 01:37:36,300
the power of the people. They
are more powerful than, uh,

1707
01:37:36,910 --> 01:37:40,850
we Baka who's like, I don't care
what they say about marijuana.

1708
01:37:40,851 --> 01:37:44,480
I'm going to keep arresting people that
they arrest me for arresting people,

1709
01:37:44,630 --> 01:37:47,730
you know, so I would, he said, no, I
made that up, but he said some awesome,

1710
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:52,010
awesome shit. Yeah. He got to go on Bill
O'reilly tomorrow. Yeah, he would've been,

1711
01:37:52,070 --> 01:37:55,980
he would've been an anchor on Fox
News the next day. But the is like

1712
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,300
the, the, the, the people or the
lion and you event and that's the,

1713
01:38:00,301 --> 01:38:04,230
that's the horror of the government is
when the line starts waking up and the

1714
01:38:04,231 --> 01:38:05,940
people start realizing,
wait a minute,

1715
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:09,060
you can't tell me I can't
fucking eat mushrooms.

1716
01:38:09,061 --> 01:38:10,710
You can't tell me I can't smoke pot.

1717
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:14,190
You can't take 60% of my
money away from me anymore.

1718
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:18,180
I don't understand why we
were in Afghanistan. And
instead of being like, well,

1719
01:38:18,181 --> 01:38:21,840
that's weird. What time is it?
I have time to grab a coffee.

1720
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:25,530
You start fucking organizing and doing
what you can to fight against it,

1721
01:38:25,531 --> 01:38:27,780
which I never do, so I
should shut up. But it's,

1722
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:29,010
you're saying it's just,

1723
01:38:29,011 --> 01:38:32,010
it's an idealistic point of view and
the only reason why it's idealistic is

1724
01:38:32,011 --> 01:38:34,920
cause no one's pulled it off yet. But it
doesn't mean it's not possible. Right.

1725
01:38:36,030 --> 01:38:38,570
Paris, have you seen what
they're doing in Paris? Yeah.

1726
01:38:38,630 --> 01:38:42,510
That shits not getting a lot of airplay
is, or what's happening? Tell us in a,

1727
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:44,690
in Paris, uh, I believe it's in Paris,

1728
01:38:44,691 --> 01:38:49,370
they're like increasing the age
that you can get your pension,

1729
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:54,260
uh, from 61 to 63. So I guess
it's equivalent to being a 61.

1730
01:38:54,261 --> 01:38:56,180
Like for all your life you've
been working or whatever,

1731
01:38:56,181 --> 01:38:58,820
and all of a sudden you're about to have
the big vacation before you take it.

1732
01:38:58,821 --> 01:39:02,210
You have to work two more years.
And not everyone's that they,

1733
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:03,590
but I think there's other things involved.

1734
01:39:03,591 --> 01:39:07,550
They have like serious financial problems
all day. Well, yeah. Well they, you know,

1735
01:39:07,551 --> 01:39:10,270
a lot of people were saying the financial
problems they're experiencing, we're,

1736
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:14,510
we're, again, we're about to get a
little taste of that too. But um, uh,

1737
01:39:14,630 --> 01:39:17,450
but what you're seeing over there is,
um,

1738
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:21,290
not being carried in the mainstream
press that much because it's a,

1739
01:39:21,291 --> 01:39:23,780
it's a mild little revolutions
happening over there.

1740
01:39:23,781 --> 01:39:25,820
They caught off the fucking oil supplies.

1741
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:30,390
They're cutting off oil supplies really
to the city yet. Um, and I don't know.

1742
01:39:30,391 --> 01:39:32,470
And I was coming off oils activists,

1743
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:35,330
they're fucking blockading
like the Oil Refineries.

1744
01:39:35,331 --> 01:39:39,170
There's like a ship full of oil apparently
floating out there and can't come in.

1745
01:39:39,410 --> 01:39:40,101
Whoa.
Yeah,

1746
01:39:40,101 --> 01:39:43,430
there gas is running out over there from
these activists because there are six

1747
01:39:43,431 --> 01:39:45,860
seating there like that.
But the problem,

1748
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:49,760
it's like that's the level of reaction
you have to have to oppression.

1749
01:39:49,990 --> 01:39:53,440
So the activists are cutting off the oil
and the reason why they're cutting off

1750
01:39:53,441 --> 01:39:55,330
the oil to the city is to
starve the city outside.

1751
01:39:55,350 --> 01:39:56,380
The city has to listen to them.

1752
01:39:56,381 --> 01:39:59,520
Well somebody call in and explain this
cause like this is like something all in,

1753
01:39:59,530 --> 01:40:00,600
we don't have right now.
I'm just

1754
01:40:03,010 --> 01:40:05,410
give me off the fucking Hook here.
But they are,

1755
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:08,200
I know they're blockading
the fucking oil and and I,

1756
01:40:08,290 --> 01:40:11,710
it's not getting that much play in the
news. I haven't heard anything about this.

1757
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:14,530
Oh, let's go to cnn.com
that was you. Okay.

1758
01:40:14,531 --> 01:40:17,170
You would have to think that's breaking
news, right? Yeah. That's breaking news.

1759
01:40:17,290 --> 01:40:21,940
Dems look to energize women and
unions. Yeah. Lindsay Lohan backwards.

1760
01:40:21,941 --> 01:40:26,440
Scotty, the stock chart. Worst Day
in two months to bullshit stories.

1761
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:30,610
That's their big story. Two things
that make no sense. The stock market,

1762
01:40:30,611 --> 01:40:33,070
which is fake as fuck
and no one understands.

1763
01:40:33,071 --> 01:40:36,580
You can't even pretend you understand
that. Yeah. After that Bernie Madoff Shit,

1764
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,660
that guy was, he even stockbrokers
got fucked by that guy, right?

1765
01:40:40,940 --> 01:40:43,900
No one knows what the fuck that guy
was doing. How is that possible?

1766
01:40:43,901 --> 01:40:46,750
Then you have a bullshit system,
right? Your system is nonsense.

1767
01:40:46,751 --> 01:40:49,960
Even the people that were experts didn't
understand what the fuck was happening.

1768
01:40:49,961 --> 01:40:53,860
Yeah. Nobody saw this fucking gigantic
collapse coming. Nobody vocal about it.

1769
01:40:53,890 --> 01:40:54,160
Please

1770
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:57,070
shut the fuck up. And then Dems
look to energize women in unions.

1771
01:40:57,071 --> 01:40:59,990
What does that even mean? How is that
a story? It's a number one story.

1772
01:40:59,991 --> 01:41:01,840
I'd rather look at that. That's
the big one. That's the picture.

1773
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:06,310
And at some haggard old check who hasn't
seen a dick in over a decade and she's

1774
01:41:06,311 --> 01:41:09,310
talking about running shit.
You talking about [inaudible] and shit?

1775
01:41:09,370 --> 01:41:12,820
Not one that was still connected to
a body talking about running shit.

1776
01:41:12,821 --> 01:41:15,760
You ain't running nothing, mom.
Shut the fuck up. All right.

1777
01:41:15,761 --> 01:41:18,070
I'm tired of these crazy old
bitches that want to run shit.

1778
01:41:19,150 --> 01:41:24,070
Go Meg Whitman. Neh. Donald. No.

1779
01:41:24,071 --> 01:41:27,220
Christine O'Donnell. Just because
your vagina doesn't work anymore,

1780
01:41:27,221 --> 01:41:31,590
it doesn't mean you get to be a man. You
don't get to run shit. Okay. How dare you.

1781
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:35,110
You heard me? You heard and Joe? Yeah.
You are a man. I'm not talking to you.

1782
01:41:35,111 --> 01:41:36,430
I was looking at you,
but I wasn't talking to you.

1783
01:41:36,850 --> 01:41:40,780
He's talking to these crazy brides that
want to run shit, man. Stop it now.

1784
01:41:40,810 --> 01:41:45,160
The fucking, the, the, the,
what's her name? Um, fucking,

1785
01:41:45,670 --> 01:41:50,630
what's her name? Ellen did president.
You would be against Alan become? Um,

1786
01:41:51,150 --> 01:41:54,850
I would vote against her just based
on my talkings with Greg Fitzsimmons.

1787
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:57,970
What does he say about you have
to talk to Greg for semis. Oh,

1788
01:41:58,060 --> 01:42:00,790
nothing goes public with that shit.
You know what?

1789
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:03,980
I would fucking vote for Ellen
just for the absurdity. I would,

1790
01:42:04,230 --> 01:42:08,140
I would hope we would all dance like on
national flag day. Meg Whitman, ladies,

1791
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:13,160
thanks that marijuana is a gateway drug
and that it should not be legal because

1792
01:42:13,751 --> 01:42:18,130
if it is more we'll get to our children.
Oh, we've got to protect our children.

1793
01:42:18,910 --> 01:42:23,440
I'm so tired of people being able to
say things like gateway drug with no

1794
01:42:23,441 --> 01:42:26,110
consequences. Like
that's a, that is a lie.

1795
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:30,190
That is nonsense that has been
disproven by science like you can.

1796
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:34,240
Alcohol is far more of a gateway drug
to bad decisions and marijuana is

1797
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:35,260
marijuana in fact,

1798
01:42:35,261 --> 01:42:38,770
keeps a lot of people from ever trying
dangerous drugs because they get fucking

1799
01:42:38,771 --> 01:42:40,450
paranoid.
You know,

1800
01:42:40,451 --> 01:42:42,430
they think about it because of
marijuana and they get paranoid.

1801
01:42:42,431 --> 01:42:45,640
If you're going to start doing coke and
ecstasy and then you're going to do it

1802
01:42:45,641 --> 01:42:49,450
anyway. Man, it's, it's, it's out there.
If you want it, it's there. You know,

1803
01:42:49,451 --> 01:42:51,520
it's not hard to find pot.
It's out there.

1804
01:42:51,550 --> 01:42:54,520
It's not going to change the
ability of kids to get pot.

1805
01:42:54,550 --> 01:42:57,730
They can get pot everywhere. I mean,
just drive down the street from my house.

1806
01:42:57,850 --> 01:43:00,490
There is five fucking
medical marijuana stores,

1807
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:03,670
five of them in a row and like two blocks.
It's pots everywhere.

1808
01:43:03,850 --> 01:43:07,090
You're telling me that pot is, you
know, it doesn't have a GPS chip on it.

1809
01:43:07,090 --> 01:43:11,470
So the 21 year old dude who bought it
can't sell it at twice the price to some

1810
01:43:11,471 --> 01:43:15,550
17 year old kid. Now you
know, it's fucking, anybody
can get it. It's everywhere.

1811
01:43:15,551 --> 01:43:17,740
Pots just out there, man. It's out there.

1812
01:43:18,130 --> 01:43:21,610
So you can't fucking tell me that it's
there. That there would be some sort of a,

1813
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:25,360
a bad thing. You know, that that
would come with making it legal.

1814
01:43:25,361 --> 01:43:29,950
Making people who are responsible human
beings who want to do something to make

1815
01:43:29,951 --> 01:43:31,780
themselves feel.
You're treating them like criminals.

1816
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:34,360
And you're saying that that
being a criminal is okay,

1817
01:43:34,510 --> 01:43:38,140
but it's okay for them to be a criminal
because they want to relax and have a

1818
01:43:38,141 --> 01:43:41,860
plant that makes you feel soothing and
it makes sex better and it makes food

1819
01:43:41,861 --> 01:43:46,690
better. No, you want them
to be a criminal, but yeah,
that's just dom. Let's talk.

1820
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:48,850
Let's look at the gateway drug idea,

1821
01:43:49,150 --> 01:43:52,130
and if you think about it in a where all

1822
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:54,140
drugs are lumped together,

1823
01:43:54,141 --> 01:43:56,810
all illegal drugs are lumped
together into one category, right?

1824
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:01,490
Some teenagers smokes pot for the first
time. I was like, this is fucking awesome.

1825
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:04,880
Holy Shit. Drugs are great. It's like, no,

1826
01:44:04,881 --> 01:44:09,020
actually drugs aren't great.
Certain drugs are great,

1827
01:44:09,110 --> 01:44:13,700
certain drugs are fucking awful.
Cocaine is that I, I personally hate it.

1828
01:44:13,701 --> 01:44:15,910
I have friends who are fans of it,
but they're annoying.

1829
01:44:16,140 --> 01:44:20,360
Someone on cocaine is really annoying to
be around. It's, it's, it's too expensive.

1830
01:44:20,361 --> 01:44:24,770
I fucking hate it. And of course the
freebase form of it is awful. Meth,

1831
01:44:24,860 --> 01:44:28,190
awful heroin, awful.
These are terrible drugs.

1832
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:33,220
Why are you lumping them together in with
a drug that only seems to have mostly

1833
01:44:33,411 --> 01:44:37,190
positive effects on your life
outside of if you smoke it way, way,

1834
01:44:37,191 --> 01:44:41,150
way too much and you get a foggy mind
and I don't know, maybe you eat too much.

1835
01:44:41,190 --> 01:44:43,600
Well I think you also have to take
into consideration that everyone has a

1836
01:44:43,601 --> 01:44:45,160
different biological makeup.
You know,

1837
01:44:45,161 --> 01:44:47,950
there's some people that get addicted
to alcohol really quickly to some people

1838
01:44:47,951 --> 01:44:49,990
that are allergic to wheat.
You know, some people,

1839
01:44:49,991 --> 01:44:51,370
marijuana is not the best thing for them.

1840
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:53,780
But you know what? You know what's,
this is the thing though, man.

1841
01:44:54,010 --> 01:44:54,843
There was this one girl,

1842
01:44:54,860 --> 01:44:59,860
there was a girl I dated that she smoked
we once and she took one hit and within

1843
01:44:59,931 --> 01:45:03,530
two minutes she stood up,
ran full speed into the bathroom,

1844
01:45:03,620 --> 01:45:08,210
hit the bathtub and hit her head on the
wall and she just laid in the bathtub

1845
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:10,580
for like three minutes. And I was
like, what the fuck are you okay?

1846
01:45:10,790 --> 01:45:14,420
She said that she just got this instant
thing that she had to stand up and run

1847
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:15,860
and she didn't even know where she was.

1848
01:45:15,861 --> 01:45:19,940
She just started running and that was
from one hit from weed. Yeah. But yeah,

1849
01:45:19,970 --> 01:45:24,200
but no, she wasn't dumb fucking
intelligence. That's bad.

1850
01:45:24,230 --> 01:45:28,430
You think one hit, one hit. How
good was the weed? Ohio brick.

1851
01:45:28,431 --> 01:45:33,140
We Bong. Really? Yes. Wow. We'll try
giving a skateboard to a nine year old.

1852
01:45:33,470 --> 01:45:36,610
If you want to talk about a dangerous,
scary, you give a kid a escapes

1853
01:45:36,710 --> 01:45:40,230
or they'll go get you sell like a
propaganda. They'll go slam. Yeah. Yeah.

1854
01:45:40,470 --> 01:45:44,240
I'd love to see you in Congress.
I'm running for office. Mr Trussell.

1855
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:49,340
How do you explain all of these children
that smoke marijuana and ran into the

1856
01:45:49,341 --> 01:45:53,600
bathtub and hit their heads?
He man, it's like, you know,

1857
01:45:53,630 --> 01:45:57,610
you can get my nine year old
kid a skateboard man. Uh Huh.

1858
01:45:57,830 --> 01:46:02,510
Duly noted. Mr Trussell, please, please
sit down, take your seat. They'd be like,

1859
01:46:02,511 --> 01:46:05,840
listen to this guy. You'd be a ch huge
fuck up for the cause. You'd be like,

1860
01:46:05,870 --> 01:46:09,440
when they made the movie of the story,
you'd be the fucking that got it.

1861
01:46:09,441 --> 01:46:13,470
Steve Buscemi would play and uh,
he would get up and he'd be super stoned.

1862
01:46:13,480 --> 01:46:15,680
Forget what he was saying.
And he would say, hey man,

1863
01:46:15,860 --> 01:46:20,390
just like you can't give a nine
year old a fucking skateboard.

1864
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:25,370
Well, the whole thing, I mean, the whole
thing about keeping weed away from kids,

1865
01:46:25,670 --> 01:46:29,330
it's like you should, I think you
should keep all things that change kids,

1866
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:33,170
psychological state, that the state
of mind. I think it's all tricky.

1867
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:36,170
It's a very dangerous, I think it's
up in the air. It should be done.

1868
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:38,330
I have a father,
you know,

1869
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:40,550
I think you should be introduced
to alcohol by your father.

1870
01:46:40,610 --> 01:46:43,810
You're right. Can I just say something
just to go back a little bit.

1871
01:46:44,230 --> 01:46:46,900
I'm not saying we should give pot to kids.

1872
01:46:46,990 --> 01:46:49,950
I know you're not just blow it in their,
we should make them

1873
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:53,360
buy it. You shouldn't give
it away. They get that.

1874
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:56,900
They get the wrong idea.
I think for a lot of kids earn it.

1875
01:46:56,970 --> 01:46:59,170
A lot of kids through a lot of,

1876
01:46:59,250 --> 01:47:01,830
a lot of kids are going through a lot
of weird shit when they're growing up.

1877
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:05,210
I mean everybody is just the reality of
becoming a teenager and then, you know,

1878
01:47:05,310 --> 01:47:09,120
growing into manhood or womanhood, it's a
fucking freaky feeling. Like, Oh my God,

1879
01:47:09,121 --> 01:47:11,910
I'm going to have to take care of
myself someday and make my own money and

1880
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:14,700
fucking feed myself.
And this is just too crazy.

1881
01:47:14,701 --> 01:47:17,640
I don't want to leave my mom's house
and his fucking schools drive me nuts.

1882
01:47:17,910 --> 01:47:19,610
How much am I going to have
to work once I got a job?

1883
01:47:19,630 --> 01:47:21,510
I'm working this hard when I'm in school.
You know,

1884
01:47:21,511 --> 01:47:24,760
all that shit could be overwhelming
to kids, you know, to Real,

1885
01:47:24,810 --> 01:47:28,830
especially young kids like 14, 15. If
you start throwing pot in the mix too,

1886
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:31,050
that might send them off into the woods.

1887
01:47:31,051 --> 01:47:33,660
There might Corinne them off track
and really fuck with their head.

1888
01:47:33,661 --> 01:47:37,170
But what have you were six years old
watching sesame street and you had this

1889
01:47:37,171 --> 01:47:39,040
magic guy come and go, hey, uh,

1890
01:47:39,210 --> 01:47:43,380
would you like to look at this stoned
as a six year old PR? No, man, listen,

1891
01:47:43,381 --> 01:47:45,810
when you're six years old,
your brain is still developing.

1892
01:47:45,811 --> 01:47:48,210
I don't think it's a good
move to introduce drugs.

1893
01:47:48,211 --> 01:47:51,930
And to develop their minus
the mean street. I want to
talk about this magic guy,

1894
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:55,780
this guy all the time.

1895
01:47:56,550 --> 01:47:59,960
I'm more interested in the college
guys in that pot. That's what I,

1896
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:02,420
that's what I would be doing
if I was at a time machine.

1897
01:48:02,421 --> 01:48:04,290
I'd be going back in time giving myself,

1898
01:48:04,291 --> 01:48:08,740
we'd would you when I was watching sesame
seeds. So paranoid you did to try this?

1899
01:48:09,310 --> 01:48:12,990
Yeah. You had to go back in time into
your life and do anything differently.

1900
01:48:12,991 --> 01:48:17,130
What would you do differently? Uh,
probably that I was getting myself. No,

1901
01:48:17,131 --> 01:48:18,690
I don't know.
Uh,

1902
01:48:19,170 --> 01:48:23,070
is there any one instance
from your childhood that you
would redo? You take back?

1903
01:48:24,010 --> 01:48:28,800
Probably throwing rocks at that
cardinal threw a rock at a bird. Yeah.

1904
01:48:28,870 --> 01:48:31,340
Yeah.
Little baby and a baby cardinal.

1905
01:48:31,370 --> 01:48:34,550
That was like retarded or something
like that. But I was like six or seven.

1906
01:48:34,551 --> 01:48:38,500
And you know, I think I've talked about
this before. Yeah. What about you?

1907
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:39,353
[inaudible]

1908
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:44,220
same. I, yeah, at once when I, when
I was a kid, I like went in my,

1909
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:49,250
my grandparents love birds and I had a
BB gun and my grandparents were out of

1910
01:48:49,761 --> 01:48:51,680
town and I like took that,

1911
01:48:51,890 --> 01:48:54,830
drove their golf cart because they
drove around in a golf cart with like,

1912
01:48:54,860 --> 01:48:59,860
like I'm on a hunting safari into the
backyard and just shot a Robin Wright,

1913
01:48:59,961 --> 01:49:04,820
just killed a Robin and it fell and it
like spiraled down and all the other

1914
01:49:04,821 --> 01:49:09,130
burden, like there's bird feeders all
over my grandmother's yard and as a staff,

1915
01:49:09,180 --> 01:49:12,920
you know, statue of Saints and these
birds are like dive bombing me.

1916
01:49:12,921 --> 01:49:15,560
They were freaking out cause I'd killed
one of them and they're freaking out and

1917
01:49:15,561 --> 01:49:19,950
just swirling around. And it
was like, I was mortified. Uh,

1918
01:49:19,980 --> 01:49:22,120
and that's definitely something
that I would go, yeah,

1919
01:49:22,340 --> 01:49:25,790
fish fish bombing to where used to take
him eighties and put it in fish's mouth,

1920
01:49:25,820 --> 01:49:25,971
you know,

1921
01:49:25,971 --> 01:49:29,040
like live fish and it would light them
and then throw him off the roof of the

1922
01:49:29,041 --> 01:49:33,980
school at people. Oh my God, you guys
are sick fucks. Which gives me his fish.

1923
01:49:34,120 --> 01:49:37,490
There's a pond at our elementary school
that you catch them going with Ketchum

1924
01:49:37,491 --> 01:49:40,650
and then we put them in a bucket and then
they'll mark God, you guys are a mess.

1925
01:49:40,670 --> 01:49:44,300
Fish bombing. Oh, bombing.
Yeah. That's such a fun.

1926
01:49:44,301 --> 01:49:47,770
It was great for fishes.
Like imagine your fish.

1927
01:49:47,771 --> 01:49:50,710
All of a sudden you're yanked out
of your world into an alien world.

1928
01:49:51,010 --> 01:49:54,100
Stare at these things. These things
are laughing. They throw you a bucket.

1929
01:49:54,101 --> 01:49:57,040
You're flopping around in a fucking
bucket. You're swimming around in circles.

1930
01:49:57,041 --> 01:49:58,900
You can't get out,
but he takes it out of that bucket.

1931
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:02,710
Shoves his big giant Dick in your mouth.
You know this,

1932
01:50:02,711 --> 01:50:06,910
this explosive deck lights it on fire
and then you fly through the air and

1933
01:50:06,911 --> 01:50:09,100
explode.
That's how you leave this world.

1934
01:50:09,130 --> 01:50:12,760
We had also did squirrel baseball where
like the squirrels would go up and you

1935
01:50:12,761 --> 01:50:13,890
need to stop because it's,

1936
01:50:14,100 --> 01:50:19,100
you're looking at some Dexter Shit fucking
serial killer than what you would do.

1937
01:50:19,541 --> 01:50:23,950
Kitten crucifixion
scene in the Bible with kittens.

1938
01:50:23,980 --> 01:50:26,760
Have you ever strangled a frog?
Was real easy.

1939
01:50:26,780 --> 01:50:28,480
Just put them in your throat
and just strangle it. You know?

1940
01:50:28,481 --> 01:50:32,280
Look at their face and then you've killed.
No, I've never killed a frog. Skidding.

1941
01:50:33,820 --> 01:50:36,340
Disturbing.
That's one thing I used to love.

1942
01:50:36,341 --> 01:50:38,500
I used to collect frogs or inner window.

1943
01:50:38,501 --> 01:50:41,050
Well know you guys know what
window wells are. They're like,

1944
01:50:41,051 --> 01:50:43,630
we're the basement windows are and
had little sling and the neighborhood.

1945
01:50:43,631 --> 01:50:45,550
We had wood frogs would
get trapped in there.

1946
01:50:45,610 --> 01:50:48,760
And so as a kid I would take all these
frogs and put them in buckets in the

1947
01:50:48,761 --> 01:50:51,340
neighborhood would have like a pet show
where you bring your pet and he's like,

1948
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:54,700
Ooh, first place, second place. And I
didn't have a pet because my cat ran away.

1949
01:50:54,790 --> 01:50:57,730
So I would take my bucket
of frogs and I did that.

1950
01:50:57,800 --> 01:50:59,720
I'll put like little things
for them to climb up and down.

1951
01:50:59,721 --> 01:51:03,130
And that was my pet never won,
but I was at frog free.

1952
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:07,120
That's all I wanted to say about
frogs. I have plugged in. I was a kid.

1953
01:51:07,330 --> 01:51:09,620
The thing about frogs is
they've got no rights, right?

1954
01:51:09,630 --> 01:51:12,520
You take a frog and stomp on it and nobody
ever goes, what happened to your frog?

1955
01:51:12,850 --> 01:51:15,460
I Dunno. He died. Right? Was
buried that bitch in the backyard.

1956
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:17,180
Nobody ever does an autopsy in your fraud.

1957
01:51:17,210 --> 01:51:20,620
Go Watch this frog as of a crushed skull.
The fuck is going on at frog.

1958
01:51:20,621 --> 01:51:23,260
CSI gives a fuck.
You can play baseball with frogs.

1959
01:51:23,380 --> 01:51:26,610
You could throw frogs at each other and
hit each other with fucking frogs and

1960
01:51:26,611 --> 01:51:28,900
the frogs die in a paralyzed.
Nobody's going to arrest.

1961
01:51:28,901 --> 01:51:31,270
You told us were pretty
bad ass toads were like,

1962
01:51:31,330 --> 01:51:34,840
throw a toad at a dude in front of
a cop and nobody would say shit.

1963
01:51:34,990 --> 01:51:39,100
You can pick up the toad and her alum
at a dude and he hit the dude and nobody

1964
01:51:39,101 --> 01:51:41,590
would be like, fuck man. Animal rights.

1965
01:51:43,230 --> 01:51:45,550
So a toad is a frog with herpes.

1966
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:47,410
You know they used to have
those like little bumps.

1967
01:51:47,411 --> 01:51:50,460
If you look close and you're all just
like warts are nowhere near the waters I

1968
01:51:50,470 --> 01:51:55,240
would. It is. I don't that yet.
They're dry, dry licking a frog thing.

1969
01:51:55,241 --> 01:51:58,810
Did you ever do that? No. Did you ever? It
doesn't work that way. When I was a kid,

1970
01:51:58,811 --> 01:52:00,310
I did it,
but I don't think I ever trip.

1971
01:52:00,311 --> 01:52:02,830
Maybe I was doing DMT went
out by the way to do it.

1972
01:52:02,930 --> 01:52:05,860
Doesn't everybody thinks it's looked
at frog? No. You have to smoke it.

1973
01:52:05,861 --> 01:52:08,170
If you look at it, it's just like eating
it. It's not going to get into the,

1974
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:09,833
it's just like

1975
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:12,830
tea. When you, your brain
makes it. You're, if you,

1976
01:52:12,831 --> 01:52:17,270
if you eat any sugar has DMT in it.
DMT contains whatever,

1977
01:52:17,271 --> 01:52:20,540
whatever it is, uh, in your body,
your stomach breaks it down.

1978
01:52:20,541 --> 01:52:23,300
It's called the Amato aiming model.
Avian oxidase.

1979
01:52:23,390 --> 01:52:25,310
So when you're taken DMT orally,
you're,

1980
01:52:25,311 --> 01:52:28,360
your stomach kills it and it never
gets in your bloodstream. Wow.

1981
01:52:28,610 --> 01:52:29,480
So you have to smoke it.

1982
01:52:30,010 --> 01:52:33,780
He can't orally consume DMT and less
like the way they do it in the, uh,

1983
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:37,520
in Peru and the Amazon, they, they
make this stuff called Iowasca.

1984
01:52:37,550 --> 01:52:39,440
You know what that is?
And with Iowasca,

1985
01:52:39,441 --> 01:52:41,390
what they've done is
they put in one plant,

1986
01:52:41,720 --> 01:52:45,920
they put one plant that has DMT in it
and another plant that has an inhibitor.

1987
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:48,370
And that's why it works.
So you can't really lick a frog.

1988
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:50,870
Cause if you lick a frog would just be
like eating. It wouldn't work. Right.

1989
01:52:51,010 --> 01:52:55,790
So what you do is you take the frog
and you put it on a glass, you know,

1990
01:52:55,791 --> 01:53:00,791
and you make the frog excrete his body
ages all over this glass and this body

1991
01:53:00,820 --> 01:53:03,890
just I guess just as certain
animals that kills him, kill sheep.

1992
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:06,920
If they ate five Meo DMT kills them.
So you take any,

1993
01:53:06,921 --> 01:53:10,670
excrete it on the glass and then you
stick the glass in the sun and it dries it

1994
01:53:10,671 --> 01:53:13,580
out and then you scrape it off with
a razor blade and then you smoke it.

1995
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:18,320
That's how do you think the some I
figured out how they figured out anything

1996
01:53:18,321 --> 01:53:22,730
that'd be figured out to eat lobsters,
you know? I mean I get that. Makes Sense.

1997
01:53:23,240 --> 01:53:26,210
Let's see if we can get this
thing. You're like, ah, you know,

1998
01:53:26,211 --> 01:53:31,130
like I wonder what this just on the back
of my fat guys, if I try and smoke it,

1999
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:33,410
let me see if I stuck it up mass.

2000
01:53:34,010 --> 01:53:38,180
How many steps were there before he tried
smoking? He had to figure it out. Right?

2001
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:41,870
I bet it's fairly recent.
I bet the smoking it off the frogs.

2002
01:53:41,871 --> 01:53:45,500
I bet it's probably pretty recent. There's
a bunch of different types of, uh, of,

2003
01:53:45,501 --> 01:53:48,230
of DMT out there too. That was one of
the things they were talking about.

2004
01:53:48,231 --> 01:53:52,250
Like different people have different
experiences depending on what plant they

2005
01:53:52,251 --> 01:53:55,760
use when they make Iowasca
cause if they use Syrian Rue,

2006
01:53:55,761 --> 01:53:58,010
I was listening to some guy talking
about this on the Internet and some

2007
01:53:58,011 --> 01:54:01,580
interesting discussion about it.
And if you use Syrian Rue,

2008
01:54:01,581 --> 01:54:04,370
apparently they have
all this like, um, uh,

2009
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:09,170
Annunaki imagery and all this Mesopotamia
imagery. You get all this, like it's,

2010
01:54:09,171 --> 01:54:12,470
they all have snakes. That's one
thing they share in common, but it's,

2011
01:54:12,530 --> 01:54:16,610
when you get it from the Amazon,
you see black people and Jaguars,

2012
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:21,350
you see like jungle themes you see like
plants and shit and like a big jump.

2013
01:54:21,590 --> 01:54:24,140
But when you get it in
the, uh, the Middle East,

2014
01:54:24,230 --> 01:54:27,170
the stuff you're getting is all
like fucking Mesopotamia Shit.

2015
01:54:27,410 --> 01:54:28,940
It's all like Babylonia,

2016
01:54:29,180 --> 01:54:32,660
all that cuneiform tablets
and that kind of imagery.

2017
01:54:32,750 --> 01:54:35,750
You get in the San Fernando Valley,
you see Carl's Jr's

2018
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:41,240
traffic Zang, old cars
with little tires. Yeah.

2019
01:54:42,350 --> 01:54:45,590
Yeah. It's, uh, the, the
idea of, uh, you know,

2020
01:54:45,650 --> 01:54:48,710
keeping psychedelics from
people by locking them up.

2021
01:54:48,740 --> 01:54:52,670
It is amazing that they've been able
to do that for that long that they have

2022
01:54:52,850 --> 01:54:56,600
been able to keep them illegal.
And then if people try to use them,

2023
01:54:56,601 --> 01:55:00,850
if you want to use it for your own
edification, for your own, you know,

2024
01:55:01,670 --> 01:55:05,960
your own experience, it's illegal
for you yourself to do something.

2025
01:55:06,110 --> 01:55:09,230
Some person will come and get
you and lock you in a cage.

2026
01:55:09,310 --> 01:55:10,610
Where could you imagine if it was only us?

2027
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:12,920
Look and there's only the three of us
were the only people left on the earth.

2028
01:55:13,310 --> 01:55:18,230
And um, we discovered while we were here
that there is some shit that makes you

2029
01:55:18,290 --> 01:55:22,130
experience like these incredible states
of consciousness and you start having

2030
01:55:22,131 --> 01:55:25,940
this wave of creativity in these new
ideas and it feels like an incredibly

2031
01:55:25,941 --> 01:55:30,410
intelligent alien lifeforms communicating
with you. And then we were like,

2032
01:55:30,411 --> 01:55:32,750
you can't do that dude. You
can't do that. If you do that,

2033
01:55:32,751 --> 01:55:35,630
we're going to kill you or lock you in
a cage and we're going to contain you.

2034
01:55:36,170 --> 01:55:39,410
We can't have you running around having
an experience and it just running around.

2035
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:41,270
You're not doing anything to anybody else.

2036
01:55:41,390 --> 01:55:42,950
You're getting it and then you're doing.

2037
01:55:43,110 --> 01:55:46,650
And if you do it and you test positive
for it, you are, you are against the law.

2038
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:51,010
Well, let's imagine that. Let's
say we just in this house,

2039
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:55,360
there was a creature
in a weird outfit did,

2040
01:55:55,361 --> 01:55:59,500
if he caught any of us smoking pot
would come and grab us and take us to a

2041
01:55:59,501 --> 01:56:02,050
certain part of the house
and put us in a rape cage.

2042
01:56:02,620 --> 01:56:06,130
We would stop that animal. Kill
it. You kill it. You'd be like,

2043
01:56:06,131 --> 01:56:10,420
you know what the thing that's taking
us and putting us in the rape cage, um,

2044
01:56:10,450 --> 01:56:12,400
there's only one of them
and there's three of us.

2045
01:56:12,401 --> 01:56:16,330
So I don't want to go on that rape cage
again. Can we please make it? Can you,

2046
01:56:16,360 --> 01:56:20,150
can you, can we get rid of
the guy who takes us into the
rape cage? Yeah. It's like

2047
01:56:20,690 --> 01:56:23,090
we're trying to be enlightened
here and we keep getting raped.

2048
01:56:26,020 --> 01:56:26,853
Well,
yeah,

2049
01:56:27,060 --> 01:56:31,760
try to fucking take pay Odeon communicate
with the spirit world and someone

2050
01:56:31,761 --> 01:56:34,130
keeps throwing me a cage of some
big black dude. What the fuck man?

2051
01:56:35,180 --> 01:56:37,700
What the hell man, why does it
have to be a black dude? Why?

2052
01:56:37,701 --> 01:56:41,510
Because they probably would win
more often. Why the better rapers

2053
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,800
athletes?
Oh Man.

2054
01:56:45,830 --> 01:56:50,270
Yeah. It's a, it's a, it's
a real confusing situation.
And whenever you a year,

2055
01:56:50,740 --> 01:56:51,110
you know,

2056
01:56:51,110 --> 01:56:55,520
leave Baka talking about how he's just
going to keep arresting people or anytime

2057
01:56:55,521 --> 01:57:00,140
you hear or like in Mexico and they're
like, they just found 500 yeah.

2058
01:57:00,160 --> 01:57:02,550
Tons of marijuana. Do you hear
about that? Yeah. Biggest,

2059
01:57:02,570 --> 01:57:07,060
biggest cash crop ever that they
hauled in. They busted. Yeah.

2060
01:57:07,150 --> 01:57:10,870
It's just, it's just, I mean, less
Mexican weed. That stuff sucks.

2061
01:57:11,530 --> 01:57:14,800
Your weed sucks. If you weed was good,
you want to be shooting each other. Yeah,

2062
01:57:17,320 --> 01:57:21,070
that's true. Mexican weeds, the
worst. No Brazilian weeds the worst.

2063
01:57:21,071 --> 01:57:23,770
And I was in Brazil, we got some
weight. It was a intellect. A little,

2064
01:57:23,980 --> 01:57:26,980
it was like almost like particle board.
It was like a little brick. Yeah.

2065
01:57:27,050 --> 01:57:29,650
Little Sin.
Very tightly compact brick.

2066
01:57:29,860 --> 01:57:31,840
And you had to break it
off and then smoke it.

2067
01:57:31,841 --> 01:57:35,170
AIDS tastes like shit and it smelled
like shit and you barely got hot.

2068
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:39,670
It's like a cousin of high. It wasn't
like real high, nothing like we have here.

2069
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:43,240
You would take God, these
people are living in the
forest, the rainforest rather.

2070
01:57:43,630 --> 01:57:46,900
Beautiful Tropical Paradise. You know how
easy it would be for them to grow weed.

2071
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:48,393
They keep it illegal.

2072
01:57:48,420 --> 01:57:51,670
That's how it was in Bahamas to
same thing. Really. Bahamas shit.

2073
01:57:51,950 --> 01:57:56,630
Isn't that amazing? What the fuck
is that about man? You know? I mean,

2074
01:57:56,631 --> 01:57:59,960
how do they not rebel against that?
Prostitution is legal in Brazil.

2075
01:58:00,260 --> 01:58:03,140
Cage fighting's everywhere.
That's the birth of valley.

2076
01:58:03,141 --> 01:58:06,800
Tuto five the birth of no rules fighting
and somehow or another they keep potty

2077
01:58:06,801 --> 01:58:08,770
illegal.
It's an interesting,

2078
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:12,770
well, yeah, I mean it's the big, it's the,
it's the elephant in the room everywhere.

2079
01:58:12,771 --> 01:58:16,990
It's just, yeah. That to me is the
criteria through which you can measure it.

2080
01:58:17,060 --> 01:58:22,060
How far a society's advanced is their
relationship with psychoactive drugs.

2081
01:58:22,130 --> 01:58:25,940
[inaudible] says everything because
it's like anyone who does a psychoactive

2082
01:58:25,941 --> 01:58:29,910
drug knows you. It's fun. It is fun.

2083
01:58:29,970 --> 01:58:32,730
This is the poor.
The podcast will always click off.

2084
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:37,560
I was hoping you would talk about
the first UFC, which bode clear. No.

2085
01:58:37,561 --> 01:58:41,770
To me, it a Hippie faggot and he
wants to talk about is fucking

2086
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:43,750
pro drug bullshit.

2087
01:58:44,930 --> 01:58:47,380
That's the only reason why we're talking
about drugs at all is because drugs are

2088
01:58:47,381 --> 01:58:50,920
part of life. That's the only reason.
If drugs weren't drugs, if they were,

2089
01:58:52,150 --> 01:58:53,580
if there was some new word,
it's a,

2090
01:58:53,581 --> 01:58:57,490
it's a part of life and a
fucking significant one.
Yep. That's a gateway drug.

2091
01:58:58,160 --> 01:59:01,160
It's all fucking gateway drugs
got damn and everything's out.

2092
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:05,470
Drug milk is a gateway drug to
cookies. It's, you know it is.

2093
01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:08,620
Drink some milk. He's like, Oh, I'm just
going to be to have cookies and this shit.

2094
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:11,650
The next thing you're eating cookies,
the milk got you. Eat Cookies.

2095
01:59:11,651 --> 01:59:15,130
Cookies are bad for you. Cookies of sugar
in it. You're going to get diabetes.

2096
01:59:15,131 --> 01:59:19,150
You're gonna fucking die young to smoke
or eat cookies whenever we want. Yeah,

2097
01:59:19,210 --> 01:59:23,470
that's right, bitch. There's people that
want to let mandate against fatty foods.

2098
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:24,900
They want to,
I want to say that food should,

2099
01:59:24,901 --> 01:59:28,150
shouldn't have a certain amount of
calories or fat content or you know,

2100
01:59:28,360 --> 01:59:31,870
bad oils or whatever. Fuck
that man. If it tastes good,

2101
01:59:31,871 --> 01:59:33,730
just let me know what it's gonna do to me.
If I ate it,

2102
01:59:33,790 --> 01:59:37,620
I'll make my own decisions. Your
space suit, you get to Iran,

2103
01:59:37,630 --> 01:59:39,300
whatever fuel you want through it,

2104
01:59:39,301 --> 01:59:43,750
it doesn't matter what it is and if
sometimes that fuel kills you. Tough Shit.

2105
01:59:44,190 --> 01:59:48,130
Tough Shit. That's the way it goes.
What I say? So give me it all man.

2106
01:59:48,131 --> 01:59:50,680
Let it leave it all on the table.
Let's fucking sort it all out.

2107
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:53,500
I don't want my kids to get hooked on it.
Neither do you write good.

2108
01:59:53,501 --> 01:59:55,660
So let's educate her fucking kids.
All right,

2109
01:59:55,661 --> 01:59:58,420
let's educate our kids and let's get rid
of the scumbags and want to push it on

2110
01:59:58,421 --> 02:00:00,880
kids. Get rid of people that
are, you know, don't make it.

2111
02:00:00,950 --> 02:00:02,530
Don't make it illegal
to sell the children.

2112
02:00:02,531 --> 02:00:05,710
Don't make it legal to give
them propaganda that makes
them think that drugs are

2113
02:00:05,711 --> 02:00:06,340
good.

2114
02:00:06,340 --> 02:00:10,540
But you know the whole idea behind
locking anyone up for doing anything that

2115
02:00:10,541 --> 02:00:13,210
they want to do.
As long as they're informed and a of age,

2116
02:00:14,090 --> 02:00:15,400
we can do what you want to do,
man.

2117
02:00:15,560 --> 02:00:18,820
If you want to start smoking
crack in 2010 he lives,

2118
02:00:18,821 --> 02:00:21,430
you're like a successful person who's
got a good business on a nice family.

2119
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:24,910
Like I've always wanted to try
crack. I just saw, you know, I mean,

2120
02:00:24,911 --> 02:00:27,940
I see new Jack City. It's so
appealing. I know it sounds crazy,

2121
02:00:28,150 --> 02:00:32,620
but there's just like part of me. It's
been missing. Southbank Ip crack. Yeah.

2122
02:00:32,860 --> 02:00:34,390
I want to try and crack once.

2123
02:00:34,540 --> 02:00:37,930
I don't think I'm going to wind up in
a fucking crack house with no money.

2124
02:00:38,050 --> 02:00:42,250
I mean, come on Mike. I'm Sigma
Phi. We went to school together.

2125
02:00:42,340 --> 02:00:46,840
We played the costs. I'm not a crack
head. I just want to try crack.

2126
02:00:47,140 --> 02:00:50,170
Julie doesn't want me to do it,
but I told her, hey, don't worry.

2127
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:54,310
That's on happening. No,
why not? I did it. Why not?

2128
02:00:55,020 --> 02:00:59,360
You did do crack, man. We talked
about this before. No, I haven't.

2129
02:01:00,010 --> 02:01:04,390
No, I haven't, but I did. I
did. Um, when I was, uh, why
are you saying that he didn't?

2130
02:01:04,391 --> 02:01:09,010
Because he acts like a crack it when I
was not that it really offended you are

2131
02:01:09,011 --> 02:01:11,950
ruthless where you're
cut downs Brah you know,

2132
02:01:12,030 --> 02:01:15,950
they come so fast and so unexpected and
they're so powerful when they land. Yeah.

2133
02:01:15,951 --> 02:01:19,720
It's just incredible. You really
thank God you doing comedy again

2134
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:25,780
company again? No, I useless.
Ruthless Brian. I'm just kidding.

2135
02:01:25,870 --> 02:01:29,710
I heard him but I have, I have
bought crack. I when I was really,

2136
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:33,700
when I was living in crowded one side
fucking food away, I didn't even want it.

2137
02:01:34,470 --> 02:01:36,790
I looked at him like, what the fuck is
this? I'm going to do crack come out.

2138
02:01:36,791 --> 02:01:40,100
Really guys, guys,
really? I just moved to La

2139
02:01:40,370 --> 02:01:42,560
and my landlord was a crack head wound.

2140
02:01:42,590 --> 02:01:45,410
He had a friend who would do crack
with them now. I didn't know,

2141
02:01:45,530 --> 02:01:46,850
I knew that he was into drugs.

2142
02:01:46,851 --> 02:01:50,060
I didn't know it was crack and his friend
was over and his friend said to me,

2143
02:01:50,420 --> 02:01:54,110
you have a copter, a rock
before. And I, I swear to God,

2144
02:01:54,111 --> 02:01:57,920
I didn't know what he meant, but I
wanted to seem cool. So I was like, no,

2145
02:01:58,160 --> 02:02:00,590
never copped the rock where I wasn't
sure what he meant. He's like,

2146
02:02:00,870 --> 02:02:05,210
give me a ride. So I, he's like, drive
up here, turn right. I turned right,

2147
02:02:05,211 --> 02:02:08,690
drive around the corner, drove around the
corner, we pull up in front of a house.

2148
02:02:08,870 --> 02:02:12,410
These two fucking gangsters
come running out of the house.

2149
02:02:12,411 --> 02:02:15,200
I don't know what it is,
but they're automatically
screaming at him. They're like,

2150
02:02:15,201 --> 02:02:18,770
you stupid mother fucker. You fucking
idiot. Don't just fucking pull up here.

2151
02:02:18,920 --> 02:02:23,590
They throw crack into the car. He gives
them money. I'm like that. And you know,

2152
02:02:23,630 --> 02:02:26,990
that's when I was like, Oh, you, you
more on? What do you think this was?

2153
02:02:27,260 --> 02:02:31,700
Drove or drove back? Well, you know,
like really, what'd you think? And um,

2154
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:36,650
drove back, uh, and, and him
and my landlord proceeded
to smoke crack together.

2155
02:02:36,651 --> 02:02:40,190
And that's the only time I've ever seen
anyone smoke crack. So shitty smells,

2156
02:02:40,191 --> 02:02:44,660
smells like burning plastic. The guy's
face got all pale. And he was like,

2157
02:02:45,320 --> 02:02:47,420
if I have a heart attack,
call nine one one. Wow,

2158
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:53,650
whoa, whoa. No, I didn't suck.

2159
02:02:53,660 --> 02:02:56,290
I remember the first time I
ever saw someone smoking crack,

2160
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:57,880
it was like on HBO or something like that.

2161
02:02:57,881 --> 02:03:00,850
It's like some sort of documentary
and while the guy was smoking crack,

2162
02:03:00,851 --> 02:03:04,800
I was like looking at him. He's fine.
He's not even going crazy. Yeah,

2163
02:03:04,900 --> 02:03:06,010
I thought you smoked crack.

2164
02:03:06,230 --> 02:03:09,090
[inaudible]

2165
02:03:10,230 --> 02:03:13,860
fuck man. Does this get crazy?
Know the guy just smoking crack.

2166
02:03:13,861 --> 02:03:15,000
He's just sitting there and I'm like,

2167
02:03:15,001 --> 02:03:18,330
how high could he possibly like a speedy
high? That's all it is. It's like, Ooh,

2168
02:03:18,331 --> 02:03:22,710
I'm feeling speedy. You feel better
if you like, that kind of thing.

2169
02:03:22,711 --> 02:03:25,800
It was not my thing.
Is it like coffee? No,

2170
02:03:25,801 --> 02:03:30,660
it's like doing like doing cocaine pretty
much always reminds me of exactly of

2171
02:03:30,661 --> 02:03:35,190
doing cocaine. That's pretty much
what it was. Ugh, wow. Never done it.

2172
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:39,570
Never done it. Dodge that bullet.
Don't do it. I'm not going to,

2173
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:43,320
I think it might be what? The
funding research? No, I'm not.

2174
02:03:43,321 --> 02:03:46,380
I'm not interested in hanging out the
pilot. I'll see any cocaine advocates.

2175
02:03:46,381 --> 02:03:50,100
I don't see any cocaine people going,
I made it because of cocaine.

2176
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:54,960
Cocaine's responsible for most of my
energetic decisions. Most of my drive,

2177
02:03:54,990 --> 02:03:58,140
most of my wisdom when I
innovating on a beach town,

2178
02:03:58,141 --> 02:04:01,260
you'll start getting in that, that
group of people that were like, no,

2179
02:04:01,261 --> 02:04:04,690
I prefer a cocaine when I go
out. You know, it's a nice drug.

2180
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:08,650
You will have people that are
selling it to like civilized cocaine.

2181
02:04:08,670 --> 02:04:12,870
People always one up shooting each other.
They just get crazy cocaine,

2182
02:04:12,871 --> 02:04:16,050
relationships, cocaine people. They
just get to that fucking point,

2183
02:04:16,051 --> 02:04:19,310
that Goodfellas point.
Like when that fucking chick throws the,

2184
02:04:19,311 --> 02:04:23,940
the basket at Ray Liotta
that she's cooking the coke
for him and she throws the

2185
02:04:23,941 --> 02:04:27,120
basket as [inaudible] mad at him.
They always get to that.

2186
02:04:27,210 --> 02:04:30,930
I was, um, I was just telling him
about this, that I had this, one of,

2187
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:34,500
one of the first girls I dated
was in Asheville, North Carolina,

2188
02:04:34,501 --> 02:04:38,130
and I met her and this little,
because she was sitting at,

2189
02:04:38,131 --> 02:04:41,940
they just done cocaine and she was
sitting next to this blonde girl and the

2190
02:04:41,941 --> 02:04:46,890
blonde girls like all coked up and
she's like, we're gonna run this town.

2191
02:04:47,740 --> 02:04:49,440
They can,
small mouth

2192
02:04:53,670 --> 02:04:57,990
run Asheville. It's
like 600 population. Oh,

2193
02:04:57,991 --> 02:05:00,270
that's hilarious. Yeah.
But that's what it does.

2194
02:05:00,271 --> 02:05:04,320
Asheville supposed to be really cool.
It's the coolest city ever. It really is.

2195
02:05:04,321 --> 02:05:06,930
And it keeps getting cooler and
cooler and cooler. I haven't know.

2196
02:05:07,050 --> 02:05:08,520
Every time I go back there,

2197
02:05:08,850 --> 02:05:13,350
it's just gotten more interesting
and more subversive and really, yeah,

2198
02:05:13,351 --> 02:05:17,730
it's a really cool place. We should do
comedy there. Are you and me? I'd love it.

2199
02:05:17,770 --> 02:05:21,930
Yeah. Yeah. There's a club up there. Okay.
Talk in trust. So we're going on the road.

2200
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:25,650
All right. You got to go do it. That'd
be good. That'd be good one for you too.

2201
02:05:25,651 --> 02:05:28,650
You're, you're acting so fucking weird.
It'll fit right in with those hippies. Oh,

2202
02:05:28,651 --> 02:05:32,310
there. I mean, it's not hippies.
It's an arc is up there.
It's everybody. It's every,

2203
02:05:32,311 --> 02:05:34,020
it's just a way,
it's a mix of like,

2204
02:05:34,021 --> 02:05:35,470
I don't know how to enter
because you're talking about,

2205
02:05:35,480 --> 02:05:36,810
I believe there's a lot of uh,

2206
02:05:36,860 --> 02:05:40,200
environmental Liberation Front
type people in there, but I'm not,

2207
02:05:40,230 --> 02:05:43,390
I'm not positive about that. So people
who live in Azure, I don't know, easy

2208
02:05:43,780 --> 02:05:48,180
bags. The problem with the, you know,
the really radical organizations,

2209
02:05:48,181 --> 02:05:51,840
like almost all of it, even though change
does need to occur at the very top,

2210
02:05:51,841 --> 02:05:54,540
like if you get to the top of pita and
you find out fucking none of these guys

2211
02:05:54,541 --> 02:05:57,600
are. Yeah. You know, you get to the
top of any of these, like major,

2212
02:05:57,660 --> 02:06:01,590
like what does that Animal Liberation
Organization? Yes, it is. Well,

2213
02:06:01,591 --> 02:06:04,470
it's the people who wet the animals free.

2214
02:06:04,530 --> 02:06:07,350
There's a lot of people that don't even
think that animals should be pets that

2215
02:06:07,351 --> 02:06:07,861
they did all,

2216
02:06:07,861 --> 02:06:10,680
all animals should be free to go where
they want that you shouldn't be keeping

2217
02:06:10,681 --> 02:06:11,960
them locked up in cages and yeah.

2218
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:16,430
Yeah, yeah. There's some, there's
some, yeah, that's great animals.

2219
02:06:16,431 --> 02:06:20,320
Just run her dogs running around fucking
everywhere. Oh my Chihuahua Mayor Qd.

2220
02:06:20,321 --> 02:06:22,670
She shouldn't be a, yeah,
that would be cool though.

2221
02:06:22,671 --> 02:06:24,220
You get like a new dog every day,

2222
02:06:24,290 --> 02:06:26,300
which is kind of dog I'm going
to hang out with today. Oh,

2223
02:06:26,301 --> 02:06:30,410
there's a golden retriever. Hey doggy,
come over. Yeah, fair. What stood

2224
02:06:30,410 --> 02:06:32,540
out here where I live,
because there's a lot of coyotes.

2225
02:06:32,541 --> 02:06:35,690
I see coyotes all the time,
which is a really strange thing.

2226
02:06:35,691 --> 02:06:39,730
It's like the cousin to a dog. Like
a dog didn't quite make it, you know,

2227
02:06:39,731 --> 02:06:44,000
and to the group got cast them the outside
of man and now it just follows around

2228
02:06:44,001 --> 02:06:45,750
and man encroaches on its territory.

2229
02:06:45,751 --> 02:06:50,690
So it comes in and eats cats and shit
every now and then. Dogs, cats, dogs, man.

2230
02:06:50,900 --> 02:06:55,220
There's a story. When I used to go
to this, a pet store near my house,

2231
02:06:55,221 --> 02:06:58,570
there was a guy who used to work there
that train dogs and he had this dog that

2232
02:06:58,580 --> 02:07:02,390
he worked as a veterinarian assistant.
This dog got brought into him, uh,

2233
02:07:02,391 --> 02:07:06,290
that was just covered in fucking cuts.
It was horrendous.

2234
02:07:06,550 --> 02:07:09,590
They had to put the dog under and
it was, it was uh, a big pit bull,

2235
02:07:09,620 --> 02:07:13,250
like a 90 pound pit bull. And they
were like, what did this to this dog?

2236
02:07:13,251 --> 02:07:15,570
Like he wants to gotten a big
dog fight with a bunch of dogs.

2237
02:07:15,571 --> 02:07:19,310
Like this dog is like covered with
hundreds and hundreds of wounds. Okay.

2238
02:07:19,311 --> 02:07:22,810
Like they then hours of stitches,
who knows how many. So they,

2239
02:07:22,811 --> 02:07:24,830
they take the dog and they stitch them up,

2240
02:07:24,831 --> 02:07:29,240
they put them in the veterinarian's
hospital and they go back to the scene of

2241
02:07:29,241 --> 02:07:30,710
the crime to figure out
what the fuck happened.

2242
02:07:30,950 --> 02:07:34,220
And they follow like a trail
of blood and like some,

2243
02:07:34,221 --> 02:07:35,710
they see some scuffle the woods.

2244
02:07:35,711 --> 02:07:37,390
So they go and figure out
what the fuck happened.

2245
02:07:37,660 --> 02:07:41,020
And there they find nine dead coyotes.

2246
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:47,140
And what what they do is one coyote will
come out and they'll show themselves

2247
02:07:47,410 --> 02:07:50,440
and then the dog will see that and bark
at it and the coyote will look like he's

2248
02:07:50,441 --> 02:07:54,160
going to run and the dog will have
instincts to chase and the coyote will run

2249
02:07:54,280 --> 02:07:56,570
and a dog will chase after him.
And as he chases after him,

2250
02:07:56,590 --> 02:07:58,810
then they ambush him with
the rest of the pack.

2251
02:07:58,870 --> 02:08:02,920
So they ambushed his pit bull and
it killed nine coyotes. Christ.

2252
02:08:02,950 --> 02:08:07,950
Could you imagine the look on the
coyotes faces when this fucking thing is

2253
02:08:08,231 --> 02:08:10,900
coming? I can't tell. Are we
ever going to fuck him up?

2254
02:08:10,901 --> 02:08:13,720
Mikey looking can fuck them up.
This is a pitch.

2255
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:18,680
You want some person who wants a coyote
and then they see this

2256
02:08:21,370 --> 02:08:26,370
big giant fucking fire hydrant head
muscles for crushing things built into its

2257
02:08:27,731 --> 02:08:32,260
fucking skull. The skull of a, a big
male, pitbull. Brian, what are you doing?

2258
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:35,410
Turn the volume back up the vines
and then through the headphone vine.

2259
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:37,990
What happened? I haven't changed a
thing. You just did something? No,

2260
02:08:38,110 --> 02:08:41,650
my volume just jacked. Oh,
you're just adjusted something.

2261
02:08:42,660 --> 02:08:46,370
I was turned down in the headphone
fine. Okay. All right. Point.

2262
02:08:46,900 --> 02:08:51,320
It didn't affect that podcast
point is that the, you know,

2263
02:08:51,670 --> 02:08:54,790
dog tried to kill coyotes.
Coyotes tried to kill the dog.

2264
02:08:55,480 --> 02:08:59,740
Man. That's, that's a, that's a
stupid fucking Kiowa. It's like,

2265
02:08:59,950 --> 02:09:04,670
here's what you do, Roger. You're
going to see a Chihuahua. Maybe

2266
02:09:04,810 --> 02:09:08,480
they just think dogs, man, they think
dogs are soft. But you know what?

2267
02:09:08,481 --> 02:09:11,450
Pitfalls are not regular dogs.
Those things are engineered first of all,

2268
02:09:11,451 --> 02:09:14,180
to fight through pain,
to not worry about their own instincts.

2269
02:09:14,181 --> 02:09:17,420
They were the ones that worry about their
own instincts. They don't let breed.

2270
02:09:17,870 --> 02:09:21,200
When the dogs quit, when the dogs give
up, they realize this other dog superior.

2271
02:09:21,350 --> 02:09:24,590
They never let that dog breed. And a
lot of times they kill them. You know,

2272
02:09:24,591 --> 02:09:25,460
it's pretty fucked up.

2273
02:09:25,700 --> 02:09:30,260
But what it makes at the end of the day
is this crazy fucking monster animal

2274
02:09:30,350 --> 02:09:34,400
that will do anything. You know the
pit bulls are like, that is the one

2275
02:09:34,450 --> 02:09:37,120
last dog you want. Come
on after you man. No Shit.

2276
02:09:37,121 --> 02:09:40,620
And like there's a guy in our neighborhood
walks his fucking pit bull off leash.

2277
02:09:40,700 --> 02:09:42,940
He told me about that.
It's awful.

2278
02:09:42,941 --> 02:09:45,510
It's like most of them are great
and people are getting, you know,

2279
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:48,310
a lot of people get scared. My dogs
great. Yes, most of them are great,

2280
02:09:48,540 --> 02:09:50,650
but you have to recognize the
potential for destruction.

2281
02:09:50,651 --> 02:09:53,610
If you've got a nutty one, donate their
brains also swell. No, that's fine.

2282
02:09:54,010 --> 02:09:58,130
That's bullshit. Bullshit. No,
no. That's all silliness. Ah,

2283
02:09:58,820 --> 02:10:01,300
they're, they're fucking crazy
dogs. They are sweet though.

2284
02:10:01,301 --> 02:10:04,450
Anytime I've been around someone's
pitfall, it's the sweetest dog ever.

2285
02:10:04,451 --> 02:10:07,240
I've never, everyone always says
no. It's the sweetest dog ever.

2286
02:10:07,241 --> 02:10:10,180
It's not like all of them. And then it
just takes one bad day and then it's like,

2287
02:10:10,181 --> 02:10:14,140
okay. It's crazy. Like they're nuts, man.
I've had a bunch of them, three of them,

2288
02:10:14,141 --> 02:10:14,860
four of them.

2289
02:10:14,860 --> 02:10:18,250
One of them got this temper and the
other ones there was all fighting.

2290
02:10:18,850 --> 02:10:22,300
They fight, they, they get
mad at each other. And you
know, if you have, you know,

2291
02:10:22,510 --> 02:10:23,343
more than one,

2292
02:10:23,350 --> 02:10:26,590
they get together sometimes and they
just settle arguments and one of them

2293
02:10:26,591 --> 02:10:28,580
doesn't want to back down. Next thing
you know, you've got a dead dog.

2294
02:10:29,460 --> 02:10:31,600
And these dogs loved each other
and live together all the time.

2295
02:10:31,601 --> 02:10:33,980
He used to lick each other and
play together. We wanted to

2296
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:38,060
kill each other. Huh? Yeah. It's horrible.
But this just, that's what it is, man.

2297
02:10:38,110 --> 02:10:41,690
It's just what it is. And now they're,
they're engineered to fight. You know,

2298
02:10:41,691 --> 02:10:43,170
and that's the problem.
They're,

2299
02:10:43,190 --> 02:10:48,140
they're engineered to not have like
normal Alpha Beta interactions where,

2300
02:10:48,141 --> 02:10:51,050
you know, the Beta gives up in the Alpha
dominates them and leaves them alone. No,

2301
02:10:51,051 --> 02:10:53,510
they fight to the death. All right?
They just go after it. You know,

2302
02:10:53,750 --> 02:10:57,230
sometimes I'd come home and it'd be all
bloody. So they worked it out. You know?

2303
02:10:57,290 --> 02:10:59,330
I'm like, well, I'm glad you're
assholes. Work this out. You know?

2304
02:10:59,331 --> 02:11:01,730
And I would just assume it
probably never happen again. Yeah,

2305
02:11:01,731 --> 02:11:05,340
of course it would rouse. Yeah.
Well, it's, you know, it's,

2306
02:11:05,360 --> 02:11:08,930
it's a fucking scary thing when you think
about what a dog really is because a

2307
02:11:08,931 --> 02:11:12,920
dog has just some fucking animal that
could kill you that you control. You know,

2308
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:17,150
you got a dog like that dog that
can kill nine type nine coyotes.

2309
02:11:18,260 --> 02:11:22,010
What a fantastic scene that must've
been coming up on that scene.

2310
02:11:22,190 --> 02:11:23,750
Just oh carnage.

2311
02:11:23,870 --> 02:11:27,800
Just coyote guts and coyote
faces jaws half hanging off,

2312
02:11:28,520 --> 02:11:29,181
you know?
I mean,

2313
02:11:29,181 --> 02:11:32,440
think about what that thing must've done
to those coyotes and they just bite at,

2314
02:11:32,450 --> 02:11:35,660
I'm Taryn skin and he's not even paying
attention. He's just jacking the next one

2315
02:11:36,670 --> 02:11:40,120
rage of frosting. Great.
It's probably hard, man.

2316
02:11:40,121 --> 02:11:44,590
I had this really spooky fucking thing
happened in my neighborhood where I was

2317
02:11:44,890 --> 02:11:48,370
walking my dog and this Weirdo
came up to me and he's like,

2318
02:11:49,360 --> 02:11:51,750
you should be careful with
your tires like high, oh,

2319
02:11:51,751 --> 02:11:55,180
he's in his name right there and
killing animals. And it was like an eye.

2320
02:11:55,200 --> 02:11:56,410
You didn't need to tell me that.

2321
02:11:56,411 --> 02:12:00,460
Like I understand it was just this weird
gaunt guy. And I started thinking like,

2322
02:12:00,700 --> 02:12:04,090
was that a serial killer?
I just run into a serial killer is like,

2323
02:12:04,470 --> 02:12:06,810
maybe it's just a nice guy.
I want you to look out for your dog.

2324
02:12:06,870 --> 02:12:09,250
No, cause he said, he like
says, you know, I've got,

2325
02:12:09,990 --> 02:12:13,320
was he whispering this into your ear?
Yeah, he said we got a problem. Yeah.

2326
02:12:13,321 --> 02:12:14,460
He kind of pointed at things like,
you know,

2327
02:12:14,461 --> 02:12:19,461
I've got problems but our
coyote attacks lately.

2328
02:12:19,950 --> 02:12:20,401
And you know,

2329
02:12:20,401 --> 02:12:23,580
like when you're around somebody you kind
of get the sense as a bad person like

2330
02:12:23,581 --> 02:12:27,150
you is it, it was something that,
something else that's wrong with it.

2331
02:12:27,151 --> 02:12:31,360
And then I remember walking up the street
a ways and there was just like, uh,

2332
02:12:31,780 --> 02:12:35,730
I limb of an animal. I don't know if it
was a rabbit or what the fuck it was,

2333
02:12:35,731 --> 02:12:38,340
but some limb that he gotten chopped off.
So I guess he's right.

2334
02:12:38,970 --> 02:12:39,650
I don't know if that name,

2335
02:12:39,650 --> 02:12:44,570
maybe he did it. What limb? Like a dog's
limb. Yeah. It was like a foot of a dog.

2336
02:12:44,600 --> 02:12:47,270
Yeah. I think it was a dog.
Yeah. Do this. No joke, man.

2337
02:12:47,271 --> 02:12:50,000
Coyote snatch right off
leashes. Yeah, in Brentwood.

2338
02:12:50,001 --> 02:12:51,260
A friend of mine was living in Brentwood.

2339
02:12:51,261 --> 02:12:54,770
He was walking his dog and the coyote
came and took it right off his fucking

2340
02:12:54,771 --> 02:12:57,920
leash and ran with it.
Ah, that's just snatched.

2341
02:12:57,921 --> 02:13:01,570
It came by and snatched it and ran
away. Was Dog screaming and Yiping, ah,

2342
02:13:01,670 --> 02:13:04,100
it's out of his hands and he's running
after it and you can't do a God damn

2343
02:13:04,101 --> 02:13:07,160
thing about it. Instead, when my dog
was a puppy, actually was worried about,

2344
02:13:07,170 --> 02:13:09,770
I said there was a lot of falcons that
were just hanging out in front of my

2345
02:13:09,771 --> 02:13:12,040
thing and they would like come
down real close. I'm like, okay,

2346
02:13:12,240 --> 02:13:16,220
some hawks come inside now I think
don't even live in this country.

2347
02:13:16,220 --> 02:13:20,140
Do they found thousands? I don't know. To
America, what am I talking? I don't know.

2348
02:13:20,150 --> 02:13:21,650
I think so. Either way. Birds of prey.

2349
02:13:21,800 --> 02:13:24,830
Were you the one that posted
that thing of the giant Eagle?

2350
02:13:25,140 --> 02:13:26,480
They didn't kill the animal,

2351
02:13:26,481 --> 02:13:30,020
but pushes it off a cliff and
then goes down and eat. Yeah,

2352
02:13:30,260 --> 02:13:33,030
they grabbed goats and dragged him off
the side of the cliff and drop them.

2353
02:13:33,090 --> 02:13:38,010
Awesome. Too Sane Dude. Eagles
are ruthless mother fuckers, dude.

2354
02:13:38,280 --> 02:13:41,580
They're so scary.
The idea of made it's a flying dinosaur.

2355
02:13:41,670 --> 02:13:43,140
That's really what it is.
I mean,

2356
02:13:43,141 --> 02:13:47,370
they have the same mentality that a
dinosaur would have, right? I mean,

2357
02:13:47,371 --> 02:13:50,790
when they say that birds, they say that
birds are the descendants of dinosaurs,

2358
02:13:50,791 --> 02:13:55,620
right? Whatever survived the big
Yucatan meteor impact, asteroid impact,

2359
02:13:55,770 --> 02:13:59,280
whatever survived, whatever, you
know, animal dinosaur species,

2360
02:13:59,400 --> 02:14:02,670
they eventually evolved into birds.
That's the theory, right, isn't it? Yep.

2361
02:14:03,270 --> 02:14:06,600
So that's the theory. Chickens grow
things every once in awhile, right?

2362
02:14:07,280 --> 02:14:11,160
Chickens do. Yeah. Yeah.
And so if that's the theory,

2363
02:14:11,190 --> 02:14:15,750
then you got to think that
the really ruthless ones
that we have today, you know,

2364
02:14:15,751 --> 02:14:17,310
like eagles and shit like that.

2365
02:14:17,490 --> 02:14:22,490
They were probably some nasty ass fucking
flying little dinosaur reptile thing

2366
02:14:23,731 --> 02:14:25,200
that made it,
you know,

2367
02:14:25,470 --> 02:14:30,470
live through the holocaust
of some gigantic chunk of
iron and rock slamming into

2368
02:14:31,891 --> 02:14:33,900
the earth at 45,000 miles an hour.

2369
02:14:34,110 --> 02:14:37,410
These ruthless little concert
lived and became eagles.

2370
02:14:39,120 --> 02:14:42,030
They weren't the only ones.
What a fucked up way to kill things too.

2371
02:14:42,210 --> 02:14:45,620
They fly out of the sky,
they're like dragons man.

2372
02:14:45,690 --> 02:14:48,750
They look like Dev Dragon clause and shit.
They don't spit out fire,

2373
02:14:48,751 --> 02:14:50,850
but that you take away
all the feathers and shit.

2374
02:14:50,851 --> 02:14:52,920
If they didn't have feathers and you
looked at them for what they wore

2375
02:14:52,921 --> 02:14:57,030
underneath that, all that pretty, you
know, soft exterior of the feathers.

2376
02:14:57,150 --> 02:14:59,760
That's a nasty, scaly, you know,

2377
02:14:59,761 --> 02:15:03,630
gray looking lizard thing that flies.
That's what it is.

2378
02:15:03,870 --> 02:15:06,810
I mean we think of them as being
soft and almost be a million.

2379
02:15:07,020 --> 02:15:10,950
You know what I'm saying? Those are
lizard things. Those aren't like, like,

2380
02:15:11,010 --> 02:15:12,840
like any fucking mammal.

2381
02:15:12,930 --> 02:15:17,100
That's a creepy alien looking
lizard thing with dead eyes.

2382
02:15:17,400 --> 02:15:19,350
Those eyes don't give a fuck about you.

2383
02:15:19,530 --> 02:15:23,880
And they come swooping out of the sky
to snatch fish out of the water and fly

2384
02:15:23,881 --> 02:15:26,970
with them and pull eagles
or pull polo rather, um, uh,

2385
02:15:27,030 --> 02:15:31,580
goats off the side of a fucking cliff
and drop them. Just ruthless cons.

2386
02:15:31,581 --> 02:15:34,620
They're like a little fucking
devil's little flying demons.

2387
02:15:35,550 --> 02:15:37,110
I the Noble Eagle.

2388
02:15:37,170 --> 02:15:42,170
I take offense at you disparaging or
Ruth Colker who could shed his grace on

2389
02:15:47,390 --> 02:15:51,270
thee.
Just evil flying lizard,

2390
02:15:52,530 --> 02:15:57,240
snatches fucking shit out of sky and eats
babies.

2391
02:15:57,241 --> 02:15:58,021
They'd probably babies.

2392
02:15:58,021 --> 02:16:01,470
I bet there's definitely been a baby
that got snapped up by an eagle course.

2393
02:16:01,590 --> 02:16:04,740
There's a fucking cool
video in, um, Alaska.

2394
02:16:04,830 --> 02:16:08,700
These people are in their yard and they
have this yard that's all this grass in

2395
02:16:08,701 --> 02:16:13,080
it and they throw out some fish like,
you know, the, after they made filets,

2396
02:16:13,081 --> 02:16:15,720
I throw it like heads and all
sorts of extra fish that they have.

2397
02:16:16,050 --> 02:16:19,080
And these eagles come out and they're
all eating in their yard and they've

2398
02:16:19,081 --> 02:16:21,060
gotten like fucking,
I don't know,

2399
02:16:21,061 --> 02:16:26,040
2030 bald eagles eating the
salmon in their yards. Like,

2400
02:16:26,041 --> 02:16:28,800
Whoa,
like this is nuts man.

2401
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:34,240
These crazy fucking demons with
pretty feathers. That'd be cool.

2402
02:16:34,390 --> 02:16:37,500
Get really stoned and watch an
eagle feast. Go on your backyard.

2403
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:42,370
Would, you know, seeing any natural,

2404
02:16:42,790 --> 02:16:46,840
any animal in its natural habitat
must be fucking incredible. You know,

2405
02:16:46,960 --> 02:16:49,660
like you run into a bear if you
actually did run into a bear.

2406
02:16:49,780 --> 02:16:51,310
I mean I ran into a bear at Yellowstone,

2407
02:16:51,430 --> 02:16:54,700
but it didn't feel like it was a natural
environment because they were coming up

2408
02:16:54,701 --> 02:16:58,180
to cars and it was obvious
that these bears had been
coming up to college before.

2409
02:16:58,180 --> 02:16:59,950
So it almost like felt like the zoo,

2410
02:16:59,980 --> 02:17:02,380
it didn't feel real and they
would tell you not to feed them,

2411
02:17:02,381 --> 02:17:05,260
but people were still feeding them.
They were like open their window of crack.

2412
02:17:05,261 --> 02:17:09,160
This is like the seventies. I did this
when I was a little kid, you know,

2413
02:17:09,161 --> 02:17:10,870
and I remember thinking like,
this is just like the zoo.

2414
02:17:10,871 --> 02:17:14,590
Like this isn't until we went to sleep,
we were in our sleeping bag and a,

2415
02:17:14,591 --> 02:17:18,830
we were camping and it was me and I think
it was just me and my stepdad. No, no,

2416
02:17:18,831 --> 02:17:22,050
it was a whole family.
So we're camping in Yellowstone and um,

2417
02:17:22,480 --> 02:17:23,830
I slept through the whole thing,

2418
02:17:24,010 --> 02:17:26,860
but apparently they heard
some banging around and shit.

2419
02:17:27,100 --> 02:17:31,600
And we got up there in the morning and
the cooler had been torn open and all the

2420
02:17:31,601 --> 02:17:35,230
food had been eaten and there
was paw prints all over the car.

2421
02:17:35,350 --> 02:17:38,230
So there's bear was just feet away,

2422
02:17:38,830 --> 02:17:41,680
just feet away from us sleeping
and signed some little Baggie.

2423
02:17:41,890 --> 02:17:44,140
We're basically like a
little dinner in a Baggie.

2424
02:17:44,260 --> 02:17:45,760
The whole family's in this baggy,

2425
02:17:45,880 --> 02:17:49,990
but these bears are so conditioned to
being around wasteful humans and sloppy

2426
02:17:49,991 --> 02:17:52,330
humans that they just look
for food that way. Right?

2427
02:17:52,331 --> 02:17:54,400
They're conditioned to go look in
your cooler. That's where the food is.

2428
02:17:54,610 --> 02:17:57,580
It's not like let's start eating
people. But if they did, they'd be like,

2429
02:17:57,581 --> 02:18:00,010
Holy Shit,
this is way better though in the bag.

2430
02:18:00,011 --> 02:18:02,140
They can't even get out of the bag.
You just start eating them.

2431
02:18:02,141 --> 02:18:05,640
You just jump in and start eating. They
can't get away, you know? I mean they,

2432
02:18:05,641 --> 02:18:09,430
they could do that. They were right
outside our door. Rip and shit apart.

2433
02:18:09,520 --> 02:18:12,100
So strong they could tear apart a cooler,
rip it open.

2434
02:18:12,620 --> 02:18:16,780
Sto stomped all over the car. Big
Ass paw prints. That's, to me,

2435
02:18:16,781 --> 02:18:21,310
that's like one that really is a shitty
death is getting, I mean, I like,

2436
02:18:21,570 --> 02:18:26,260
it's obvious to say, but compared to
other deaths, getting killed by an animal.

2437
02:18:27,130 --> 02:18:30,340
Yeah. How about the guy that just got
killed by a goat? What is that? I didn't,

2438
02:18:30,341 --> 02:18:32,560
I saw the link, but I didn't
click on it. What is that?

2439
02:18:32,650 --> 02:18:36,430
Goat jabbed him in the leg
and it penetrated one of his
arteries and he bled out.

2440
02:18:36,460 --> 02:18:40,780
That's bad luck. Goat apparently
was super aggressive. He had,

2441
02:18:40,810 --> 02:18:43,200
they'd had problems with
this go before and they, uh,

2442
02:18:43,240 --> 02:18:46,210
had done things to try to condition
the goat, stay away from people.

2443
02:18:46,420 --> 02:18:49,240
So they would go near the goat and shoot
it with like a beanbag gun and shit.

2444
02:18:49,480 --> 02:18:52,850
And that made the go even more douchey.
Cause don't go through stubbornness.

2445
02:18:52,870 --> 02:18:56,080
Fuck goats. Don't learn what they
should've done a shot at with a gun.

2446
02:18:56,110 --> 02:18:58,400
That's what they should've done.
You've got to go. That's continued.

2447
02:18:58,401 --> 02:19:01,030
Wants to Jack People. Yeah. Let's just
kill this fucking goat. All right.

2448
02:19:01,031 --> 02:19:03,870
There's plenty of other goats. Why we?
Why are we taking chances? Job Goshen.

2449
02:19:03,950 --> 02:19:05,710
Go shoot the goat with a bullying.

2450
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:08,890
Go bully the goat so that the goat
is scared of people. What is this?

2451
02:19:08,891 --> 02:19:12,160
A petting zoo. It's the mountains.
Oh, it was in the mountain? Yeah,

2452
02:19:12,161 --> 02:19:12,970
it's in the mountains.

2453
02:19:12,970 --> 02:19:17,920
So guys in the bands and goat comes
up and just fucking goes after him,

2454
02:19:17,950 --> 02:19:19,540
gets him in the leg,
the is fucked.

2455
02:19:19,541 --> 02:19:22,900
And then the goat won't let people take
away the body to go standing over him

2456
02:19:22,901 --> 02:19:25,030
while he's moaning. You
know, he's hasn't died yet.

2457
02:19:25,240 --> 02:19:28,040
So he's lying on his ground and they
can't the go to waste so they can

2458
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:32,040
save the guy. Go. I know. I mean
goats aren't that small. Goats.

2459
02:19:32,120 --> 02:19:36,920
Goats goat though. Say
that, bro. Go fuck you up.

2460
02:19:36,921 --> 02:19:39,200
Hey Man,
what's a wild don't a lot of goats.

2461
02:19:39,201 --> 02:19:43,340
You haven't been around a wild mountain.
Mountain Mountain. Go to scary dude.

2462
02:19:43,341 --> 02:19:44,540
Those things are strong as fuck.

2463
02:19:44,541 --> 02:19:46,550
You ever see how they can
climb up the side of mountains?

2464
02:19:46,790 --> 02:19:50,630
They climb on mountains. I mean like
this, like this incredible pitch.

2465
02:19:50,780 --> 02:19:53,900
It's like a fucking 60 degree angle there.
Climbing straight up a mountain.

2466
02:19:53,901 --> 02:19:57,320
You're like, how the fuck are they doing
this? That's the height of absurdity.

2467
02:19:57,321 --> 02:20:00,110
Like if you think about as
that man was laying there,

2468
02:20:00,111 --> 02:20:04,970
going into shock and contemplating his
whole life situation, going from being,

2469
02:20:04,971 --> 02:20:08,660
you know, then like, oh look, oh
my God, Mary, look, it's a goat.

2470
02:20:09,050 --> 02:20:13,450
Oh eight the goats coming. Oh Jesus
fucking Christ. Oh my God, I'm bleeding.

2471
02:20:14,460 --> 02:20:17,700
I get in a week.
What did I just get killed by?

2472
02:20:17,750 --> 02:20:22,070
Go get killed by go my Dick and run.
Yeah.

2473
02:20:22,071 --> 02:20:25,070
That's so absurd to think about that.
That's very strange.

2474
02:20:25,071 --> 02:20:29,420
How long in all of human history,
how many humans had been killed by goat?

2475
02:20:30,890 --> 02:20:33,730
Probably like, it's probably
pretty small. It's small.

2476
02:20:33,900 --> 02:20:37,910
The biggest thing in this
country for farm animals, pigs,

2477
02:20:38,600 --> 02:20:40,490
pigs kill more people than
any other farm animal.

2478
02:20:40,730 --> 02:20:42,350
Have you seen Jackass Three d yet?
No,

2479
02:20:42,351 --> 02:20:45,800
but apparently what happens with pigs
is they'll eat anything. And if you,

2480
02:20:45,801 --> 02:20:48,490
if you're feeding pigs and you
fall into the the police side,

2481
02:20:48,500 --> 02:20:53,460
they just start jacking you. Yet there's
my, my um, my parents have a place, uh,

2482
02:20:53,870 --> 02:20:57,770
on this like little island off the coast
of Georgia that's got wild pigs and

2483
02:20:57,771 --> 02:21:00,500
those things will kill you.
Like they're dangerous.

2484
02:21:00,501 --> 02:21:03,110
Wild pigs especially cause they
always have babies. And if you get,

2485
02:21:03,111 --> 02:21:06,620
it's the same thing. If you get around
their babies, they'll, they've got tusks,

2486
02:21:07,010 --> 02:21:10,760
they'll bite you in. They're, they're
filthy. So the vital get infected.

2487
02:21:10,761 --> 02:21:13,850
Even their pigs are dangerous.
Very ruthless.

2488
02:21:14,120 --> 02:21:16,610
Feral pigs are scary
because feral pigs change,

2489
02:21:16,611 --> 02:21:19,910
you know the story that if you get
like a pink pig that's in a, you know,

2490
02:21:19,911 --> 02:21:22,810
in a farm and it's kept well and fed well,

2491
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:24,350
they have a certain appearance to them.

2492
02:21:24,500 --> 02:21:29,150
Well when they get loose within three
weeks, their body starts to change.

2493
02:21:29,450 --> 02:21:31,220
It's a very strange phenomena.

2494
02:21:31,460 --> 02:21:36,460
The idea of a farm animal is like an
embryonic stage and all it has to do is

2495
02:21:37,161 --> 02:21:39,050
think that it has to fend for itself.
Yeah.

2496
02:21:39,060 --> 02:21:40,550
And then it becomes this different thing.

2497
02:21:40,551 --> 02:21:44,780
It's like some new chemical gets released
and it's for becomes thick and Harry

2498
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:48,300
like thick and like darker and
then its tusks grow. It changed,

2499
02:21:48,320 --> 02:21:52,160
literally changes the animal. It's
a fascinating metamorphosis. Yeah.

2500
02:21:52,580 --> 02:21:54,470
And it happens within three weeks.

2501
02:21:54,920 --> 02:21:57,170
Within three weeks of the
animal becoming feral,

2502
02:21:57,200 --> 02:22:00,800
they just get loose and then they
start morphing fucking nutty shit.

2503
02:22:00,830 --> 02:22:04,490
That's Nutty, nutty shit.
Like what's happening there?

2504
02:22:05,060 --> 02:22:06,860
What's that saying about people,
you know,

2505
02:22:06,861 --> 02:22:09,860
are we not reaching our full potential
because we get our food from a

2506
02:22:09,861 --> 02:22:12,590
supermarket and you know, are we
are, you know what I'm saying?

2507
02:22:12,810 --> 02:22:16,190
[inaudible] we set up that way.
That's a great like weird Saifai idea,

2508
02:22:16,191 --> 02:22:20,870
which is like a space ship finally makes
it out of the Earth's gravitational

2509
02:22:20,871 --> 02:22:23,060
field and get to a certain
distance away from Earth.

2510
02:22:23,061 --> 02:22:26,400
And the people on the spaceship
start changing like their body

2511
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:30,900
start elongating the aliens.
Oh my God.

2512
02:22:31,080 --> 02:22:35,130
The more they more for like the pigs.
Yeah, look, if you go into space,

2513
02:22:35,131 --> 02:22:38,020
that's the next stage. Yeah. That's
the next stage. It's like, uh,

2514
02:22:38,040 --> 02:22:42,500
the like the aquatic worm jumping
into the pawn to give spaces.

2515
02:22:42,510 --> 02:22:46,320
The next stage we're just like, we're
here. We're just like squashed aliens.

2516
02:22:46,321 --> 02:22:50,190
Like the gravity squashed his dad
when we get off the plan and you know,

2517
02:22:50,191 --> 02:22:53,790
there's certain salamanders that never
reached adulthood unless exert certain

2518
02:22:53,791 --> 02:22:55,830
environmental conditions are in place.

2519
02:22:56,400 --> 02:23:00,330
Like weather conditions are like
temperature, moisture, you know,

2520
02:23:00,331 --> 02:23:04,290
certain conditions have to be in place
otherwise they stay in the immature phase

2521
02:23:04,291 --> 02:23:05,250
their entire life.

2522
02:23:05,730 --> 02:23:08,650
How fascinating would that be if
that's what the thing with humans is,

2523
02:23:08,651 --> 02:23:11,700
is once you get off the earth,
once you go into space,

2524
02:23:11,920 --> 02:23:16,920
then the different gravity and environment
of space allows your body to knock

2525
02:23:16,951 --> 02:23:19,860
out of the human shell and
become this next thing. Third,

2526
02:23:19,861 --> 02:23:22,020
I start secreted already know that,
right?

2527
02:23:22,021 --> 02:23:24,330
Because the people in the
space be smart as fuck.

2528
02:23:24,660 --> 02:23:28,140
People that got back from the space
station will be dropping science on far

2529
02:23:28,141 --> 02:23:32,590
enough. People in the space station,
they're still on the gravitational what?

2530
02:23:32,740 --> 02:23:36,780
[inaudible] there's a lot of
what ifs. Every week, man.

2531
02:23:37,380 --> 02:23:40,950
I blamed the weed would
if, man, if we go to space,

2532
02:23:40,951 --> 02:23:43,990
we turned into a frog and then
you smoke yourself with the front,

2533
02:23:44,010 --> 02:23:48,480
wants to suck my Dick shot that up.
Chips seem pretty happy.

2534
02:23:49,680 --> 02:23:54,680
So it was on this flight to London and
Melanie Griffith was on the flight and

2535
02:23:55,441 --> 02:23:58,890
uh, Melanie Griffith is a very
nice lady. She seems very sweet.

2536
02:23:58,891 --> 02:24:02,730
Like she smiles at everybody. She's like,
she seems nice. And uh, I was thinking,

2537
02:24:02,731 --> 02:24:04,500
man, this is Melanie
Griffin. Like, you know,

2538
02:24:04,501 --> 02:24:07,470
I remember her old school
from like the 80s, you know,

2539
02:24:07,471 --> 02:24:10,410
some of those movies that she was in. You
know, I remember when she played, I mean,

2540
02:24:10,411 --> 02:24:15,210
even recently when she played. Um,
and uh, the thing about the guy who,

2541
02:24:15,211 --> 02:24:18,030
uh, William Randolph Hearst, what
was the movie about? Was it called?

2542
02:24:18,060 --> 02:24:20,530
It was about him.
It was about the constraint.

2543
02:24:20,531 --> 02:24:23,850
The making of Rosebud or the
making of a citizen Kane. It was,

2544
02:24:24,660 --> 02:24:28,500
Orson Welles was in it and it was all
about how crazy we ran our first wasn't

2545
02:24:28,501 --> 02:24:31,420
she played his wife. I'm like, she's
like, so it's a good actor, you know,

2546
02:24:31,421 --> 02:24:33,210
a an actress. So anyway, she's,

2547
02:24:33,240 --> 02:24:37,230
she's on this plane and
I ate a cookie like, um,

2548
02:24:37,500 --> 02:24:38,820
two hours before the flight.

2549
02:24:38,850 --> 02:24:43,600
I figured like I'll eat it in the car
over there and then right when I get on

2550
02:24:43,620 --> 02:24:47,580
board it'll kick in and it was
way too strong. Why would you

2551
02:24:49,080 --> 02:24:51,570
get that? It was so strong,
dude. It was so strong.

2552
02:24:51,571 --> 02:24:53,640
I was breaking down my entire life.

2553
02:24:53,641 --> 02:24:54,960
I was thinking about
everything I've ever done,

2554
02:24:55,200 --> 02:24:57,000
every every negative
thing that I've ever done,

2555
02:24:57,001 --> 02:24:58,350
every positive thing that I've ever done.

2556
02:24:58,530 --> 02:25:01,380
And then I started thinking about
the possibility of endless universes.

2557
02:25:01,500 --> 02:25:05,340
The possibility of every single choice
leads you into another parallel universe

2558
02:25:05,341 --> 02:25:08,490
that you don't even feel the distance,
you don't even feel the difference in the,

2559
02:25:08,491 --> 02:25:09,211
in the switch over.

2560
02:25:09,211 --> 02:25:12,720
I started thinking all this crazy shit
and I started thinking about mortality.

2561
02:25:12,721 --> 02:25:15,360
I started thinking about energy
and life and I was just couldn't,

2562
02:25:15,490 --> 02:25:19,830
I couldn't function. I was curled
up in the fetal position. I was so,

2563
02:25:19,860 --> 02:25:21,240
I was so adrift.

2564
02:25:21,241 --> 02:25:26,241
I was so high that I seriously
considered pissing my pants really,

2565
02:25:26,320 --> 02:25:29,650
because I had to go, I had to
pee, but I didn't want to get up.

2566
02:25:29,800 --> 02:25:31,090
So I thought I'll just pissed my pants.

2567
02:25:31,310 --> 02:25:35,180
I had, I thought that that was a real
consideration for a whole second,

2568
02:25:35,360 --> 02:25:37,520
for a whole second. I was
like, I found a solution.

2569
02:25:37,521 --> 02:25:38,900
I was going through my possibilities.

2570
02:25:39,170 --> 02:25:43,150
I wanna, I wanna pee. Okay. I don't
want to get up. What are the options?

2571
02:25:43,160 --> 02:25:44,280
So I'll just piss myself though

2572
02:25:45,460 --> 02:25:49,120
knew I had to pee. But my brain was
like, that's all that my brain was like,

2573
02:25:49,121 --> 02:25:51,280
that's all well and good,
but you see you can't get up.

2574
02:25:51,340 --> 02:25:55,390
There's no way you can get up. We need
to stay in this spot. Yeah. So I got up

2575
02:25:55,490 --> 02:25:56,630
and then I,
I peed.

2576
02:25:56,631 --> 02:25:59,180
And then I thought about like how
ridiculous it is that I even thought about

2577
02:25:59,181 --> 02:26:02,240
that. So I'm sitting in
this bathroom, you know,

2578
02:26:02,241 --> 02:26:05,000
looking out this little round window at,
you know,

2579
02:26:05,001 --> 02:26:08,390
it's turning dark now and I'm seeing
fucking street lights and shit and I'm

2580
02:26:08,391 --> 02:26:11,630
30,000 feet up and I'm fucking
flying. Dude. I'm gone.

2581
02:26:11,870 --> 02:26:16,870
I am a wash in a river of information
and it's flowing by so quick.

2582
02:26:17,780 --> 02:26:21,050
I can't grab any of it and I have to pay
attention to what I'm doing because I'm

2583
02:26:21,051 --> 02:26:24,230
on Whitewater rapids. And
um, if I don't pay attention,

2584
02:26:24,231 --> 02:26:27,950
I'm going to hit a rock of consciousness
that I might never recover from.

2585
02:26:28,100 --> 02:26:30,740
You know what I'm saying? Like I gotta
keep it together. That's how high I am.

2586
02:26:31,070 --> 02:26:34,010
So I go back to my seat and I lied down
again back in the fetal position after

2587
02:26:34,011 --> 02:26:37,580
I'm done. Peon. And, um,
the seats are all staggered.

2588
02:26:37,640 --> 02:26:39,560
Like they're not in a straight line.
You know,

2589
02:26:39,590 --> 02:26:41,240
it's not like everybody's
head is at the same place.

2590
02:26:41,241 --> 02:26:44,840
Everybody's feed her in the same place.
Well, four hours into the flight,

2591
02:26:44,870 --> 02:26:47,630
everybody starts to go to sleep.
I'm so high I can't do anything.

2592
02:26:47,631 --> 02:26:51,140
I'm just laying there just hoping this
is just gonna eventually come back to

2593
02:26:51,141 --> 02:26:51,621
normal.

2594
02:26:51,621 --> 02:26:53,780
And I don't have to think like this for
the rest of my life cause I'm not gonna

2595
02:26:53,781 --> 02:26:56,120
be able to enjoy anything because
I'm going to overthink everything.

2596
02:26:56,390 --> 02:26:57,680
And so as I'm thinking this,

2597
02:26:57,890 --> 02:27:02,890
I look over and I noticed that this guy
is sitting in this one seat right here

2598
02:27:03,830 --> 02:27:08,830
and he's this big fat guy and right where
his ass is directly across the aisle

2599
02:27:10,070 --> 02:27:11,000
is Melanie Griffiths

2600
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:11,833
head

2601
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:17,360
three feet away is three feet away
and this guy is sleeping okay.

2602
02:27:17,361 --> 02:27:20,210
And Melanie Griffith is sleeping.
This guy doesn't even have a

2603
02:27:20,350 --> 02:27:25,060
a blanket on. Okay. And I
got my headphones on. Okay.
And listen to some music.

2604
02:27:25,061 --> 02:27:28,090
I'm trying to writing on the
computer and this guy, oh,

2605
02:27:28,530 --> 02:27:30,030
his ass.

2606
02:27:30,600 --> 02:27:33,930
I mean opens his ass on
Melanie Griffiths head.

2607
02:27:34,230 --> 02:27:37,800
Her head was right across the aisle.
It was only three feet away.

2608
02:27:37,980 --> 02:27:40,650
He just shit in her head.
He was,

2609
02:27:40,760 --> 02:27:44,430
there was no blanket to
contain the blast radius.

2610
02:27:45,010 --> 02:27:49,200
It was just she wake up, dude, she
didn't say nothing. No one said nothing.

2611
02:27:49,201 --> 02:27:52,740
There's no way. She didn't know
what happened. There's no way.

2612
02:27:52,741 --> 02:27:55,950
I don't know if she realizes this guy
just shit in her head because she was

2613
02:27:55,951 --> 02:27:58,980
facing the other direction. She
just probably like, oh my God,

2614
02:27:58,981 --> 02:28:03,360
someone's disgusting. But she has no
idea that really she just got shat upon.

2615
02:28:03,450 --> 02:28:08,450
That is awesome too at this guy is not
even wearing fucking a blanket man.

2616
02:28:09,720 --> 02:28:14,720
He's just got his sweaty dress slacks and
it's just a poorly maintained lid to a

2617
02:28:17,251 --> 02:28:22,160
biological sewer that's not very
well maintained either. And this guy

2618
02:28:22,340 --> 02:28:26,600
probably had all kinds of
fucked up food and you know,

2619
02:28:26,660 --> 02:28:30,080
just burgers and shit.
He's fat man.

2620
02:28:30,081 --> 02:28:35,081
He's got this big fat face and
he just just fucking unloads.

2621
02:28:35,660 --> 02:28:39,410
It was horrible man.
It was horrible.

2622
02:28:39,980 --> 02:28:42,290
And you know it was him because
he's the fat guy in this.

2623
02:28:42,410 --> 02:28:46,100
No one gets discriminated more than fat
guys. When somebody farted, you know,

2624
02:28:46,130 --> 02:28:48,410
black people get blamed
when shit gets stolen.

2625
02:28:48,411 --> 02:28:50,840
And Chinese people when they're in
a car accident, they get blamed.

2626
02:28:51,050 --> 02:28:54,140
Nobody gets blamed more than if
somebody farted. And as a fat guy,

2627
02:28:54,470 --> 02:28:55,730
that's just immediately,

2628
02:28:56,660 --> 02:28:59,840
even though we all know some very skinny
people there have some horrible fucking

2629
02:28:59,841 --> 02:29:03,630
gas. It doesn't matter.
I'll get a fact. Yeah,

2630
02:29:04,010 --> 02:29:08,110
the fact guy's gotta be worse. He Shit
right in million Griffith his head.

2631
02:29:08,450 --> 02:29:11,720
Did she move around or when
moved? He did though. He moved.

2632
02:29:11,721 --> 02:29:15,140
He adjusted after he farted, he
moved into Charleston. I was like,

2633
02:29:15,141 --> 02:29:17,780
you motherfucker.
Like I saw him move.

2634
02:29:17,781 --> 02:29:20,060
So I knew he was conscious while
it all happened, but you know,

2635
02:29:20,061 --> 02:29:23,020
his back was turned. So he's pretending
that nothing was real. You know,

2636
02:29:23,030 --> 02:29:25,040
he was turned into a seat.
So he was like, you know,

2637
02:29:25,041 --> 02:29:27,960
facing a little wall so he could
just pretend nothing. I'm going to

2638
02:29:29,510 --> 02:29:31,760
open up on purpose. Dude. He opened up.

2639
02:29:31,761 --> 02:29:34,880
He didn't like the feeling
he farted a vengeance. No,

2640
02:29:34,881 --> 02:29:37,880
but it would be funny if he did.
Imagine if they set it up this way.

2641
02:29:38,150 --> 02:29:41,900
Imagine if it was like the guy came out
to Melanie Griffith agent. It's like,

2642
02:29:41,990 --> 02:29:46,710
I have $1 billion I made in the
software industry and I have,

2643
02:29:46,711 --> 02:29:50,210
but one wish I want to
fart on Melanie Griffith.

2644
02:29:50,770 --> 02:29:54,230
He had this idea and he, they were
like, well, you know, first of all,

2645
02:29:54,231 --> 02:29:57,650
we're going to, you know, even to bring
it to Melanie's desk, um, we're gonna,

2646
02:29:57,680 --> 02:30:01,820
we're gonna need to talk numbers
because guys like $5 million,

2647
02:30:01,830 --> 02:30:05,210
I'm willing to pay $5 billion to Fart.
And Melanie Griffiths face.

2648
02:30:05,240 --> 02:30:07,920
It's the role of her
lifetime and so no, no, no.

2649
02:30:07,921 --> 02:30:09,830
Let's say they had to figure out
how are we going to do this? Okay.

2650
02:30:09,831 --> 02:30:14,090
Melanie is not gonna agree to just let
you fart in your face. Man. This is just,

2651
02:30:14,120 --> 02:30:15,350
this is not going to work this way.

2652
02:30:15,530 --> 02:30:18,020
What we needed to do is get
you guys both on an airplane.

2653
02:30:18,200 --> 02:30:20,570
That's the only way you're going to
be about three feet from her head.

2654
02:30:20,571 --> 02:30:23,480
I mean you can't be fighting right on
her head but are going to be three feet

2655
02:30:23,481 --> 02:30:28,481
away and we'll seed it so that your ass
lines up with her face and you get to

2656
02:30:28,661 --> 02:30:32,330
far down there and take it from there.
Maybe hurt her agent, did the whole thing.

2657
02:30:32,510 --> 02:30:34,850
He's taken all the money.
He said it all up.

2658
02:30:36,770 --> 02:30:41,570
Maybe always for this guys wish maybe
she has a super sophisticated enemy and

2659
02:30:41,571 --> 02:30:45,160
that's all he's been doing her whole
life is paying guys to [inaudible]

2660
02:30:46,060 --> 02:30:48,290
did on an old woman at
Starbucks a couple of weeks ago.

2661
02:30:48,460 --> 02:30:50,680
It was one of the greatest things ever.
She was right behind.

2662
02:30:50,681 --> 02:30:52,270
You are totally right behind me.

2663
02:30:52,390 --> 02:30:54,430
It was one of those where I was
just going to do a little quick.

2664
02:30:54,460 --> 02:30:57,580
I thought it was going to be quiet.
Nice one, but he's just like super,

2665
02:30:57,581 --> 02:31:00,730
super loud and powerful. Loud. Yeah,

2666
02:31:00,731 --> 02:31:05,170
it was super loud and powerful and very
embarrassing and I remember looking at

2667
02:31:05,171 --> 02:31:07,440
her, I kind of like looked back
like like 10 seconds later,

2668
02:31:07,450 --> 02:31:10,210
just kind of when we did a little look
back to see what was going on and she did

2669
02:31:10,211 --> 02:31:14,800
not seem like mad. She looked kind of
concerned, like almost like meet with.

2670
02:31:15,070 --> 02:31:19,960
Was that me? No, her face look so confused
to exactly. I thought it was going.

2671
02:31:20,520 --> 02:31:24,090
That's awful. She thought
she shit herself. That must
be the worst feeling ever.

2672
02:31:24,091 --> 02:31:26,340
When you're incontinent
and just walking around,

2673
02:31:26,341 --> 02:31:30,900
your body doesn't contain it's bowels
anymore and your urine leaks out and like,

2674
02:31:30,960 --> 02:31:35,370
oh God. Yeah, it's pretty gross when
these things start melting down, man.

2675
02:31:35,580 --> 02:31:38,250
You know it's funny up, kids don't
give a shit if you watch him pee.

2676
02:31:38,610 --> 02:31:40,830
They don't feel bad about peeing and
pooping and everything like that.

2677
02:31:40,831 --> 02:31:43,670
It doesn't, it's not like there's
no shame in it. And so, uh,

2678
02:31:43,700 --> 02:31:46,350
my daughter is learning
how to potty train,

2679
02:31:46,500 --> 02:31:48,060
so she's getting out of the diaper stage,

2680
02:31:48,300 --> 02:31:51,900
but occasionally she just makes a
mistake. And so, uh, she's sitting in her,

2681
02:31:51,940 --> 02:31:54,600
her high chair and she has to pee.
She thinks about it while she was,

2682
02:31:54,601 --> 02:31:55,660
I'm just kind of just pissed.

2683
02:31:55,740 --> 02:31:59,790
It's just like an agreeable amount
of p is dripping off the high chair.

2684
02:31:59,790 --> 02:32:04,440
It's on the ground. And she's
like, what happened? She
goes, I peed. You know, like,

2685
02:32:04,441 --> 02:32:07,710
it's not bothering her. I go, why didn't
you tell me you have to go? She goes,

2686
02:32:07,711 --> 02:32:10,170
I forgot. I'm like, oh, okay.

2687
02:32:11,010 --> 02:32:16,010
That's the basis of Freud and psychology
is the way your parents handled you're

2688
02:32:16,690 --> 02:32:21,030
yourself. Exactly. So I go, okay.
I go, well, next time that happens,

2689
02:32:21,060 --> 02:32:24,630
maybe we should, uh, make sure before you
go into a high chair, you use the potty.

2690
02:32:24,850 --> 02:32:28,890
She was like, okay. Probably. She says
shit like that. That's how I saw it. Yeah,

2691
02:32:30,060 --> 02:32:33,300
no, yeah, yeah. And there's
a lot of maybes. Yeah.

2692
02:32:33,360 --> 02:32:36,060
Maybe like maybe we can get ice cream.
You know,

2693
02:32:36,061 --> 02:32:40,080
it was like there's a lot of like trying
to steer the conversation a certain way.

2694
02:32:40,290 --> 02:32:42,500
Very manipulative it too.
That's awesome.

2695
02:32:42,510 --> 02:32:46,440
Have you taken the a I'm sitting on my
toilet photo for her so she can use it

2696
02:32:46,441 --> 02:32:49,890
and in her Facebook and 15 years, no,
I'm not gonna allow her to have Facebook.

2697
02:32:50,540 --> 02:32:51,373
How many,

2698
02:32:52,610 --> 02:32:57,300
how many terabytes of photographs of
kids sitting on toilets are on Facebook?

2699
02:32:57,301 --> 02:32:59,740
Like two, two or three. That's such a,

2700
02:33:01,710 --> 02:33:03,300
that's the thing that kills single people.

2701
02:33:03,360 --> 02:33:05,410
I have one of you will
have babies in our mind.

2702
02:33:05,610 --> 02:33:08,880
I have one of me holding Glamour magazine
sitting on the toilet naked. Really?

2703
02:33:09,450 --> 02:33:10,500
Glamour magazine.

2704
02:33:11,070 --> 02:33:15,180
Is there any more overused
premise than the woman's magazine?

2705
02:33:15,390 --> 02:33:18,150
Do they have a story left to tell?
I mean,

2706
02:33:18,151 --> 02:33:22,890
is there a new sex trick to keeping your
man how to keep your ups a passion in

2707
02:33:22,891 --> 02:33:23,724
the bedroom?

2708
02:33:23,760 --> 02:33:28,760
I mean who has exhausted a
genre more than like cosmo?

2709
02:33:29,560 --> 02:33:33,690
Men's magazines always have a new
way to get a six pack. That's true.

2710
02:33:33,750 --> 02:33:37,470
Every third men's magazine or
second men every every other month.

2711
02:33:37,471 --> 02:33:40,770
It's like new way to day. The
six pack of a marine. Yeah.

2712
02:33:40,771 --> 02:33:45,771
There's something very homoerotic
about those bodybuilding magazines.

2713
02:33:46,410 --> 02:33:49,650
There's something very homoerotic about
the admiration of a man's physique.

2714
02:33:49,920 --> 02:33:53,400
You know, looking at this
guy, motherfuckers get the
best thighs or something,

2715
02:33:53,401 --> 02:33:57,390
but we'll get the striations in the
the ass and then the Lula back with the

2716
02:33:57,510 --> 02:34:01,860
Christmas tree in the lower back. The
striations are incredible. I mean,

2717
02:34:01,861 --> 02:34:05,940
he did still a tremendous job.
Tremendous job. And uh, you know,

2718
02:34:06,350 --> 02:34:09,900
and cutting the Waldo out so he
could really shoot a muscle. I mean,

2719
02:34:09,901 --> 02:34:11,070
it's so very beautiful,

2720
02:34:11,071 --> 02:34:16,071
beautiful sculpture he made his body into
why not your SCO suck his Dick Buddy.

2721
02:34:17,830 --> 02:34:17,980
You

2722
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:19,690
know what I'm saying?
Like there's something weird about it,

2723
02:34:19,691 --> 02:34:21,890
but on the other hand it's like,
I recognize your,

2724
02:34:21,900 --> 02:34:24,940
your desire to have a insane body.

2725
02:34:24,941 --> 02:34:28,450
Like why not go do it if
that's what you're into and
you get oohs and ahs out of

2726
02:34:28,451 --> 02:34:30,300
it and people think you're special
because of it. I totally, yeah.

2727
02:34:30,660 --> 02:34:34,250
Was the difference between wanting to
have an insane body and then like talking

2728
02:34:34,251 --> 02:34:37,260
about a Christmas tree on someone's
back a term. I never heard mine.

2729
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:38,760
There was a dude

2730
02:34:38,760 --> 02:34:42,000
who used to be a huge bodybuilding fan.
This is back when I lived in Boston.

2731
02:34:42,001 --> 02:34:44,280
He was one of my students when
I was teaching martial arts.

2732
02:34:44,281 --> 02:34:47,460
He was a huge bodybuilding fan, but
he was fat. I never understood it.

2733
02:34:47,670 --> 02:34:50,310
The dude was like, seriously
fat. And I was like, well,

2734
02:34:50,340 --> 02:34:53,440
I guess he was really fat at one point.

2735
02:34:53,441 --> 02:34:57,180
And then he got into bodybuilding and
then he started slowly losing weight

2736
02:34:57,181 --> 02:34:59,460
because you, he wanted to
have a physique like that. So,

2737
02:34:59,850 --> 02:35:02,550
but he never lost any weight. I
just like, was it just a fat guy?

2738
02:35:02,551 --> 02:35:06,280
I always talk about Bible. You see the
latest thing. And Lee Haney is incredible.

2739
02:35:06,450 --> 02:35:09,630
I don't know who those though. You
know, I think it was a, who was it?

2740
02:35:09,690 --> 02:35:12,810
The WHO's the Mr Olympia back in that day.
I really have no idea but this.

2741
02:35:12,990 --> 02:35:16,410
But he was, and I was like, how come? You
know, I mean, are you into bodybuilding?

2742
02:35:16,440 --> 02:35:19,590
Like do you body build yourself? And
he's like, well, I did, you know,

2743
02:35:19,591 --> 02:35:21,990
I lift a little weights, I lift. I just
tried to keep in shape, but I'm just,

2744
02:35:21,991 --> 02:35:25,110
I just admire what they do
and I'm like, whoa. Okay.

2745
02:35:25,111 --> 02:35:26,250
There's something weird about that.

2746
02:35:27,240 --> 02:35:29,550
Some weird about you
fixating on other dudes bias.

2747
02:35:29,551 --> 02:35:31,950
You're a fan of what they're
doing to their bodies,

2748
02:35:32,220 --> 02:35:33,990
but you don't even do
anything to your own.

2749
02:35:34,020 --> 02:35:37,220
Like you just like to stare at their
improvement. Our core, I'll look,

2750
02:35:37,230 --> 02:35:41,550
it isn't back. That is a hilarious
character. His back's incredible. Yeah,

2751
02:35:41,551 --> 02:35:44,700
it is hilarious character, right?
Like a guy who's not gay at all,

2752
02:35:44,820 --> 02:35:47,820
but he's just like super into like really,

2753
02:35:47,821 --> 02:35:49,880
really into men's body development.

2754
02:35:50,120 --> 02:35:50,840
Like you go out,

2755
02:35:50,840 --> 02:35:55,370
you go to his office and it's just got
like framed pictures of muscular guys and

2756
02:35:55,371 --> 02:35:58,040
he's just like, I respect
their work. Yeah. Come here.

2757
02:35:58,041 --> 02:36:01,540
Let me show you something Joe.
Look at our Christmas tree. Yeah,

2758
02:36:01,790 --> 02:36:06,080
that's a terrible term I've never heard.
Yeah, they call it the lower back. Yeah.

2759
02:36:06,190 --> 02:36:09,940
Yeah. This, this guy, this guy told
me the Christmas tree, this guy back,

2760
02:36:09,970 --> 02:36:12,480
one of my students was like Scott,
that Christmas tree and as low.

2761
02:36:12,820 --> 02:36:15,850
Yeah. Christmas tree and a
lot of presence under that.

2762
02:36:16,230 --> 02:36:17,860
Put a little bit of snow on that tree.

2763
02:36:17,890 --> 02:36:22,890
[inaudible] the snowman.

2764
02:36:25,750 --> 02:36:28,390
Where's that present on the ditch?
Yeah.

2765
02:36:28,810 --> 02:36:33,390
It always helps to go to some gay place
folks. Yeah. We are very immature. Very,

2766
02:36:33,391 --> 02:36:35,350
very no watches it.
I got to say,

2767
02:36:35,360 --> 02:36:38,390
God have a little immature with
farting met Melanie Griffith Hack.

2768
02:36:38,650 --> 02:36:42,370
Is that where I went wrong? Yeah. You
blame me and it really happened, man.

2769
02:36:42,980 --> 02:36:46,450
Nobody but shit. What I like,
what I like is it was preceded by,

2770
02:36:46,451 --> 02:36:50,620
it looks like you were like on the verge
of like figuring out one of the biggest

2771
02:36:50,621 --> 02:36:54,660
things ever and it you ended up in a
catatonic state and got to see you.

2772
02:36:54,661 --> 02:36:57,580
One of the funniest things of
all times. Yeah. No Shit. Right.

2773
02:36:57,610 --> 02:37:00,490
That's a very funny
moment to get to witness.

2774
02:37:00,491 --> 02:37:02,800
I mean that that may
be only happened once.

2775
02:37:04,620 --> 02:37:05,453
Yup.

2776
02:37:05,700 --> 02:37:07,550
People aren't always farting.
I'm Melanie Griffith.

2777
02:37:07,551 --> 02:37:10,800
His heads probably more likely that
you'd been abducted by an alien.

2778
02:37:11,010 --> 02:37:13,440
Then you get yourself into a position
where you could fight a Melanie Griffiths

2779
02:37:13,441 --> 02:37:16,040
head. Yeah. Operation. You saw

2780
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:17,810
the final phase of operation.

2781
02:37:18,530 --> 02:37:21,710
Would you rather fart on Melanie
Griffin's head or Angela Landsbury.

2782
02:37:21,740 --> 02:37:24,050
I wouldn't want to fall on any
one of their heads. Angela,

2783
02:37:24,051 --> 02:37:28,850
all the way [inaudible] I'd make
her wear a little bit of makeup.

2784
02:37:28,880 --> 02:37:33,260
I put the blood on people's heads.
That's just rude. Fucked that girl.

2785
02:37:34,130 --> 02:37:38,390
Who was Angela Lansbury murder she wrote
here. Can you where you have a problem?

2786
02:37:38,910 --> 02:37:42,200
I just want to see what these pucker up.
What is it that we want to see?

2787
02:37:42,201 --> 02:37:43,520
Like little old ladies kicking ass.

2788
02:37:43,970 --> 02:37:47,030
Could you imagine if Angela Lansbury
like would beat dudes up occasionally.

2789
02:37:47,360 --> 02:37:51,080
Like they try to get her from calling
nine one one in the fall and she kicks him

2790
02:37:51,081 --> 02:37:53,590
in the balls and he carries it.
Yeah.

2791
02:37:54,270 --> 02:37:58,850
Like if there was like a
female seniors MMA, whoa.

2792
02:37:58,910 --> 02:38:01,910
That would make a lot of money. Oh
my God. Could you imagine ladies,

2793
02:38:02,210 --> 02:38:04,130
old ladies beating the
fuck out of each other?

2794
02:38:04,250 --> 02:38:06,680
And occasionally they would
die bravely in the ring.

2795
02:38:06,770 --> 02:38:09,170
Like she died for our
freedom and they would show

2796
02:38:11,210 --> 02:38:16,210
just the sound of hips breaking
ACL is just snapping like carrots.

2797
02:38:17,240 --> 02:38:20,330
They ensured grow wild haymaker
and their foot falls off.

2798
02:38:23,960 --> 02:38:26,900
Oh God,
that'd be so sad to watch.

2799
02:38:27,050 --> 02:38:31,850
Just concern grandchildren weeping in
this dance. Isn't there a video online?

2800
02:38:31,880 --> 02:38:35,180
I didn't watch it but somebody put
it up to old ladies got into a fight.

2801
02:38:35,690 --> 02:38:38,930
Somebody throw up on Twitter.
I know you folks know who know what it is.

2802
02:38:38,931 --> 02:38:42,020
It was on the rogue and board.
I'm pretty sure I didn't watch it,

2803
02:38:42,170 --> 02:38:46,740
but I saw the opening frame and it was
like one old lady was down and the other

2804
02:38:46,741 --> 02:38:50,030
old lady was up and I was like,
I don't need to see anymore.

2805
02:38:50,170 --> 02:38:53,210
I need to see these old ladies beating
the shit out of interesting old lady porn.

2806
02:38:53,211 --> 02:38:55,280
Like really old lady porn.
Yes.

2807
02:38:55,370 --> 02:38:57,620
I've seen some very disturbing
because that one old lady,

2808
02:38:57,621 --> 02:39:00,470
this one old lady I showed it looked
like she was like maybe Alzheimer's,

2809
02:39:00,500 --> 02:39:03,050
like they found her like she,
she didn't seem like she knew it was

2810
02:39:04,800 --> 02:39:08,270
Jesus. It was really bad.
There's a dark one I want.

2811
02:39:08,271 --> 02:39:11,240
The first one I ever watched
was Ron Jeremy. He was like
the first one to do it.

2812
02:39:11,241 --> 02:39:15,920
I think it was him banging this
really old lady and she was like, oh,

2813
02:39:15,921 --> 02:39:20,600
it's so lovely to feel so good.
I was watching it and she was just like,

2814
02:39:20,640 --> 02:39:22,580
just wretched old creature.
I was like,

2815
02:39:22,581 --> 02:39:26,900
oh my God puts these look fine.
Kind of still though.

2816
02:39:26,901 --> 02:39:29,930
Like they look like they don't
look as old as their faces.

2817
02:39:30,570 --> 02:39:32,800
I don't see that much sunlight.

2818
02:39:33,070 --> 02:39:35,780
Don't you think it's a
charitable thing to do though?

2819
02:39:35,810 --> 02:39:37,940
The face is getting lit up by
sunlight all the time, man.

2820
02:39:37,941 --> 02:39:41,300
You have to realize how bad that is for
people don't realize how bad it is for

2821
02:39:41,301 --> 02:39:42,590
you until you look at
the rest of your body.

2822
02:39:42,650 --> 02:39:44,930
How much is your face deteriorating like?

2823
02:39:44,930 --> 02:39:47,780
Well this is much more wrinkles in my
face, in any other part of my body.

2824
02:39:47,870 --> 02:39:49,790
You know it's because my
face is in sun all the time.

2825
02:39:49,820 --> 02:39:53,000
Your son's coming off your windshield,
you're out there in the sun.

2826
02:39:53,001 --> 02:39:55,750
The aging process is accelerated
by the sun for sure. Huh?

2827
02:39:56,030 --> 02:39:58,850
You know like your armpits and everything
when you aren't pits get wrinkled,

2828
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,640
your faces jacked as fuck.
You know,

2829
02:40:03,300 --> 02:40:05,190
when you are pit start giving out,
you know,

2830
02:40:05,210 --> 02:40:06,740
and all that shit starts
to sag and wrinkle,

2831
02:40:06,830 --> 02:40:11,540
that means your face looks like ass son.
You know these poor old ladies man,

2832
02:40:12,430 --> 02:40:13,630
these poor ladies,

2833
02:40:14,190 --> 02:40:16,290
a dark moment for a woman.
You know,

2834
02:40:16,310 --> 02:40:19,680
when especially a really super
attractive woman who's kind of banked her

2835
02:40:19,681 --> 02:40:22,680
personal self esteem on being attractive,

2836
02:40:22,710 --> 02:40:25,500
that's gotta be the worst
feeling in the world, man. Yeah,

2837
02:40:25,501 --> 02:40:29,250
you mean the Lady Universal
Justice crushing in on you.

2838
02:40:29,470 --> 02:40:33,350
Do you justice as a justice?
Because anytime you are an idolater,

2839
02:40:33,360 --> 02:40:38,130
anytime you base your, they'll shout,
not build the house on sand. Don't,

2840
02:40:38,330 --> 02:40:42,330
don't, don't structure your
whole life. And it's an easy
thing to do. And you know,

2841
02:40:42,360 --> 02:40:47,040
I get it and I understand how easy it
would be to slip into depending on your

2842
02:40:47,041 --> 02:40:50,220
looks and all that stuff. But it's
like if you are really intelligent,

2843
02:40:50,221 --> 02:40:54,810
you would have developed some facet of
yourself that wasn't based on that. Yeah,

2844
02:40:54,811 --> 02:40:58,080
yeah. I know what you mean. Yeah, I
guess. But it's, that's easy to say.

2845
02:40:58,110 --> 02:41:00,660
Most people live their lives
without a rule book or a guide book.

2846
02:41:00,660 --> 02:41:02,190
And they really don't know
what the fuck they're doing.

2847
02:41:02,370 --> 02:41:05,340
There's a lot of good people that wind
up and shit lives cause they just never

2848
02:41:05,341 --> 02:41:08,880
were told how to live and they made a
series of mistakes and they fell into the

2849
02:41:08,881 --> 02:41:11,980
wave of the momentum, those mistakes.
And now here they are. I'll fucked,

2850
02:41:11,981 --> 02:41:13,110
fucked by circumstance.

2851
02:41:13,111 --> 02:41:16,470
Being born a fuckup neighborhood did
some fucked up parents and fucked up

2852
02:41:16,471 --> 02:41:17,130
friends.

2853
02:41:17,130 --> 02:41:21,330
I prefer to believe though that and I
think this is where we definitely differ

2854
02:41:21,390 --> 02:41:25,650
in opinion cause I really believe that
no matter what life situation you're in,

2855
02:41:25,890 --> 02:41:29,730
you can get out of that. No a better
place I can. If you go to jail, you can't.

2856
02:41:29,731 --> 02:41:31,770
If you do something dumb when you're
young and you want to go to jail,

2857
02:41:31,771 --> 02:41:34,170
I think that this areas,
even in jail,

2858
02:41:34,171 --> 02:41:38,670
there are ways that you cannot master
certain techniques of getting out of it.

2859
02:41:38,670 --> 02:41:41,930
There's there's, there's always
true, but you will not be you.

2860
02:41:41,940 --> 02:41:45,420
You will not be surrounded by those.
Those techniques. You will not,

2861
02:41:45,421 --> 02:41:46,740
you will will have to seek them out.

2862
02:41:46,741 --> 02:41:51,741
It's going to take a very rare effort to
really rise and eliminate yourself from

2863
02:41:52,020 --> 02:41:56,220
the horrible reality of your conditions,
your surroundings, violent people,

2864
02:41:56,340 --> 02:41:59,310
all the different shit that they're doing
in there, the gangs, all the bullshit.

2865
02:41:59,670 --> 02:42:02,370
We're not going to involve in there.
It's more difficult. But it's like,

2866
02:42:02,371 --> 02:42:05,880
I just think is it an almost
impossible man? You, it's, I mean,

2867
02:42:05,881 --> 02:42:08,940
people do it and they get through it
and they become better people for it and

2868
02:42:08,941 --> 02:42:12,150
they learn while they're in there and
they really truly reflect on their life

2869
02:42:12,151 --> 02:42:13,530
and you know,
reflecting their mistakes,

2870
02:42:13,531 --> 02:42:16,710
but much more likely to get
sucked into the system. But, um,

2871
02:42:16,830 --> 02:42:20,160
there's a great book by Viktor Frankl
called man's search for meaning,

2872
02:42:20,400 --> 02:42:25,400
which is a written by a psychologist who
was in Auschwitz and was observing the

2873
02:42:25,831 --> 02:42:29,880
way people were reacting with apps, having
their humanity ripped away from them,

2874
02:42:30,180 --> 02:42:34,860
their clothes ripped off,
being naked, covered in lice,

2875
02:42:35,040 --> 02:42:37,770
uh, randomly getting killed. And um,

2876
02:42:37,950 --> 02:42:42,120
he like founded an entire style of
therapy based on his theory of why some

2877
02:42:42,121 --> 02:42:44,490
people in these situations survived.

2878
02:42:44,491 --> 02:42:49,491
Some even flourished in these situations
as far as being kind to people around

2879
02:42:49,891 --> 02:42:54,720
them and why some people died. And
the essence of his theory is that, uh,

2880
02:42:54,900 --> 02:42:59,130
that within the human being,
if you can find something to live for,

2881
02:42:59,280 --> 02:43:03,510
just something, whatever it is, then
that will take you through any situation.

2882
02:43:03,630 --> 02:43:05,850
It'll get you to the other
side of any situation. So it's,

2883
02:43:06,120 --> 02:43:10,590
this book changed my life. It's one of my
favorite books. It's fucking incredible.

2884
02:43:10,740 --> 02:43:12,070
And one thing that he says

2885
02:43:12,070 --> 02:43:16,750
in there, which is really awesome,
as he talks about how he was,

2886
02:43:16,751 --> 02:43:20,050
uh,
being on foot on a forced work march,

2887
02:43:20,080 --> 02:43:21,940
and he was really weak and he was being,

2888
02:43:22,090 --> 02:43:26,200
he was on a forced work march and he
fell down and one of the soldiers,

2889
02:43:26,380 --> 02:43:28,780
because he fell down,
came and just started beating him,

2890
02:43:29,080 --> 02:43:33,550
beating with his fucking rifle,
get up, get up, get up. And He, um,

2891
02:43:34,180 --> 02:43:37,360
he had seen this soldier kill
people with his technique,

2892
02:43:37,361 --> 02:43:40,780
just beat him to death with
a rifle because they wouldn't
get up. And he thought,

2893
02:43:40,810 --> 02:43:44,560
if I don't get up, I'm going to
die. And he thought, well, you know,

2894
02:43:45,250 --> 02:43:48,580
why should I not die? This is, I'm
probably going to die anyway. Why should,

2895
02:43:48,581 --> 02:43:50,560
why not just let this be
the moment that I die?

2896
02:43:50,890 --> 02:43:55,890
And all of a sudden he imagined himself
giving a speech where he was talking

2897
02:43:56,291 --> 02:44:01,291
about this experience and
using this experience to try
to transform the world in

2898
02:44:02,111 --> 02:44:03,100
a positive way,

2899
02:44:03,310 --> 02:44:07,420
to show people that no matter how
fucking horrible the situation is,

2900
02:44:07,540 --> 02:44:11,710
you can find a way out of it mentally
to give you the strength and the will to

2901
02:44:11,711 --> 02:44:13,000
keep pushing forward.

2902
02:44:13,180 --> 02:44:16,930
And he got up and he survived and
he became like a very famous, um,

2903
02:44:17,080 --> 02:44:21,940
psychologist and an a philosopher. So it's
a good, what was that guy's name again?

2904
02:44:22,390 --> 02:44:27,250
Victor Franco in the book is man's search
for meaning. And it's a brutal book.

2905
02:44:27,251 --> 02:44:31,090
It's really fucking intense. The
description of the death camp and stuff,

2906
02:44:31,091 --> 02:44:34,870
but it's awesome.
And his therapy was called logos therapy.

2907
02:44:35,560 --> 02:44:38,260
Existential psychotherapy.
Wow.

2908
02:44:39,140 --> 02:44:40,800
I mean,
what is the search for meaning?

2909
02:44:40,801 --> 02:44:44,280
The search remaining is a search to
try to find a reason to stay alive.

2910
02:44:44,520 --> 02:44:49,140
And then if you do try to find a reason
to stay alive and succeed and you do

2911
02:44:49,141 --> 02:44:51,630
look forward to life and
put positive energy into it,

2912
02:44:51,631 --> 02:44:56,160
something's going to come out. But is, is
that a meaning? Is that meaning, you know,

2913
02:44:56,170 --> 02:45:00,420
man's search for meaning? Is that a
correct is, is there really a meaning to,

2914
02:45:00,530 --> 02:45:03,990
to everyone. And if we look
at the way the world is going,

2915
02:45:03,991 --> 02:45:05,730
look at the direction
that human beings are,

2916
02:45:05,910 --> 02:45:09,270
are headed into with the pollution
of the world with, you know,

2917
02:45:09,271 --> 02:45:12,120
this crazy nuclear arms race thing,

2918
02:45:12,121 --> 02:45:15,150
trying to keep Iran from developing
nukes and Israel's got him and all these

2919
02:45:15,151 --> 02:45:19,290
people go have you look at overpopulation.
If you look at the economic crisis,

2920
02:45:19,291 --> 02:45:22,620
that crisis of of government, you look
at all this crazy shit that's going on.

2921
02:45:22,920 --> 02:45:26,850
Like what are we, we're preserving
what, like what are we doing?

2922
02:45:27,390 --> 02:45:30,690
We're moving it towards what
direction, you know, like what,

2923
02:45:30,691 --> 02:45:34,620
what are we trying to save? What are, what
is, what is, what is good about all this?

2924
02:45:35,330 --> 02:45:40,130
Well, I mean, the thing is like the I,
the ego tries to create a lofty reason.

2925
02:45:41,010 --> 02:45:44,050
Somebody's, you know what I'm saying? Like
search for meaning. No, you live and you,

2926
02:45:44,150 --> 02:45:46,250
but you live and you die.
You live under these

2927
02:45:46,460 --> 02:45:49,770
stances of is slow toxification
of the earth and you die.

2928
02:45:50,160 --> 02:45:52,410
And man's search for meaning.
Okay,

2929
02:45:52,411 --> 02:45:55,680
well you're searching for meaning while
all this shit is happening, right?

2930
02:45:56,280 --> 02:45:58,920
Well, yeah, I mean, you know what I
mean? I know exactly what you're saying.

2931
02:45:58,980 --> 02:46:03,360
And I think he's, he's dealing
with that very issue and he, uh,

2932
02:46:03,660 --> 02:46:06,520
what he says, what he says that he, yeah,

2933
02:46:06,630 --> 02:46:09,470
he would ask his clients are the
people who came to me, he's like,

2934
02:46:09,980 --> 02:46:14,930
why don't you kill yourself? What's the
reason that you're not killing yourself?

2935
02:46:15,080 --> 02:46:19,460
Why are you deciding to stay alive
in the world? Have you explored that?

2936
02:46:19,640 --> 02:46:22,340
If you ever asked yourself,
what's getting me out of bed?

2937
02:46:22,490 --> 02:46:26,060
What's the reason behind this? And it
doesn't have to be some lofty thing.

2938
02:46:26,061 --> 02:46:29,930
It doesn't have to be, I'm staying
alive to cause I wanna you know,

2939
02:46:29,931 --> 02:46:32,690
I want to become president
and bring peace to the world.

2940
02:46:32,691 --> 02:46:36,410
It can be some very simple thing.
It can be your kids, it can be art.

2941
02:46:36,500 --> 02:46:38,150
It can be cause you like video games.

2942
02:46:38,151 --> 02:46:40,400
It doesn't have to be
some lofty fucking thing.

2943
02:46:40,401 --> 02:46:42,650
Even though to me some
of those ideas would,

2944
02:46:42,980 --> 02:46:44,960
it was very difficult
for me to swallow it.

2945
02:46:44,961 --> 02:46:48,530
But it's finding that connection
to the world, you know,

2946
02:46:48,531 --> 02:46:49,610
it's finding that right way.

2947
02:46:49,670 --> 02:46:52,790
What is that all about? What is
the meaning of all of it? I mean,

2948
02:46:52,791 --> 02:46:53,601
that's the thing man.

2949
02:46:53,601 --> 02:46:55,940
Search for meaning that there's some
sort of a meaning to everything.

2950
02:46:55,970 --> 02:46:59,080
And I think it's an individual. It's
like what you said when you're at these,

2951
02:46:59,440 --> 02:47:02,530
each individual has their
own particular meaning.

2952
02:47:02,680 --> 02:47:06,400
And if they don't hit that frequency
and they don't find that path,

2953
02:47:06,430 --> 02:47:06,930
then they won't

2954
02:47:06,930 --> 02:47:10,440
be happy. Well, think of it man. Like,
you know, like the Times that I've,

2955
02:47:10,470 --> 02:47:15,100
this sounds really stupid, so go ahead
and make fun of me for it. But like, uh,

2956
02:47:15,420 --> 02:47:19,650
um, I have, uh, uh, a really,
uh, amazing girlfriend.

2957
02:47:19,651 --> 02:47:21,420
I have a really fucking cool shower.

2958
02:47:21,990 --> 02:47:25,650
I fucking love those entities right now.

2959
02:47:25,910 --> 02:47:29,520
There have been times in my life where I
haven't had things like that. You know,

2960
02:47:29,521 --> 02:47:31,320
we're having those connections,
right?

2961
02:47:31,321 --> 02:47:34,930
And I've noticed I tend to be more self
destructive in those states. Right.

2962
02:47:35,010 --> 02:47:38,070
You know what I mean? Like I
agree. It's like we are, uh,

2963
02:47:38,140 --> 02:47:42,810
Louis C CK has this really funny joke
about how like if you don't have a kid,

2964
02:47:43,050 --> 02:47:47,910
you know, he's like, I can't die.
There are people I have to feed.

2965
02:47:48,030 --> 02:47:51,540
They're things that I have to take care
of. You know, they're like, I like,

2966
02:47:51,840 --> 02:47:53,640
it adds this whole other d.

2967
02:47:53,850 --> 02:47:57,450
So it's like finding that
thing in your life, you know?

2968
02:47:57,451 --> 02:48:00,270
And it doesn't have to be an interpersonal
relationship. It can be other things,

2969
02:48:00,271 --> 02:48:04,320
but it's like the idea is find that thing
and that thing will be the thing that

2970
02:48:04,380 --> 02:48:07,770
steers your ship through this
turbulent, the inevitable. But

2971
02:48:07,770 --> 02:48:12,280
take it a step further. What, what
is this purpose? What is this,

2972
02:48:12,360 --> 02:48:15,210
this reason to stay alive,
this reason to find this thing,

2973
02:48:15,420 --> 02:48:19,260
this reason to do your job and stake your
position here and have your influence

2974
02:48:19,261 --> 02:48:24,030
here. What is it, what is it about
choosing the correct frequency to you?

2975
02:48:24,031 --> 02:48:24,900
Whatever it is for you,

2976
02:48:24,901 --> 02:48:29,901
whether it's pursuing a a career as a
professional bowler or a carpenter or a

2977
02:48:31,351 --> 02:48:34,110
doctor or a writer or whatever
the fuck it is for you.

2978
02:48:34,320 --> 02:48:37,830
What is it about that pole like
what, what do you, what is,

2979
02:48:37,831 --> 02:48:42,420
what is really happening is fulfilling
your own personal desires and interests?

2980
02:48:42,600 --> 02:48:47,600
Is that really just a part of a gigantic
equation and then everybody is working

2981
02:48:47,791 --> 02:48:51,540
and everybody has a certain part
and it's, it's, it's not stated.

2982
02:48:51,570 --> 02:48:53,760
It's not written in stone.
There's some room,

2983
02:48:53,761 --> 02:48:58,290
some wiggle room to go this way and that
way, but in order to truly be happy,

2984
02:48:58,440 --> 02:49:00,900
your, your instincts, your emotions,

2985
02:49:00,901 --> 02:49:04,500
all these things are guiding you towards
a certain direction and that certainly

2986
02:49:04,501 --> 02:49:09,120
Rick direction might be a part of
some huge that is impossible to see.

2987
02:49:09,120 --> 02:49:11,940
You'd have to get so far
high above the human race.

2988
02:49:11,941 --> 02:49:15,920
You have to separate yourself from your
history and your ideas about humans to

2989
02:49:15,930 --> 02:49:20,520
in order to see it all together and all
the see all the fucking different things

2990
02:49:20,521 --> 02:49:22,260
that are happening all over the world,

2991
02:49:22,290 --> 02:49:26,700
all together simultaneously and consider
the impact of the human race as a whole.

2992
02:49:26,730 --> 02:49:28,830
It seems like that that's
why there's trashman.

2993
02:49:28,831 --> 02:49:30,210
That's why there's like these jobs.

2994
02:49:30,211 --> 02:49:33,720
You'd be like a wire people actually
doing that. That's crazy. You know?

2995
02:49:33,740 --> 02:49:36,540
It seems like that is makes
complete sense that way.

2996
02:49:37,200 --> 02:49:39,720
We don't like to think that it makes
sense because we'd like to think that we

2997
02:49:39,721 --> 02:49:41,070
all have our own personal choice.

2998
02:49:41,100 --> 02:49:44,190
We all have our own identity and we all
have our own path that we can choose

2999
02:49:44,191 --> 02:49:46,830
through this life and you can change
when you can become a different person.

3000
02:49:47,070 --> 02:49:48,180
And I agree with all that I,

3001
02:49:48,220 --> 02:49:52,380
I'm not saying that it's 100%
everything that you do is set in stone,

3002
02:49:52,530 --> 02:49:54,750
but it seems to me that there is,

3003
02:49:54,751 --> 02:49:58,260
without a doubt there's a push towards
a certain direction and it might not be

3004
02:49:58,261 --> 02:50:01,650
very exact. It might not be. Everyone
gets pushed towards a certain direction.

3005
02:50:01,860 --> 02:50:06,000
But if you're, you're instincts are to
breed, to settle down, to procreate,

3006
02:50:06,180 --> 02:50:11,130
to possess the coolest
material possessions to shy
show off for the Jones is to

3007
02:50:11,131 --> 02:50:14,400
be successful at what you do. What
are all those things doing? Well,

3008
02:50:14,401 --> 02:50:16,950
all those things.
They're all pushing innovation.

3009
02:50:17,160 --> 02:50:19,560
They're all pushing the
creation of new technology.

3010
02:50:19,710 --> 02:50:24,630
They're all pushing the invention of
new crazy fucking super things. Yep.

3011
02:50:24,930 --> 02:50:29,250
It's almost like we don't even
realize we are infected by a parasite.

3012
02:50:29,400 --> 02:50:30,840
The parasite is technology.

3013
02:50:30,930 --> 02:50:35,160
We're slowly giving birth to it over a
period of a couple of decades until it

3014
02:50:35,161 --> 02:50:37,020
gets to a point where it
can take care of itself.

3015
02:50:37,230 --> 02:50:40,950
And what we're doing is we're carrying it
inside of our bodies. We're leaving it,

3016
02:50:40,980 --> 02:50:44,460
you know, in, in our houses. Everywhere
we look we're connected to it.

3017
02:50:44,790 --> 02:50:48,630
And it is a life form.
It is a life for, yeah.

3018
02:50:48,810 --> 02:50:51,600
We just don't recognize it as a life
form because we're looking for something

3019
02:50:51,601 --> 02:50:52,280
like us.

3020
02:50:52,280 --> 02:50:55,980
We are looking for something that has
cells and give blood and it has blood

3021
02:50:55,981 --> 02:50:58,110
pumping through it.
But if you look at like my old Shitty,

3022
02:50:58,170 --> 02:51:02,340
I have an old shitty Mac laptop. It's
big and fat, like a fucking like a Bible,

3023
02:51:02,460 --> 02:51:05,910
you know, and it cranks open. It's
like it's all rickety and shit.

3024
02:51:05,911 --> 02:51:09,180
The screen looks like dog shit.
It's only a few years old man.

3025
02:51:09,181 --> 02:51:12,960
It's like 10 years old. You know.
That's, that's, that's insane. You know,

3026
02:51:12,961 --> 02:51:15,360
in 10 years this thing is evolved.
Like,

3027
02:51:15,870 --> 02:51:19,380
like it's like comparing a
monkey and comparing a person.

3028
02:51:19,950 --> 02:51:21,810
But that shit took millions of years.

3029
02:51:21,960 --> 02:51:26,960
This laptop into a macbook pro that
only took 10 that's a 10 years.

3030
02:51:27,540 --> 02:51:31,290
His big fat, stupid brick and now
this thing's awesome. What is that?

3031
02:51:31,291 --> 02:51:34,610
It's 15 years. 16 years.
That's some crazy shit. And,

3032
02:51:34,640 --> 02:51:38,320
and the thing that it evolved
into is using itself as a,

3033
02:51:38,610 --> 02:51:43,610
as tip make make itself smaller like that
you're using each subsequent evolution

3034
02:51:44,641 --> 02:51:49,410
is accelerating the next phase. Yeah.
It's, it's really cool man. Yeah,

3035
02:51:49,411 --> 02:51:52,740
it's fascinating man. It might
be a life form, like literally,

3036
02:51:53,160 --> 02:51:55,800
literally technology.
It might be something that we just,

3037
02:51:55,920 --> 02:51:58,920
we don't consider it a life for him
cause we need to consider life forms as

3038
02:51:58,921 --> 02:52:03,510
being similar to us in some way. You can
kill it. It bleeds, it eats a chits. We,

3039
02:52:03,540 --> 02:52:06,040
that's the only way we see it.
We don't, we don't see this

3040
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:09,990
thing that we're making.
We're literally creating its brain young.

3041
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:13,180
But if you are watching from
a far, you'd be like, Oh yeah,

3042
02:52:13,181 --> 02:52:16,960
those creatures are innovating.
Some sort of, I don't know. Sure.

3043
02:52:16,961 --> 02:52:19,840
If you were an alien intelligence
without a doubt. Right?

3044
02:52:19,841 --> 02:52:22,770
That's immediately what you
would say a Terence Mckenna.

3045
02:52:22,810 --> 02:52:27,430
That what he says is we are
extruding psychic objects
into the material universe.

3046
02:52:27,431 --> 02:52:31,930
That's what human beings do. And if
you look at the, you know, the cities,

3047
02:52:31,931 --> 02:52:36,931
it's like coral extrusions of matter
coming from our minds like coral reefs and

3048
02:52:37,690 --> 02:52:38,680
this is all being,

3049
02:52:38,950 --> 02:52:43,150
this is all moving towards the
invention of some super tool.

3050
02:52:43,330 --> 02:52:44,400
Yes.
Yeah.

3051
02:52:44,900 --> 02:52:49,450
This is moving towards the invention
of some new connection to the universe.

3052
02:52:49,480 --> 02:52:50,980
Some new,
you know,

3053
02:52:50,981 --> 02:52:55,981
we might be giving birth to some
organism of some technological organisms.

3054
02:52:56,351 --> 02:53:00,880
Something that can replicate something
that is sentiment, it's aware of itself,

3055
02:53:00,910 --> 02:53:05,530
and that can make decisions and alters
its environment and chooses to replicate

3056
02:53:05,531 --> 02:53:07,360
itself in a more advanced way.

3057
02:53:07,360 --> 02:53:10,390
And then that one chooses to replicate
itself in a more advanced way.

3058
02:53:10,391 --> 02:53:13,330
And like literally within a year they
could go through 10,000 years of fucking

3059
02:53:13,331 --> 02:53:16,870
evolution. I mean, they can, they can
produce incredible results. You know,

3060
02:53:16,871 --> 02:53:18,310
if you really get to the point of view,

3061
02:53:18,311 --> 02:53:22,480
see how quickly took technology and
computers have evolved as compared to

3062
02:53:22,481 --> 02:53:24,460
biology,
if they're both life forms,

3063
02:53:24,461 --> 02:53:27,420
it's not even close as to
which one's gonna win. Yeah,
the technology ones going,

3064
02:53:27,460 --> 02:53:28,270
they're getting to,

3065
02:53:28,270 --> 02:53:31,750
they're going to develop wormholes and
portals and we'll just be growing webbed

3066
02:53:31,751 --> 02:53:34,030
feet because we live near water.
You know what I mean?

3067
02:53:34,031 --> 02:53:37,290
That shit will take a million years
before people can hold their breath past

3068
02:53:37,330 --> 02:53:38,480
five minutes.
Right.

3069
02:53:38,560 --> 02:53:42,400
There's one tribe in New Zealand that
can hold their breath for seven minutes.

3070
02:53:42,401 --> 02:53:44,350
This is an evolutionary advantage.
You know,

3071
02:53:44,351 --> 02:53:47,350
when they talk about like Eskimos have
an evolutionary advantage where they

3072
02:53:47,351 --> 02:53:51,340
could be outside in freezing weather and
their hands don't get cold like ours do.

3073
02:53:51,460 --> 02:53:53,020
Well, your, your hands
would get frostbite,

3074
02:53:53,050 --> 02:53:56,230
you'd be fucked and you might even lose
your fingers. They can actually be fine.

3075
02:53:56,560 --> 02:53:59,200
You know, it's because their body
has adapted to that environment.

3076
02:53:59,201 --> 02:54:03,280
But that shit takes generations. Yeah.
You know when that started. Okay.

3077
02:54:03,281 --> 02:54:07,030
They didn't even have writing. Okay.
And the way that that happens, Joe is,

3078
02:54:07,031 --> 02:54:11,620
is by according to like hardcore
evolution as it's random mutation.

3079
02:54:11,830 --> 02:54:15,700
It's not even as though the necessity
caused, the thing that happened is though,

3080
02:54:15,701 --> 02:54:19,780
like you through the will of necessity
that you need to survive in the cold

3081
02:54:19,781 --> 02:54:24,280
longer, suddenly you get
that it's a mutation that
happens to some lucky Eskimo.

3082
02:54:24,400 --> 02:54:25,960
And because he has that mutation,

3083
02:54:26,080 --> 02:54:29,800
he's a little bit more advanced than he
reproduces more on passes that mutation

3084
02:54:29,801 --> 02:54:33,400
on. And that's how it gets into the
gene line, not from an intentionality.

3085
02:54:33,401 --> 02:54:37,300
So it's even more random than
necessity. It's just, you know,

3086
02:54:37,301 --> 02:54:41,200
when the moth accidentally mutates
into the same color of the tree,

3087
02:54:41,380 --> 02:54:45,040
that math is gonna survive more. The
birds can't see it. And that math,

3088
02:54:45,070 --> 02:54:48,770
is it accidental though? That's,
that's the big question. The question.

3089
02:54:48,780 --> 02:54:52,930
Random mutations being accidental is
a very controversial subject. Yes.

3090
02:54:52,960 --> 02:54:54,280
It's a very controversial theater.

3091
02:54:54,750 --> 02:54:59,020
Very cause a lot of people believe that
things just like Mckenna had this idea

3092
02:54:59,021 --> 02:55:00,880
that everything. Brian,
why do you keep doing that?

3093
02:55:00,940 --> 02:55:03,710
Because we have three minutes till
we have to split up. Apartment has

3094
02:55:04,310 --> 02:55:07,340
codes. You're going seven, five please.

3095
02:55:07,341 --> 02:55:10,400
I'm just letting you know because he
will have to split this into two podcasts

3096
02:55:10,401 --> 02:55:11,900
just so it doesn't matter.
I don't give a fuck.

3097
02:55:13,190 --> 02:55:16,880
I don't give a fuck about two podcasts.
Right. What were we talking about?

3098
02:55:17,300 --> 02:55:21,260
We're talking about whether evolution is
some random mutation or whether through

3099
02:55:21,261 --> 02:55:25,760
the need of the organism itself.
Somehow this begins to itch in Munich.

3100
02:55:26,030 --> 02:55:27,790
Well, the idea that, thanks did,

3101
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:32,240
Mckenna had this idea that everything
naturally moves towards uh,

3102
02:55:32,270 --> 02:55:37,190
infinite complex con. Let comp the
idea. What was the exact wording?

3103
02:55:37,460 --> 02:55:39,830
Um, his idea was that everything
moves towards complexity.

3104
02:55:39,831 --> 02:55:44,720
Let like everything from the Big Bang
till today from single celled organisms to

3105
02:55:44,721 --> 02:55:45,710
multi celled organisms,

3106
02:55:45,711 --> 02:55:50,030
from everything that exists in the
whole universe has like an ethic.

3107
02:55:50,031 --> 02:55:54,440
It has like a rule and that rule moves
towards more and more complex things.

3108
02:55:54,740 --> 02:55:55,910
And that,
you know,

3109
02:55:55,911 --> 02:55:59,510
what it is is that these animals
recognize that they're being spotted and

3110
02:55:59,511 --> 02:56:02,330
somehow or another by them getting
jacked over and over again,

3111
02:56:02,480 --> 02:56:05,390
the universal consciousness
recognizes this is unfair.

3112
02:56:05,600 --> 02:56:09,200
This is kind of a tricky situation. These
things are stupid and they stand out.

3113
02:56:09,290 --> 02:56:12,170
We have to figure out a way to hide them,
to keep them in the situation.

3114
02:56:12,410 --> 02:56:16,160
And so what they do is they impart some
sort of an ability to blend in with

3115
02:56:16,161 --> 02:56:19,820
their environment. Like chameleons
are like octopus can, you know,

3116
02:56:19,821 --> 02:56:23,120
that it's just some sort of a universal
intelligence that recognizes there's an

3117
02:56:23,121 --> 02:56:27,760
imbalance. You know, we need this octopus,
but they're too easy to eat. We did.

3118
02:56:28,060 --> 02:56:29,420
They're getting Jack left and right.

3119
02:56:29,421 --> 02:56:31,640
Let's figure out a way to keep
them around a little bit more.

3120
02:56:31,820 --> 02:56:33,920
And so they adjust their superpowers.
You know what I'm saying?

3121
02:56:34,300 --> 02:56:34,871
Yeah.
And,

3122
02:56:34,871 --> 02:56:39,310
and I find that so I mean
that other alternative that
just at some point on our,

3123
02:56:39,380 --> 02:56:42,260
it's like, wait a minute, I can
turn any color in the world.

3124
02:56:42,390 --> 02:56:44,810
Well, and even the idea of
random mutation and you know,

3125
02:56:44,850 --> 02:56:48,960
maybe that is how it goes and maybe the
whole thing is programmed by radiation

3126
02:56:48,961 --> 02:56:52,080
and maybe random mutations are
really what causes evolution.

3127
02:56:52,260 --> 02:56:55,920
But maybe that's the tool that it uses
in order to move towards complexity.

3128
02:56:55,921 --> 02:56:58,230
It's still the, it's moving
towards the same thing every time.

3129
02:56:58,410 --> 02:57:00,960
So to call it just random mutations.
It's not like,

3130
02:57:00,961 --> 02:57:04,170
it seems to be these random
mutations are always good. Yeah.

3131
02:57:04,270 --> 02:57:06,720
They're always an advanced version.
They're not that, that they don't,

3132
02:57:07,290 --> 02:57:11,160
they don't succeed. Yes. They don't
succeed. So even though it is, yes,

3133
02:57:11,161 --> 02:57:14,580
it's very simple. They are random
mutations. But look where it's going.

3134
02:57:14,820 --> 02:57:19,620
It's always going towards more
and more complex things. You know,

3135
02:57:19,800 --> 02:57:23,080
it's fascinating shit man. When you
really think about the idea that we're,

3136
02:57:23,081 --> 02:57:27,180
we're moving towards something and
no one's recognizing it and it's all

3137
02:57:27,181 --> 02:57:28,500
happening all the time.

3138
02:57:28,740 --> 02:57:32,370
And everything you do every day in your
life is really just pushing this thing

3139
02:57:32,610 --> 02:57:35,640
along in a program towards
some predetermined goal,

3140
02:57:35,720 --> 02:57:39,630
right? Yeah. The thing that you
consider to be whatever that, that,

3141
02:57:39,680 --> 02:57:42,410
whatever it is,
it really is part of a bigger picture.

3142
02:57:42,411 --> 02:57:44,270
And that's a very optimistic
way to look at it.

3143
02:57:44,271 --> 02:57:47,200
And I liked that way of looking at it
because the alternative is as them,

3144
02:57:48,510 --> 02:57:53,390
Ooh, well that's it folks. That's the end.

3145
02:57:53,910 --> 02:57:58,430
That's the mind. Fuck. That's the mind
fuck of life. Is this all just a pattern?

3146
02:57:58,910 --> 02:58:02,100
Are there patterns upon,
are there

3147
02:58:02,100 --> 02:58:05,190
infinite possibilities for these patterns?

3148
02:58:05,191 --> 02:58:10,020
Is every single second a choice that
you make that pushes you into a parallel

3149
02:58:10,021 --> 02:58:13,410
universe of a very close
distinction, but, but different,

3150
02:58:13,440 --> 02:58:17,420
was it evolution that farted on her,
Ellen Griffin said,

3151
02:58:17,421 --> 02:58:21,930
was the evolution or a random mutation?
