00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.830
Solve for c and
graph the solution.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.460
We have negative 5c is
less than or equal to 15.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.510
So negative 5c is less
than or equal to 15.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.509
I just rewrote it a
little bit bigger.

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:15.050
So if we want to
solve for c, we just

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.430
want to isolate the c
right over here, maybe

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.190
on the left-hand side.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.480
It's right now being
multiplied by negative 5.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.780
So the best way to just have
a c on the left-hand side

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.730
is we can multiply both
sides of this inequality

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.070
by the inverse of negative
5, or by negative 1/5.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.630
So we want to multiply
negative 1/5 times negative 5c.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.470
And we also want to multiply
15 times negative 1/5.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.650
I'm just multiplying both
sides of the inequality

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.430
by the inverse of negative 5,
because this will cancel out

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.495
with the negative 5 and
leave me just with c.

00:00:49.495 --> 00:00:51.490
Now I didn't draw
the inequality here,

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.520
because we have to remember,
if we multiply or divide

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.570
both sides of an inequality
by a negative number,

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.370
you have to flip the inequality.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.490
And we are doing that.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.620
We are multiplying both
sides by negative 1/5, which

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.402
is the equivalent of dividing
both sides by negative 5.

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:09.860
So we need to turn
this from a less

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.550
than or equal to a
greater than or equal.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.390
And now we can
proceed solving for c.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.580
So negative 1/5 times
negative 5 is 1.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.060
So the left-hand
side is just going

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.320
to be c is greater than or
equal to 15 times negative 1/5.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.490
That's the same thing as
15 divided by negative 5.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.740
And so that is negative 3.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.660
So our solution is c is greater
than or equal to negative 3.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.970
And let's graph it.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.940
So that is my number line.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.110
Let's say that is 0, negative
1, negative 2, negative 3.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.570
And then I could go above, 1, 2.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.950
And so c is greater than
or equal to negative 3.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.820
So it can be equal
to negative 3.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.630
So I'll fill that
in right over there.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.046
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:01:57.046 --> 00:01:58.610
So I'll fill it in
right over there.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.630
And then it's
greater than as well.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.710
So it's all of these values
I am filling in in green.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.880
And you can verify that it works
in the original inequality.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.530
Pick something that should work.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.880
Well, 0 should work.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.920
0 is one of the numbers
that we filled in.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.410
Negative 5 times 0 is 0, which
is less than or equal to 15.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.857
It's less than 15.

00:02:21.857 --> 00:02:23.690
Now let's try a number
that's outside of it.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.067
And I haven't drawn it here.

00:02:25.067 --> 00:02:27.400
I could continue with the
number line in this direction.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.800
We would have a negative 4 here.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.660
Negative 4 should
not be included.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.180
And let's verify that
negative 4 doesn't work.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.950
Negative 4 times negative
5 is positive 20.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.180
And positive 20 is
not less than 15,

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.760
so it's good that we did
not include negative 4.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.920
So this is our solution.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.957
And this is that
solution graphed.

00:02:48.957 --> 00:02:51.040
And I wanted to do that
in that other green color.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.640
Here you go.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.880
That's what it looks like.
