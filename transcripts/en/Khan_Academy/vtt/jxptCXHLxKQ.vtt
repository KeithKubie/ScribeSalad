00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.520
Before doing more examples with
Snell's Law, which essentially

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.820
amount to some math
problems, what I want to do

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.880
is get an intuitive
understanding

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.440
for why this straw looks bent
in this picture right over here.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.270
To do that, let me
just draw a simplified

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.910
version of that picture.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.880
So let's draw, this is
the cup right over here.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.080
We'll do a side
profile of the cup.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.710
So this is a side profile of
this glass right over here.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.410
It's the best that
I can draw it.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.580
And then let me draw
the actual straw.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.400
So I'm going to first draw the
straw where it actually is.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.720
So it's coming in off
the side of the cup,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.080
and the straw is
actually not bending,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.350
and it goes to the bottom
of the cup just like that.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.380
And then it goes up
like that, and then it

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.360
goes slightly above it.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.810
And then it actually does
bend up here, up here, right

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.851
over here, and then the
straw actually does bend.

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:54.112
But that is irrelevant to
what we want to talk about.

00:00:54.112 --> 00:00:56.570
What I want to do in this video
is talk about why-- when we

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.150
look over here, why does it
look like the straw got bent?

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.780
And it all comes out
of the refraction

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.820
of the light as the light from
the straw down here changes,

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.500
as it goes from one
medium to another.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.370
Now, we know from
refraction indices,

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.910
or just in general, that
light moves slower in water

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:17.930
than it does in air.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.410
So it's slower in water
and faster in air.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.250
So let's think about
what's going to happen.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.260
Let me draw two
rays that are coming

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.790
from this point on the
straw right over here.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.810
So if I draw one
ray right over here,

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.630
so I'm just going to pick
an arbitrary direction.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.230
So if I pick one
ray just like that.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.800
Now, when it goes from the
slower medium to the faster

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.620
medium, what's going
to happen to it?

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.540
And it's at a slight angle here,
so the left side of the ray

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.160
is going to end up in the
air before the right side.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.177
And I'm just using this
as a way of the-- I'm

00:01:58.177 --> 00:01:59.760
using the car example
to kind of think

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.650
about which way this
light's going to bend.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.566
So if you visualize it
as a car-- or sometimes

00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:05.150
people visualize as
a marching band--

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.661
the left side of
the marching band

00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:08.410
is going to get out
before the right side.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.020
And it's going to
start moving faster.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.603
So this is going to
turn to the right.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.290
Now, let me do another ray.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.600
So let me do another ray that's
going from that same point.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.020
I don't want it to go
right along the straw,

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.720
so another ray just like that.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.040
It will also turn to the right.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.930
So it is also going
to turn to the right.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.080
Now, if someone's eye is right
over here, so that's your eye.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.360
That's the eyelashes.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.240
That someone's eye.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.160
You can draw their
nose and all the rest.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.010
If they're looking
down, where does it

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.730
look like these two
light rays-- let's

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.396
say their eye is big enough that
it captured both of these rays.

00:02:48.396 --> 00:02:51.480
Where does it look like these
two rays are coming from?

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.010
So if you trace
both of these rays

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.476
back, if you just assume
that there was a line here,

00:02:55.476 --> 00:02:57.100
that's what our eyes
and our brains do.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.120
If you assume that whatever
direction this ray is currently

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.660
going is the direction
it came from,

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.700
and same thing for this
magenta ray, just like that,

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.610
it would look to this observer
that this point on the straw

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.682
is actually right over there.

00:03:12.682 --> 00:03:14.140
And it would look--
and if you kept

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.320
doing that for a bunch
of points on the straw,

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.070
it would look like
this point on the straw

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.650
is actually right over here.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.440
It would look like we could do
it for this point on the straw.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.190
It would look like
that point on the straw

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.940
is actually right over here.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.440
So to this observer, the
straw would look like this.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:39.240
It would look like
something like that.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.610
It would look bent.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.520
This part would-- even
though the light from here

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.390
is going up and then up
and then it moves out,

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.390
because it gets bent,
when you converge it back,

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.850
it would converge to
this, just like we

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:50.970
saw with that first point.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.570
The light from this point,
when it goes out and gets bent,

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.960
if you were to just
extrapolate backwards

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.280
from their new directions,
you'd get to that point.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.170
So to this observer,
this point on the straw

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.140
will look to be right over
here, even though the light was

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.430
emitted down here.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.720
And that's why the straw
actually looks bent.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.770
So this is all really just
because of refraction,

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.423
from going from a slow or
medium to a faster one.

00:04:15.423 --> 00:04:17.589
So hopefully you find that
a little bit interesting.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.677
In the next video, we'll
actually do some examples

00:04:19.677 --> 00:04:21.260
with Snell's Law
just to get ourselves

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.440
comfortable with
the mathematics.
