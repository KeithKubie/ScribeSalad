00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.750
What I want to do in this video
is think about what type

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.690
of reaction we might have if
we have ingredients very

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.000
similar to what we saw
in the last video.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.130
But instead of our nucleophile
or our base being methoxide,

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.320
it's going to be something
slightly more involved.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.860
So it's still going to have the
O minus, but it's going to

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.090
be bonded to a carbon, which is
then bonded to three methyl

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.220
groups: CH3, CH3, CH3,
just like that.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.875
So we don't have methoxide
anymore.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.090
We have this thing
right over here.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.090
So just like before, we have
the exact same solvent.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.520
We have dimethylformamide.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.880
It's an aprotic solvent.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.840
That by itself would put us in
the Sn2 or E2 direction.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.410
But now we don't have
methoxide anymore.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.830
Methoxide was both a strong
base, very strong base.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.340
It's also a very small molecule,
and so it can really

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.010
get in there and react
with the substrate.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.300
So it's also a strong
nucleophile.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.240
Now, this more bulky molecule,
it is still a strong base.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.950
It is still an extremely
strong base.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.980
But now it's this big,
bulky molecule.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.510
It would actually have trouble
getting in to react with your

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.080
substrate, so it is no longer
a good nucleophile.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.730
This is not a good
nucleophile.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.260
So by making the base more, I
guess, bulky, it's now-- or I

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.890
guess you could also call it the
nucleophile or the thing

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.080
that would act as a nucleophile,
more bulky.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.810
It is no longer a strong
nucleophile, so it would no

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.810
longer be good for
an Sn2 reaction.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.530
So just by changing the base a
little bit or the nucleophile

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.170
a little bit, now this
one would go

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.630
strictly in the E2 direction.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.550
So we wouldn't see anything like
this in the last video.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.850
We would only see something
like this.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.480
And obviously, the base in this
example is no longer just

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.190
a methoxide.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.140
It looks like this.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.336
Let me clear it.

00:01:58.336 --> 00:02:01.130
Let me do my best to clear it.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.370
Edit, clear.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.130
Let me clear it over
here as well.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.630
So now instead of just being
bonded to a methyl group, it's

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.950
bonded to a carbon.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.220
It's bonded to a carbon that's
bonded to three methyl groups.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:25.320
So CH3, CH3, CH3, or you could
call this a tert-butyl group;

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.330
this whole thing over here.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:33.090
So that's a carbon bonded to
a CH3, a CH3 and a CH3.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.360
So the reaction occurs just like
what we saw in the last

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.460
video, except this base is this
big, old, bulky thing,

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.960
but it can still act as a strong
base, so it still nabs

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.370
the hydrogen or really
just the proton.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.460
The hydrogen's electron that
was bonded now goes to the

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.730
alpha carbon.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.960
The alpha carbon will then lose
an electron to the bromo

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.950
group and that becomes bromide,
so the same exact

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.530
mechanism, different base.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.730
But that base is now not a good
nucleophile, so you won't

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.970
see Sn2 occurring at all.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.680
You will only see E2.
