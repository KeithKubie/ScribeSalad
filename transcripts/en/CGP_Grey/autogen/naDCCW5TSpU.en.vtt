00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.590
 Las Vegas, dear! It’s paradise, this is not a metaphor. It’s really not Las Vegas. 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:11.019
 Check the map and you will see Paradise. This is also the name you use when visiting and inquiring about the local weather. 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.849
 The blue part is the Las Vegas city and the pink area is the paradise city: there are almost everything related to Las Vegas. 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:18.890
 Even including the market mark! 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.160
 You may think that paradise is like other cities that have become relatively unknown because of their larger neighbors (eg London and London) 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.699
 But Paradise City is not a city at all: it is a non-formal area. 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:30.249
 What? 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:34.670
 A quick review of the political course: Residents living in the city need to comply with the city’s regulations, 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.360
 And the county law (the largest administrative district below the US state is the county), state law, and national law. 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.000
 It’s a government that is politicized on every layer of the government’s taxation to enforce current levels of regulation. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.860
 But if anyone thinks that this layer of tax is too heavy, he can step on the gas to the fields outside the borders of all cities. 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.680
 Live like a stubborn individualist: not bound by any regulations 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.949
呃... In addition to national law, state law, and county law, we must continue to comply. 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.449
 But when you move outside the city, you can pay a little less tax and get a little less political. 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:08.520
 Because they are in a non-formal area, but when the area develops, the population rises. 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.330
 People will inevitably want to have police drainage system school rules, etc. So they will soon draft a charter and elect the mayor 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.700
 Then a new city was born. 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.810
 The strange thing about Paradise City is that it is not like most non-formal areas. 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.360
 Most of the tumbleweed that is only scratched and run may have a felt bag (a kind of yurt). This is the equivalent of a Disney World in Paradise City. 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:34.050
 Living close to 250,000 people, the population density far exceeds the density of people who usually want to form a city. 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.399
 But this is not because people in paradise are too troublesome. 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.520
 Paradise City is almost the only non-organized area that is "officially recognized". So why? 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.640
 Let's go back to the time when the Mormons moved to this land in the 1880s... 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.979
 It seems to be too far. Now I jumped to the 1950s when people were conducting nuclear tests in the open areas on the edge of the city. 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.880
 (Error: Safe and harmless zero pollution mushroom cloud!) 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.700
 Nevada has just legalized gambling and the gambling empire that is seated in Las Vegas is growing. 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.149
 Ok, actually, it’s just "just right" outside the edge of the city to avoid paying city taxes. When it comes to serving casinos, it’s enough money. 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.440
 They can use their private security as a police officer in the real sense 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.500
 Even if this doesn’t sound like it’s completely deserved, it’s a triad industry. 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.300
 Now, of course, it’s not the case. The current operators are already two major gaming companies. 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.450
 Far away now back to the theme in the 1950s Las Vegas Municipality is on the verge of bankruptcy 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.750
 And the casino that earned a lot of money is on the edge of the city, so the brain is turning around. 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.390
 Say to the casino in the paradise city area, "Who is it? You are definitely in my jurisdiction. I am the boss. I said that I should pay taxes quickly." 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.480
 But the casino refused 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.690
 This dispute can only be solved by the county government that goes to the next level. 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.360
 By the way, the casino pays taxes directly to the county government, so "surprisingly" the result is 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.840
 The county government denied the taxation power of Las Vegas to Paradise City 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:54.950
 In order to prevent future disputes, the county government officially established this non-established area: Paradise City 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.130
 All the affairs in the area, Las Vegas has no right to interfere 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.060
 The county government directly manages the city of paradise and lowers the tax rate. This is why when the new casino is established 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.730
 Usually choose to be in paradise city instead of Las Vegas 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.810
 However, if you think that the origin of the city of paradise is only a kind of city-scale tax evasion 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.480
 Then you are right 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:24.780
 Thanks to Audible.com for funding this episode, which is a platform with more than 180,000 audiobooks. 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.780
 Every year I listen to many audio books and Audible is the platform I choose to use. 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.680
 Here I would like to recommend a sound novel that I have listened to during my recent trip to Las Vegas. 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.780
 That is the book of the graveyard book. This is the story of the novel written by Neil Gaimen. I won’t say much if I don’t spoil. 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.680
 I will tell you that Neil Gaiman is very telling the story and the voice of his narrative fits perfectly with the story. 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.280
 He gave personality to every character he created in a unique way that only writers have. 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.680
 If you want to watch interesting and interesting stories, I have to give a thumbs up for this book.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:31.680

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.480
 As you continue to correct others saying "your holiday is in paradise city instead of Las Vegas" 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.470
 Las Vegas and Paradise City are located in the Las Vegas Valley 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.040
 So next time you can still say that you are going to Las Vegas, even if you haven’t actually stepped into Las Vegas. 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.790
 Because you are in theory going to Las Vegas.
