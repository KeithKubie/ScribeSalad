00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.390
Do girls who go together really flow together?

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:14.090
Hey guys, Amy with you on DNews today talking
about one of the more common lady-myths: menstrual

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.430
synchrony, or the idea that women who spend
a lot of time together find themselves menstruating

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.930
at the same time.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.710
Since the 1970s, there have been a few studies
to suggest that synchronized menstruation

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.680
is possible between roommates, lesbian couples,
and sexually segregated groups of women.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.609
But there have also been studies to suggest
synchrony isn’t a real thing; roommates

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:35.969
who are not close friends and lesbian couples
living together for a number of years have

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.370
been found to not sync their cycles.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.510
Some studies have split the difference to
find that women’s cycles adjust for closer

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.440
flow dates, but only by a day or two.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.989
But more recent research says that synchrony
isn’t really what’s happening.

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.280
Two separate studies done in 2006 found that
menstrual synchrony is actually just chance.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.049
It’s normal for a woman’s cycle to last
anywhere from 21 to 35 days with menses lasting

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:57.929
between five and seven days.

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:00.329
And variations in that cycle are common.

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.989
Many women experience erratic or even missed
periods.

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.390
So not only are regular periods actually quite
irregular, there are all kinds of things that

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.130
can impact your cycle.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.170
Stress is a common culprit, be it personal
like a breakup, professional like losing your

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.009
job, or life stress like a moving to a new
city.

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.690
Scientists aren’t exactly sure how this
one works, but we know that stress affects

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.320
the hypothalamus gland that controls the pituitary
gland that in turn controls the ovaries (among

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.930
other things) and help manage hormones.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.520
And hormone imbalance can lead to a change
in cycle.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.659
We see this most commonly with medication.

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.060
Antidepressants and antipsychotics can elevate
the pituitary hormone called prolactin that

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.350
can affect the hormones responsible for regulating
your cycle.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.090
Hormonal birth control also affects a woman’s
cycle by preventing ovulation and thickening

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.340
cervical mucus to prevent pregnancy.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.649
But even non-hormonal birth control like copper
IUDs can disrupt a cycle just by virtue of

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.189
putting a foreign object inside the uterus.

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.860
Changes in diet and exercise can affect your
cycle as well.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.569
Working out typically more leads to shorter,
lighter periods, but excessive exercise can

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:00.560
actually stop menstruation altogether.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.259
It has to do with body fat.

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.840
Too little body fat and a woman stops ovulating.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.360
On the opposite end of the spectrum, weight
gain can cause the ovaries to produce extra

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.530
testosterone leading to longer cycles or missed
periods.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.760
Illness, too, though more serious illnesses
than a common cold, can affect a cycle.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.440
It’s not unheard of for a women to bleed
while seriously ill with a virus, changing

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.590
her cycle’s start date.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.160
But like all myths, there’s a grain of truth
to the idea that women can sync by proximity.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.170
Pheromones are the chemical substances we
excrete through sweat that give other people

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.540
subtle messages about us.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.720
One of these pheromones secreted in armpit
sweat is called 5 alpha-androstenol and is

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.500
thought to be linked to menstrual synchrony.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.250
So while it’s possible that smelling 5 alpha-androstenol
affects women’s cycles leading them to sync,

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.751
it’s far more likely that all the other
things that are known affect a woman’s period

00:02:43.751 --> 00:02:46.510
are actually what causes the appearance of
synchrony.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.030
Because when you think about it, two women
menstruating for around five days a month

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.480
would probably end up overlapping at some
point.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.700
So, ladies, have you ever found yourself seemingly
syncing with a roommate or close friend?
