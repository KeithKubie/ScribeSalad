00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:01.968
[music playing]

00:00:01.968 --> 00:00:05.405
This ladder's-- this
thing is janky, man.

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:06.840
If we're going to
go the distance

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.342
to get to a place like
this, then I'm going to go

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:10.944
the distance when I'm there.

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:13.213
I mean, you gotta check
every nook and cranny

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:14.681
behind every piece of plywood.

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:15.582
You gotta get in the attic.

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:16.716
You gotta get in the basement.

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:19.352
I was looking to see if
any of these are signs.

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:20.720
You'd be surprised
how many times

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.390
we see stuff from people that
use signs that have repairs.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.325
Repaired stuff.
Good ones, too, you know?

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:26.960
MIKE: You gotta do your
due diligence, man.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.695
I mean, those are the kind
of places that you think

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.597
about when you're driving down
the road, and you're like,

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:31.731
ah, I wish I would
have checked the attic,

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:32.799
or I wish I would've done this.

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:33.633
There's nothing up there.

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:34.601
[laughs]

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:35.769
I don't want to
second guess myself

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:36.970
when I leave this building.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.773
I want to see it all.

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:43.910
This is a base for
a clothing rack.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.315
And the top of this is
downstairs in Laura's room.

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:50.717
Because I remember,
when I walked

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.619
in, downstairs, on the second
floor, I saw her to the left.

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:56.222
To the right, on the floor,
is the top to this rack.

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:57.724
When I'm looking
through a lot of stuff,

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:00.760
I'm basically creating
a Rolodex in my mind

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.395
of parts and pieces of things.

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:05.465
For some reason, I can
remember where I saw something.

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:06.833
And then when I
see something else,

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:09.102
I can remember that piece I saw.

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:10.904
And then I put the
two pieces together.

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:14.174
You know, it's always been a
hands-on memory thing for me.

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:16.743
Turn a page in a book,
you know, I'm snoozing.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:19.913
But when I'm waist deep
in it, I come alive.

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:20.747
It's great.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:21.714
How much do you want for this?

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:23.116
And then she can
have the whole thing.

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:24.951
DAVID: Throw me out something.

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:26.553
- 100 bucks.
- OK.

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:27.253
OK.

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:28.588
So 100 bucks.

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:31.825
The top without the bottom
is really no big deal.

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:33.626
You know, but when you
put the two together,

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:34.761
it's something again.

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:36.663
And I want Laura to have this.

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:40.500
We would never have found
this place without her.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.468
Laura.

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:43.436
LAURA: Ooh.

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:44.204
Look what I found.

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:44.971
What did you find?

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:46.139
Look what I bought you.

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:47.140
LAURA: You bought that for me?

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.741
- And then look.
- Are you kidding?

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:54.914
The reason I bought you
that is because you have this.

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:56.049
LAURA: Oh, no.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.684
I didn't even see that.

00:01:57.684 --> 00:01:59.686
MIKE: She's a vintage
clothing buyer.

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:01.621
But she saw all
this other stuff,

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:03.690
and she realized she
wasn't going to buy it.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.658
- Oh, [inaudible].
- Oh, this is really happening.

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:07.560
So she turns another
dealer onto it.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.496
And that's what we
do in our industry.

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:10.563
We help each other out.

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:12.799
Because at the end of
the day, isn't that

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.135
what it's all about, not just in
business, but in life as well?

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:17.871
You being in the clothing
business and all--

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:18.972
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:20.540
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.442
I thought it was really
nice that Mike completed

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:23.877
that clothing rack for me.

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:26.179
It was kind of like
scratching my back.

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:27.080
David.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.216
DAVID: Yes.

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:31.718
Was this inside the store?

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:32.752
I really don't know.

00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:34.888
The two sisters were
great collectors.

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:37.724
They would go to auctions
and country farm sales.

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:39.392
And I don't know.

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:40.660
It could have come
from anywhere.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.464
This is a great piece,
because it's specific enough--

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:47.867
pottery-- but it's
also broad enough--

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:49.068
any kind of pottery.

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:51.871
Pottery collectors would
absolutely love this sign.

00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:55.942
It's double-sided, and
it's weathered enough

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:57.944
to where you can see its age.

00:02:57.944 --> 00:03:00.079
Is this something I
can make you an offer on?

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.514
Sure, why not?

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:07.220
Um, 300.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.489
Mm.

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.991
350?

00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:13.226
Hm.

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:15.929
I'm just wondering how much
it's going to clean up.

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:18.364
I'll tell you what.
Why don't we settle on 325?

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:19.165
OK.

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:20.133
MIKE: We doing this?

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:22.001
- Makes a deal to me.
- All right.

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:23.002
We're doing it.

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:24.938
We have found some
great stuff here.

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:29.042
But what I want to do is ask one
more time about the Keds shoe.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:32.679
Let's get back into the
shoe department here.

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:33.947
All right.

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:38.051
The last time we were down
here, I got a little crazy

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.919
and offered you a
grand for the shoe.

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.354
This would have
been in the store,

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:45.358
letting the customer know that
they represent Keds brand.

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:48.761
So what are you thinking?

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:51.965
Well, I think you're crazy,
but we'll do the 1,000.

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:53.366
- You going to do it?
- We're going to do it.

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:54.701
- We're getting crazy together?
- We're going to get together.

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:55.535
- Let's get crazy together.
- All right.

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:56.369
We're getting crazy together.

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:58.471
I never see displays like this.

00:03:58.471 --> 00:04:00.773
And it's perfect.

00:04:00.773 --> 00:04:02.942
A lot of people collect
vintage clothing.

00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:05.244
A lot of people
collect vintage shoes.

00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:07.614
And when you look at something
like this that's made

00:04:07.614 --> 00:04:10.049
this well, it's a piece of art.

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.150
It really truly is.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.851
David.

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:12.685
Super careful.

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:13.987
Thank you, my friend.

00:04:13.987 --> 00:04:16.389
DAVID: I think when you find
somebody that appreciates

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.458
it and you know will
take care of it,

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:20.693
it sort of gives you
a warm, good feeling

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:24.497
to know that it's going
on to the next generation.

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:25.632
I'll get over it.

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:26.966
[laughs]

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:29.335
When you get the museum
and everything all done--

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:30.970
Come back in two years.
[laughs]

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.305
All right.

00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:34.674
MIKE: This building has a
tremendous amount of history,

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:36.509
and it's had a lot
of different uses.

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.979
And it's had to, in order to
stay relevant in the community

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.215
and to stay competitive
in industries

00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:43.916
that are constantly changing.

00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:45.251
- Thank you so much.
- God bless you, my friend.

00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:46.753
- Thanks, David.
- It's been a real thrill.

00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:48.588
Dave understands
that, and he's

00:04:48.588 --> 00:04:51.124
willing to carry on
the family tradition,

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:53.526
not just for himself,
but for the community.

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:54.594
[horn honking]

00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:55.662
Good luck, David!

00:04:55.662 --> 00:04:56.696
Bye bye.

00:04:56.696 --> 00:04:58.498
Safe trip.
