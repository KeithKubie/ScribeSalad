00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.240
Hello Psych2Go-ers!

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.660
We just want to
take the time to thank you

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.280
for all your kind of support.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.100
We're a team of dedicated,

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.100
passionate and hardworking individuals,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.120
who come together every day
with one goal in mind:

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.000
We want to make psychology
come alive for you.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.400
We're self-funded
and recently launched our Patreon!

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.080
If you enjoy the work we do
and find it meaningful,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.920
please stick around
until the end of the video

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.180
for information on
how to get more involved with us,

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.140
and all the cool rewards
you can get from us!

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.880
We hope you enjoy this video!

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.100
The world is becoming

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.400
more demanding
and fast-paced every day.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.860
As a result, it's easy to feel
burnt-out and unmotivated.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.100
Just when you think

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.540
you're ready to pick
yourself up again and start over,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.160
something happens along the way
that can flip you like a switch.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.080
It's not too long
until you find yourself sinking.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.340
It feels heavy but it feels familiar.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.660
You may find yourself
scared of fading,

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.440
and wanting to disappear again.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.080
So, how do you keep going?

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.540
Here are five ways to stay motivated,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.000
once you're ready to do something.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.280
1. Realize what you can control,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.320
and allow the rest
that you can't to just be.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.380
It's powerful when you recognize

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.060
that you're in control of
how your life unfolds.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.340
This prevents you from living passively.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.540
We all feel lost
at some point in our lives,

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.680
and that's okay.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.240
But when you allow
your uncertainty to do the steering,

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.700
you can easily fall into the trap
of going through everyday motions,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.540
just because.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.660
It's easy to give ourselves
less credit than what we deserve,

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.820
because it means taking less
responsibility for our lives.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.960
Instead of shutting yourself away
from taking control, embrace it.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.120
But also learn to let go
of what cannot be controlled.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.520
Balance is key.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.040
Have people in your life
who believe in your potential,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.440
although it may be tempting

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.220
to want to prove
your non-believers wrong.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.380
You may be putting yourself
at an emotional risk.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.900
If you're going to be motivated,

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.940
be motivated by healthy reasons.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.400
Do something because you care about.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.820
Or, if you're feeling dejected,

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.520
do something because you
want to care about it again.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.840
Connect with positive people
and others with similar goals,

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.340
together, we can build
a support system for one another

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.820
when the going gets tough.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.380
Everyone falls down at some point.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.900
What matters is finding others
who can lend a hand

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.400
to help you get back up
and try again.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.760
3. Adapt a different perspective
towards your obstacles.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.160
Don't be afraid of
your struggles or challenges.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.100
Instead, build your resilience and focus

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.820
on the benefits of growing
from the mistakes you make.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.020
Setbacks can teach you
the art of patience.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.900
It's easy to get discouraged

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.520
when you experience bad days
or feel overwhelmed,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.000
with things get hectic.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.560
Life is full of surprises,
including the bad ones.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.680
So, expect the unexpected,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.200
but don't allow the temporary negativity

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.180
to cause you prolonged suffering.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.500
Instead, take a step back,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.380
and tell yourself that
the storm will pass.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.400
4. Breakdown your big goals
into smaller ones.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.040
It can be daunting
when you have to execute big tasks.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.580
Rather than diving in blindly,

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.300
It's more helpful to first visualize
what you want to accomplish.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.460
You can do this by drawing a map,

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.840
creating an outline
or coming up with a list.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.120
When you break down a big task
into multiple small ones,

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.220
it makes it much more approachable
and much more doable.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.040
Since there's only
24 hours in a day,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.700
and only so much energy you carry,

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.080
before you feel burnt out
and need to recharge.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.760
You have to recognize
the limitations you possess,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.360
and make the best
out of your time and resources.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.960
This will help you learn
how to prioritize accordingly.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.440
5. Don't forget to live for yourself,

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.960
and have fun in between.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.860
If all you're doing
is work and no fun,

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.740
Then, you're putting your mental
and physical health at risk.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.460
Don't forget to enjoy life
for what it is.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.240
Although it's great to find something
you're passionate about,

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.520
leave room for yourself,

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.860
to grow with your friends,
your love life and your family.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.800
Break familiar cycles of work and routine

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.080
and replace them with laughter
or moments of joy

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.500
when you try something new.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.820
Give yourself time to be who you are,

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.720
without your work defining you.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.820
It doesn't make you
any less passionate.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.700
You just make room
for valuable experiences

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.720
that remind you why
you were motivated in the first place.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.080

when the going gets tough?
