00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.252
Voiceover:We've been drawing analogies

00:00:02.252 --> 00:00:03.755
between I guess we could say

00:00:03.755 --> 00:00:06.688
traditional multiplication,
or scalar multiplication,

00:00:06.688 --> 00:00:07.840
and the first one we drew is

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.268
when you have traditional multiplication,

00:00:10.268 --> 00:00:13.364
you multiply 1 times any number

00:00:13.364 --> 00:00:15.139
and you get that number again.

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.998
And you could view 1 as
essentially the identity.

00:00:17.998 --> 00:00:19.177
The identity number,

00:00:19.177 --> 00:00:21.535
or this is the identity
property of multiplication.

00:00:21.535 --> 00:00:22.813
You multiply 1 times any number,

00:00:22.813 --> 00:00:24.063
you get that number again.

00:00:24.063 --> 00:00:26.222
And that essentially inspired our thinking

00:00:26.222 --> 00:00:29.020
behind having identity matrices.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.748
Said hey, maybe there are some matrices

00:00:30.748 --> 00:00:34.546
that if I multiply
times some other matrix,

00:00:34.546 --> 00:00:38.101
I'm going to get that matrix again.

00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:40.071
And you've probably shown for yourselves

00:00:40.071 --> 00:00:42.069
that you can do it in either way.

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:47.470
You could have some matrix
times an identity matrix

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.931
and get that matrix again.

00:00:50.931 --> 00:00:54.964
Now if matrix A right over
here is a square matrix,

00:00:54.964 --> 00:00:58.580
then in either situation,
this identity matrix

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.344
is going to be the same identity matrix.

00:01:00.344 --> 00:01:02.298
But if matrix A is not a square matrix,

00:01:02.298 --> 00:01:03.116
then these are going to be

00:01:03.116 --> 00:01:05.178
two different identity matrices,

00:01:05.178 --> 00:01:08.722
depending on the appropriate dimensions.

00:01:08.722 --> 00:01:11.385
Now, let's see if we
can extend this analogy

00:01:11.385 --> 00:01:13.616
between traditional multiplication

00:01:13.616 --> 00:01:16.109
and matrix multiplication.

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:17.873
We know that there's
another spacial number

00:01:17.873 --> 00:01:20.898
in traditional multiplication,
and that's a 0.

00:01:20.898 --> 00:01:27.394
So, we know that 0 times
anything is equal to 0.

00:01:27.394 --> 00:01:31.840
Or, anything times 0 is equal to 0.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.233
So what would be the analogy

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:35.122
if we're thinking about
matrix multiplication?

00:01:35.122 --> 00:01:37.535
Well, it would be some matrix that

00:01:37.535 --> 00:01:40.747
if I were to multiply
it times another matrix,

00:01:40.747 --> 00:01:45.777
I get, I guess you could say
that same 0 matrix again.

00:01:45.777 --> 00:01:47.007
And that is what we call it.

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:49.122
We call it a 0 matrix.

00:01:49.122 --> 00:01:53.954
So if I take some matrix
A, and essentially,

00:01:53.954 --> 00:01:57.324
if I multiply it times
one of these 0 matrices,

00:01:57.324 --> 00:02:01.473
or I multiply one of
the 0 matrices times A,

00:02:01.473 --> 00:02:07.249
I should get another 0 matrix.

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:08.825
And it depends on the dimensions.

00:02:08.825 --> 00:02:11.461
You might not get a 0 matrix

00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:13.458
with the same dimensions.

00:02:13.458 --> 00:02:14.897
It depends what the dimensions

00:02:14.897 --> 00:02:17.328
of A are going to be, but you could image

00:02:17.328 --> 00:02:20.161
what a 0 matrix might look like.

00:02:20.161 --> 00:02:26.138
For example, if A is 1,2,3,4,

00:02:26.138 --> 00:02:28.657
what's a 0 matrix that I could multiply

00:02:28.657 --> 00:02:31.815
this by to get another 0 matrix?

00:02:31.815 --> 00:02:33.642
Well, it might be pretty straight forward,

00:02:33.642 --> 00:02:35.855
if you just had a ton of zeros here,

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:37.746
when you multiply this out,

00:02:37.746 --> 00:02:39.977
you're going to get this -

00:02:39.977 --> 00:02:42.703
you date the dot product of
this row and this column.

00:02:42.703 --> 00:02:45.713
0 times 1 plus 0 times 3 is going to be 0.

00:02:45.713 --> 00:02:49.654
You keep going, 0,0,0,0.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:54.761
If we had a - just to
make the point clear -

00:02:54.761 --> 00:03:03.205
let's say we had a matrix 1,2,3,4,5,6.

00:03:03.205 --> 00:03:05.916
So over here, we want
to multiply this times -

00:03:05.916 --> 00:03:08.165
let's see, in order for
the matrix multiplication

00:03:08.165 --> 00:03:12.078
to work, my 0 matrix has got to have

00:03:12.078 --> 00:03:19.213
the same number of columns
as this one has rows,

00:03:19.213 --> 00:03:25.630
so it's got to have 2 columns,

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.276
but I could make it have 3 rows.

00:03:28.276 --> 00:03:31.792
So it could look like this, 0,0,0,0

00:03:31.792 --> 00:03:34.646
and I encourage you to multiply these two.

00:03:34.646 --> 00:03:36.610
Pause the video right
now, and see what you get.

00:03:37.453 --> 00:03:40.079
Well when you multiply
them, let's think about it.

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.807
So the top left entry -

00:03:41.807 --> 00:03:43.606
so let me just write the dimensions.

00:03:43.606 --> 00:03:48.135
This is a 3x2 matrix, this is a 2x3matrix.

00:03:48.135 --> 00:03:51.678
So, we know that we have
valid matrix multiplication

00:03:51.678 --> 00:03:53.116
going on right over same here.

00:03:53.116 --> 00:03:55.016
The number of columns in the first matrix

00:03:55.016 --> 00:03:56.914
is equal to the number of
rows in the second one.

00:03:56.914 --> 00:03:58.938
And we also know that
the resulting product

00:03:58.938 --> 00:04:01.862
is going to be a 3x3 matrix.

00:04:01.862 --> 00:04:04.960
So it's going to be a 3x3 matrix,

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.236
and I'll leave it up to you to verify

00:04:07.236 --> 00:04:13.903
that all the entries
here are going to be 0.

00:04:13.903 --> 00:04:16.351
And it makes sense, you
could go through the math,

00:04:16.351 --> 00:04:17.550
but you can see, well
you're just everytime,

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.293
you're multiplying say
this row by this column

00:04:22.293 --> 00:04:23.851
to get that entry, we'll just have

00:04:23.851 --> 00:04:28.007
0 times 1 plus 0 times
4 to get that 0 there.

00:04:28.007 --> 00:04:30.041
But the whole point of
showing you this example is,

00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:32.240
we have one 0 matrix multiplying

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.474
by this matrix right over here,

00:04:35.474 --> 00:04:38.130
and then we get another 0 matrix

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.544
but it has different dimensions.
