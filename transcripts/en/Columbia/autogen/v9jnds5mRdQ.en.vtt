you know sort of not have been members
 

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.990
you know sort of not have been members
will be members go to the meeting you

00:07:58.990 --> 00:07:59.000
will be members go to the meeting you
 

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.250
will be members go to the meeting you
know that that there's the kind of the

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:00.260
know that that there's the kind of the
 

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:01.960
know that that there's the kind of the
membership and then there's that that

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:01.970
membership and then there's that that
 

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.780

broader community around it um those

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:04.790

historians think that the aaj should be

doing more or less what it is doing and
 

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:18.910
doing more or less what it is doing and
so this crisis is it can be taken two

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:18.920
so this crisis is it can be taken two
 

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.070
so this crisis is it can be taken two
ways one one that you know there are

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.080
ways one one that you know there are
 

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.020
ways one one that you know there are
some real measurable problems with

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:23.030
some real measurable problems with
 

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.200
some real measurable problems with
scholarly societies the other that you

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:26.210
scholarly societies the other that you
 

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:27.610
scholarly societies the other that you
know people generally like these things

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:27.620
know people generally like these things
 

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.830
know people generally like these things
and and and so I think what we need to

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:31.840
and and and so I think what we need to
 

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.780
and and and so I think what we need to
interrogate then is well if they like

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:34.790
interrogate then is well if they like
 

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:38.380
interrogate then is well if they like
what scholarly societies do but the

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:38.390
what scholarly societies do but the
 

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.270
what scholarly societies do but the
scholarly societies are having a trouble

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:40.280
scholarly societies are having a trouble
 

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.850
scholarly societies are having a trouble
making a go of that we should kind of

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:42.860
making a go of that we should kind of
 

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.530
making a go of that we should kind of
take a look at what these societies do

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:44.540
take a look at what these societies do
 

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:49.750
take a look at what these societies do
and where that mismatch is happening for

so all of these structures all of these

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.480
so all of these structures all of these
 

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.120
so all of these structures all of these
structures of scholarly societies they

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:25.130
structures of scholarly societies they
 

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:28.340
structures of scholarly societies they
start to seem less like what the

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:28.350
start to seem less like what the
 

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.170
start to seem less like what the
scholarly societies were intended to do

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:30.180
scholarly societies were intended to do
 

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:34.400
scholarly societies were intended to do
and more like overhead right they they

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:34.410
and more like overhead right they they
 

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.920
and more like overhead right they they
seem to kind of get in the way of what

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:36.930
seem to kind of get in the way of what
 

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.500
seem to kind of get in the way of what
the scholarly society intended to do

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:39.510
the scholarly society intended to do
 

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:41.690
the scholarly society intended to do
that the structures have taken over the

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:41.700
that the structures have taken over the
 

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.040
that the structures have taken over the
purpose you know the structures were

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:43.050
purpose you know the structures were
 

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:44.980
purpose you know the structures were
created for a purpose and now the

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:44.990
created for a purpose and now the
 

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:47.450
created for a purpose and now the
scholarly societies kind of exist not

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:47.460
scholarly societies kind of exist not
 

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.310
scholarly societies kind of exist not
serve the purpose but to kind of

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:49.320
serve the purpose but to kind of
 

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.340
serve the purpose but to kind of
perpetuate the structures and I think

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:52.350
perpetuate the structures and I think
 

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.870
perpetuate the structures and I think
that's a lot of what people see when

that's a lot of what people see when
 

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.840
that's a lot of what people see when
they see crisis and scholarly societies

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:55.850
they see crisis and scholarly societies
 

00:14:55.850 --> 00:15:02.480
they see crisis and scholarly societies
that's that's what they see knowing very

scholarly communication too often served
 

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.080

you know this can this can happen

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:55.310
you know this can this can happen
 

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:58.840
you know this can this can happen
anywhere for very low low cost even

00:27:58.840 --> 00:27:58.850
anywhere for very low low cost even
 

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:01.000

and I connect that with some of my
 

00:49:13.059 --> 00:49:14.760
and I connect that with some of my
interest in the difficulty in conveying

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:14.770

maybe some sort of demonstration about
 

00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:43.500
maybe some sort of demonstration about
how that connects to larger projects

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:43.510
how that connects to larger projects
 

00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:45.720
how that connects to larger projects
that develop over time and have some

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:45.730

questions um well the first thing to say

00:49:52.829 --> 00:49:52.839
questions um well the first thing to say
 

00:49:52.839 --> 00:49:54.930
questions um well the first thing to say
is this thing is in its infancy and we

00:49:54.930 --> 00:49:54.940
is this thing is in its infancy and we
 

00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:56.280
is this thing is in its infancy and we
and the answer to most of those

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:56.290
and the answer to most of those
 

00:49:56.290 --> 00:50:03.480
and the answer to most of those
questions is I don't know but I think

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:03.490
questions is I don't know but I think
 

00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:07.770
questions is I don't know but I think
you know we are going to throw a bunch

00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:07.780
you know we are going to throw a bunch
 

00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:08.880
you know we are going to throw a bunch
of stuff against the wall and see what

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:08.890
of stuff against the wall and see what
 

00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:10.980
of stuff against the wall and see what
sticks I think that's that's actually

00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:10.990
sticks I think that's that's actually
 

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:12.720
sticks I think that's that's actually
and that is a very that camp way of

00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:12.730
and that is a very that camp way of
 

00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:15.960
and that is a very that camp way of
working so initially I think what we're

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:15.970
working so initially I think what we're
 

00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:17.970
working so initially I think what we're
going to do is because we've got a big

00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:17.980
going to do is because we've got a big
 

00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:22.319
going to do is because we've got a big
backlog of stuff you know produced from

00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:22.329
backlog of stuff you know produced from
 

00:50:22.329 --> 00:50:25.200
backlog of stuff you know produced from
these hundred camps I think what we're

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:25.210
these hundred camps I think what we're
 

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:27.690
these hundred camps I think what we're
going to do is we're going to really

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:27.700
going to do is we're going to really
 

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:29.700
going to do is we're going to really
just start organizing and putting out

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:29.710
just start organizing and putting out
 

00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:35.490
just start organizing and putting out
that stuff and by turns we're going to

00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:35.500
that stuff and by turns we're going to
 

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:38.280
that stuff and by turns we're going to
start opening up so that process I think

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:38.290
start opening up so that process I think
 

00:50:38.290 --> 00:50:39.900
start opening up so that process I think
is going to be pretty close to begin

00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:39.910
is going to be pretty close to begin
 

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:41.430
is going to be pretty close to begin
with because we want to actually you

00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440
with because we want to actually you
 

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.559
with because we want to actually you
know produce something and put it out

00:50:43.559 --> 00:50:43.569
know produce something and put it out
 

00:50:43.569 --> 00:50:46.200
know produce something and put it out
there and see what people how people use

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:46.210
there and see what people how people use
 

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:48.420
there and see what people how people use
it how people want to use it what which

00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:48.430
it how people want to use it what which
 

00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:51.539
it how people want to use it what which
people are using it and then and then to

00:50:51.539 --> 00:50:51.549
people are using it and then and then to
 

00:50:51.549 --> 00:50:54.809
people are using it and then and then to
iterate on it so are our philosophy with

00:50:54.809 --> 00:50:54.819
iterate on it so are our philosophy with
 

00:50:54.819 --> 00:50:56.910
iterate on it so are our philosophy with
the journal is that we're going to take

00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:56.920
the journal is that we're going to take
 

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:58.170
the journal is that we're going to take
a bunch of we're going to find a bunch

going to put it out there and we're
 

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:09.059
going to put it out there and we're
going to iterate and we're going to

00:51:09.059 --> 00:51:09.069
going to iterate and we're going to

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:19.850
between building on what you've already
 

00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:22.060
between building on what you've already
talked about and kind of not having the

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:22.070
talked about and kind of not having the
 

00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:23.980
talked about and kind of not having the
same conversations over and over again

00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:23.990
same conversations over and over again
 

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:27.190
same conversations over and over again
we'll also be able to bring in new

00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200
we'll also be able to bring in new
 

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:30.070
we'll also be able to bring in new
voices and I kind of wonder if you if

00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:30.080
voices and I kind of wonder if you if
 

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:32.440
voices and I kind of wonder if you if
you have any best practices for the ways

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:32.450
you have any best practices for the ways
 

00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:34.450
you have any best practices for the ways
that you try to do that or if it happens

00:52:34.450 --> 00:52:34.460
that you try to do that or if it happens
 

00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:36.640
that you try to do that or if it happens
organically or if you see that tension

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:36.650
organically or if you see that tension
 

00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:40.810
organically or if you see that tension
or not yeah I mean I I definitely see

00:52:40.810 --> 00:52:40.820
or not yeah I mean I I definitely see
 

00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:44.410
or not yeah I mean I I definitely see
that tension the same conversations

00:52:44.410 --> 00:52:44.420
that tension the same conversations
 

00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:46.470
that tension the same conversations
happen over and over and over that is

00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480
happen over and over and over that is
 

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:50.860
happen over and over and over that is
you know every that camp has two or

00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:50.870
you know every that camp has two or
 

00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:52.690
you know every that camp has two or
three conversations about tenure and

00:52:52.690 --> 00:52:52.700
three conversations about tenure and
 

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:55.900
three conversations about tenure and
promotion I mean you know inevitably so

00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:55.910
promotion I mean you know inevitably so
 

00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:59.740
promotion I mean you know inevitably so
yeah so they say they do have the same

00:52:59.740 --> 00:52:59.750
yeah so they say they do have the same
 

00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:00.940
yeah so they say they do have the same
conversations over and over and over

00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:00.950
conversations over and over and over
 

00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:02.680
conversations over and over and over
again I think the first thing to say

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:02.690
again I think the first thing to say
 

00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:05.020
again I think the first thing to say
about that is in one respect that's not

00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:05.030
about that is in one respect that's not
 

00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:07.660
about that is in one respect that's not
bad these are conversations that lots of

00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:07.670
bad these are conversations that lots of
 

00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:11.490
bad these are conversations that lots of
people want to have need to have and so

00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:11.500
people want to have need to have and so
 

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:15.640
people want to have need to have and so
you know let let them have them on the

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:15.650
you know let let them have them on the
 

00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:17.470
you know let let them have them on the
other hand I do see I you know I think

00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:17.480
other hand I do see I you know I think
 

00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:19.330
other hand I do see I you know I think
we want new stuff to come out of that

00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:19.340
we want new stuff to come out of that
 

00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:21.280
we want new stuff to come out of that
camp we don't want it to just be you

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:21.290
camp we don't want it to just be you
 

00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:23.800
camp we don't want it to just be you
know 2008 you know groundhog day over

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:23.810
know 2008 you know groundhog day over
 

00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:27.910
know 2008 you know groundhog day over
and over and over again and so there are

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:27.920
and over and over again and so there are
 

00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:30.370
and over and over again and so there are
a couple of things that that we've done

00:53:30.370 --> 00:53:30.380
a couple of things that that we've done
 

00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:35.530
a couple of things that that we've done
I think to to try to encourage that and

00:53:35.530 --> 00:53:35.540
I think to to try to encourage that and
 

00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:39.070
I think to to try to encourage that and
I think the big thing is the realization

00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:39.080
I think the big thing is the realization
 

00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:42.310
I think the big thing is the realization
that we should encourage to kind of

00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:42.320
that we should encourage to kind of
 

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:44.350
that we should encourage to kind of
specialized kinds of that camps the

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:44.360
specialized kinds of that camps the
 

00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:46.750
specialized kinds of that camps the
first one being these disciplinary that

00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:46.760
first one being these disciplinary that
 

00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:50.860
first one being these disciplinary that
camps that are often tied to a big

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:50.870
camps that are often tied to a big

you know they talk about history and

00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:55.000
you know they talk about history and
 

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.430
you know they talk about history and
things that are of concern to digital

00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440
things that are of concern to digital
 

00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:59.290
things that are of concern to digital
historians but not necessarily to you

00:53:59.290 --> 00:53:59.300

camp 18th century studies you know that

00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:05.720
camp 18th century studies you know that
 

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:07.540
camp 18th century studies you know that
was another you know so there are these

00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:07.550
was another you know so there are these
 

00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:09.190

kind of very kind of specialized back

00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200
kind of very kind of specialized back
 

00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.110
kind of very kind of specialized back
camps which deal with issues of concern

00:54:11.110 --> 00:54:11.120
camps which deal with issues of concern
 

00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:13.570

community of d h the second thing we've

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:17.510
community of d h the second thing we've
 

00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:20.080
community of d h the second thing we've
done is so

00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:20.090
done is so
 

00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:21.520
done is so
there's there's these disciplinary ones

00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:21.530
there's there's these disciplinary ones
 

00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:24.220
there's there's these disciplinary ones
and then there's somatic back camps and

00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:24.230
and then there's somatic back camps and
 

00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:25.750
and then there's somatic back camps and
when we first started this I was really

00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:25.760
when we first started this I was really
 

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:28.660
when we first started this I was really
against this idea I was like no like it

00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:28.670
against this idea I was like no like it
 

00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:30.400
against this idea I was like no like it
should just be that camp you know it

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:30.410
should just be that camp you know it
 

00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:33.130
should just be that camp you know it
should just be it should be anybody

00:54:33.130 --> 00:54:33.140
should just be it should be anybody
 

00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:33.910
should just be it should be anybody
should be able to talk about anything

00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920
should be able to talk about anything
 

00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.680
should be able to talk about anything
there shouldn't be any constraints on

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:35.690
there shouldn't be any constraints on
 

00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:38.230
there shouldn't be any constraints on
the on the program and and then I

00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:38.240
the on the program and and then I
 

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:42.670
the on the program and and then I
realized or I was I was schooled that

00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:42.680
realized or I was I was schooled that
 

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:44.890
realized or I was I was schooled that
there still aren't really constraints on

00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:44.900
there still aren't really constraints on
 

00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:47.020
there still aren't really constraints on
the program you know just because it's

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:47.030
the program you know just because it's
 

00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:48.640
the program you know just because it's

labeled that camp 18th century studies
 

00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:51.430
labeled that camp 18th century studies
like the culture of the thing is such

00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:51.440
like the culture of the thing is such
 

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:52.780
like the culture of the thing is such
that if somebody starts talking about

00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:52.790
that if somebody starts talking about
 

00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:55.630
that if somebody starts talking about
you know the 16th century you know no

00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:55.640
you know the 16th century you know no
 

00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:57.850
you know the 16th century you know no
one's going to get really offended and

00:54:57.850 --> 00:54:57.860
one's going to get really offended and
 

00:54:57.860 --> 00:54:59.980
one's going to get really offended and
and people go and people from outside

00:54:59.980 --> 00:54:59.990
and people go and people from outside
 

00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:02.680

those disciplines go so so so the other

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:02.690
those disciplines go so so so the other
 

00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:04.630
those disciplines go so so so the other
thing so so I was against this but but

00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640
thing so so I was against this but but
 

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:06.220
thing so so I was against this but but
we've we've also started these so the

00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:06.230
we've we've also started these so the
 

00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:07.750
we've we've also started these so the
Disciplinary ones and then then also the

00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760
Disciplinary ones and then then also the
 

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:09.610
Disciplinary ones and then then also the
thematic ones where you know there's a

00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:09.620
thematic ones where you know there's a
 

00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:11.830
thematic ones where you know there's a
that camp theory which doesn't make

00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:11.840
that camp theory which doesn't make
 

00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:13.060
that camp theory which doesn't make
sense to me because that camps a

00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:13.070
sense to me because that camps a
 

00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:14.740
sense to me because that camps a
pragmatic thing but there's going to be

00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:14.750
pragmatic thing but there's going to be
 

00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:16.840
pragmatic thing but there's going to be
at Camp theory which is great like and

00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:16.850
at Camp theory which is great like and
 

00:55:16.850 --> 00:55:18.700
at Camp theory which is great like and
that's the beauty of that camp people

00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:18.710
that's the beauty of that camp people
 

00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:20.350
that's the beauty of that camp people
can if they want to have a strong focus

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:20.360
can if they want to have a strong focus
 

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:22.900
can if they want to have a strong focus
on theory or that can't pedagogy that

00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:22.910
on theory or that can't pedagogy that
 

00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:26.380
on theory or that can't pedagogy that
camp games there have been so if people

00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:26.390
camp games there have been so if people
 

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:28.660
camp games there have been so if people
really want to talk about games there's

00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:28.670
really want to talk about games there's
 

00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:32.080
really want to talk about games there's
that camp feminism's you know so if you

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:32.090
that camp feminism's you know so if you
 

00:55:32.090 --> 00:55:33.820
that camp feminism's you know so if you
know people want to talk about issues of

00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:33.830
know people want to talk about issues of
 

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:36.100
know people want to talk about issues of
gender in particular well great you know

00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:36.110
gender in particular well great you know
 

00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:38.800
gender in particular well great you know
they can do that just so long as it's

00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:38.810
they can do that just so long as it's
 

00:55:38.810 --> 00:55:41.350
they can do that just so long as it's
open to everybody and nobody's excluded

00:55:41.350 --> 00:55:41.360
open to everybody and nobody's excluded
 

00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:43.680
open to everybody and nobody's excluded
and you know people aren't going to be

00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:43.690
and you know people aren't going to be
 

00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:48.520
and you know people aren't going to be
aren't going to be made to feel excluded

00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:48.530
aren't going to be made to feel excluded
 

00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:50.740
aren't going to be made to feel excluded
because of the Disciplinary focus or the

00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:50.750
because of the Disciplinary focus or the
 

00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:52.570
because of the Disciplinary focus or the
thematic focus then then that's that's

00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:52.580
thematic focus then then that's that's
 

00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:54.490
thematic focus then then that's that's
great and that's worked and so that has

00:55:54.490 --> 00:55:54.500
great and that's worked and so that has
 

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:57.060
great and that's worked and so that has
I think helped to kind of focus people's

00:55:57.060 --> 00:55:57.070
I think helped to kind of focus people's
 

00:55:57.070 --> 00:56:00.100
I think helped to kind of focus people's
minds on and do to do new things that

00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:00.110
minds on and do to do new things that
 

00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:01.810
minds on and do to do new things that
aren't just the same old d.h

00:56:01.810 --> 00:56:01.820

adjunct faculty does that come up at all

00:56:59.960 --> 00:56:59.970
adjunct faculty does that come up at all
 

00:56:59.970 --> 00:57:02.210
adjunct faculty does that come up at all
at the bat camps or do you think it's

00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:02.220
at the bat camps or do you think it's
 

00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:03.650
at the bat camps or do you think it's
you know do you think there will be an

00:57:03.650 --> 00:57:03.660
you know do you think there will be an
 

00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:06.500
you know do you think there will be an
impact yeah I mean it's talked about a

00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:06.510
impact yeah I mean it's talked about a
 

00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:08.089
impact yeah I mean it's talked about a
lot so first of all the first thing to

00:57:08.089 --> 00:57:08.099
lot so first of all the first thing to
 

00:57:08.099 --> 00:57:14.470
lot so first of all the first thing to
say is it skews young that's for sure it

00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480
say is it skews young that's for sure it
 

00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:18.410
say is it skews young that's for sure it
skews a little male and excuse a little

00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:18.420
skews a little male and excuse a little
 

00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:25.039
skews a little male and excuse a little
wider it skews less male and less white

00:57:25.039 --> 00:57:25.049
wider it skews less male and less white
 

00:57:25.049 --> 00:57:28.039
wider it skews less male and less white
probably and a lot of scholarly meetings

00:57:28.039 --> 00:57:28.049
probably and a lot of scholarly meetings
 

00:57:28.049 --> 00:57:31.279
probably and a lot of scholarly meetings
but but yeah it still does and and you

00:57:31.279 --> 00:57:31.289
but but yeah it still does and and you
 

00:57:31.289 --> 00:57:33.620
but but yeah it still does and and you
know but again like what's nice about it

00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:33.630
know but again like what's nice about it
 

00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:35.809
know but again like what's nice about it
is we don't have to solve that problem

00:57:35.809 --> 00:57:35.819
is we don't have to solve that problem
 

00:57:35.819 --> 00:57:40.430
is we don't have to solve that problem
centrally necessarily we you know there

00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:40.440
centrally necessarily we you know there
 

00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:42.499
centrally necessarily we you know there
are you know there's a working group on

00:57:42.499 --> 00:57:42.509
are you know there's a working group on
 

00:57:42.509 --> 00:57:44.240
are you know there's a working group on
diversity in that camp like peep they

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:44.250
diversity in that camp like peep they
 

00:57:44.250 --> 00:57:45.859
diversity in that camp like peep they
just started this group and they're

00:57:45.859 --> 00:57:45.869
just started this group and they're
 

00:57:45.869 --> 00:57:47.269
just started this group and they're
doing it and they're trying to figure

00:57:47.269 --> 00:57:47.279
doing it and they're trying to figure
 

00:57:47.279 --> 00:57:49.009
doing it and they're trying to figure
out ways to encourage more diversity in

00:57:49.009 --> 00:57:49.019
out ways to encourage more diversity in
 

00:57:49.019 --> 00:57:52.660
out ways to encourage more diversity in
that camp you know there's a back camp

00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:52.670
that camp you know there's a back camp
 

00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:54.349

historically black colleges and

00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359
historically black colleges and
 

00:57:54.359 --> 00:57:56.329
historically black colleges and
universities so to try to solve that

00:57:56.329 --> 00:57:56.339
universities so to try to solve that
 

00:57:56.339 --> 00:57:58.910
universities so to try to solve that
that some of that that problem um so so

00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920
that some of that that problem um so so
 

00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:00.380
that some of that that problem um so so
the diversity thing you know it's it's a

00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:00.390
the diversity thing you know it's it's a
 

00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:03.319
the diversity thing you know it's it's a
real it's a real real question in terms

00:58:03.319 --> 00:58:03.329
real it's a real real question in terms
 

00:58:03.329 --> 00:58:05.769
real it's a real real question in terms
of you know diversity in terms of

00:58:05.769 --> 00:58:05.779
of you know diversity in terms of
 

00:58:05.779 --> 00:58:10.940
of you know diversity in terms of
position and hierarchy and it's a pretty

00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:10.950
position and hierarchy and it's a pretty
 

00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:14.509
position and hierarchy and it's a pretty
good mix actually um you know it skews

00:58:14.509 --> 00:58:14.519
good mix actually um you know it skews
 

00:58:14.519 --> 00:58:15.980
good mix actually um you know it skews
young I mean I don't you know there

00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:15.990
young I mean I don't you know there
 

00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:18.470
young I mean I don't you know there
aren't a lot of you know octogenarian

00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480
aren't a lot of you know octogenarian
 

00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:22.609
aren't a lot of you know octogenarian
faculty there but there are plenty of

00:58:22.609 --> 00:58:22.619
faculty there but there are plenty of
 

00:58:22.619 --> 00:58:25.370
faculty there but there are plenty of
full professors you know in their late

00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:25.380
full professors you know in their late
 

00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:29.230
full professors you know in their late
40s type just made full kinds of people

00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:29.240
40s type just made full kinds of people
 

00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:33.289
40s type just made full kinds of people
and then there are plenty of adjuncts as

00:58:33.289 --> 00:58:33.299
and then there are plenty of adjuncts as
 

00:58:33.299 --> 00:58:38.329
and then there are plenty of adjuncts as
well and and more and more adjuncts than

00:58:38.329 --> 00:58:38.339
well and and more and more adjuncts than
 

00:58:38.339 --> 00:58:41.329
well and and more and more adjuncts than
you get it at maybe a on aaj meeting

00:58:41.329 --> 00:58:41.339
you get it at maybe a on aaj meeting
 

00:58:41.339 --> 00:58:43.310
you get it at maybe a on aaj meeting
where you know their large registration

00:58:43.310 --> 00:58:43.320
where you know their large registration
 

00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:46.310
where you know their large registration
and you know there's you don't really

00:58:46.310 --> 00:58:46.320
and you know there's you don't really
 

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:48.380
and you know there's you don't really
need department support to go to a that

00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:48.390
need department support to go to a that
 

00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:49.850
need department support to go to a that
camp so there's probably more kind of

00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:49.860
camp so there's probably more kind of
 

00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:53.170
camp so there's probably more kind of
adjunct faculty there's also way more

00:58:53.170 --> 00:58:53.180
adjunct faculty there's also way more
 

00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:57.110
adjunct faculty there's also way more
librarians museum professionals kind of

00:58:57.110 --> 00:58:57.120

through that camp I'm I think we're more

00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:38.670
through that camp I'm I think we're more
 

00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:42.610
through that camp I'm I think we're more
concerned with just saying like you know

help thinking looking at the history as

01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:52.079
help thinking looking at the history as
 

01:00:52.079 --> 01:00:54.140
help thinking looking at the history as
a historian looking at this phenomenon

01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:54.150
a historian looking at this phenomenon
 

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:57.049

01:00:57.049 --> 01:00:57.059
that you're participating in looking
 

01:00:57.059 --> 01:00:59.390
that you're participating in looking
back as I listen and look at what that

01:00:59.390 --> 01:00:59.400
back as I listen and look at what that
 

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.010
back as I listen and look at what that
camp is doing it makes me think very

01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:01.020
camp is doing it makes me think very
 

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:02.270
camp is doing it makes me think very
much of something that flourished

01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:02.280
much of something that flourished

Seth summer seminars I don't know if if
 

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:09.890
Seth summer seminars I don't know if if
you were thinking about that camp that

01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:09.900
you were thinking about that camp that
 

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:11.510
you were thinking about that camp that
is informed at all what you're doing if

01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:11.520
is informed at all what you're doing if
 

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:12.349
is informed at all what you're doing if
you're very familiar with that

01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359
you're very familiar with that
 

01:01:12.359 --> 01:01:14.539
you're very familiar with that
phenomenon but what Susan hockey and her

of years it was a little bit more formal

01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:19.020
of years it was a little bit more formal
 

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:21.020
of years it was a little bit more formal
in some ways than that camp but still a

01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:21.030
in some ways than that camp but still a
 

01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:23.270
in some ways than that camp but still a
pretty loose community building and of

01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280
pretty loose community building and of
 

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.370
pretty loose community building and of
course it didn't go viral so on one hand

01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:25.380
course it didn't go viral so on one hand
 

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:27.109

there's that historical precedent and

01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119
there's that historical precedent and
 

01:01:27.119 --> 01:01:28.069
there's that historical precedent and
I'm curious to know what you think about

01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079
I'm curious to know what you think about
 

01:01:28.079 --> 01:01:30.079
I'm curious to know what you think about
that and if I can stick in one other

01:01:30.079 --> 01:01:30.089
that and if I can stick in one other
 

01:01:30.089 --> 01:01:31.819
that and if I can stick in one other
piece for the the current thing I'm

01:01:31.819 --> 01:01:31.829
piece for the the current thing I'm
 

01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:33.650
piece for the the current thing I'm
wondering if you've looked at analogous

01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:33.660
wondering if you've looked at analogous
 

01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:35.900
wondering if you've looked at analogous
phenomena yet in a way you talk about

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:35.910
phenomena yet in a way you talk about
 

01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:37.730
phenomena yet in a way you talk about
this being an expression of the sort of

01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:37.740
this being an expression of the sort of
 

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:40.160
this being an expression of the sort of
culture of the web I can't help thinking

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:40.170
culture of the web I can't help thinking
 

01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:42.020
culture of the web I can't help thinking
one of my staff members is very active

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:42.030
one of my staff members is very active
 

01:01:42.030 --> 01:01:44.510
one of my staff members is very active
in Occupy Wall Street Dennis I hear him

01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520
in Occupy Wall Street Dennis I hear him
 

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:47.089
in Occupy Wall Street Dennis I hear him
talk about the kinds of organizational

01:01:47.089 --> 01:01:47.099
talk about the kinds of organizational
 

01:01:47.099 --> 01:01:49.819
talk about the kinds of organizational
principles and methods that they pursue

01:01:49.819 --> 01:01:49.829
principles and methods that they pursue
 

01:01:49.829 --> 01:01:51.829
principles and methods that they pursue
and as they begin to undertake some

01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839
and as they begin to undertake some
 

01:01:51.839 --> 01:01:54.200
and as they begin to undertake some
pedagogical activities whether you see

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:54.210
pedagogical activities whether you see
 

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:55.910
pedagogical activities whether you see
some parallels whether you see this very

01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920
some parallels whether you see this very
 

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:59.450
some parallels whether you see this very
much as a as a kind of analogous sort of

01:01:59.450 --> 01:01:59.460
much as a as a kind of analogous sort of
 

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:00.440
much as a as a kind of analogous sort of
phenomenon in terms of the

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:00.450
phenomenon in terms of the
 

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:02.420
phenomenon in terms of the
organizational principles that it's

01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:02.430
organizational principles that it's
 

01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:03.829
organizational principles that it's
turning to on the basis of people's

01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839
turning to on the basis of people's
 

01:02:03.839 --> 01:02:08.230
turning to on the basis of people's
participation in the web yeah so so

01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240
participation in the web yeah so so
 

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.220
participation in the web yeah so so
there's sort of three things there I

01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:10.230
there's sort of three things there I
 

01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:12.319
there's sort of three things there I
guess that I mean the first one the

01:02:12.319 --> 01:02:12.329
guess that I mean the first one the
 

01:02:12.329 --> 01:02:14.120
guess that I mean the first one the
first thing to say is that you know

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:14.130
first thing to say is that you know
 

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:17.059
first thing to say is that you know
we're in the I guess fortunate position

01:02:17.059 --> 01:02:17.069
we're in the I guess fortunate position
 

01:02:17.069 --> 01:02:21.470
we're in the I guess fortunate position
digital humanities there's an argument

01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480
digital humanities there's an argument
 

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.190
digital humanities there's an argument
over whether to discipline or not

01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:23.200
over whether to discipline or not
 

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:25.740
over whether to discipline or not
whatever but we're in the fortunate

01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:25.750
whatever but we're in the fortunate
 

01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:27.660
whatever but we're in the fortunate
position that we're new and that we're

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:27.670
position that we're new and that we're
 

01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:30.540
position that we're new and that we're
trying to establish our kind of

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:30.550
trying to establish our kind of
 

01:02:30.550 --> 01:02:33.870
trying to establish our kind of
disciplinary structures now in the

01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:33.880
disciplinary structures now in the
 

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.420
disciplinary structures now in the
change information environment you know

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:36.430
change information environment you know
 

01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:38.550
change information environment you know
when these you know when aaha was

01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:38.560
when these you know when aaha was
 

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:42.150
when these you know when aaha was
founded when when MLA was founded they

01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160
founded when when MLA was founded they
 

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.740
founded when when MLA was founded they
were these organizations were founded

01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:43.750
were these organizations were founded
 

01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:45.150
were these organizations were founded
and their structures were developed in

01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:45.160
and their structures were developed in
 

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:48.240
and their structures were developed in
response to and and and and in you know

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:48.250
response to and and and and in you know
 

01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:50.579
response to and and and and in you know
in the information environment they were

01:02:50.579 --> 01:02:50.589
in the information environment they were
 

01:02:50.589 --> 01:02:52.290
in the information environment they were
the scholarly communication environment

01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:52.300
the scholarly communication environment
 

01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:54.900
the scholarly communication environment
and the needs and opportunities that

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:54.910
and the needs and opportunities that
 

01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:56.099
and the needs and opportunities that
they were faced with we're doing the

01:02:56.099 --> 01:02:56.109
they were faced with we're doing the
 

01:02:56.109 --> 01:02:58.440
they were faced with we're doing the
same thing it's just that you know those

01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:58.450
same thing it's just that you know those
 

01:02:58.450 --> 01:03:00.450
same thing it's just that you know those
needs and opportunities have changed and

01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:00.460
needs and opportunities have changed and
 

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:03.300
needs and opportunities have changed and
and it's just easier for us to react to

01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:03.310
and it's just easier for us to react to
 

01:03:03.310 --> 01:03:05.609
and it's just easier for us to react to
that change so this is a you know I mean

01:03:05.609 --> 01:03:05.619
that change so this is a you know I mean
 

01:03:05.619 --> 01:03:07.680
that change so this is a you know I mean
this is a part this is another chapter

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:07.690
this is a part this is another chapter
 

01:03:07.690 --> 01:03:09.810
this is a part this is another chapter
in a story of discipline building and

01:03:09.810 --> 01:03:09.820
in a story of discipline building and
 

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:12.030
in a story of discipline building and
and and so there's a lot of precedent

01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:12.040
and and so there's a lot of precedent
 

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.920
and and so there's a lot of precedent
from the 19th century and from the early

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:13.930
from the 19th century and from the early
 

01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:17.579
from the 19th century and from the early
20th century in terms of other kinds of

01:03:17.579 --> 01:03:17.589
20th century in terms of other kinds of
 

01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:22.319
20th century in terms of other kinds of
precedent within the Academy we weren't

01:03:22.319 --> 01:03:22.329
precedent within the Academy we weren't
 

01:03:22.329 --> 01:03:24.420
precedent within the Academy we weren't
we weren't looking at those consciously

01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:24.430
we weren't looking at those consciously
 

01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:28.319
we weren't looking at those consciously
when we thought of this but I do think

01:03:28.319 --> 01:03:28.329
when we thought of this but I do think
 

01:03:28.329 --> 01:03:29.640
when we thought of this but I do think
there is a lot of precedent another

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:29.650
there is a lot of precedent another
 

01:03:29.650 --> 01:03:31.050
there is a lot of precedent another
thing I'd point to is like the Berks

01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:31.060
thing I'd point to is like the Berks
 

01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:34.980
thing I'd point to is like the Berks
conference you know which is is you know

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:34.990
conference you know which is is you know
 

01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:37.559
conference you know which is is you know
kind of you know or is kind of an

01:03:37.559 --> 01:03:37.569
kind of you know or is kind of an
 

01:03:37.569 --> 01:03:39.240
kind of you know or is kind of an
organic thing that grew up and has

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:39.250
organic thing that grew up and has
 

01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:42.000
organic thing that grew up and has
become an important structure in a

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:42.010
become an important structure in a
 

01:03:42.010 --> 01:03:44.190
become an important structure in a
sub-discipline but which wasn't

01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:44.200
sub-discipline but which wasn't
 

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:47.190
sub-discipline but which wasn't
necessarily kind of intended that way I

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:47.200
necessarily kind of intended that way I
 

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.680
necessarily kind of intended that way I
know what the Berks um it's a women's

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:49.690
know what the Berks um it's a women's
 

01:03:49.690 --> 01:03:53.250
know what the Berks um it's a women's
history conference and it is it you know

01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:53.260
history conference and it is it you know
 

01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:55.530
history conference and it is it you know
in some ways was was started in response

01:03:55.530 --> 01:03:55.540
in some ways was was started in response
 

01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:58.170
in some ways was was started in response
to you know the gendered interactions

01:03:58.170 --> 01:03:58.180
to you know the gendered interactions
 

01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:00.150
to you know the gendered interactions
that happened at the other big history

01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:00.160
that happened at the other big history
 

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:01.800
that happened at the other big history
conferences and it's become a thing unto

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:01.810
conferences and it's become a thing unto
 

01:04:01.810 --> 01:04:03.930
conferences and it's become a thing unto
itself in many ways it's like that camp

01:04:03.930 --> 01:04:03.940
itself in many ways it's like that camp
 

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.390
itself in many ways it's like that camp
it's a it's a movement dan Cowan likes

01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400
it's a it's a movement dan Cowan likes
 

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.859
it's a it's a movement dan Cowan likes
to call that camp a movement like the

01:04:07.859 --> 01:04:07.869
to call that camp a movement like the
 

01:04:07.869 --> 01:04:12.359
to call that camp a movement like the
Olympics you know and and so it is it is

Olympics you know and and so it is it is
 

01:04:12.369 --> 01:04:14.190
Olympics you know and and so it is it is
in a tradition of those kinds of

01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:14.200
in a tradition of those kinds of
 

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.910
in a tradition of those kinds of
movements so it's kind of kind of

01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:16.920
movements so it's kind of kind of
 

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.260
movements so it's kind of kind of
disciplinary analogies movement

01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:19.270
disciplinary analogies movement
 

01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:23.550
disciplinary analogies movement
analogies the third thing I would say

01:04:23.550 --> 01:04:23.560
analogies the third thing I would say
 

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:28.230
analogies the third thing I would say
though is yes Occupy Wall Street is a

01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:28.240
though is yes Occupy Wall Street is a
 

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.540
though is yes Occupy Wall Street is a
kind of similar phenomena I mean the

01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:30.550
kind of similar phenomena I mean the
 

01:04:30.550 --> 01:04:33.059
kind of similar phenomena I mean the
values of it I think are you know

01:04:33.059 --> 01:04:33.069
values of it I think are you know
 

01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:35.340
values of it I think are you know
there's there's some analogies there

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:35.350
there's there's some analogies there
 

01:04:35.350 --> 01:04:37.170
there's there's some analogies there
but it's also the way it's organized i

01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:37.180
but it's also the way it's organized i
 

01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:38.400
but it's also the way it's organized i
mean it's it's an internet phenomenon

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:38.410
mean it's it's an internet phenomenon
 

01:04:38.410 --> 01:04:40.500
mean it's it's an internet phenomenon
you know is organized again kind of

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:40.510
you know is organized again kind of
 

01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:43.710
you know is organized again kind of
around a hashtag you know the Occupy

01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:43.720
around a hashtag you know the Occupy
 

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:51.030
around a hashtag you know the Occupy
hashtag it it's very distributed you

01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:51.040
hashtag it it's very distributed you
 

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:54.630
hashtag it it's very distributed you
know the Occupy the governance is this

01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:54.640
know the Occupy the governance is this
 

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:57.570
know the Occupy the governance is this
kind of loose consensus governance so

01:04:57.570 --> 01:04:57.580
kind of loose consensus governance so
 

01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:59.130
kind of loose consensus governance so
yes there are a lot of analogies there I

01:04:59.130 --> 01:04:59.140
yes there are a lot of analogies there I
 

01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:02.400
yes there are a lot of analogies there I
think the analogy we were most conscious

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:02.410
think the analogy we were most conscious
 

01:05:02.410 --> 01:05:05.100
think the analogy we were most conscious
of was to open source software

01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:05.110
of was to open source software
 

01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:07.020
of was to open source software
communities which are organizing very

01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:07.030
communities which are organizing very
 

01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:08.880
communities which are organizing very
much the same way communicate via the

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:08.890
much the same way communicate via the
 

01:05:08.890 --> 01:05:10.860
much the same way communicate via the
Internet very you know kind of rough

01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:10.870
Internet very you know kind of rough
 

01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:13.310
Internet very you know kind of rough
consensus is there model for governance

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:13.320
consensus is there model for governance
 

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:16.590
consensus is there model for governance
so we were very much aware of those

01:05:16.590 --> 01:05:16.600
so we were very much aware of those
 

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.870
so we were very much aware of those
those communities as open source

01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880
those communities as open source
 

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.880
those communities as open source
software developers ourselves and the

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:20.890
software developers ourselves and the
 

01:05:20.890 --> 01:05:23.010
software developers ourselves and the
two guys who who really spearheaded this

01:05:23.010 --> 01:05:23.020
two guys who who really spearheaded this
 

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:26.700
two guys who who really spearheaded this
in 2008 Dave Lester and Jeremy Boggs who

01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:26.710
in 2008 Dave Lester and Jeremy Boggs who
 

01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:29.430
in 2008 Dave Lester and Jeremy Boggs who
grad students and and and developers at

01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440
grad students and and and developers at
 

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:31.740
grad students and and and developers at
CH and I'm at the time those guys you

01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:31.750
CH and I'm at the time those guys you
 

01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:33.300
CH and I'm at the time those guys you
know our members of open source

01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:33.310
know our members of open source
 

01:05:33.310 --> 01:05:34.980
know our members of open source
developer communities and and so that

01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:34.990
developer communities and and so that
 

01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:37.380
developer communities and and so that
was very much in our in our minds when

01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:37.390
was very much in our in our minds when
 

01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:39.300
was very much in our in our minds when
we started so I do think there's there

01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:39.310
we started so I do think there's there
 

01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:41.010
we started so I do think there's there
are a bunch of things that grow out of

01:05:41.010 --> 01:05:41.020
are a bunch of things that grow out of
 

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:44.730
are a bunch of things that grow out of
internet culture like this I actually

01:05:44.730 --> 01:05:44.740
internet culture like this I actually
 

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:46.500
internet culture like this I actually
have a question the one that camp that

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:46.510
have a question the one that camp that
 

01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:48.120
have a question the one that camp that
I've been involved with was was that

01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:48.130
I've been involved with was was that
 

01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:50.790
I've been involved with was was that
camp publishing and so not a scholarly

01:05:50.790 --> 01:05:50.800
camp publishing and so not a scholarly
 

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:53.640
camp publishing and so not a scholarly
society model as much as a sort of

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:53.650
society model as much as a sort of
 

01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:55.770
society model as much as a sort of
professional sort of society so there

01:05:55.770 --> 01:05:55.780
professional sort of society so there
 

01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:57.420
professional sort of society so there
were people from university presses

01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:57.430
were people from university presses
 

01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:58.710
were people from university presses
there were people from library

01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720
there were people from library
 

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.630
there were people from library
publishing operations that are all very

01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640
publishing operations that are all very
 

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.520
publishing operations that are all very
new and we were more or less trying to

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:02.530
new and we were more or less trying to
 

01:06:02.530 --> 01:06:04.290
new and we were more or less trying to
figure out how to use technology how to

01:06:04.290 --> 01:06:04.300
figure out how to use technology how to
 

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:06.360
figure out how to use technology how to
learn what we needed to know to do to do

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:06.370
learn what we needed to know to do to do
 

01:06:06.370 --> 01:06:08.820
learn what we needed to know to do to do
our jobs so it wasn't really about a

01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:08.830
our jobs so it wasn't really about a
 

01:06:08.830 --> 01:06:11.190
our jobs so it wasn't really about a
discipline as much as a sort of job

01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200
discipline as much as a sort of job
 

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.230
discipline as much as a sort of job
structure kind of you know how do we

01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:13.240
structure kind of you know how do we
 

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:14.910
structure kind of you know how do we
actually do this and one of the

01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:14.920
actually do this and one of the
 

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:16.530
actually do this and one of the
challenges we face especially as we're

01:06:16.530 --> 01:06:16.540
challenges we face especially as we're
 

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:18.990
challenges we face especially as we're
sort of trying to extend this out into

01:06:18.990 --> 01:06:19.000
sort of trying to extend this out into
 

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.850
sort of trying to extend this out into
the University Press community is that

01:06:20.850 --> 01:06:20.860
the University Press community is that
 

01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:24.060
the University Press community is that
because of that camp is web native it

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:24.070
because of that camp is web native it
 

01:06:24.070 --> 01:06:26.130
because of that camp is web native it
can be hard to bring in people who are

01:06:26.130 --> 01:06:26.140
can be hard to bring in people who are
 

01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:29.340
can be hard to bring in people who are
not web native and so those people in

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:29.350
not web native and so those people in
 

01:06:29.350 --> 01:06:31.080
not web native and so those people in
the University Press community who don't

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:31.090
the University Press community who don't
 

01:06:31.090 --> 01:06:33.810
the University Press community who don't
tweet aren't in the gang and it's very

01:06:33.810 --> 01:06:33.820
tweet aren't in the gang and it's very
 

01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:36.060
tweet aren't in the gang and it's very
hard to explain to them what's going on

01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:36.070
hard to explain to them what's going on
 

01:06:36.070 --> 01:06:37.950
hard to explain to them what's going on
to say oh you're just going to post your

01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:37.960
to say oh you're just going to post your
 

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.510
to say oh you're just going to post your
idea on a blog and we're all going to

01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520
idea on a blog and we're all going to
 

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.100
idea on a blog and we're all going to
deal with it when we get there what this

01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:41.110
deal with it when we get there what this
 

01:06:41.110 --> 01:06:43.410
deal with it when we get there what this
what the schedule is I mean that it's

01:06:43.410 --> 01:06:43.420
what the schedule is I mean that it's
 

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:46.080
what the schedule is I mean that it's
really hard to to kind of move even

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:46.090
really hard to to kind of move even
 

01:06:46.090 --> 01:06:48.410
really hard to to kind of move even
though there's a huge need for this

01:06:48.410 --> 01:06:48.420
though there's a huge need for this
 

01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:53.360
though there's a huge need for this
of loose learning about the technology

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:53.370
of loose learning about the technology
 

01:06:53.370 --> 01:06:55.190
of loose learning about the technology
that you need at the time that you need

01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200
that you need at the time that you need
 

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:57.950
that you need at the time that you need
it that's really valuable organizing the

01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960
it that's really valuable organizing the
 

01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:59.990
it that's really valuable organizing the
event is challenging when you're not

01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000
event is challenging when you're not
 

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.870
event is challenging when you're not
dealing with net natives yeah so how do

01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880
dealing with net natives yeah so how do
 

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:05.120
dealing with net natives yeah so how do
you how do you address that or can you

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:05.130
you how do you address that or can you
 

01:07:05.130 --> 01:07:09.260
you how do you address that or can you
um yeah it is it is difficult it is it

01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:09.270
um yeah it is it is difficult it is it
 

01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:13.280
um yeah it is it is difficult it is it
can I think feel like and we've got you

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:13.290
can I think feel like and we've got you
 

01:07:13.290 --> 01:07:15.050
can I think feel like and we've got you
know we do surveys after that camps a

01:07:15.050 --> 01:07:15.060
know we do surveys after that camps a
 

01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:19.880
know we do surveys after that camps a
lot or the counselors do and a pretty

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:19.890
lot or the counselors do and a pretty
 

01:07:19.890 --> 01:07:23.000
lot or the counselors do and a pretty
common comment you know it's not

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:23.010
common comment you know it's not
 

01:07:23.010 --> 01:07:24.410
common comment you know it's not
certainly not the majority but there's

01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:24.420
certainly not the majority but there's
 

01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:26.360
certainly not the majority but there's
always a couple people who sort of say

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:26.370
always a couple people who sort of say
 

01:07:26.370 --> 01:07:29.180

and I got to be honest we haven't come
 

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.790
and I got to be honest we haven't come
up with good ways to deal with that I

01:07:37.790 --> 01:07:37.800
up with good ways to deal with that I
 

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:39.950
