&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
I'm John Haskell

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.500
and I'm the director
of the Kluge Center.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.490
And I know that there's a
lot of people I haven't seen

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.290
at our events before,
so I'll let you know.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.600
And maybe a good refresher
for those of you who have come

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.950
to our events, what our
mission is at the Kluge Center,

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.810
which is located
through that wall here

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.260
in the Jefferson Building.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.850
The mission as established in
the charter that was in 2000 is

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.060
to reinvigorate the
interconnection

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.360
between thought and action.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.830
That's how the charter puts it.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.710
So it's the bridge between
scholarship on the one hand

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.460
and the policymakers like the
people in Congress and elsewhere

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.230
in Washington and the
interested public on the other.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.700
So to that end, we at the
Kluge Center bring some

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.170
of the world's great scholars
to the library to make use

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.720
of the collections and
engage in conversations

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.880
that address the
challenges facing democracies

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.180
in this century.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.690
In this event, the Kluge Center
in conjunction with the Center

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.130
for Women in Politics and
the Center for Congressional

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.430
and Presidential Studies

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.620
at American University are
bringing together practitioners

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.010
and scholars in an effort to
shed some analytical rigor

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.510
and insight on the
upcoming midterm elections.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.680
As you probably know, the entire
House as well as about one-third

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.310
of the Senate is up this year,

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.580
which means that power
is in the balance.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.900
The balance of power will be
determined by the election.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.850
So of course it's
extremely important.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.810
So we're going to go through
some topics here with respect

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.880
to the elections for the
next 40 minutes or so.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.140
And then we'll leave
time before the reception

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.440
which you're all welcome

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.370
to for some questions
from the audience.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.790
Let me start by introducing
our panel.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.820
Sara Fagen is immediately
here to my left,

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.790
is one of the nation's leading
political and issue strategists

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.660
at DDC Public Affairs where
she became a partner in 2011.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.240
She was a senior aide and
White House political director

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.620
to President George W. Bush.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.380
The word wunderkind, which
some of you may know --

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.370
I'm not pronouncing the
German right, I know --

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.970
was created for people
like Sara.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.960
This is not on her webpage.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.100
I can attest to this personally
because I've known Sara

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.690
for longer than either of us
probably want to talk about.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.650
She gained a high-level
position in the White House

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.430
in the presidential campaign
before she was 25 years old.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.490
And in the White House she was
deputy political director well

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.790
before she was 30.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.760
We're not going to get too
specific other than that,

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.060
because that would be rude.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.510
The Wall Street Journal
describes her as one

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.920
of the people who perfected
political microtargeting.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.000
You can see her commentary
on a regular basis on CNBC.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.570
Dr. Elaine Kamarck.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.870
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: Kamarck.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.110
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: I knew that.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.780
I even know her daughter-in-law
who works at the library.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.030
Is a senior fellow in the
governance studies program

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.860
as well as director
of the Center

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.480
for Effective Public Management
at the Brookings Institution.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.810
Elaine is an expert on
American electoral politics

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.500
and government innovation
and reform.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.050
Her research focuses
on the party system

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.000
and the presidential
nomination system.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.570
She's the author of
several books including

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.970
"How Change Happens or Doesn't:

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.840
The Politics of US
Public Policy."

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.920
She's a lecturer
in public policy

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.900
for over the last 20 years at
the Harvard Kennedy School.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.170
Previously she helped spearhead
the new Democrat movement

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.460
in the 1980's and worked
in the Clinton White House

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.190
and has been a member of the DNC

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.780
and the DNC's rules
committee for over 20 years.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.650
And she's also been a five-time
super-delegate which kind

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.810
of got a little more
attention a couple of years ago

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.520
than it had in the past.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.070
She makes regular appearances
-- am I supposed to say that?

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.370
I pulled it right off your --

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.670
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck:
It's all right.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.970
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: She
makes regular appearances

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.270
on all the major media.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.570
David Barker is professor of
government and he's the director

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.320
of the Center for Congressional
and Presidential Studies

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.620
at American University.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.730
He's the author of
numerous articles and books.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.280
Please take special note

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.010
of his upcoming Oxford
University Press book,

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.460
"One Nation, Two Realities."

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.270
I've already read most of it,
even though it's not out yet.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.250
"Dueling Facts in
American Democracy."

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.000
And by the way, there
will be a book even there

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.890
at the Kluge Center
early next year.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.280
It really is fascinating.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.140
So we're going to jump
right into starting to think

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.170
about in an analytical way
congressional elections

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.860
in general, in particular
midterm elections.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.200
So I want to hit some
generic things first.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.390
And I'm going to start
with David at that end.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.780
In beginning any analysis
of midterm elections,

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.290
forget about that
we're in 2018 --

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.010
just anyone on a
generic standpoint --

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.510
what are the key factors that
you take into consideration?

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:45.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.340
&gt;&gt; David Barker: Historically,

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.640
a president with
an approval rating

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.220
under 50 traditionally
loses a lot of seats.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.680
The average is in the 40s.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.010
And indeed, all presidents
except three in the history

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.040
of the United States have
lost seats during midterms.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.340
So you start there.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.230
Another thing that you
want to take a look

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.760
at is the state of the economy.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.970
This is an unusual year because
we have a very strong economy

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.600
and a very unpopular president.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.530
So that statistic that I
mentioned a second ago,

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.100
where unpopular presidents
tend to translate

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.440
into big seat losses, typically
those unpopular presidents are

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.060
partially unpopular because of
a downward-trending economy.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.740
So this is a really unusual
year and it's going to be a test

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.150
of these competing theories

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.120
as to presidential approval
and economic factors.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.580
Just a third thing
that I'll mention

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.700
that is important is
the size of the victory

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.980
by the president
two years earlier.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:47.170
So typically really big
midterm losses correspond

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.810
to big coattails
two years earlier.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.860
So when there's a big
victory like in 1964, 1972,

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.330
to a lesser extent 1992
or 2008, then you tend

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.540
to see the big loss two
years later because a lot

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.490
of people are swept
in on the coattails.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.730
We obviously don't have
that situation this time.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.030
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Elaine,
what would you add to that?

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.330
What do you look
at, irrespective

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.780
of the particular year?

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.410
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: Well,
let me dig deeper on one

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:15.720
of the points you made.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.080
Midterm elections
are not always,

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.560
always about the
presidential candidate

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.370
or the president rather.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.670
It varies.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.840
And we've had midterm elections
that are really local, you know.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.590
It's just what the local issues
are, who's running, et cetera.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.300
But increasingly we seem to have
what the political scientists

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.600
call nationalized
midterm elections.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.830
We've just in recent years
-- 2006 was nationalized.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.420
2010 was nationalized.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.580
And this one looks to be a
heavily nationalized election.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.380
Now one of the reasons that
this happens is you've got

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.060
to think about it this way.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.700
People who are in the
business of politics have --

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.440
they're planning their careers

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.130
in a long-term fashion
the way you would

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.950
in your business, right?

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:18.260
And so if you're sitting around
in 2017 and you're looking

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.650
at this president's
kind of bumbling along

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.690
and having a hard time
getting his footing, et cetera,

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.890
and you're a county
commissioner someplace

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.510
and you've always wanted
to run for congress.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:33.480
You say, "Hmm, this
year I'm getting in."

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.190
Okay? Because this year might
be a good year for my party.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:41.060
And if you were sitting
around in Congress in 2009

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:45.000
as Barack Obama ran
into problems getting

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.050
out of the recession and his
healthcare bill, et cetera,

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.510
you might say, "Good year for
me, a Republican, to get it."

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:57.260
So what intermediates this
phenomenon is something we call

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.220
quality candidates.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.870
So good candidates, people
with a base in the district,

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.670
know something about the
business for running for office,

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:09.970
can raise money, et cetera,
they tend to get in in years

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.560
when it's looking
good for their party.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.830
And we see some evidence
of that this time

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.790
around on the Democratic side.

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:19.640
The converse of that is,
if you're a Republican

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.990
and you're sitting around
in 2017 or Democrat sitting

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:26.830
around in 2009, you
say to yourself,

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.710
"Maybe it's time I retired.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:32.170
Maybe it's time I went and
became a lobbyist and made money

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:34.400
or did something else."

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.550
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Spend
more time with my children.

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:39.150
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: Spend
more time with my children.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:40.600
That's a good one.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.900
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Sara,
what would you add to that?

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.560
And also, maybe you
could speak to --

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.920
neither of them said the magic
word money or campaign finance,

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.220
so maybe you can speak to that.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.710
But what else would you add?

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.250
&gt;&gt; Sara Fagen: Well, I think you
know, adding to those points,

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:56.410
I would add two things
that I would look for.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:58.240
One is the enthusiasm gap.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.770
And that plays out
in many forms.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:05.390
In self-reported polls we've
seen in this election Democrats

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:09.640
for virtually the entire cycle
have had a significantly higher

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:14.230
level of enthusiasm
over the Republicans.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.920
The enthusiasm gap has
been higher for Democrats.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:23.150
In 2010 and 2014, Republicans
had a significantly higher gap

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.290
over the Democrats and of
course they did very well

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.590
in those midterms.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:29.120
I always look at
the generic ballot.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.310
I think it tends to be
a little less effective

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:32.990
than it was 15 years ago.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:34.780
There are so many other
things to measure.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:41.850
But the generic ballot which is
a self-reported polling question

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:45.760
where they say, you know,
they're getting rid of the names

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.600
of the irrespective candidates.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.530
Would you be more likely
to vote for the Democratic

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:50.830
or the Republican candidate?

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:53.360
And Democrats have had --

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.570
you know, I would say
roughly an 8-12-point lead

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.900
in the generic ballot
most of this cycle,

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:05.400
even prior to the recent
Supreme Court frontpage news.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.370
So those are two other
things I look at.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:08.870
And then of course
money does matter,

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.330
although money is
increasingly less important.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:12.860
And it's much less important

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.370
when the election
is nationalized.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.840
And I agree a lot with Elaine.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.140
We've had a series -- five

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.950
of the last six elections
have been change elections.

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:22.910
The last three midterms
were change elections.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.170
This appears to be
a change election.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:30.160
We're in a period of enormous
political tumult in this country

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.240
that has a lot more
to do with --

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.710
if you sort of think back
about the rapid pace of change

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:40.480
in society over the
last 20 or 30 years.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.840
Quickening pace of change.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:48.850
Technology, finance, the way
wars are fought in this country,

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:50.780
significant demographic changes.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.970
There's a lot underlying
our politics.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:57.590
Donald Trump is a symptom of
the times, not the opposite way.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:02.420
And so I think a lot of those
factors mean we're going

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.120
to have a nationalized election.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.810
And you know, money is
going to be less important.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:10.660
There are going to
be people who lose.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:13.270
Incumbents with more
money are going to lose

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:16.190
because of the nationalized
nature of this election.

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:17.490
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: David, you
wanted to add something.

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:18.790
&gt;&gt; David Barker: Yeah, I
just wanted to add something

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.970
on the campaign finance which
is that money is important

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.270
but it's really a threshold.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:24.190
There are diminishing
returns to it.

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.410
So you have to have a certain
amount of money to be able

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:31.030
to run an effective campaign and
put ads out there and have staff

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.840
and all that kind of
stuff that you need

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.370
to do just to be competitive.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.810
But once you get above that
threshold of competitiveness,

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:42.610
then you can raise $50 million
more and it's not going to make

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.180
that much of a difference.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.750
In fact, it's frequently
the case that the candidate

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.810
who raises and spends
more money loses.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:53.040
And I mean, this is a panel
about midterm elections,

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.620
but if we want one example
of that, we can look to 2016

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.270
when Clinton outraised
and outspent Trump

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:02.170
by a very significant margin

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.270
and that didn't really
matter to much.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:08.550
&gt;&gt; Sara Fagen: One final point
on money, the higher the office,

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.200
the less impactful dollars are.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.610
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck:
That's a good point, yeah.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.860
&gt;&gt; Sara Fagen: And
I agree with David,

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.720
that oftentimes money
isn't relevant.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.580
But in the Senate races, in a
midterm that's not nationalized,

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.980
money matters a lot more than it
does I think in a year like this

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.730
where the whole country
appears to be paying attention

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.490
to Donald Trump's Twitter feed.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:36.080
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So Elaine
and Sara in particular harped

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.880
on the idea that the election
is more nationalized and it used

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.380
to be you had a panel like this

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.670
and in the first five minutes
somebody would say, "Well,

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:44.970
all politics is local."

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.140
They'd quote Tip O'Neil
and then they'd quit and go

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.830
to questions and the reception.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.680
But it's different now.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.270
And I was looking up some
statistics in preparing for this

00:12:54.270 --> 00:13:01.380
and I noticed that in 1988,
over 40% of the House seats

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:05.760
in those districts, over 40% of
them went or different parties

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.760
for president and for the House.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.870
And that's a Dukakis -- for
those of you who don't remember

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:14.970
or weren't alive,
Dukakis lost pretty badly

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:18.560
to then Vice President Bush,

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.620
but the Democrats maintained
the House quite easily in fact

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.010
when you look at it in
the sweep of history.

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:27.980
And nowadays it's like there are
a few seats that are like that,

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.870
that regularly split tickets.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.180
Where a lot of people
are splitting tickets

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.070
which yielded the kind of
result I described in 1988.

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:39.360
So let's just nail it down.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.110
What specific has
changed and how does

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:42.900
that affect our analysis
this time?

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.090
You guys have sort of touched
on it, but let's get specific.

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:46.840
Elaine, do you want
to tackle that?

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.740
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: Yeah,
well first thing to say

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.260
on that is there
are 24 House seats

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:56.070
that Hillary Clinton won the
district and the Republican won.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:00.500
And if you look at those,
most of them are you know,

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.120
right in the bull's eye

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.060
where the Democrats are
concentrating their efforts

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.450
to try to take back those seats.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:07.960
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: That's
as compared to 200

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.410
that were like that in 1988.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:11.710
Yeah.

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:13.010
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: That's right.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:14.310
Many, many fewer.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:15.610
I think that there's a
couple of structural changes.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:19.040
I think one is, interestingly
enough, the disappearance

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.860
of local newspapers and the
diminishment of local news.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:27.780
So you can't have a localized
race if nobody's reporting

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.500
on local issues, right?

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:33.040
And we at Brookings have a big
project called The Primaries

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.460
Project, for those of
you interested in it.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.530
We're publishing lots
of papers and we're

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.940
about to publish
three major reports.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:45.020
And what we do in that is we
code people's websites, okay?

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.050
And we don't even take a sample.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:50.760
We do the whole universe,
all the Republicans,

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.060
all the Democrats who run.

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.360
And we look at their websites.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:59.470
And what's interesting is how
little variation there is,

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:00.770
right?

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.230
The Republicans talk about
the same five or six things,

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.270
the Democrats talk about
the same five or six things.

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:09.630
There's very rarely local
issues on these websites.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:13.680
Now we couldn't have done the
same research 20 years ago

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.700
because nobody had websites.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:19.420
But I'm sure if you were able to
somehow have a standard measure

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:23.470
of candidate message
20-30 years ago,

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:24.770
we wouldn't have found that.

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:27.850
I think we would have found
a lot more local issues.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:32.810
So between the non-reporting
of that and the absence

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:37.920
of a local press has
really helped I think

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.750
to further nationalize
these campaigns.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:42.050
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: David?

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:43.350
&gt;&gt; David Barker: So
a couple of things.

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.970
First of all, to pick
up on the media aspect.

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:49.530
In addition to the
decline of local reporting

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.430
across the country, as
everybody in this room knows,

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:56.110
we've had an increase in
terms of partisan news, right?

00:15:56.110 --> 00:16:00.620
And so starting in the '90s with
talk radio and then in cable

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.180
with Fox and MSNBC and
then with websites and then

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:07.540
with social media, increasingly
people get their news filtered

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.540
through partisan sources,
and that actually contributes

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.230
to the nationalization
of politics.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:15.160
Because Rush Limbaugh
or Sean Hannity

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.320
or Rachel Madow don't
talk about local issues.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.700
And that's where people get
their news, not from local.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.840
Another couple of things I'll
mention is that over the course

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.520
of the past, I don't
know, ten years or so,

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.100
there have been two books
called "The Big Sort"

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.440
and they were talking
about different things.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.640
But both of those sorts
are relevant here.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:38.790
The first "big sort"
has to do with the fact

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.900
that it's mostly in
the south, right?

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.370
The formerly solid Democratic
south where you had really,

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.050
really conservative
democrats, right,

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:48.530
there used to be basically
three parties in this country:

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:51.030
national Republican party,
a northern Democratic party

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:52.330
and a southern Democratic party.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:53.750
And the southern
Democratic party were the

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:55.630
most conservative.

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.500
Still as of 1988 there were lots

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.630
of conservative Democrats
in the south.

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:02.930
That has changed.

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.310
People have sorted themselves
ideologically, right?

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:07.870
And so now there are very
few conservative Democrats.

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:10.790
There are very few
liberal Republicans.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:13.870
And that means you're going

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:17.690
to have fewer people balancing
their ticket or switching votes.

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:23.210
The other thing is the big sort
in terms of neighborhood sorting

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:25.960
or clustering or where
people live, right?

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.190
And so increasingly Republicans
and Democrats don't live

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:32.280
in the same cities or
towns or neighborhoods

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.490
or blocks like they used to.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:38.750
I mean, Democrats increasingly
are clustered really

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:42.240
in a few heavily-concentrated
metropolitan areas on the coasts

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:46.710
and a few other places around,
college towns and et cetera.

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:49.000
Whereas Republicans
live everywhere else.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.380
And so that along

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.700
with Gerrymandering has
created these districts

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.420
that are overwhelmingly
Democratic

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.190
or overwhelmingly Republican.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:58.970
And in those sorts of
districts people are going

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:01.170
to vote along the party line.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.470
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So
where do Republicans live

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.030
in the Washington area, Sara?

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:06.050
[ Laughter ]

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:07.350
I'm teasing.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.650
I'm teasing.

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:09.950
&gt;&gt; Sara Fagen: They hide.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:11.250
[ Laughter ]

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.550
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: They don't
go to dinner, I understand.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:16.080
Yeah. One example that
sort of illustrates some

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.200
of the things these
folks have said,

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.500
Sara's originally from Iowa.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.860
And in 1994, which
we didn't know

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.170
at the time this was a trend,
but there was a congressman

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:27.590
who never was challenged going
all the way back 36 years named

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:28.890
Neil Smith.

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:30.360
And all he did every
time was explain, "Hey,

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.270
I'm on appropriation and
every building in Aims,

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:36.330
Iowa and every hospital in this
entire district has my name

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:37.630
on it.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:38.930
Remember?"

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:40.230
And suddenly, based
on a national wave,

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:44.030
a plastic surgeon who's never
done any politics at all

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.130
and didn't particularly
have a tremendous amount

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:48.310
of political ability
beat him easily.

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:50.930
And that was -- looking back
on it, you're like, "Oh yeah,

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.230
that's the beginning of it."

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:54.610
But that happened a lot in 1994.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:55.910
&gt;&gt; Sara Fagen: Yeah.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:57.210
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So one thing I
wanted to bring up with respect

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:58.750
to the generic ballot that
Sara brought up is like,

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.050
well, how useful is it?

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:01.750
You go on 538 and you
see Democrats are ahead

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.050
by this much.

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:04.520
I did a little research
on that and I looked back,

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.560
and if you go back to other
decades, even the first decade

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.120
of this century or further back,

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.940
you see that the overall
vote total in the House more

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.840
or less reflected what would
happen in the distribution

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.990
of House seats in
the general election.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:20.630
So Democrats got 55% of the
two-party vote, get more

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:22.670
or less 55% of the seats.

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:25.800
What you see since 2010
is a very different thing

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.700
where now the commentary says,
"Hey, Democrats have to win

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.430
in the generic ballot or the
overall vote by at least seven

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:34.840
to be assure of winning."

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.140
What has happened?

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.610
What's the difference here?

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.130
&gt;&gt; Sara Fagen: Well,
you know, I think some

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:42.870
of it is the way
redistricting has happened.

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:46.470
And you know, we talked about
the self-sorting and so forth.

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:49.610
But if you sort of think through
partisan redistricting has

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:51.560
gotten more partisan

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:57.690
and Republicans have had
an important sort of thumb

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.170
on the scale, particularly
the last ten years,

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.150
just given their dominance.

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:05.440
Ironically, you know, for as
weak as Republicans may be

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.470
on the enthusiasm gap or
the generic balance today,

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:11.550
in many respects the party's
at a high watermark in terms

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:12.850
of the number of seats it holds.

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:14.150
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Yep.

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:15.450
&gt;&gt; Sara Fagen: Governor seats,
state legislative chambers

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:16.750
that they have control of.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:21.420
Of course control both chambers
of Congress across the street.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:25.730
So partisan redistricting
has helped a lot with that.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:29.050
I think if Democrats in fact
have a good year this year,

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:30.960
they'll be pretty
well set up heading

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.170
into the next decade
for redistricting.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:37.170
And you'll see some of
that counterbalance.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:40.080
And then also a lot
of it is turnout.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.620
You know, in a presidential
year,

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:46.110
you'll get significantly
higher turnout of course.

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:51.750
And much of the Democratic base
are the folks that don't show

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.050
up in midterm elections.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:54.350
They show up in presidential
elections.

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:58.670
But when you think of
where are the biggest gaps,

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:04.820
it tends to be single women,
minority voters, younger voters.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:07.150
They tend to vote only in
presidential elections.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:12.580
And so as a result, Republicans
have outperformed in midterms

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.230
because their older, whiter
voters tend to show up.

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:16.810
And they show up consistently.

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:18.820
So we'll see what
happens this year.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.120
There's a lot of discussion

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.230
about the energized
Democratic base.

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:25.440
It's been like that
most of the year.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.410
But historically speaking,
some of those groups

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:30.040
of voters have underperformed
in midterms.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.810
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: David, you
were going to piggyback on that?

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:33.110
&gt;&gt; David Barker:
Yeah, so I just want

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.470
to mention two things
with respect to that.

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:38.410
The first is that the
group that I think for whom

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:39.710
that is the most true,

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:42.520
or the gap that is most
important there is the age gap.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.970
There have been an awful lot

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.970
of progressive Democratic
candidates over the years

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:50.680
that have you know,
dreamed of winning big

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.940
because they were going
to turn out the youth.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.240
And it just doesn't
really ever happen, right?

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.900
I mean, some of you may
remember Howard Dean,

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.670
is one name that comes to mind.

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:06.940
And even when they do, right,
I mean, young people turned

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:10.160
out in higher numbers
for Obama both times.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.960
But the gap still between people
in their 20s or 30s and people

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.590
in their 50s, 60s and
older is enormous.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:19.560
Now the other thing that I'll
say though is there is one

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:24.250
countervaling trend
to this general truism

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:26.630
that Republicans tend to
have a turnout advantage.

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:30.690
And that has been another
realignment if you want to say

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:31.990
with respect to education.

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:35.100
So one of the factors
that's most predictive

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.300
of turnout is education, right?

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.540
People with college degrees
and higher tend to turnout

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:42.910
at higher levels than
people who don't.

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:46.310
And you know, 40 years ago
Republicans had a big advantage

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:48.110
with college-educated voters.

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:50.260
20 years ago it was about even,

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.060
but Republicans still might
have had a slight advantage.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:57.590
But now Democrats have a 22- or
23-percentage-poitn advantage

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:59.240
with college-educated voters.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.450
They have a 33- or
35-percentage-point advantage

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:05.060
with voters who have
advanced degrees.

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:08.510
And so that may counter
the age gap and some

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:10.520
of the other gaps
that we talked about.

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:11.820
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Elaine, yeah.

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:13.120
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: Yeah.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.450
And let me just do one
other thing on age.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:16.910
Because Sara's absolutely
right on that.

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:25.430
The thing that keeps giving
Democrats hope is not just

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:27.490
hoping for bigger turnout.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:33.080
But the different generations
are either bigger or smaller.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.660
So us baby boomers, there
were a heck of a lot of us.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:40.640
And to everybody's surprise,
we had a heck of a lot

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.510
of children called millennials.

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:47.060
The millennial generation
is the biggest generation

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.520
in American history.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:53.180
So generations are
important when they're big.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.480
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Yep.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.780
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: See, nobody
talks about the voting behavior

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.830
of gen X-ers, unfortunately
for those of you

00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:59.470
who might be gen X-ers, right?

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:02.280
Because there just weren't
very many gen X-ers.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.790
&gt;&gt; David Barker: And
we're tired and boring.

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.880
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: And
we're tired and boring.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.110
But when you have
a big generation,

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:12.550
when you have what we call
a pig in the python, right,

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:16.370
as that generation moves
through you know, you've got --

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:18.610
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: It
eventually comes out.

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:19.910
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: Yeah.

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:22.340
As that generation moves
through the electorate,

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:26.280
their voting behavior becomes
quite significant simply

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.870
because there's so many of them.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:29.200
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Less creative
people used to say lump

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.500
in a snake, so I'll
give you that one.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.310
[ Laughter ]

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:33.610
Sorry, Elaine.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:34.910
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: That's okay.

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:36.410
And so what we know so far

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:38.870
about the millennial
generation is they have tended

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:40.170
to vote Democratic.

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:41.470
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Yeah.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:42.770
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: Okay,

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:44.070
they don't like to call
themselves, Democrats, right?

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:46.750
But it doesn't matter
when push comes to shove.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:48.110
They vote Democratic.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:52.290
Barack Obama's entire
margin of victory

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:55.360
in 2008 came from
people under 30.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.470
Okay? If you had taken them out
of the equation, he was neck

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:02.050
and neck in all the
other age cohorts.

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:05.020
So it's not just
old versus young.

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.740
It's the size of
generations and whether

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:12.020
or not they express
a partisan preference

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.590
and then stick with it.

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:15.340
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: You know,
one thing I wanted to ask Sara

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:16.690
about -- because Sara is one

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:20.230
of the people you
know, who's prominent.

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:23.240
I mean, she's done
the nitty-gritty

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.710
on the ground electioneering,
literally the ground game

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:28.910
as well as other
forms of campaigning.

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:31.260
She orchestrated
that as a career

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.270
and is still doing some of that.

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:36.990
What's changed in terms of
campaigning and electioneering

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:40.430
over the last two and
a half decades or so

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:41.730
since you've been involved?

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:45.400
And also, does the
campaign matter very much?

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:48.270
You know, how does
campaigning matter?

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:50.480
&gt;&gt; Sara Fagen: So I think the
campaign does still matter

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.780
a lot.

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:55.100
It's much harder to have
control over your campaign

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:59.230
as a candidate, particularly
a candidate for Senate

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:03.290
and governor, because of the
way campaign finance laws

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:04.590
have changed.

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:08.480
And the outsized influence
now of third-party groups.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.200
So you can very easily lose
control of your message

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:15.810
if another entity comes in
and spends significantly more

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:18.100
than you and changes
the narrative

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:19.400
of what you want to talk about.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.700
And that happens.

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:22.100
And people often tend
to be very frustrated

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.430
with the outside groups in their
own parties because of that.

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:28.470
What's changed overall though
I would say is you know,

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:33.790
I started working in -- my
first campaigns were as a kid.

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:37.340
But my first paid jobs
were in college, you know.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:40.430
Brancett for governor, and
Dansky who you mentioned earlier

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.580
for Congress, did
some work on those.

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:46.690
It was a small business
back then, you know,

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:47.990
like little b business.

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:50.380
You had grassroots
activists, you did some mail,

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:51.960
you organized funding banks.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.120
And those activities still
exist as the lifeblood

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:59.870
of the campaign, but it's
a really big business now.

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:03.610
The amount of money has
grown exponentially.

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:07.220
The amount of sophistication
of communication and targeting,

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:12.630
you know, it takes data
scientists to run a campaign,

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:14.330
particularly at a
statewide level.

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:19.310
But even in most congressional
campaigns, they're now working

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:23.160
with advanced voter
files and analytics.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:26.830
And like I said, there's teams
of data people involved in them,

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:29.280
and digital targeting.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.300
And you know, it used to
be way more shoe leather.

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:36.040
And there's real
benefits to some of that

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:39.500
and of course there is some
downsides to it as well.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:40.800
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Well,
what are you all's answers

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.260
to the question of,
do campaigns matter?

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:45.560
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck:
I think they do.

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:49.290
I mean, Sara's right in the
way that they've changed.

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:51.160
But I do think campaigns matter.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:54.220
And it's interesting, a
lot of times they matter

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:55.610
when somebody screws up.

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:56.910
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Yeah.

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:58.210
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: Okay?

00:27:58.210 --> 00:27:59.510
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Yeah.

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:00.810
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: So all
you have to do is think back

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:03.310
to Todd Aikin the
Republican candidate or Senate

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:07.090
in Missouri saying
that you know,

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:09.040
women who were raped
couldn't get pregnant

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:13.540
because their body went into
some kind of altered state

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:16.120
and they couldn't get
pregnant if they were raped.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.890
It's like, "What?"

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:20.030
And you know, that
did it for him.

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:24.740
So you know, the campaign
does matter, particularly

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:28.320
when somebody just
makes a big mistake.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:33.140
Or when you find out something
about someone that was hidden.

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:37.890
They have a drunk driving
record, they have something else

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:40.850
that they've done in their
past that gets unearthed

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:43.110
in the course of the campaign.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:48.870
But in terms of arguing over
your Social Security plan,

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:54.640
I just don't see the campaign
really mattering all that much.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.940
&gt;&gt; David Barker:
Yeah, I would say

00:28:55.940 --> 00:29:00.850
that campaigns frequently matter
in sort of an indirect way,

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:04.010
in that they make what we refer

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:06.400
to as the fundamentals
matter more, right?

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.760
Because it's through campaigning
that people get reminded

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.060
of partisanship, right?

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.960
So campaigning can
activate partisanship just

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:18.060
by simply reminding the
important targeted voters, "Hey,

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:21.480
like this is the Democratic
or Republican candidate.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.960
This is the person that you're
supposed to be voting for,"

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.090
through ads or especially
through microtargeting

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:28.040
and social media, et cetera.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.560
And the second thing
that I'll say --

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.410
and this piggybacks
on Sara as well --

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:38.160
is that they matter
in that getting people

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.260
to the polls aspect, right?

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:44.070
And again, that's done in a
much more sophisticated way

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:47.930
than it used to be through the
microtargeting and whatnot.

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:51.370
But it's not like you're going
to persuade that many voters

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:55.570
through campaigning, but you
are going to try to make sure

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:57.560
that your people
get to the polls.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:01.630
And campaigns are a lot better
at that than they used to be.

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:02.930
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So how
many seats are in play

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:04.230
in the House, David, this year?

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:05.530
Let's get to the fun part.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:06.830
&gt;&gt; David Barker: Yeah.

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:09.030
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: We're
going to talk about 2018,

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:10.330
what's going to happen.

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:11.630
&gt;&gt; David Barker: Yeah.

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:12.930
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: I
might even force them

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:14.230
into a prediction,
but maybe not.

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:15.530
Let's see.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:16.830
&gt;&gt; David Barker:
No, let's do that.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:18.130
I'm ready for that.

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:19.430
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
Straight up, all of you.

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:20.730
We'll start with David.

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:22.030
How many House seats
are in play?

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:23.330
&gt;&gt; David Barker: Roughly 60.

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:24.630
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Okay.

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:25.930
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck:
I'd say about 70.

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:27.230
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Okay.

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:28.530
What do you think?

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:29.830
&gt;&gt; Sara Fagen: I'd say 55.

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:31.130
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: 55.

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:32.430
So we're sort of in range here.

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:33.730
And in the Senate, how many?

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:36.380
We'll start with you.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:37.680
&gt;&gt; Sara Fagen: Six or seven.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.980
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Yeah.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.430
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck:
I'd say about five.

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:41.730
&gt;&gt; David Barker: Yeah.

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.090
I was going to say like if you
really want to be generous,

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:47.440
right, you could
imagine up to 10.

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:50.340
But in reality, I'd
say more like six.

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:51.640
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Okay,
so we'll get back

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.290
to specific things to look at.

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:57.170
But here's a question that --
I think this is a hard one,

00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:59.930
so I'm just going to let
anyone who wants to talk to it.

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:02.690
And it's been anticipated
by some of what you said.

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:04.510
Particularly I think
something David said earlier.

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:06.950
The economy is going
great guns right now,

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.470
although don't look
at your stocks today.

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:11.720
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: Right, don't
look at the stock market today.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.020
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
Don't happen to look

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.530
at the Wall Street
Journal today.

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:16.580
And so two things.

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:18.360
They're different but
they're going to play in.

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.660
The economy's going great.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:23.130
You know, unemployment's
like minus three or whatever.

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:27.510
Republicans didn't pick up any
seats in the house in 2016,

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:30.620
in part because their
candidate didn't win a plurality

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:31.920
of the vote.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.370
And they have thus relatively
few vulnerable seats.

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:36.370
I think you got into
that, David,

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:40.690
as compared to say Democrats
had in 2010 after they'd gone

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:42.460
through two cycles of
winning lots of seats.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:44.290
And they had a lot of people who
should never have been elected.

00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:46.260
You know, you get into that
situation, who are going

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:47.620
to be more vulnerable.

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:51.200
Yet, analysts are saying this
year that Republicans are

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.650
in deep trouble in the House

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:55.790
and maybe even have a small
chance of losing the Senate.

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:58.780
What is going on here?

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.300
&gt;&gt; Sara Fagen: It's a really
interesting phenomenon.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:04.860
You know, I think there are sort
of some environmental factors

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.320
that certainly caused
the House to be in play.

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:10.570
We mentioned earlier the
president's low approval rating.

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:13.560
But you know, what
is highly unusual is

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.380
that you have a president
with a low job approval rating

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:17.880
and a really strong economy.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.180
&gt;&gt; David Barker: Yeah, I'm not
sure we've ever seen it before.

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:20.480
&gt;&gt; Sara Fagen: Just to put

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.010
into context how strong the
economy is, it's the single --

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:27.250
I've always looked at -- I
sort of learned this working

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:30.690
on the Bush reelect
from another strategist

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:35.050
on the team studying consumer
conference board present

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:36.350
situation index.

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:40.380
You study it, if you look at
the trend line, and over time

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.610
since the thing has
been measured,

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:44.220
if an incumbent president
running

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:48.450
for reelection has a trend line
going up, he has been reelected.

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:54.210
And if he has a trend line
going down, he has lost.

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:56.300
And you can look at every
president and you know,

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.860
the Reagan and Clinton economies

00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:00.480
and the consumer confidence
is high and trending up.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.790
So you look at all the
clusters in the period

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:07.480
of time before their
election, their reelect,

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.210
and you of course would see
Clinton and the Reagan economies

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:14.820
up here, you know, the Bush 41
and Carter economies down here.

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:18.050
Well, Trump is over here.

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:21.120
It's really strong right now.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.920
And so I do wonder if that's
going to blunt some of this.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:31.130
And that he's personally
unpopular, but his job approval

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:35.410
in terms of his actions
in office are higher.

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:37.960
And this is something people
measured in the Clinton years.

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:44.100
People didn't personally like
Bill Clinton because of some

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.850
of the antics and the Me
Too stuff before Me Too was

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:48.240
a movement.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.520
But they thought he did a
really good job in office

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.430
and they rewarded him for it
and rewarded Democrats for it.

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:58.850
And I think we're going to see
that blunt some Democrat wins.

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:02.700
We also had a significant amount
of retirements as a party.

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.070
More retirements out of
this Congress I think

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:06.450
than at any point
since the '30s.

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:08.100
And that's going to --

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.400
&gt;&gt; David Barker:
Mostly Republicans.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.700
&gt;&gt; Sara Fagen: Mostly
Republicans.

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:12.660
So it's going to cause
Republicans to lose seats

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:16.110
that had the party been more
organized and kept people

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:19.290
in office, they'd probably
be in a better position

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:21.100
to retain the House today.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.500
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Elaine, how
do you answer that question?

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.800
Or either of you?

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.810
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: I mean,
you're absolutely right.

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:31.890
It really is a conundrum
here, this president.

00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:33.600
But what you see in a lot

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.820
of the public opinion
polls are people saying,

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:41.570
"We need a Democratic Congress
to check this president."

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:47.160
And their concerns about this
president are not the classic

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:50.060
ones: is he handling
the economy right?

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.950
You know, it's not
a policy concern.

00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:57.960
It's a concern about frankly
his authoritarian tendencies.

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.290
And so people are
worried about democracy.

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:02.980
They're worried about
the norms of the country

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:08.750
because he's been a norm breaker
ever since he got into office.

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:11.170
And he doesn't seek
to unite the country

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:12.950
like most presidents have done.

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:14.510
He's very divisive.

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:20.810
And so I think you have
another issue out there

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:26.050
which is his behavior vis a
vis, the democratic process.

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:30.370
And that's in competition with
the more classic behaviors

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:34.980
that we've studied like how good
the economy is, do you approve

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:39.320
of the way he's conducting
his policies in office?

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:42.000
The way to look at this,
and Sara mentioned this,

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.070
was in 1998, that's
one of the few years

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:50.530
where the incumbent president
actually didn't lose seats

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:53.000
but actually gained
seats in a midterm.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.350
And Clinton had been
impeached that year.

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:57.650
He'd been impeached.

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:58.950
&gt;&gt; David Barker:
Which is something

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:00.250
for the Democrats to remember.

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:01.830
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: Something
for the Democrats to remember.

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:03.360
He'd been impeached.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.400
He was not convicted
in the Senate.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:09.340
And what happened was
people made a decision

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:11.360
that they liked what
he was doing

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.500
as president even
though the ratings

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:20.530
of him personally were very
low because of his dalliances

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:22.180
with a White House intern.

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:25.110
So that's something
to bear in mind

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:28.350
as we look at what's coming up.

00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:29.650
&gt;&gt; David Barker: So
a couple of things

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:31.290
that are different
I think that help

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:33.310
to explain why we've
got this conundrum

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:38.370
of a really strong economy and
a really unpopular president is

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:41.370
that unlike Clinton
where as Sara said,

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:44.560
people didn't necessarily like
him personally, but they thought

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.240
that he was doing
well in office,

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.650
the median voter
believed that, right?

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:53.850
Independents, right, and even
some Republicans believed

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:56.970
that Clinton was doing
well policy-wise in office.

00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:58.270
And why wouldn't they, right?

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:01.470
I mean, he was a right of center
president in a lot of ways.

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:09.150
But people who opposed Trump,
right, basically all Democrats

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:12.540
and a plurality of
independents, right,

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.670
don't just dislike
him personally --

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:16.050
although it's impossible

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:19.000
to overstate how much they
dislike him personally, right?

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.090
They also think that he
is bad at his job, right?

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:28.150
And so in that way it's
different than Trump, right?

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:29.470
They oppose his policies.

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:30.770
They oppose the tax cuts.

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:32.470
They oppose the immigration
plan.

00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:34.330
They oppose pulling out
of the Climate Accord.

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:36.430
They oppose pulling out of Iran.

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:39.070
They oppose sort of
like offending everybody

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:40.370
in Europe, right?

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:43.180
They oppose the shift on trade

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:45.280
and they oppose basically
everything.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.780
They oppose all the deregulation
and everything, right?

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:50.050
We can go on and on
and on and on, right?

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:51.770
And so that's different.

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:54.570
The other thing that is
different is that if you think

00:37:54.570 --> 00:38:00.020
about those presidents who were
reelected with strong economies

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:03.470
in the trajectory, in
every one of those cases,

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:07.730
the economy had been
going poorly, right.

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:11.290
And then that new president came
in and things got better, right?

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:14.100
So Reagan came in -- it took
a couple of years, right --

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.320
but the economy had been
struggling throughout most

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.560
of the '70s and definitely
at the end

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.100
of the Carter administration.

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.120
It continued to for
a couple of years,

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.080
but then it took off, right?

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:26.540
And that fueled Reagan's
popularity.

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:29.690
The same was true, right,
with Clinton, right?

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:32.300
Where the economy had
been strong in the '80s

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:33.600
but we'd had a recession

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.420
in the '90s right before
Clinton took office.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:38.090
Same was true with Obama, right?

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:40.810
We had had the Great Recession
and then Obama comes in

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:44.470
and things slowly tick
up, not fast enough

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:45.770
to anybody's satisfaction.

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:47.840
But things slowly got
better over the course

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.500
of his administration.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:53.890
The difference this time,
right, is that the Trump,

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:56.040
that trend line is
just a continuation.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.590
Instead of going like
this and then like this,

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:02.840
the economy's been going like
this for ten years, right?

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.140
Or it's going like this

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:06.580
for eight years prior
to Trump coming in.

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:09.970
And it has continued
to go like this, right?

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:12.270
And so that might explain
that conundrum to some degree.

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:13.570
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So listen,
we're going to do one sort

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:15.160
of fun question and
then we'll get

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.520
to one more substantive question
and then go to your questions.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.820
&gt;&gt; David Barker: Yeah.

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:21.230
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: The fun one
is, in the next few weeks,

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:22.530
what are the bellweathers?

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:25.630
What are you watching,
either House or Senate?

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:27.830
You know, what would
you tell the audience

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:29.130
to say, "Hey, watch this.

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:30.450
This will give you a sense"?

00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:33.100
Anything will give you a sense
of where things are headed?

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:36.720
And then also maybe you could
throw in your prediction.

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.060
Who wants to start?

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:39.440
Elaine, why don't you start?

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.740
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: Okay.

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:43.650
Well, all right, I'm going
to watch two Senate races.

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:48.670
I'm going to watch the Heitkamp
race in North Dakota to see

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:53.910
if she bounces back from
her opposition to Kavanaugh

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:55.940
and begins to close that gap.

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:59.460
She has come from behind before.

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:03.440
There's a lot of money
pouring into that state.

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.480
So that's possible.

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:09.100
I will also watch
the Texas Senate race

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:11.960
with Bado O'Rourke and Ted Cruz.

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:16.200
Because if Bado O'Rourke
comes within a point or two,

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:22.550
that's a pretty significant
shift, even if he loses.

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:27.350
If he wins, then they're going
to call this not the blue wave,

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:29.860
but they're going to
call it the blue tsunami.

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.490
Okay? And that's what
it's going to be.

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:35.930
I'm going to also watch
those California races.

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:40.430
Seven out of the 24 districts
that the Democrats need

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:43.470
to flip the House
are in California.

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:47.240
And California has been
going increasingly blue.

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:50.950
So if those races
all look solid,

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:55.030
then it means Democrats don't
have to pick up that many seats

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:57.260
in other parts of the country.

00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:00.020
So watch those California races.

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:02.610
Many of them are in Southern
California, Orange County

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:05.950
which has gone through
a demographic change,

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:09.560
as well as the opposition
to Trump.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.630
So that's what I'm watching.

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:12.990
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
And your prediction?

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:15.810
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: I think
the Senate will stay close

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:17.780
and stay in Republican hands.

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:21.330
I think the Democrats
will pick up 30-40 seats

00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:22.870
in the House and take the House.

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:24.170
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: David,
you want to go next?

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:25.470
&gt;&gt; David Barker: Sure.

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:26.770
So let me pick up on Texas.

00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:31.150
So I grew up in Texas
and people --

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:34.950
and it's easy for me when I
think about the state I grew

00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:39.480
up in to imagine Texas
turning blue as being some sort

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:43.410
of crazy, wild-eyed
liberal pipe dream.

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:48.100
But it's important to think
about something in 2016,

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:52.440
which is that Hillary
Clinton lost Texas

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:57.080
by a smaller margin
than she lost Ohio.

00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:00.760
And Jared Brown is going to
win by double digits in Ohio.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.810
And Jared Brown is
a very liberal --

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:04.110
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Senate race.

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:05.410
&gt;&gt; David Barker: Yeah.

00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:07.320
He is defending his
seat in the Senate,

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.160
very progressive Democrat.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.470
Some would call him shrill.

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:14.260
And he's going to
win easily in a place

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:18.460
that really should be worse
for Democrats now than Texas

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:22.730
if you take 2016 as
the marker on that.

00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:24.840
And so what that means, I'll say

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:28.250
that Jared Brown is more
progressive than Bado O'Rourke.

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:31.860
And so I don't actually
think that it will be as much

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:36.090
of a shocker if O'Rourke
is able to win in Texas.

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:38.790
To me it would be a bigger
shock if Bredesen were

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:40.830
to win in Tennessee, right?

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:44.750
And so in terms of other
things to pay attention to,

00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:48.510
in addition to Texas and in
addition to North Dakota --

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:51.400
although I've already kind of
written Heidi Camp off there --

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.910
I would also pay
attention to Missouri

00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:57.690
where Claire McCaskill
is in deep trouble,

00:42:57.690 --> 00:43:01.450
and probably outside of
Heitkamp, the Democrat who's

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:04.930
in the biggest trouble.

00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:07.960
And I would say -- well,
I'll leave that alone.

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:12.040
Yeah, and I guess Tennessee.

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:17.200
We'll see if the Taylor Swift
effect makes any difference.

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.920
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: What are you
doing for your predictions?

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.220
&gt;&gt; David Barker: Oh.

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:22.920
So in the House, we're going
to call it a blue tide,

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:26.480
not a blue wave, for a
whole host of reasons,

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:30.840
some of which we touched on
here and Sara alluded to.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:34.170
It's harder for blue waves
to happen than red waves.

00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:38.720
And so I'm going to say 30
seats in the House and I'm going

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.720
to say that Democrats lose
a couple in the Senate

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.580
and they win a couple
in the Senate,

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:45.320
and it evens right back out.

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.660
So we stay right where we are.

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:49.600
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Sara,
what are you looking at?

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.950
&gt;&gt; Sara Fagen: Well, I'll just
continue on the Texas theme.

00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:56.140
I think you know, three
weeks ago, four weeks ago,

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:58.350
Ted Cruz would have won
by three or four points

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:00.610
and I think today he'll
win by six or seven points,

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:03.090
because I think it's
still a Republican state.

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:06.320
Although it has gotten
increasingly blue.

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.780
But it's still a
republican state

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:11.750
and I think the hyper-partisan
nature

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:16.900
of the Supreme Court fight
really manifested itself

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:21.410
in places like Missouri,
North Dakota but also Texas.

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:26.260
I also think Bado
O'Rourke, you know,

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:29.250
while he may be less
progressive than Jared Brown,

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:30.930
he's quite progressive
for Texans

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:33.980
and I think Ted Cruz has got
a real campaign apparatus now

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:35.280
in motion on this.

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.790
Maybe the weren't
taking him as serious

00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:40.310
as they should have
been earlier.

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:43.310
You know, I'm also watching
these House districts.

00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:45.290
My view -- and this
could change,

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:50.840
because passions were inflamed
and the whole nation was focused

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:53.440
on the Supreme Court and
four weeks is an eternity

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.740
in an election cycle.

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:58.480
But assuming Republicans
are now more enthusiastic

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:01.090
and Democrats were
basically already

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:03.990
at 11 before the
Supreme Court hearing,

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:05.290
they don't have much
room to grow.

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:07.240
Republicans have a lot of room
to grow and they've grown.

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:10.970
And so I look at all these
House seats that are plus-7,

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:15.550
6 or 7% Republican advantage
in the partisan registration

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:18.290
or the partisan identification
in the district

00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:21.350
that were lean Republican seats

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:23.080
or in some cases
even swing seats.

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:27.080
Like a seat like Indie Bar,
a seat like Kentucky where --

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:28.730
that's maybe not
the best example

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:30.840
because there's a lot
of colleges there.

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:33.740
There are a number of really
what should be Republican

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:35.110
districts that were "in play".

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:37.990
I don't think those
are in play anymore.

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:41.950
So I still think from a
prediction perspective,

00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:49.220
just based on the math,
there's so many swing seats

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:50.520
that are Republican
and there are

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:52.140
so many Republican retirements

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:53.930
and you have a president
under 40.

00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:58.610
It's probably very difficult for
Republicans to retain control.

00:45:58.610 --> 00:45:59.910
But I would have said three

00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:03.360
or four weeks ago Democrats
might pick up 40 seats,

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.850
and I think they probably
pick up just enough

00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:07.240
to get them over the hump.

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:10.260
&gt;&gt; David Barker: Or
25-30, in that range.

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:11.560
&gt;&gt; Sara Fagen: Yeah,
something like that.

00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:15.930
And the Senate, I think
Republicans probably --

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:19.520
you know, maybe net
lose one only.

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:20.820
&gt;&gt; David Barker: Yeah.

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.310
&gt;&gt; Sara Fagen: And maybe
not, maybe lose none.

00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:23.610
Yeah.

00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:24.910
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: And so the
last thing I want to ask

00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:26.210
about is there's
been a lot of talk --

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:27.510
and we'll start with you, Sara,

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:30.220
that this is potentially
the year of the woman.

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.230
What does that actually
mean in tangible terms?

00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:33.720
I mean, to the extent
that might be true,

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.600
what does that mean
in tangible terms?

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:38.560
&gt;&gt; Sara Fagen: Well, first
of all, it was the year

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:42.910
of the woman long before there
was a Supreme Court opening.

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:44.580
And the reason it was
the year of the woman

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:48.700
in part is certainly in the
aftermath of the 2016 election,

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:50.830
some women in this country felt

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:55.660
like Donald Trump's behavior
toward women was not properly

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:56.960
addressed in the election.

00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:00.810
And they felt very
emboldened to get involved.

00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:04.660
There's also a cultural
movement that spans sports

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:09.610
and entertainment and the news
industry, and across the board,

00:47:09.610 --> 00:47:15.260
where appropriate workplace
conduct had a big light shone

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:16.560
on it.

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.860
And it needed to.

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:19.160
And it was a good thing.

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:22.650
Just to put some practical
numbers around it though,

00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:26.340
if you look at the number of
women who are running for office

00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:29.950
in the house, you
know, I think 50%

00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:32.210
of the nominees are
Democrats in the House.

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:35.150
50% of the Democrat
nominations are women.

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:38.080
You've had significantly --
I have actually this chart.

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.190
It's going to be
really hard to see it,

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:44.290
but you've had basically
450 women run for the House.

00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:46.420
And while many of them are
Democrats, you've also had

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:50.620
over 100 Republican women run
which is significantly more

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:52.470
than any year in history.

00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:54.770
It's true in the Senate as well.

00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:57.140
You've had almost 50
women run for the Senate.

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:58.440
Most of them are Democrats.

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:01.660
But you've had almost 20
Republican women run as well.

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:06.910
So it's across the board
and it scales in proportion

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:09.560
to the percentage of
people previously involved.

00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:10.860
And it's a good thing.

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:12.990
And I think women getting
involved more actively

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:17.120
in the political process
will help dramatically,

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.710
actually move back to a place

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:24.040
where we have conversation
and bipartisanship.

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.800
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Both of you
have been involved in politics,

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.670
Elaine even longer than Sara.

00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:29.360
What's your perspective on it?

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:31.380
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: Thanks, that
really makes me feel great.

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:32.680
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: By
a month or two, yeah.

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:34.900
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck:
Yeah, by a month.

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:37.310
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: But what's
your perspective on that?

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:38.610
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: There's
going to be more women

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:42.320
in the Congress, no doubt about
it, and the number of women

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:47.250
who are activated this
time is truly amazing.

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:50.620
So there's been a
generational shift here.

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:53.370
The scholarship on women
in politics is that one

00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:57.140
of the big differences is that
women always waited to be asked.

00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:58.500
Okay? Well, guess what?

00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:00.890
This new generation is
not waiting to be asked.

00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:02.490
They're acting like men.

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:04.530
They're just looking in
the mirror and saying,

00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:06.540
"Hello, Madame Senator."

00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:10.230
Okay? You know, the
joke used to always be

00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:13.680
that any 28-year-old man in the
country would look at himself

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:15.180
and go, "Hello, Mr. President."

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:17.060
And a 28-year-old woman
would say, "Oh dear,

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:18.360
I could never do that."

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:21.290
So you know, this
seems to be going away

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:23.890
with the new generation,
thank God.

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:29.590
And I also think, and we see
this in all the races we've seen

00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:31.640
with the special elections,

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:35.050
there is an enormous gender
gap between the parties.

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:37.450
I mean, the Republican
party is the man's party.

00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:39.160
The Democratic party
is the woman's party,

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:41.150
just to be simple about it.

00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:45.560
And there's just lots more
women voting for Democrats.

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:50.820
The hope for the Democrats
is suburban Republican women

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:53.930
crossing over because
they don't like Trump.

00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:57.910
Remember, the day after the
president was inaugurated,

00:49:57.910 --> 00:50:00.870
you had a woman's march
on Washington that was all

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:04.460
about opposing that
new president.

00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:06.770
So something's happened here.

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:12.080
I don't know how long this will
exist, you know what I mean?

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:13.380
I don't know how
permanent it is.

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:16.890
But there's definitely
a big gender split

00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:18.610
in our politics these days,

00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:20.930
and I've never seen
anything like it.

00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:22.780
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So
roughly what is that split?

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:24.080
What is that gap?

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.380
Do you know the numbers, David?

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:26.680
&gt;&gt; David Barker:
It's like 20 points.

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:27.980
Yeah.

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:29.280
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck:
Yeah, 20 points is huge.

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.970
Now, if it's 20 points
evenly, right,

00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:32.460
it sort of doesn't
make any difference,

00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:35.650
except there are
slightly more women

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:38.820
than men in the world, okay?

00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:42.400
And women have higher
turnout rates than men do.

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:45.750
That began to happen
in the '80s.

00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:48.550
Now I'm showing my age now
in spite of what I said,

00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:54.210
so when I was a baby political
scientist, women did not turn

00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:55.600
out as much as men did.

00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:57.870
And the reason was
that you still had

00:50:57.870 --> 00:51:01.970
in the electorate women who
were socialized in an era

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:05.220
when they didn't
have the vote, okay?

00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:08.420
And even when they got
the vote, it wasn't sort

00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:10.450
of something women
were supposed to do.

00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:13.800
Well, you know, fast
forward 30 years

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:15.990
and they're all dead, okay?

00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:18.830
And they're not in the
electorate anymore.

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:22.310
So you don't have any
generations of women

00:51:22.310 --> 00:51:25.420
who think it's weird that
women should vote, okay?

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:30.140
So this has been -- so now
you have slightly more women

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:33.750
and you have much
higher turnout of women.

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:35.960
And this makes a
big, big difference.

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:38.930
You know, the big
problem journalists have

00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:42.650
in election analysis is they
always look at percentages

00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:45.930
and they forget about
the arithmetic, okay?

00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:47.950
So guess what?

00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:54.630
Having a 1-point advantage
amongst 51% of the electorate,

00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:56.520
that's big numbers, right?

00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:59.710
Whereas having a 1-point
advantage among 8%

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:01.590
of the electorate is not.

00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:02.890
&gt;&gt; David Barker: Yeah.

00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:04.190
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: And so,

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:05.550
there's just a lot
of women around.

00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:06.850
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So you're going

00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:09.080
to have the last word before
we get to a few questions.

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:10.570
&gt;&gt; David Barker: A few
final things to say on that.

00:52:10.570 --> 00:52:13.280
First of all, with the turnout
differential between men

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:17.860
and women, Elaine is
completely right on that.

00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:23.530
However, until this year it
appears, right, the gap in terms

00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:27.230
of turnout of women turn
out more, was much more true

00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:30.360
in presidential years
than in midterms, right?

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:34.710
And so women tended to turn
out much higher rates than men

00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:37.850
in presidential years, and
then maybe like slightly higher

00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:41.990
than men in midterm years or
even to men in midterm years.

00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:45.740
Whereas this year, right,
all the indicators are

00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:50.030
that women will turn out
at higher rates than men

00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:52.660
in similar rates that they
do in presidential elections.

00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:54.280
And so that's really
significant.

00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:57.160
The other thing I'll say,
just with respect to the year

00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:01.860
of the woman is that anybody
who thinks that Nancy Pelosi is

00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:05.190
in trouble is probably
wrong, right?

00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:09.400
I mean, I think this is going
to be the wrong year, right,

00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:13.260
to oust Nancy Pelosi as speaker.

00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:18.160
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: Can
I just say, if Pelosi,

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:23.150
Hoyer and Klieberd
deliver a Democratic House

00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:25.400
with a significant margin,

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.700
none of the mare
going anyplace, okay?

00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:29.960
This is all nonsense.

00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:31.260
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Okay,
so indicate to me

00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:33.740
if you're interested
in asking a question.

00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:36.280
We have the lady
right there, Linda.

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:38.430
You want to give Linda --

00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:40.950
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:43.880
Mention was made of
the essential role

00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:50.540
that data scientists play
in election campaigns today.

00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:54.890
I've always been curious
though, what happened

00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:59.970
with the data science when
they predicted Clinton's win

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:01.710
for the presidential campaign?

00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:03.010
Can you explain that?

00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:04.610
&gt;&gt; Sara Fagen: Yeah, so
it's a good question.

00:54:04.610 --> 00:54:09.910
And I think you're really asking
a question about the polling.

00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:13.980
And you know, a couple thoughts.

00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:17.390
One, the polling actually wasn't
wrong on the national election.

00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:21.270
It showed Hillary Clinton
winning by a few points

00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:25.800
and she did win the popular
vote by almost two points.

00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:29.480
She did not of course
win key electoral states

00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:31.880
like Michigan and Wisconsin.

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:35.080
And at least in one of those
states, I think it as Wisconsin,

00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:37.650
she didn't even set
foot in the entire time.

00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:41.600
And the polling on some
of those states was off.

00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:46.070
But it was also because
there wasn't very much of it.

00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:47.370
&gt;&gt; David Barker: Right.

00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:49.270
&gt;&gt; Sara Fagen: So there was
nothing recent, you know?

00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:54.720
And the Trump campaign was just
very sophisticated in playing

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:58.850
in those states and playing
quite quietly until the very end

00:54:58.850 --> 00:55:02.110
when they played quite
publicly and won them.

00:55:02.110 --> 00:55:05.290
And they played the
electoral college very well.

00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:06.670
There is a problem with polling:

00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:11.210
it tends to be more accurate
nationally and harder to predict

00:55:11.210 --> 00:55:14.260
in states because
of the sample size.

00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:18.400
It's increasingly difficult
to get people on a landline.

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:21.810
And fundamentally polling still
works if it's done properly.

00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:25.820
And if it's a mix of sort
of internet, landline

00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:27.840
and increasingly cell
phone technology --

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:31.400
and what happens and why a
lot of news polls are off is

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.700
because -- not all of them.

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:34.000
Some of them are
still quite good.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.960
Some of them are really off,
particularly the auto dials --

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.260
is they don't do cell phones,

00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:42.070
or they don't do a
big enough percentage

00:55:42.070 --> 00:55:43.370
of people with cell phones.

00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:45.540
Because it's really
expensive to call cell phones

00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:50.430
because the laws prevent
research companies --

00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:52.000
if you're calling
someone on a cell phone,

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.680
you have to manually dial it.

00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:56.780
You can't use an auto
dialer for cell phones.

00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:58.650
So it dramatically
raises the cost.

00:55:58.650 --> 00:56:01.510
And as a result of it, they
skimp on the cell phones

00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:03.530
and they get too
high a proportion

00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:07.520
of whatever population,
whether it's poor or older

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:12.280
or some combination, that
only has a landline telephone.

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:13.580
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Of
course Sara's right

00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:16.840
that the polls reflected Hillary
winning the popular vote,

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:20.510
but the better data scientists
did say Trump could win.

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:21.810
&gt;&gt; David Barker: Right.

00:56:21.810 --> 00:56:23.940
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: It's like
with anything on the internet.

00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:26.470
You're bombarded
with information.

00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:27.870
Are you getting the
better information?

00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:31.710
Can you separate
wheat from chaff?

00:56:31.710 --> 00:56:33.730
&gt;&gt; David Barker: Haskell,
you're the moderator.

00:56:33.730 --> 00:56:35.030
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Yeah.

00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:36.330
&gt;&gt; David Barker: I want to
remind you you're the moderator.

00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:37.630
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: You were
about to say that too?

00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:39.510
[ Laughter ]

00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:41.540
&gt;&gt; David Barker: I did
want to quickly just say

00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:46.560
that not only were the
data scientists as opposed

00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:48.140
to the pollsters or the pundits,

00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:51.220
the real data scientists
did give Trump about a one

00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:53.290
in three chance of winning.

00:56:53.290 --> 00:56:55.360
Which you know, if you
flip a bunch of coins,

00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:58.630
one in three happens
quite a bit, right?

00:56:58.630 --> 00:57:01.130
And so that was the deal there.

00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:03.990
And also I will say that part
of the reason why he was able

00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:07.220
to win unexpectedly in
Wisconsin, Pennsylvania

00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:11.540
and Michigan was because of the
microtargeting done as a result

00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:13.910
of some of the data
science that was done

00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:16.220
by that campaign
in those states.

00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:18.800
The final thing I'll say about
the polling though is that part

00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:22.730
of the reason why it's hard
to get good polls in states is

00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:25.200
that in addition to it
being really expensive

00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:29.430
to call cell phones, hardly
anybody has an area code

00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:32.390
that is associated with where
they actually live, right?

00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:33.690
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: Yeah.

00:57:33.690 --> 00:57:34.990
&gt;&gt; David Barker: And
so that's like fine

00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:36.290
for a national poll, right?

00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:37.590
You think you're calling
somebody in Wisconsin.

00:57:37.590 --> 00:57:38.890
In reality you're
calling somebody

00:57:38.890 --> 00:57:40.810
in California and all that.

00:57:40.810 --> 00:57:42.110
So anyway.

00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:43.780
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: That gentleman
right there, I think -- yeah.

00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:46.480
Why don't you get the
microphone for a second?

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:49.420
&gt;&gt; I was interested in
some of your thoughts

00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:52.130
about these new approaches
to elections.

00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:56.430
I had read about this approach
called right choice voting.

00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:59.500
And I was interested in what
you all think about that.

00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:02.060
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Elaine, do
you know anything about that?

00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:03.360
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: You know,

00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:04.970
I think right choice
voting is very interesting.

00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:08.660
I think when I first heard
about it back in the Dark Ages,

00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:10.160
it was before computers.

00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:11.870
So you know, it was kind

00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:15.510
of mind-boggling how you
would get an accurate count.

00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:20.180
These days you really could
use right choice voting.

00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:25.330
It think it's very interesting
as a possibility in primaries.

00:58:25.330 --> 00:58:26.690
&gt;&gt; David Barker: Yeah.

00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:28.550
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: Where you
tend not to have a binary,

00:58:28.550 --> 00:58:32.010
and the differences between
the candidates are not all

00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:33.420
that great.

00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:37.150
But other than the state of
Maine which just tried it,

00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:39.530
nobody else seems
very interested in it.

00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:42.720
And when I talked to members
of Congress or I talked

00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:44.870
to elected officials about
it, they sort of stare

00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:46.930
at you blankly like, "Huh?"

00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:50.860
So I think the uncertainty
about it -- it's like anything.

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:54.150
When you change electoral
systems, it's the incumbents

00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:55.510
who have to change it.

00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:57.660
And it's the incumbents
who are most fearful of it

00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:01.290
because after all they
won in the old system.

00:59:01.290 --> 00:59:02.950
So it's a good idea.

00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:04.980
I mean, it's not
at all a bad idea.

00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:08.120
Its just one that I don't
see happening very quickly.

00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:09.710
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: We're going
to one more question over here

00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:11.620
and then we'll have an
opportunity for people

00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:14.480
to meet the panel
during the reception.

00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:15.780
Does Kathy have a question?

00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:17.850
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for
a very interesting panel.

00:59:17.850 --> 00:59:22.720
I have one question that goes
back to the pig in the python.

00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:26.280
The millennial group, I
didn't realize it was so big

00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:27.870
as you just said it is.

00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:30.830
How likely is that group,
based on your knowledge

00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:34.280
and experience, to shift
its political affiliations

00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:37.360
as they move through
the age cycle?

00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:39.290
Are they going to go from
left to right to left,

00:59:39.290 --> 00:59:41.570
or just stay wherever they are?

00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:42.960
Just wondering what
you think about that.

00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:44.690
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Sara's
eager to address that.

00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:45.990
It's a great question.

00:59:45.990 --> 00:59:47.290
&gt;&gt; Sara Fagen: It
is a great question

00:59:47.290 --> 00:59:48.590
and I actually considered
jumping in

00:59:48.590 --> 00:59:53.000
and saying historically,
as young people get older

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.710
and buy homes and pay
taxes and have you know,

00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:59.580
other more complex
responsibilities in life,

00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:01.690
they have tended to
become conservative.

01:00:01.690 --> 01:00:07.110
Now you know, I think society
is changing quite dramatically

01:00:07.110 --> 01:00:10.310
and quite rapidly, so I don't
think that's guaranteed.

01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:12.350
And certainly some members

01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:18.300
of young generations would
always stay more liberal

01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:21.310
or more conservative based
on how they were raised.

01:00:21.310 --> 01:00:24.080
But you know, that's a
generation that's not

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.210
particularly interested
in owning things.

01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:30.520
They're very comfortable
in a sharing economy.

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.640
Elaine mentioned, I would
agree, that they don't

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.390
like Republicans or Democrats.

01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:38.070
They don't particularly assign
themselves to any label.

01:00:38.070 --> 01:00:41.560
I think what's probably more
likely than them becoming --

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:43.960
you know, some of them will move

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:46.940
around over time
and based on issues.

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:49.430
But I think what's more likely
politically is that we're going

01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:51.730
to see more parties
in this country.

01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:54.680
And we're certainly going to
see independent candidates

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:56.300
and more meaningful
independent candidates.

01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:58.420
It's very difficult
to get on the ballot

01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:00.780
in a presidential
race for example.

01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:03.720
But social media to a
degree makes that easier

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:05.620
and makes it easier
for people to organize.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:09.110
And I think over
time, you're likely

01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:13.060
to see a more diverse
political system

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:18.860
than necessarily a younger voter
saying, "Okay, I was a liberal

01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:24.340
in my 20s and 30s and now I'm a
conservative in my 40s and 50s."

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:26.270
You know, I don't
think in 20 years

01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:30.370
when those folks are older
we'll be in the same paradigm.

01:01:30.370 --> 01:01:32.320
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: I think we have
a topic for a whole other panel.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.620
&gt;&gt; Sara Fagen: Yeah.

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:34.920
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: Yeah, right,
a topic for a whole other panel.

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.400
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: David
has a word to say on that.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.790
&gt;&gt; David Barker: Yeah, so
one thing that I think,

01:01:37.790 --> 01:01:40.150
aside from party
identification and whether

01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:42.950
or not people switch,
I think that one thing

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:50.860
that is unlikely is that these
millennials will become more

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:53.050
culturally conservative
over time.

01:01:53.050 --> 01:01:56.280
I think it may be the case that
as they get older and own things

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:58.030
and whatever, that
they may become more

01:01:58.030 --> 01:01:59.750
economically conservative.

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:03.940
I think that it's unlikely that
they are going to become --

01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:06.340
well, some of them may
become more religious,

01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:08.940
but the general trend
towards secularization

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:12.690
in society is not
likely to reverse itself.

01:02:12.690 --> 01:02:18.420
The trend toward more tolerance
toward sexual minorities is not

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:19.940
likely to reverse itself.

01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:24.030
The trend toward greater
tolerance toward racial

01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:27.430
and ethnic diversity is not
likely to reverse itself.

01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:30.800
And so what I expect to
see is that the culture war

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:33.670
that we've been living in
for the past 40 or 50 years

01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:39.120
in another 20 years may
actually finally culminate.

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:43.040
And the big things that we fight
about politically may go back

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:47.470
to what they were in the
'40s, '50s and '60s which was

01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:51.380
about like the free market
versus the welfare state.

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:55.320
I would anticipate in 2050
if we had a panel like this,

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:57.810
those will be the things that
people are fighting about,

01:02:57.810 --> 01:03:00.920
and not race, not
gender, not religion

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:04.070
like we have been
for the past 40.

01:03:04.070 --> 01:03:07.920
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: Let me
give a contrary view, okay?

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:13.600
People who cast their first vote
in 1932 for Franklin Roosevelt,

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:18.050
that generation by and
large stayed Democratic

01:03:18.050 --> 01:03:19.790
until they died.

01:03:19.790 --> 01:03:21.090
&gt;&gt; DV: Yeah.

01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:22.390
&gt;&gt; Elaine Kamarck: Okay?

01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:24.290
There is an imprinting
question that goes on.

01:03:24.290 --> 01:03:26.540
And we know this
from political --

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:29.600
there's a whole study of this
called political sociology,

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:30.900
okay?

01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:32.570
We know that one of the things

01:03:32.570 --> 01:03:37.210
about the maligned gen X-ers is
their political experience was

01:03:37.210 --> 01:03:38.770
Ronald Reagan.

01:03:38.770 --> 01:03:40.670
They tend to be Republicans.

01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:44.730
So there is something about
whether or not you come

01:03:44.730 --> 01:03:51.280
into politics in with some
sort of dramatic election.

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:54.390
Certainly, '32 was a
big, dramatic election.

01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:58.030
2008 because of the first
African American president was a

01:03:58.030 --> 01:03:59.720
dramatic election.

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:01.740
So there is some evidence

01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:07.340
that generations actually take
their partisanship with them,

01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:10.050
even though they change and
they get more conservative

01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:12.600
on economic questions
or cultural questions.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:13.940
That there's an imprinting.

01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:17.860
And I would send you
to a big literature

01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:20.860
on political sociology
and cohort analysis

01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:23.750
which shows this for
American history.

01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:25.180
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: I can't
help but point out the irony

01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:28.330
that Reagan himself
voted for FDR.

01:04:28.330 --> 01:04:30.650

01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:31.950
Four times.

01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:33.250
Four times, actually.

01:04:33.250 --> 01:04:36.010
Thank you all very much, and
American University for help.
