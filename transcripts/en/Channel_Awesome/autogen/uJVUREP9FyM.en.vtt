00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 align:start position:0%
reason I like that is because I think a
 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.050 align:start position:0%
reason I like that is because I think a

course<00:07:01.220><c> he's</c><00:07:01.580><c> faking</c><00:07:01.970><c> it</c><00:07:02.030><c> anyway</c><00:07:02.479><c> yeah</c><00:07:03.220><c> but</c>

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:04.510 align:start position:0%
course he's faking it anyway yeah but
 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
course he's faking it anyway yeah but
yeah<00:07:05.510><c> at</c><00:07:05.630><c> the</c><00:07:05.750><c> same</c><00:07:05.780><c> time</c><00:07:06.139><c> I'm</c><00:07:06.229><c> like</c><00:07:06.320><c> oh</c><00:07:06.470><c> I</c><00:07:06.500><c> know</c>

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:06.650 align:start position:0%
yeah at the same time I'm like oh I know
 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.260 align:start position:0%
yeah at the same time I'm like oh I know
we<00:07:06.830><c> can</c><00:07:06.979><c> go</c><00:07:07.100><c> for</c><00:07:07.250><c> this</c><00:07:07.310><c> but</c><00:07:07.370><c> I</c><00:07:07.610><c> didn't</c><00:07:07.940><c> see</c><00:07:08.090><c> that</c>

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.270 align:start position:0%
we can go for this but I didn't see that
 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.210 align:start position:0%
we can go for this but I didn't see that
he<00:07:08.449><c> was</c><00:07:08.600><c> going</c><00:07:08.870><c> to</c><00:07:09.020><c> use</c><00:07:09.169><c> that</c><00:07:09.380><c> like</c><00:07:09.680><c> he</c><00:07:10.070><c> was</c>

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:10.220 align:start position:0%
he was going to use that like he was
 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
he was going to use that like he was
faking<00:07:10.550><c> it</c><00:07:10.610><c> the</c><00:07:10.699><c> whole</c><00:07:10.729><c> time</c><00:07:11.030><c> I</c><00:07:11.120><c> didn't</c><00:07:12.370><c> draw</c>

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.370 align:start position:0%
faking it the whole time I didn't draw
 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
faking it the whole time I didn't draw
that<00:07:13.490><c> conclusion</c><00:07:13.699><c> so</c><00:07:14.090><c> I</c><00:07:14.360><c> like</c><00:07:14.600><c> that</c><00:07:14.630><c> I</c><00:07:14.840><c> like</c>

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.050 align:start position:0%
that conclusion so I like that I like
 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.300 align:start position:0%
that conclusion so I like that I like
that<00:07:15.080><c> they</c><00:07:15.350><c> do</c><00:07:15.500><c> always</c><00:07:15.680><c> sort</c><00:07:15.979><c> of</c><00:07:16.010><c> keep</c><00:07:16.190><c> you</c>

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:16.310 align:start position:0%
that they do always sort of keep you
 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
that they do always sort of keep you
guessing<00:07:16.430><c> like</c><00:07:16.760><c> that</c><00:07:16.910><c> don't</c><00:07:17.060><c> exactly</c><00:07:17.600><c> know</c>

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:17.930 align:start position:0%
guessing like that don't exactly know
 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:18.790 align:start position:0%
guessing like that don't exactly know
where<00:07:18.110><c> they're</c><00:07:18.260><c> gonna</c><00:07:18.320><c> go</c>

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
where they're gonna go
 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.420 align:start position:0%
where they're gonna go
go<00:07:19.340><c> with</c><00:07:19.520><c> it</c><00:07:20.050><c> it</c><00:07:21.050><c> was</c><00:07:21.199><c> fun</c><00:07:21.320><c> I</c><00:07:21.560><c> liked</c><00:07:21.800><c> it</c><00:07:21.949><c> yeah</c>

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:22.430 align:start position:0%
go with it it was fun I liked it yeah
 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.029 align:start position:0%
go with it it was fun I liked it yeah
that<00:07:22.810><c> actually</c><00:07:23.810><c> adds</c><00:07:24.110><c> a</c><00:07:24.199><c> whole</c><00:07:24.350><c> new</c><00:07:24.530><c> level</c><00:07:24.560><c> to</c>

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
that actually adds a whole new level to

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:20.870 align:start position:0%
I think a point where he was starting to
 

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
I think a point where he was starting to
dig<00:10:21.079><c> up</c><00:10:21.260><c> at</c><00:10:21.410><c> the</c><00:10:21.529><c> ML</c><00:10:21.860><c> sort</c><00:10:22.070><c> of</c><00:10:22.190><c> like</c><00:10:22.390><c> yeah</c><00:10:23.390><c> okay</c>

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:23.690 align:start position:0%
dig up at the ML sort of like yeah okay
