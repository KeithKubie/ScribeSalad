00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.290
In the last video,
we thought about how

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.951
we would allocate our $5 between
chocolate bars and fruit.

00:00:05.951 --> 00:00:07.950
And the way we did it,
and it was very rational,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.375
we thought about how much bang
would we get for each buck.

00:00:10.375 --> 00:00:12.375
And we saw, look, starting
off, our first dollar

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:14.919
we got a lot of bang
for our buck-- and this

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:17.210
is really just another way
of saying bang for the buck,

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.950
marginal utility per price.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.072
So we got a lot of utility
for price starting off

00:00:22.072 --> 00:00:23.280
for that first chocolate bar.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.988
A little less for the
next chocolate bar,

00:00:24.988 --> 00:00:28.060
but still more than we would
get for a pound of fruit.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.060
Then more for the
next chocolate bar,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.450
and only then did
we start buying

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.590
some fruit, buying
some pounds of fruit.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.427
What do I do in this
video is generalize it.

00:00:39.427 --> 00:00:41.510
I want to think about maybe
a more continuous case

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.454
where we can buy very, very
small increments of each

00:00:44.454 --> 00:00:45.120
of the products.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.259
It doesn't have to be in
chunks, like chocolate bars.

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:49.800
And what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.260
to plot the marginal utility
per price, which is really

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.881
bang for your buck,
on the vertical axis.

00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:56.380
So

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.220
This right over
here on this axis.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.070
Let's say this is the
marginal utility per price.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.239
And let's say it also
goes from 0 to 100.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.870
So that would be 50.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.260
And the numbers actually
don't matter so much here.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.680
And then this will
be dollar spent.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.140
So dollars spent, so your buck.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.150
So this is bang for your buck
and then this is your buck.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.460
So this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.590
Now we're going to do
arbitrary products.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.060
So let's say one product
looks something like this.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.902
And once again, you
have diminishing utility

00:01:33.902 --> 00:01:35.610
as you get more and
more of that product.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.060
In the case of fruit,
the more pounds of fruit

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.566
you get the more tired
you get of fruit.

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:41.940
The less fruit
you need for that,

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.430
or the less you want fruit for
that next incremental pound.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.520
So let's-- but it
could be anything.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.670
This is true of most things.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.850
So this is product A,
could be a service as well.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.130
So product A, let me
write it this way.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:02.620
So this is the marginal
utility for A per price of A.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.250
And let me get another
product right over here.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.180
So let's say my other product
looks something like this.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:15.280
So this is my marginal utility
for product B per price of B.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.690
So it's really saying
bang for the buck.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.060
So just to start
off-- and I won't even

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.720
constrain how much
money we have.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.600
I just want to think about
how we would spend that money.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.850
So if I were to spend,
if I had a penny,

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.750
where would I spend a penny.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.140
And I'm assuming I can buy these
in super small chunks, as small

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.110
as maybe the penny or even
maybe fractions of penny.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.931
So if I just had
a penny, and I had

00:02:37.931 --> 00:02:39.680
to think about where
am I getting the best

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.070
bang for my buck for that
penny, I'm clearly getting it

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.235
with product A. So I would
spend that penny on product A

00:02:45.235 --> 00:02:47.680
and I would get this much
bang for my buck, which

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.670
would be this entire
part right over here.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.880
Let me color it in.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.430
So my first-- I'll
spend it right on A.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.680
Let me do it in a color
that's more likely to be seen,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.520
so I'll do it in
this blue color.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.591
So I'll spend it on
A. My first, in fact,

00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:04.090
where would I spend
my first dollar?

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.339
Well, the whole first dollar
I'm getting a better bang

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:09.945
for my buck on A. So my first
dollar I will spend on A.

00:03:09.945 --> 00:03:12.320
And the total utility
I will get is actually

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.070
going to be the area
under this curve.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.500
It's going to be
this whole area.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.610
It's going to be dollars times
marginal utility with price.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.910
That would give you, obviously,
the area of this rectangle

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.020
right over here.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.400
The reason why it wouldn't
be the area of this larger

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.608
rectangle, it would just be
the area under the curve,

00:03:27.608 --> 00:03:32.410
is you're not getting 100
marginal utility per price

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.650
for the entire dollar.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.030
It's going down the entire time.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.040
And so your actual
total marginal utility

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.220
is actually just
the area under this.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.800
And when you take
calculus you'll

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.506
get a better
appreciation for that.

00:03:43.506 --> 00:03:45.380
But let's just think
about, once again, where

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.600
our dollar is going to be spent.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.105
So actually even if
we've spent already $1,

00:03:51.105 --> 00:03:53.480
our next penny we would still
want to spend on product A,

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.880
because we're still getting
more bang for the buck.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.340
We're still getting more
bang for the buck all the way

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.290
until right around there.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.840
Now something
interesting is happening.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.400
So we've spent about $2.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.152
We've spend our first
$2 all on product A

00:04:07.152 --> 00:04:08.860
because we're getting
more bang for buck,

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.660
even though that bang was
diminishing every penny or even

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.220
every fraction of a
penny that we spent.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.019
But now where will we
spend our next penny?

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.630
Well, we could spend
it on product A again.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.850
But look, we can get about the
same marginal utility spending

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.850
it on product B. So we
could jump right over there,

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.840
spend it on product B. Now where
could we spend our next dollar?

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.680
Well, we get about the
same marginal utility

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.930
whether we spend it on a
little bit more of product B,

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.722
or a little bit more of product
A. So we could do either.

00:04:37.722 --> 00:04:39.680
If we spent a little bit
too much on product A,

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.060
then we could have gotten
more marginal utility spending

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.540
on product B. So
what we would do

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.550
is, once we've gotten to this
threshold right about here,

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.070
we actually are going to spend
every incremental fraction

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.445
of a penny-- we're
actually going

00:04:53.445 --> 00:04:55.386
to want to split between
product A and product

00:04:55.386 --> 00:04:57.760
B. If we spend too much on
one and we go down this curve,

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.522
we could have gotten higher
utility spending on this one.

00:05:01.522 --> 00:05:02.980
If we spend too
much on this one we

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.580
could get higher
utility spending

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.350
on this one right over here.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.710
So there's a very
interesting phenomenon here.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.590
Assuming that we
eventually spent enough

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.320
that we buy some of
both, obviously we

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.220
started just buying
product A because it

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.640
had higher utility, at least,
for those first few dollars--

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.890
but assuming that we end up
buying some mix of the two,

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.340
which we do end up spending
if we spend more than $2--

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.940
there's an interesting thing.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:32.740
The marginal utility for B, or
the marginal utility for price

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.930
for B that I spent on
that last little increment

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.510
is going to be the same as
the marginal utility per price

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.030
for that last increment of
A. So if this was, if B was,

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.880
I don't know, if it was fruit
and let's say A was chocolate

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.210
but we could buy them in
very, very small increments--

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.160
we're saying for that last
fraction of a pound of fruit

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.020
you're getting the same
marginal utility per price

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.390
as you're getting for that
last fraction of a bar

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.300
or fraction of a
pound of chocolate.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.090
So there's a general
principle over here.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.460
And it really just comes from
this very straightforward thing

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.510
that as soon as you can
get better marginal utility

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.350
on the other one, you
start spending there.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.766
But then they start
to look equal.

00:06:12.766 --> 00:06:15.480
And you would keep dividing
your money between the two.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.170
And so the general
principle, if you're

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.550
allocating money
between two goods,

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.609
for that last increment--
not across the board,

00:06:21.609 --> 00:06:23.900
just that last increment--
that's why the word marginal

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.460
is so important.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.380
For that last ounce of
chocolate versus that

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:32.420
very last ounce of fruit,
the marginal utility

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.000
for price for that last
increment of one good

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.790
will be the same as
the marginal utility

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.280
per price of the second good.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.490
Now I really want to
emphasize what this is saying.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.420
This is not saying that the
marginal utility for price

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.120
of the two goods are the same.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.556
And not even that one is
better than the other.

00:06:53.556 --> 00:06:55.180
This is just saying
as you spend money,

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.450
and let's say you spend
enough money to buy both,

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.120
at some point you're going
to get to a threshold

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.090
where you're neutral
between the two, where

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.240
the marginal
utility for price is

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.762
the same for an incremental of
B versus an incremental of A.

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:12.550
And at that point you're
juts going to keep switching

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.744
between the two products.

00:07:13.744 --> 00:07:15.410
Because obviously,
if you focus too much

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.654
on this right over here--
let's say you focus,

00:07:17.654 --> 00:07:19.070
let's say at that
point you switch

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:23.070
and you just start buying
a bunch of product B

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.832
right over here.

00:07:23.832 --> 00:07:25.040
Well, that didn't make sense.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.490
Because you were
buying product B

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.948
when you could have
actually gotten

00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:30.074
higher marginal utility
buying some of product A.

00:07:30.074 --> 00:07:31.990
And that's the same
reason why you didn't just

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.520
keep going down A, because
you could have gotten

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.530
higher marginal
utility over here.

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.070
This is closer to, I don't
know, 75 while you're only

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.140
getting 70 right over here.
