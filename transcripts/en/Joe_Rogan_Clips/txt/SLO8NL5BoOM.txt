Speaker 1:          00:01          So I love the fact that you're so open with these ideas too that you're, you bring them to people and get their take on it and then incorporate their take. Is this something you've always done because of the workshopping? Is it just that this willingness to be open with your ideas and express them?

Speaker 2:          00:20          Yeah, really, you know, workshop was that the crucial thing, having that social expectation that you're going to bring work every week and it was also kind of a party, a reward for having brought the work. And it was also a way of testing the work so that you knew whether it was working. You know, you weren't constantly sort of questioning yourself. A workshop just provides so many really important ways of uh, keeping, right, keeping you writing now and you've done this always seems like you've done this most of your career. I have, and this is not the first workshop I've been bumped out of. The first workshop I was in was a very, a lot of very nice ladies and I was probably 28 and I had written a scene in which, uh, a man, a young man has done up an inflatable sex doll. So it looks exactly like the woman he's obsessed with.

Speaker 2:          01:15          And during the, the seduction of this sex doll, he accidentally snags the back of it with the zipper of its dress. And he realizes during the fornication that it is gradually losing air. So he's got to copulate faster and faster to try to achieve orgasm before this thing completely goes flat. And at the end of the scene, he standing there with this completely deflated sex doll hanging off of his erection like this, the surrender flag. And of course, his mother walks into the room. And after I wrote that scene, the leader of the workshop, I was in my first workshop, she took me aside afterwards and she said, uh, the other writers in the workshop no longer feel safe around you. She really did. She, she said, you've written something that really frightens them, uh, and they would like you to, uh, politely, uh, leave the workshop and not come back.

Speaker 2:          02:18          Wow. And so that's when I started with, uh, Tom Spann Bowers workshop in which almost anything went. Um, and so this kind of periodic implosion of the workshop, uh, is, is kind of part of the process? Well, it seems only twice right or more and more times than that. You know, it's been twice, uh, but in the past catastrophic twice catastrophic. Yeah. Yeah. But a few other flat tires along the way. Uh, periodically we've kind of had to, uh, pretend that we were disbanding in order to get rid of a member who was, uh, I had just more trouble than they were worth. How many people were in this sport chops? Boy, lately it's been last, it was about eight, but we've been up to like 16, 17. And now when I teach, I typically have about 25 people.

Speaker 1:          03:06          What does it feel, I mean, to be in a workshop for that long and then have such a, a disagreement and to disband like that or to have you forced out, what does that feel like? That's gotta suck.

Speaker 2:          03:20          No, you know, I think in a way we all need a kind of a respite from each other. We all had kind of knew what to expect from one another and I think we were all less, less of a resource for one another. Uh, you know, there's always a chance we'll come back together. So, uh, so it's not a big tragedy. So there's a chance that they might, so did they kick you out or did they just disband? I left the workshop and I understood that it disbanded wreck after that.

Speaker 1:          03:48          The seams. I just don't understand how someone who is a creative writer can't understand the, the, not just the necessity, like the need to delve into the darker possibilities of, of human reality that this, the story she wrote about her grandfather in the bird is a perfect example that, I mean, although very few people experience that in their life, we all can appreciate that these are possible scenarios.

Speaker 2:          04:19          And I think you know, it, it really comes down to what people, uh, what purpose reading and writing serves in people's lives. And most people, they want reading to be a comforting activity. They want to be able to read a book and fall asleep knowing the detective will apprehend the killer by the end of the book. That things will end very well in a way they want to be bored or lulled by the book. Uh, not so many people really want to be kind of confronted by books,

Speaker 1:          04:47          but some people do. Right? I mean, isn't it, it's kind of like a pretty much all forms of art, whether it's music or movies. I mean, there's superhero movies and then there's movies like no country for old men or the bad guy gets away at the end and you leave the movie theater and you're like, what the fuck? You know? But those, those are all satisfying in different ways to different people. And isn't that sort of the point of creative expression is that you're getting surprised, you're getting taken down a row that is, here's the world through this person's eyes and they create this world. If you put limitations on that, you're going to, yeah, you're going to eliminate some disturbing aspects that might bother some people, but you're also gonna eliminate some magical moments that might just care. It might literally like change the way you view people,

Speaker 2:          05:38          you know? And part of it has to do with the nature of, you know, movies, movies are going to always kind of attract, uh, a more dynamic audience. Movies carry their own authority through motion, uh, and books are going to be a slower medium that's harder to consume. And so maybe books are always going to, at this point, be seen as kind of a sedative as a kind of thing that loves you and comforts you and puts you to sleep. But by who? By some people, right? I mean, I mean, maybe there's a market for those kinds of books, but there's also a market for your books. There's a, there's, there's clearly a market for people that they want to tap into those more disturbing aspects of consciousness and of reality. And that market is moving to video games and that market is moving to edgier films.

Speaker 2:          06:27          There's just other forms of storytelling that are serving that market better wheelie. Oh yeah. Better than books. Oh yeah. But why is that? Is that because of the censorship or is because artists aren't exploring those ideas as much anymore? You know, and part of it is because books are harder to consume. Books take an enormous amount of a commitment of time and effort to read a book where everything else is 30 minutes to two hours and to write a book as well. It's such a solitary discipline to sit alone with your computer. No, it is not, not for me. And I, I hate that model. You know, I want to be in the mermaid Tavern talking about my ideas with my compatriots and getting their take on them and finding out how it resonates with everything else in people's lives. What's the mermaid Tavern? Oh, is the, the reference to where uh,

Speaker 3:          07:24          Mmm,

Speaker 2:          07:27          not Coleridge. All the famous writers of Shakespeare's time, ah, basically hung out at, uh, it was like the white horse Tavern in New York, but the mermaid Tavern was in London during that time. Um, and uh, Boswell, uh, all the writers hung out there and exchange ideas and entertained one another. Hmm. And so, yeah, I want writing to be my social outlet, but you have to write it by yourself, right? I mean, when you're, when you're sitting alone actually putting your fingers on the keyboards. No, you do it. That part in airplanes. Really? Yeah. I write notebooks and notebooks and notebooks in public and then when I'm trapped in some unbearable place, like an airplane or an airport, then I do that horrible part of keyboarding. Yeah. So that's the only time you actually write, right? The keyboarding is not writing. You remember the Truman Capote quote about uh, on the road Jack Kerouac Capote.

Speaker 2:          08:29          He said that's not writing. That's typing. And so the, the part on the airplane or in the airport where you have the laptop open, that's not writing really. That's typing. This is writing. Writing to you is physical pen to paper. Ah, sloppy everything. Yeah. Why is that? Why is it different? Because it's written down in the moment that you hear it and that is not set in new times. Roman 12 points so that it looks so finished. It looks like a finished book and it's much harder to monkey with it. Once you see it on that screen and in word, ah, it looks like a book, it's much harder to edit it. But when it's scrawled on the page in front of you, you can draw arrows, you can scribble it out, you can, you can do whatever you want to. It is, it's much less precious.

Speaker 2:          09:19          Is this something that you voted? There's the approach I've always taken. Did you learn this approach or is it something that just sort of made sense to you? This is how old I am. It used to be, I grew up in the age of ah, typewriters when even typewriters were kind of precious because you would have to buy ribbons for them. And those ribbons were really expensive and so something had to be written out completely long hand had to be perfect longhand before you could risk wasting a typewriter ribbon to type it out. Wow. So you just developed it this way and just stuck with it even in the age of computers? Well, and also because writing is something I do in the moment. Somebody says something insightful, something really bright, something phrased just wrong so that it's suddenly really fresh and I want to be able to write it down in that moment so that when I do have to go to the boring part with a keyboard, I have got so much wonderful fresh stuff that it makes a keyboarding part fun because it allows me to, to sort of archive and to curate, preserve these fantastically bright things that were said by so many different people.

Speaker 2:          10:37          And you don't, do you ever record, do you ever record yourself? Like record ideas then listen to them transcribe them? Oh God, no, no. I hate that. That was a big Hunter S Thompson thing who'd record a lot of his ideas and then transcribe them and write them out. You know, I kind of write word for word sentence for sentence. And so, uh, the transcription is just too much of an effort for me. Usually when I do interviews for magazines, um, I will record my interview subjects. And even then, uh, transcribing the interviews is so it's such a misery because people seldom talk in complete sentences and there's so many false starts and so many sentences that just don't go anywhere. Right. So no, talking into a recorder is just that a mess. And so this notebook that you have in front of you, this, this is a notebook for life or this a notebook for a particular project.

Speaker 2:          11:38          Like how do you, how do you organize it? This is a notebook where three pages are devoted to topics that I will talk to you about if we're desperate. And there are little notes in here about contacting my for different issues. Also, it's all universal. It's like for all sorts of things. It's through tasks that you need to do. And then as well as that parts of books you're writing and there's all these little notes that Jamie just gave me about microphones. Yeah. You're writing something about someone who's into recording equipment. Yeah. That's just a small part of it. But that's what she knows. Now

Speaker 1:          12:16          this, I want to go back to this workshop thing, like what was it? Just words, just the use of the word faggot or the N word. Was it just words that characters were utilizing in your story that was so disturbing to them?

Speaker 4:          12:31          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          12:33          it was words, but it was also some situations that I thought were, you know, I got that people were very upset by people would leave the room or people would, it would leave the room or what would weep, uh, would weep in just complete upset. Does part of you go, yeah, I got this and you see someone weeping some shit you wrote? No. Most of the time people would go to the bathroom and weep and I would find out about it much later. So, so did you get post satisfaction that way? No. It just made me feel like a bully and that really kind of another thing that it's a thin line, especially when I read a story like guts, am I entertaining people or am I bullying them? Am I beating them up? And I also bullying why in that way? Why do you describe it that way? Kind of charming them into a story that eventually will make them faint or eventually will, will make them wretch, but will upset them very deeply. Uh, and I, I feel a real reluctance about that.

Speaker 1:          13:38          Doesn't that sort of half that bridge have to be crossed though? If you're, if you're really going to explore every single possibility in a creative narrative, if you're, if you're really gonna write a book and just let your mind go wild, that has to be on the table, doesn't it?

Speaker 2:          13:54          It does. But I don't think it hurts to be aware, uh, so that you don't lapse into being a bully for the sake of being a bully. You know, I think anybody who's a really hard trainer, uh, kind of, you know, comes up against that. Am I a really good trainer or as part of me, a sadist? And you have to make sure that you don't become that sadist, but so you're not a monster. So there you go. Yeah. But I worry about it. Well, that's why you're not, but it's the

Speaker 1:          14:28          being able to explore those possibilities and being able to just delve into the deep recesses of your mind in the interest of creativity that seems to be of anybody's gonna appreciate that it's going to be creative writers,

Speaker 2:          14:43          but it's not my mind. I'm delving into the deep recesses, if I'm lucky, if I'm doing it right, of your mind of something that they'll like comedians, they'll say, Oh my gosh, that happened to you too. And a lot of times they're things that people have never ever talked about. Uh, I tell a classic anecdote after I had read the, uh, the guts story at an event, a woman came up and, uh, and she was a middle aged woman. She was about my age and she said, I really love that you read that story about how you, uh, got your anus prolapsed while masturbating in a swimming pool, which is not my story, but I'm the one that read it. So that's the one, I'm the one that they're picturing in this horrendous situation. And she says, since you can tell that story, I'm going to tell you a story.

Speaker 2:          15:45          And she said, how? When when she was seven years old, she was in second grade and she was in a little organization called the brownies, which is a precursor to the girl Scouts. You wear a Brown dress, little Brown hat, you get these little merit badges. And she said, one day I had a stomach ache and my mom kept me home from school and we had this heating pad, it must have been in the 1960s and this heating pad had this vibrating function and she put me face down on this heating pad on my stomach and I fell asleep. And while I was asleep, this vibrating warm heating pad must have slid down between my legs. She says, because I woke up with the most amazing feeling I feeling like I had never felt before. Oh my God, it felt so good. And so next time it was my turn to host the brownies.

Speaker 2:          16:45          I said, brownies, you've got to try this heating pad. And she says all the brownies, they turn the heating pad on the vibrating heating pad and they wrote it like a pony all afternoon. And she said it was like sex in the city for seven year old girls. They could not get enough of this heating pad and they were all riding this heating pad and they had a great time. And she said, and for the first time in my life I was the most popular girl in my class and I was the girl that all the girls wanted to play with. And for every brownie troop meeting it was at my house and I was the leader until the day that my mother came home from work early and she caught us with a heating pad and she sent the other brownies home and she whipped the cord out of the wall.

Speaker 2:          17:37          She just ripped it out of the socket and she started to beat me with it and she beat me with that cord and she beat me and she said, you fucking piece of shit. You dirty. What kind of a fucking whore am I raising you? Whore. And she beat me. And she beat me and she says, this woman who's my age now, she says, I have not had an orgasm since I was seven years old. And then she goes, but if you can tell that swimming pool story about how you got hurt jacking off underwater, she says, I can tell my heating pad story and I can tell that story until I can make it funny. And then maybe someday I can go back to my mom and I can say, do you remember that heating pad we used to have and it will be complete. Oh shit. As OCC CC, that's what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to create the opening for people to tell these stories that they, they never thought that they could tell because that's the way in which they're going to resolve these stories. And they're going to master these stories. We have these, um,

Speaker 1:          18:55          um, but day toilet things that have a little button on the wall, you press it, that shoots hot water up your ass. And, uh, my kids come over and, uh, they love these toilets. I have two daughters and my youngest, when she was seven, she would sit on the toilet and she was laughing and giggling and we didn't tell her there's anything wrong with it. So she was telling us how much she loves it, how much she loves the hot water when it shoots onto her. But she was like, it feels so good. And there was no shame in it. And there was this weird moment where I'm like, am I supposed to react to this? Am I supposed to say? Yeah, I know I like it too. Am I supposed to say, Hey, don't do that too much. Am I supposed to say don't tell anybody you like that you can like it, but don't tell anybody you like it.

Speaker 1:          19:50          Like what am I supposed to do? And uh, I didn't do anything. I just let her smile and she walked out of the bathroom laughing like it was great and it was, no, there was no issue. But it was this moment where I was like, wow, if I was a religious person or a suppressive person or some person with some sexual issues, this could be a real problem for this little girl. Instead I was like, okay, let's get out of the bathroom now. I guess you're done. Alrighty. And she has no idea that this was even like a moment of, you know, crisis in my mind or I was like, okay, how do I handle this? I'm in the bathroom with my seven year old daughter, just can't water shot up her ass and she's enjoying it. What do you talk about it on the radio? Is that how you deal with it? I enjoy it to share. I enjoy it too. We all do. We talk about these toilets. They're amazing. It's warm water

Speaker 2:          20:48          shoots in your, it's great. Feels awesome, but it's not supposed to feel awesome for like a little girl for some reason. Right. Is he? You tell that story and people will have so many versions of that story. Yeah. For me, I was in Germany. I went in the bathroom in the airport. I didn't know what this button was. So I pressed it. I looked down just in time to see this little plastic arms swing out. I didn't know what that thing was going to do. So I jumped off the head and this thing shot up with such force. It knocked a ceiling panel out of the ceiling and all this hot toilet water came sprinkling down on me. Uh, and I, that's the only time I've ever been around one of those. Well, we have one here. If you want to try it out, I don't know. Scares me. There's two of them. There's one in that bathroom, one in that one, one of that one bathroom you could lock. It's private. And see, that's my process is you can tell these stories and you kind of gathered the stories that people tell related to these stories. And you choose the ones that escalate the fastest, the escalate the best. And that gives you a gradual sort of, you've established the precedent and then something worse. Escalating Wars escalating, worse, escalating to the most atrocious or extreme version. And that's what brings a story to crisis.
