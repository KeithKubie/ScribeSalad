Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:07          I get a lot of questions about automation and delegation. What should you attempt to automate? What should you attempt to delegate? The technologies change. They adapt and evolve very quickly, so the tools in the toolkit will vary, but if you understand the principles, then you can choose the tools and you can certainly do homework to find the latest and greatest. I'll tell you how I look at this in the simplest form and one of the frameworks should sound familiar. If you've read the four hour work week 80 20 analysis, I will look at, and I do this in fact instead of for instance, New Year's resolutions, I do a review of my entire calendar previous year, week by week four. In this case, we just came into 2018 I'll look at 2017 and I will make a list. In fact, two lists of the the 20% of people in activities who produced 80% of my peak positive emotional states.

Speaker 2:          01:00          That's one list. The other side of the 20% of people or activities that produce 80% of my peak negative emotional states and it could be as simple as frustration and what this will help you to put together. It doesn't have to be at the end of the year is a to do list or I to focus list and then a not to do list. All right, and I tend to focus on these days at least taking disagreeable tasks or distracting tasks and first trying to automate them with software autopay, whatever. It might be a repeating schedule with a task rabbit for instance, for fiscal pickup or anything like that. Perhaps you do that through a ups store that scans and the emails or documents or earth class mail use technology whenever possible instead of a brute force with humans. Right. Even if they're humans involved in conjunction with the technology, so I'll try to automate as much as possible first.

Speaker 2:          01:57          Then if we're looking at delegating, which frequently includes technology, again, I'll try to remove the negative as much as possible, especially with repeating tasks that is the lowest hanging fruit. Then I will look at my primary projects for a given period of time. And if you have, let's just say four or five projects you could pursue or that are in play in your life, I will, I will narrow it down by asking which of these projects if moved ahead to the next milestone or if completed will make all of the rest either irrelevant or make all of the rest easier. And I've done this in fact recently in the last week, then we have a primary focus. This is the lead domino that will make everything else easier. I will throw as much at that as possible. So let's just say hypothetically we are trying to design a website. Uh, in some cases you want to throw money at a problem.

Speaker 2:          02:55          It doesn't have to necessarily be a lot of money, but throw money at a problem instead of time times nonrenewable. So I will say go to 99 designs and get 50 different submissions to brainstorm ideas for a potential website higher, perhaps two firms and have them all at the same time working on designs so that I can save time and move this project uh, ahead as quickly as possible with as few stops as possible. If for instance, I need a legal opinion. All right, well I'm going to look for a consensus. I'm going to look for gaps to be filled by different people. I will very frequently have two or three people work on that at the same time and then gather the responses again just to quickly review the not to do list based on the 20% of activities and people that tend to produce 80% of my negative emotional states.

Speaker 2:          03:43          And then the to do list based on looking at your list of projects and identifying the project that will make it the others either irrelevant unnecessarily to do or easier. That is the lead domino. And then I throw as much as possible at that, uh, which does not need to cost a lot of money. And certainly for me has not caused a lot of money, even when I was, I'm not gonna say in the poor house, but really, really scraping by and very little. You can still find ways to do it because there is talent with overseas domestically end. There are many different types of software that can help you to smooth out and simplify process to make a much more elegant. So those are a few of the ways that I think about automation and delegation. Good luck.
