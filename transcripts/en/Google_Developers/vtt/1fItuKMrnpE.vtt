[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.950
SILVANO LUCIANI:
Hi, everybody.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.700
Welcome to Google+ Developers
Live, Google+

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.580
Sign-In with iOS.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.910
I'm Silvano Luciani.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.440
I'm a developer programs
engineer for the Google+

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.740
platform, and not only my hair
is upside down, my shirt is

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.680
upside down, too.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.170
XIANGTIAN DAI: And I'm
Xiangtian Dai.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.030
And I'm a software engineer for
the Google+ iOS platform.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.680
SILVANO LUCIANI: So the
topic today is iOS.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.490
And as you might know,
at Google we

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.810
produce also iOS apps.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.520
Google Maps is a
clear example.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.100
Our own Google+ iOS apps is a
very cool and compelling app.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.140
Not only we produce amazing
apps, we also want you to

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.560
produce a compelling app.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.770
So we want to give you the tools
to be able to produce an

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.150
engaging experience
for your users.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.720
And that's why we have
the Google+ SDK.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.700
So what are we going to
show today, Xiangtian?

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.730
XIANGTIAN DAI: Today we're
going to show first the

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.470
Google+ Quickstart sample app
inside of Google+ SDK.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.050
We'll walk through with it.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.160
And the second, we're going to
create a new iOS project from

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.140
scratch that has the Google+
iOS Sign-In button.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.210
SILVANO LUCIANI: Wait.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.300
You're doing an app from
scratch, from empty to

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.460
Google+, and then working in
10 minutes, live, now?

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.050
XIANGTIAN DAI: Yes.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.010
And maybe even less than that.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.280
SILVANO LUCIANI: I really
want to see it.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.900
So let's start.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.920
First, if we want to get started
with iOS, just go to

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.270
our developer's documentation
site,

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.700
developers.google.com/plus.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.580
On the left, now, at the very
top, you can find the

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.250
Quickstart section.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.130
And the Quickstart is our set of
sample application that we

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.920
produce for many different
language that will get you

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.760
started with the platform
in less than 10 minutes.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.430
So we have Android, C#, Java,
JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.690
But today, we are interested
in iOS.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:48.580
So if we click on iOS, this is
when we can get started with

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.640
the set-up process for
the Quickstart.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.830
But before doing this,
Xiangtian, what is the SDK?

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.450
XIANGTIAN DAI: The Google+ iOS
SDK provides a library,

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.610
headers, and a sample app to
help you to integrate the

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.300
Google+ components with
your own app.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.700
So the SDK will make it easy
for you to create a more

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.040
engaging experience and to
connect with more users by

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.760
integrating social into your
app using this Google+

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.040
platform features.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.910
SILVANO LUCIANI: So inside the
SDK, we have the Quickstart,

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.230
which is the sample
application.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.330
Xiangtian, here, is the author
of this sample application.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.560
And what can you tell us
about the Quickstart

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.250
application for iOS?

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.300
XIANGTIAN DAI: Yes, the
Quickstart application is a

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.870
iOS Xcode project which lets
you get started with the

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.080
Google+ platform in less
than 10 minutes.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.620
The app demonstrates using the
Google+ Sign-In button using

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.870
the SDK method to list people
that user has circled and also

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.270
making request to other
Google+ APIs.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.390
The first requirement is to
install Xcode 4.5 or later.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.790
The second requirement is, of
course, to download SDK, but

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.360
we'll get to this later.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.570
First, we need to create our
API Console project.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.710
SILVANO LUCIANI: And let me
show you how to do it.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.450
The first thing, you need to
load the Google APIs Console,

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.540
which can be reached going--
you would see the Terms of

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.020
Services for the API.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.700
And it's really important that
you read the Terms of Service

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.720
carefully because they will tell
you what your app can and

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.200
cannot do when using
the Google+ API.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.780
So once this is done, let's
scroll up again.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.690
And now it's the time to
configure the API Access for

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:46.630
your application.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.760
So let's click on API Access.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.130
What we need is an
02 Client ID.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.820
And it's very easy
to create it.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.650
We have this big blue button.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.570
Let's just click it.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.420
Now we need to input
the branding

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.010
information for our project.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.130
And this information will be
shown to the users when they

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.890
see the consent dialogue.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.470
So it's very important that the
information that you input

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.110
here is meaningful
for the user.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.570
So use a product name that is
the name of your application.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.050
If you have a product logo, use
a compelling product logo

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.540
here because it will be
shown in the consent

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.250
dialogue to the user.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.500
And if you have a home page
URL for your application,

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.270
insert it here so that the user
can fetch more info about

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.080
your app at the time of giving
consent to your app for

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.250
accessing Google APIs
on their behalf.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.730
We can now click Next.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.000
And now we are actually
configuring the Client ID.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.580
The first thing that we need
to do is choose the

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:47.710
application type.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.750
And in our case it's an
installed application.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.560
And it's an iOS installed
application.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.050
After we chose iOS, we can see
some parameters, which are

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.020
specific to an iOS app.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.470
Xiangtian, can you explain
to us these parameters?

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.350
XIANGTIAN DAI: Of course.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.360
So there's basically
three fields.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.760
The first field is the Bundle
ID, which we need to enter the

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.750
bundle identifier from your
application's project summary.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.600
For our Quickstart sample
app, this is

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.310
com.google.GooglePlusSample.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.770
But, of course, you will
need to enter your own

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.110
app's Bundle ID there.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.910
Note that this Bundle ID will
also be used as a URL scheme

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.890
for browsers or other apps to
pass data back to your app,

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:40.030
which we'll discuss about
it a little bit later.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:44.720
Now, if your app is published
in the Apple's iTunes App

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.130
Store, enter your App Store
ID in the App Store

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.350
ID field down there.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:55.600
So you can determine the ID from
the ID part of your app

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.250
URL on the iTunes website.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:06.640
For example, it's like,
itunes.apple.com/us/app/id

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.390
some number.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.470
And that number we'll
put it there if you

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.160
have a published app.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.760
Now, there's also a flag for
deep linking, which we'll talk

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.230
about it another time.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.430
And note that you can always
come back and update the

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:24.350
settings for any of these
clients anytime later.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.690
SILVANO LUCIANI: Yeah, so now,
if I click Create Client ID,

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:27.910
this will create.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:31.560
And, as Xiangtian said, again
click on Edit Setting if I

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.900
want to bring the configuration
back and update

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.059
some of the settings.

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:38.750
Another thing to notice that if
you have other apps-- for

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.080
example, if you have a web
application, and it's the same

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.150
as this application--

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.660
you can create another
Client ID.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.310
And this will allow you to share
the branding info so

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.340
that you can have consistent
branding information that will

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:55.160
be shown to the users in the
consent dialogues across the

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.510
different platforms
that you support.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.750
So now that this is done, the
next step to get things

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.770
started with the Quickstart are
downloading the app, open

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:08.210
the Xcode project, and replace
the Client ID in the source

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:11.370
code with the Client ID that
you've just created.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.510
And Xiangtian, now, is
going to show it to

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:16.390
us, from his Xcode.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:17.290
XIANGTIAN DAI: All right.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:17.990
So let's see.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:22.800
I have already downloaded
Google+ iOS SDK 1.2.1, which

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.060
is later version,
on my desktop.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.650
I will open this app.

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.510
And it has a sample code
directory, which is a

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.280
Quickstart sample.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:42.120
And inside there,
we should see--

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.490
let me do it again, sorry.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:45.200
SILVANO LUCIANI: OK.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.260
XIANGTIAN DAI: Yes, the

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.370
GooglePlusSample.Xcode project.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:50.990
Let me open it in the Xcode.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.110
As Silvano just said, we need to
replace the Client ID with

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.620
what we have registered
in the API Console.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.265
For example, here, just copy
and paste the string value.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:14.970
All right.

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.520
And then, click Run.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.710
The sample is running, and let's
see how Sign-In works.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:31.320
So first, I tap in Google+
Sign-In It will take me to a

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.500
web browser.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.690
Note that if you have Google+
app installed, the user will

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:39.695
actually be directed to Google+
app, where user no

00:10:39.695 --> 00:10:44.650
longer need to type in their
username and password, so to

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:49.360
give you that Google+ Single
Sign-on experience.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.010
However, on this computer,
I don't

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:52.530
have Google+ app installed.

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.270
Now I'm directed to browser.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:57.900
And I need to type in my
username and password.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:07.970
After I tap Sign-In, I'm
shown a consent screen.

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:10.020
What can you tell about
this consent screen?

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.930
SILVANO LUCIANI: So this is the
consent screen where the

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:19.030
user can authenticate your
application to login and

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:22.660
access the Google+ API
on the user's behalf.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:27.410
We saw the title is the name
that you used configured in

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:28.740
the API Console.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:32.460
If we had a logo, we would
see the logo as well.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:37.370
And now Xiangtian is showing to
you what the app is asking

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:37.950
to the user.

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.710
So the very first line is
knowing name [INAUDIBLE], and

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.940
also a list of people you are
connected to on Google+.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.900
And that will be visible to
this application when they

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.660
used the people.list method.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.600
Now, the user can
edit this list.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.600
So they can choose to make all
their circle visible, or just

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.170
a selection of the circle.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:02.330
The most important thing to
know is that the API will

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:06.450
never expose information about
your circle to the app.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.750
The users will be returned
as a flat list.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:14.210
In the second part, the consent
dialogue is showing

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.770
which type of app
activities this

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:18.160
application wants to write.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.670
And, in this case, we have
the general app activity.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:24.050
We have purchases, check-in
information,

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:25.650
comments, and so on.

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:29.430
At this point, the user can
choose to which users these

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:31.350
app activities will
be visible.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.870
Once again, they can choose
all the circle.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:36.550
They can choose a subset
of their circles.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:41.260
But very importantly, as a
permanent option, they have

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.360
Only You, which means that the
activity will be private and

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.640
visible to the users only.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.320
XIANGTIAN DAI: Yes.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.280
OK, so let's say we accept.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.876
And this will get back to
third-party app, so in our

00:12:53.876 --> 00:12:55.960
case, Google+ Sample.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.700
And my Sign-In has
been succeeded.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:05.140
So that's for the Quickstart
sample app.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.645
SILVANO LUCIANI: Now,
that was easy.

00:13:06.645 --> 00:13:07.020
XIANGTIAN DAI: Yeah.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.700
SILVANO LUCIANI: Now, you
promised us something.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:09.870
XIANGTIAN DAI: Yes.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.670
SILVANO LUCIANI: So what
did you promise us?

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:12.480
I want to see it.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:18.000
XIANGTIAN DAI: I promised to
start a new app from scratch

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.960
that has a Google+ Sign-In
button just like in the

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.060
Quickstart sample app.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.310
And let's see how it works.

00:13:28.635 --> 00:13:32.200
First I install this,
just in case.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:32.770
All right.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.230
And then close Xcode window.

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:47.250
So I'm going to into the Xcode,
have this New, Project.

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:50.120
Now, I'm going to use a
single-view application just

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.580
for demonstration purpose.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.170
And I'm going to call it
GooglePlusSample as well.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:56.960
But this name doesn't
really matter.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.385
You're going to use
your own name.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:06.470
And use all default settings
and create on

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.800
the desktop as well.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.300
All right?

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:17.240
So the first step is to
integrate the library and

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.810
headers and open source files
from Google+ SDK, which we

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:23.090
have downloaded into desktop.

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:29.705
To do that, you need to add
these files into our new app.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:36.900
We add to that directory,
library and open source.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.480
Now, what I do here, is to
create groups for any added

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.190
folders, but if you have already
been using some of

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:49.770
open source files in your own
app, you may want to add them

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:53.510
individually, so you don't end
up having duplicate open

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.920
source files in two different
directories.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.750
SILVANO LUCIANI: Makes sense.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.840
XIANGTIAN DAI: Click Add.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.440
Still, we need to do some
tweaking of settings.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.050
The first thing is that we need
to add two frameworks.

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:09.415
One is the security.

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:14.776
And the second, is system
configuration.

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:22.725
We also need to change View
settings to add a new link for

00:15:22.725 --> 00:15:27.076
that, if you're not
already using it.

00:15:27.076 --> 00:15:32.060
The identifier would be dash
object of C. This ensures

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.630
libraries with objects
of C, classes with

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.440
categories, links correctly.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.765
So it's dash object C as part
of other link for apps.

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:48.810
And the third one, as we
mentioned earlier, we need to

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:54.410
add the Bundle ID as the
URL scheme we support.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:55.860
SILVANO LUCIANI: So we
already seen this.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:58.890
This is the one that we
configured before in the API

00:15:58.890 --> 00:15:59.940
Console project.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.490
XIANGTIAN DAI: Yes.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:03.270
So in our case, it's
com.Google.GoolePlusSample.

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:17.920
All right.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.100
So that's all the
first settings.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:26.560
But we still, the same as what
we did for the Quickstart

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.840
sample app, we still need to
set the Client ID, which is

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:36.390
the Client ID for our
newly-created app Google API

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.650
Console client.

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:43.570
So here, we add an import,
GPPSignIn.

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.570
And here, in application did
finish with [INAUDIBLE],

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:53.840
launching with options,
we add GPPSignIn.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:05.290
sharedInstance].clientID equals
to some value, which is

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:08.540
still in my clipboard, which
is the same thing here.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.819
SILVANO LUCIANI: It's the same
Client ID that we created for

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:12.410
the project before.

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:13.150
XIANGTIAN DAI: Yes.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.089
Now the application is ready.

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:17.119
But it does not do
anything yet.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:19.930
Let's see how we add the
Sign-In button to this

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:21.150
application.

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:22.180
Let's open Storyboard.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:26.760
Or if your app use XIB file,
that would work, too.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.300
We add a control, a button.

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:37.090
Give it some size.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:41.085
Remove the label because Sign-In
library will add their

00:17:41.085 --> 00:17:45.520
own labels and give the class,
called it GPPSignInButton.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.790
Of course, if you prefer not to
use a UI editor, by rather

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:55.450
do it programmatically, you
can do that as well.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:56.490
All right.

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:58.360
Let's see how it works.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:04.750
I will use iPhone simulator
and run.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:08.500
SILVANO LUCIANI: Build
succeeded, but--

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.200
XIANGTIAN DAI: Yeah, the build
succeeds, but we have a small

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.460
problem here.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.490
Let me try again.

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:16.020
SILVANO LUCIANI: Live demos.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.330
XIANGTIAN DAI: Yeah,
those live demos.

00:18:26.168 --> 00:18:28.730
Reset the simulator.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:29.970
SILVANO LUCIANI: OK.

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:34.470
So Xiangtian has reset the
status of the iOS simulator.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:35.765
XIANGTIAN DAI: Let's
try it again.

00:18:35.765 --> 00:18:37.015
SILVANO LUCIANI: Let's
try again the build.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.740
No.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.350
XIANGTIAN DAI: Since it didn't
work out, this--

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:46.650
SILVANO LUCIANI: The live
demo is not with us.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:47.440
XIANGTIAN DAI: Yeah.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.900
SILVANO LUCIANI: Do you
have a working--

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.570
XIANGTIAN DAI: Let's see if I
have working version before.

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:04.850
SILVANO LUCIANI: This is the
sample that we build just

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:07.820
before starting, which
was working.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.060
XIANGTIAN DAI: Which
was working, but

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.310
it didn't work either.

00:19:12.595 --> 00:19:13.070
Bummer.

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:14.430
SILVANO LUCIANI: That's what
happen when you try

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:16.100
to do a live demo.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.000
There is something wrong.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.760
Anyway, I don't have a
clock, but that was

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.140
less than 10 minutes.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:24.160
And we did 99% of it.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.440
We leave you the 1% to you
at home as homework.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.270
I'm pretty sure that
you will succeed.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.740
Do we want to move to some
questions, Xiangtian?

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:37.240
We have some questions
that are occurring.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:41.660
So the first one is, does
Google+ Sign-In work for user

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.930
that don't have the Google+
app installed

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:46.590
on their iOS device?

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:47.070
XIANGTIAN DAI: Yes.

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:51.850
I think I already mentioned it
during demo that if you have a

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:54.510
Google+ app installed, the
user will be directed to

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:55.370
Google+ app.

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:56.870
They don't have to
sign in again.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:59.900
And will redirect back to
your app immediately.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.750
However, if you do not have the
Google+ app, it will just

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:06.040
use a web browser, which you'll
need to sign in, if

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.720
you're not already signed in.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:12.810
And then go to this consent
form, like we have demoed.

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:15.380
SILVANO LUCIANI: Second question
is, does it work for

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:19.030
users that do not have
a Google+ account?

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:20.720
I can reply to this.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.445
If they don't have a Google+
account, we have a very fast

00:20:23.445 --> 00:20:27.370
flow, which is composed of two
screens, which will allow them

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:30.640
to create or upgrade the
user to Google+.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:35.000
And they will be able to access
it in 10 seconds, 15

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.830
seconds at most.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:38.130
XIANGTIAN DAI: Yes.

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:41.380
SILVANO LUCIANI: So I think we
don't have any more questions.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.230
Do you want to make another
try to fix it?

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:45.920
Or should we call it a day?

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.300
XIANGTIAN DAI: Let's
see if it works.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.130
SILVANO LUCIANI: While Xiangtian
is trying to fix the

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:57.150
live demo, let me remind you
that you can find docs on

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.710
everything that we show you
and even more, all the

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:03.270
functionalities that the Google+
platform offers, at

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:06.720
the developers.google.com/plus.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.640
If you want to see more code
examples, go to our

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.150
[INAUDIBLE]

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:12.320
on GitHub--

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.750
github.com/googleplus.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:16.410
And you will find all
the Quickstarts.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.560
And also you will find the
source code for PhotoHunt,

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.100
which is our end-to-end
sample application.

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:23.490
We have a Java backend.

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.790
We have an iOS client.

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:26.560
And we have an Android client.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.160
If you have any additional
questions, you can reach us in

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.830
the Google+ Developer Community
on Google+.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:36.910
And also you can use Stack
Overflow, use the tag

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:38.300
Google-Plus.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:42.500
We monitor questions on the tag
daily, and we try to reply

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.710
as fast as we can, usually
within the same day.

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:48.540
Also, if you have any feature
requests, or if you want to

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:53.280
file a bug, user-issued trigger,
You can find the URL

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.890
for the issue trigger in
our developer docs.

00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:00.640
And this will allow Xiangtian to
fix bugs in the iOS if you

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.880
find any bugs on the iOS.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.750
Ask to fix bugs on
any of the other

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.260
features of the platform.

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.870
And if you have feature
requests, remember to star

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:11.510
