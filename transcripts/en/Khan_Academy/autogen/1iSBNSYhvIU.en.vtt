00:00:00.526 --> 00:00:02.140
 Let's see if we can find it 

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.647
 face on the surface of this box of cereal. 

00:00:04.647 --> 00:00:06.783
 There are several ways to do this. 

00:00:06.783 --> 00:00:08.966
 The first way is to find the face on the surface 

00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:11.601
 of the countries we see, and then think about it 

00:00:11.601 --> 00:00:14.143
 what is the face on the surface of the countries that we can not see, 

00:00:14.143 --> 00:00:16.488
 and what can be the relationship between them, and then bring them together. 

00:00:16.488 --> 00:00:17.638
 Let's do it. 

00:00:17.638 --> 00:00:20.284
 The front side of the box is 20 centimeters high 

00:00:20.284 --> 00:00:21.805
 and a width of 10 centimeters. 

00:00:21.805 --> 00:00:24.417
 It's a rectangle, so to find her face, we can just 

00:00:24.417 --> 00:00:27.006
 to multiply by 20 centimeters by 10 centimeters 

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:29.862
 and that will give us 200 centimeters. 

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:34.435
 200 centimeters, I should say 200 square centimeters. 

00:00:34.435 --> 00:00:36.212
 200 square centimeters is the face of the front. 

00:00:36.212 --> 00:00:38.789
 Let me also write it here, here. 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:40.589
 Now, we also know there is another country to have 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:42.911
 exactly the same face as the front of the box, and that's it 

00:00:42.911 --> 00:00:44.489
 its back side. 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.136
 So let's write another 200 square centimeters 

00:00:47.136 --> 00:00:48.830
 for the back of the box. 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.908
 Now let's find the face on the top of the box. 

00:00:51.908 --> 00:00:55.494
 Upper side. We see that the box is three centimeters deep, 

00:00:55.494 --> 00:00:59.599
 so this here is three centimeters. 

00:00:59.599 --> 00:01:02.444
 It is three centimeters deep and 10 centimeters wide. 

00:01:02.444 --> 00:01:04.475
 We see that the box is 10 centimeters wide. 

00:01:04.475 --> 00:01:06.321
 So the top of the box will be three centimeters 

00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:09.884
 10 centimeters, which is a face 

00:01:09.884 --> 00:01:11.057
 of 30 square centimeters. 

00:01:11.057 --> 00:01:13.681
 So this is the top side of the box, 30 square centimeters. 

00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:15.317
 The bottom of the box will have the same face, 

00:01:15.317 --> 00:01:17.860
 we just can not see it now, so that's it 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.881
 there will be another 30. 

00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:22.364
 Then we have two more countries, because this box has a total of six countries. 

00:01:22.364 --> 00:01:26.301
 We have this side panel, which is 20 centimeters high, 

00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:28.540
 the height of the case is 20 centimeters, 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.653
 and three centimeters deep. 

00:01:32.523 --> 00:01:37.121
 So it's three in 20, let me write it a little more clearly. 

00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:41.305
 Three at 20, 

00:01:41.305 --> 00:01:44.135
 that's 20 centimeters. 

00:01:44.135 --> 00:01:45.633
 Three centimeters at 20 centimeters 

00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:48.481
 will give us 60 square centimeters. 

00:01:51.008 --> 00:01:52.665
 Now this is this side part, but there is one more 

00:01:52.665 --> 00:01:54.674
 a side part that has exactly the same face, 

00:01:54.674 --> 00:01:56.451
 she's on the other side of the box, so 

00:01:56.451 --> 00:01:59.330
 60 square centimeters for this country 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.651
 and another 60 for the matching country, 

00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:03.589
 against it, which we can not see. 

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:06.156
 And now we can just get together. 

00:02:06.156 --> 00:02:09.970
 So we get zero, it will 

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:14.539
 carry the unit or will regroup the unit, 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:16.257
 this is 100, and then we have 500. 

00:02:16.257 --> 00:02:20.796
 We get 580 square centimeters as a face on the surface 

00:02:20.796 --> 00:02:23.182
 of this box.
