00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.230
&gt;&gt; What do you Sterling what do

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.200
you think about public understanding of genetics, in

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.270
particular? Do you think it's would you give them an A plus? Would you give em?

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.520
&gt;&gt; I wouldn't give them an A plus. But I'd give them a potential for having an

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:18.032
A plus. I think that the impact that personal

00:00:18.032 --> 00:00:25.470
genomics and the rate at which discoveries are happening I think

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.500
that this is going to force the hand of education

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.549
in the public arena. I think that people both

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.202
are going to be interested, and are going to want to

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:38.680
learn more about the nitty gritty of genetics. And

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.820
I think that right now there's just a lot

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.030
of wonder and curiosity. And there's some people that

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.760
have really good information, and there's some people that

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.510
have really bad information, just about like anything. and genetics

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.470
you know, as you know, can be both a simple, some simple concepts to some very

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.050
complex one. And the information that one gets from their own personal genetic

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.440
background has both of those things. And it has the potential to be

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.350
confusing and to be a minefield of misinformation,.But

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.570
I, I hold a positive I think there's

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.889
a positive potential for people learning and understanding.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.810
&gt;&gt; What's, what's always so fascinating to

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.940
me, is when we meet new parents, average

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.900
sized parents, that have had a dwarf child.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.230
And it always comes to, they tell the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.810
story of when they were given the

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.520
diagnosis. And 90% of them, have horrifically bad

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.180
stories to tell, about how they were told

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.710
their child was going to be a dwarf. And

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.310
I always want to go back and hear the other side of that story. You know, was it

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.770
just a shock to them and, and they read

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.850
negativity into it? Or was that negatividly, negativity actually delivered?

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:56.451
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.390
&gt;&gt; I just want to know in general, do you

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.830
have any hopes or fears for the future of genetic research?

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.970
&gt;&gt; Well, a cousin of mine, the daughter of my

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.350
uncle who was BRCA2, found out she was BRCA2, and she's

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.890
in the process of seeing physicians. And one physician said to her,

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.520
based on her age, and my age, and my uncles age, that

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.680
there's research going on. And they're probably within the next few years, they

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.130
will find a moderator mutation.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.820
Because, why is it that there's a spectrum of people who would get breast

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:47.440
cancer? And so, th, we don't know this yet. But my, that's my hope as well, that

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.240
the research will continue, and that they will

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.210
find out that some people, why do some

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.290
people get breast cancer, who have BRCA2 and

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.330
some people don't? Is it environment or is

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.690
it drinking too much alcohol, or not enough alcohol?

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.690
&gt;&gt;

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.830
[LAUGH]

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:05.990
&gt;&gt; You know, what is it?

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.935
&gt;&gt; Hopefully that second one.

00:03:06.935 --> 00:03:10.268
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah. So, I think I definitely believe

00:03:10.268 --> 00:03:15.600
in research, and rewarding the companies that make these contributions.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.503
&gt;&gt; So you, so you think the journey,

00:03:19.503 --> 00:03:21.550
you hope the journey will continue into research.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.770
&gt;&gt; Right, yes.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:22.770
&gt;&gt; And funding the research.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.684
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:23.684 --> 00:03:24.725
&gt;&gt; What else?

00:03:24.725 --> 00:03:29.540
&gt;&gt; I think of it from the perspective of my grandchildren that

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.700
will come in about 10 or 15 years, and all of this

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.120
testing will be pu, back in the forefront in our family. I guess

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.890
I'm, I'm, there's a sense of relief knowing that my boys

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:51.170
as future dads, will have the information available to them.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.400
And they will have the freedom of choice, to do with that what they choose.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.870
&gt;&gt; I hope it continues, and I hope

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.230
it doesn't get out of hand, whatever that means.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.920
&gt;&gt; I think, for me, my best hope would

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.240
be that the information progresses, to the point where that

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.490
it helps people who are looking at cures and

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.510
treatments. That it helps them do their job, and that

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.440
it helps the general public make informed personal

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.030
decisions. My fear is kind of, it's lighthearted if you've

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.680
seen the movie Gattaca? That's basically the, one

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.200
of the fears of it going out of hand.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.580
Where there is, you know, people are forced

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.080
to make choices or where socioeconomic status can determine,

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.870
like, people can take more advantage of this. I

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.620
mean, it's kind of a lighthearted ja, I fear.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.470
But, you know? It's, it's legitimate to fear that. And, that kind

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.280
of embodies the fear of, you know, people make, having their ability to

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.850
make the choice taken away from them, due to socioeconomic status, or outside

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.010
pressures, I think. Because, my hope

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.255
would be that it remains personal decisions.

00:05:02.255 --> 00:05:02.755
&gt;&gt;

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:12.420
my hope is that, you know, it will help individuals make medical decisions

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.986
in a more informed way, both in themselves, and with clinicians. and that

00:05:17.986 --> 00:05:22.590
like, for instance, pharmacologically, like, the

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.550
pharmacological principles. Once we know the genetics

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.560
of how we may respond to certain drugs, you know, we'll be able

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.984
to fine tune which drugs would help us more, which

00:05:31.984 --> 00:05:36.810
one's will more likely produce side effects. that's just an example.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.550
&gt;&gt; I think one thing that all of you touched on, but

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.650
we never brought out into the open so directly, is the idea of

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.640
genetic determinism. And really in your own way, you each have brought to this

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:57.000
course, by representing a trait or a particular background how gray

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.040
genetic determinism really is, and that human beings

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.580
are not just their genes. Right? We're human beings.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.640
We're not just one trait. We're many traits. we're

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.930
many people together. And that I hope for the

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.100
future, that this genetic information is, we're able to

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.100
use this together, to realize all of the many

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.490
wonderful things that it means to be human and

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.270
to make us unique, individually and as a species.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.970
and that my only fear is that we grow

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:29.570
out of our adolescence of, you know, misunderstanding each

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.020
other, and, and I hope that we can understand

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.728
how we make decisions, and consensus about these ideas.

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:38.250
And I, I think very truly that it's in

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.540
great part to people's willingness like your own, to

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.750
participate in projects like this, and other educational opportunities

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.833
that that's going to be possible. So thank you for

00:06:45.833 --> 00:06:46.626
[CROSSTALK]

00:06:46.626 --> 00:06:47.492
for being here.

00:06:47.492 --> 00:06:48.580
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.200
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
