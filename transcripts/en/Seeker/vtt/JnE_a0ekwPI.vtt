00:00:05.945 --> 00:00:14.175
There are two-toed sloths and three-toed sloths,
but other than their toes -- what's the difference?!

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:21.124
Hello friends, I'm Trace thanks for tuning
in to DNews!

00:00:21.124 --> 00:00:23.705
As you're likely aware, it's SLOTH WEEK!

00:00:23.705 --> 00:00:28.755
Obviously, we're all aware sloths are cute,
slow-moving, and extremely photogenic -- but

00:00:28.755 --> 00:00:32.335
let's drill down a little further into these
South American darlings.

00:00:32.335 --> 00:00:37.075
Why do some sloths have two toes and some
have three?

00:00:37.075 --> 00:00:38.084
Because evolution.

00:00:38.084 --> 00:00:44.055
First, both two-toed and three-toed sloths
have three ACTUAL toes.

00:00:44.055 --> 00:00:47.065
Yes, two-toed sloths have three TOES, but
only two FINGERS.

00:00:47.065 --> 00:00:54.224
35 to 40 million years ago, the 2-toed and
3-toed sloth were one species, Tara talked

00:00:54.224 --> 00:00:59.064
about that in a different video about ancient
sloth ancestors -- go watch if you missed

00:00:59.064 --> 00:01:03.264
it -- but at some point they mutated into
these two distinct groups.

00:01:03.264 --> 00:01:08.145
The 3-toed megatherium -- or great beast,
which was the size of an elephant and the

00:01:08.145 --> 00:01:10.935
2-toed megalonyx -- or great claw.

00:01:10.935 --> 00:01:15.475
As they evolved the sloths shrank in size
and spread themselves through North and South

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:19.765
America -- probably to conserve energy, because
leaves aren't THAT nutritious.

00:01:19.765 --> 00:01:23.765
Though it could also be because movement attracts
predators.

00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:29.005
23-percent of the diet of Harpy Eagles is
made up of two-toed sloths, and only 8.4-percent

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:30.005
by the three-toed ones.

00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:32.655
I think you can guess who moves more.

00:01:32.655 --> 00:01:35.755
Two-toed sloths may move for several hours
throughout the day, while some species of

00:01:35.755 --> 00:01:38.565
the three-toed sloth won't move at all.

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:43.215
In case you ever run into a sloth, the two-toed
guy are larger, faster, nocturnal, and can

00:01:43.215 --> 00:01:48.745
rotate their head 90 degrees [[pause]] the
three-toed ones are slower and more docile,

00:01:48.745 --> 00:01:54.125
and can rotate their head 270 degrees and
can be either nocturnal or diurnal.

00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:55.125
Get all that?

00:01:55.125 --> 00:01:56.125
Great.

00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:57.125
More importantly for you on the internet.

00:01:57.125 --> 00:02:02.775
The three-toed are more often the ones you
see taken as pets, BECAUSE they're cute, they

00:02:02.775 --> 00:02:05.695
don't bite and, like I said, they tend to
be more docile.

00:02:05.695 --> 00:02:11.135
That doesn't help with their natural existence
however, because people keep TAKING THEM HOME.

00:02:11.135 --> 00:02:16.165
There are four species of the three-toed sloth:
The Maned, Pale-Throated, Brown-Throated and

00:02:16.165 --> 00:02:17.295
Pygmy.

00:02:17.295 --> 00:02:23.004
The three-toed sloths have a blunter muzzle,
and simpler, peg-like teeth.

00:02:23.004 --> 00:02:25.144
The cutest of those is definitely the pygmy.

00:02:25.144 --> 00:02:27.674
As it's name suggests, it's real tiny.

00:02:27.674 --> 00:02:32.275
It separated from the other three species
almost 9,000 years ago and lives solely on

00:02:32.275 --> 00:02:36.015
Isla Escudo de Veraguas off the coast of Panama.

00:02:36.015 --> 00:02:44.284
Because it only lives in that ONE PLACE, it's
definitely endangered.

00:02:44.284 --> 00:02:48.945
The two-toed sloth is ALSO really cute, I
am sure you can see a theme here...

00:02:48.945 --> 00:02:53.184
But because it has a more defensive temperament
it will be to defend itself.

00:02:53.184 --> 00:02:58.355
There are only TWO species of two-toed sloth:
The Linnaeus's and Hoffman's.

00:02:58.355 --> 00:03:03.635
The Linnaeus' sloth has a HUGE land area and
super a strong population because it's got

00:03:03.635 --> 00:03:09.555
great camouflage and is solitary, but the
Hoffmans... is a victim of it's own cuteness.

00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:13.355
It's population is strong as well, but the
Hoffmans tend to venture onto farmland where

00:03:13.355 --> 00:03:14.355
they can be killed.

00:03:14.355 --> 00:03:19.794
They're also hunted and captured for the exotic
pet trade, again, because cuteness.

00:03:19.794 --> 00:03:24.525
Another big difference between the two, is
the three-toed sloth, like humans, has a sex

00:03:24.525 --> 00:03:27.335
ratio at birth of about 1-to-1 female-to-male.

00:03:27.335 --> 00:03:31.725
But that two-toed devil has 11-to-1!

00:03:31.725 --> 00:03:34.715
Eleven females for every male.

00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:40.365
When you spot a two-sloth in the wild, look
for others, because the females form small

00:03:40.365 --> 00:03:41.805
groups, and the males are solitary.

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:46.894
In the end, whether it be two or three toes
-- the sloths are fascinating natives to the

00:03:46.894 --> 00:03:52.585
Americas with a rich history and pretty complicated
family life.

00:03:52.585 --> 00:03:54.915

sloth?
