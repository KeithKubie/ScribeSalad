Alan Queen: We are an early-stage
start-up out of Atlanta, Georgia.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.292
And we create applications
for smart TVs, such as Google TV.

00:00:10.292 --> 00:00:11.708
What we're building are applications

00:00:11.708 --> 00:00:16.792
that allow multiple people to interact
with an application running on the TV,

00:00:16.792 --> 00:00:19.542
but all using their smart phones
as game controllers.

00:00:19.542 --> 00:00:21.292
We have several apps out there now,

00:00:21.292 --> 00:00:24.917
but one of them is actually in the Google
TV Spotlight area right now.

00:00:24.917 --> 00:00:26.208
And it's called We Draw.

00:00:26.208 --> 00:00:30.708
And it is a Pictionary-style game
where the app runs on the TV

00:00:30.708 --> 00:00:34.958
and people actually use their mobile device
to draw a secret word with their finger.

00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.500
And then, other people
try to guess the word.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.042
So I may see the word and be able
to draw, while you try to guess it

00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:43.625
and it all appears and happens
on the screen in real time.

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:45.458
Developing for the Google TV was great

00:00:45.458 --> 00:00:49.333
because it uses all the standard technologies
that we're all used to using--

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.542
HTML 5, Flash, and Android.

00:00:51.542 --> 00:00:55.500
So it, it really helped us in being able
to get applications out there faster,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.708
'cause these are things that we
already do and know how to do.

00:00:58.708 --> 00:01:03.333
So, it really helped us in just getting
more applications out there quicker.

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.958
As far as the future goes
for Google TV and us specifically,

00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:10.917
we're really excited about being able to build
native Android applications for Google TV,

00:01:10.917 --> 00:01:14.208
taking advantage of all the hardware
acceleration that's gonna be on the platform

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:15.667
as well as the Android market.

00:01:15.667 --> 00:01:19.167
And there's also some pretty neat things
you can do with Google TV specifically,

00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:22.750
where you can actually control
the TV itself from mobile devices

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.458
and other things like that as well.

00:01:24.458 --> 00:01:28.167
The great thing is for anyone
who's already experienced with Android,

00:01:28.167 --> 00:01:32.375
developing for Google TV
and native applications,

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:33.458
it's exactly the same.

00:01:33.458 --> 00:01:36.375
There's really no specific difference.

00:01:36.375 --> 00:01:39.542
In other words, if you normally develop
an Android application for a phone

00:01:39.542 --> 00:01:41.500
and it's on a certain screen size,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.625
whereas Google TV is exactly the same,
just a much larger screen size.

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:47.000
So there's really not a core difference,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.292
but what's great about it is
you get to take advantage

00:01:49.292 --> 00:01:51.042
of all the things that Google TV offers.

00:01:51.042 --> 00:01:54.000
So, I think Google will be really
excited about that.
