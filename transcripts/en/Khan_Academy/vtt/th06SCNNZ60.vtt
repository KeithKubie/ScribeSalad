00:00:00.598 --> 00:00:02.869
What I want to do in this
video is to give you the gist

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:09.472
of what the Roth IRA is all about.

00:00:09.472 --> 00:00:13.138
Just to get an idea of why
it's called the Roth IRA,

00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:15.360
it's named after William Roth,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.805
the late senator from Delaware.

00:00:18.805 --> 00:00:20.140
He helped, I guess,

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.536
you could say shepherd
this legislation in 1997

00:00:23.536 --> 00:00:25.010
when it was first passed

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.472
so they named the IRA after him.

00:00:27.472 --> 00:00:32.202
William Roth from Delaware.

00:00:32.202 --> 00:00:33.472
That's where the word comes from.

00:00:33.472 --> 00:00:37.067
It's a special type of
individual retirement account.

00:00:37.067 --> 00:00:39.135
Why did they go to the
trouble of creating a new one?

00:00:39.135 --> 00:00:42.406
Let's think about what
a traditional IRA does

00:00:42.406 --> 00:00:47.538
and then I'll talk about why a
Roth IRA could be interesting

00:00:47.538 --> 00:00:48.539
or it's a little bit different

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.449
or what could be beneficial

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.029
and then we'll actually
see it in an example.

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:57.204
The first question is what
happens when you put money

00:00:57.204 --> 00:00:59.535
into a traditional or a Roth IRA?

00:00:59.535 --> 00:01:01.074
In the traditional IRA video

00:01:01.074 --> 00:01:05.176
you saw that it's tax deferred.

00:01:05.176 --> 00:01:08.413
That if you were to put
$5,000 in your traditional IRA

00:01:08.413 --> 00:01:10.411
you are not taxed on that money.

00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:15.460
In the Roth IRA it is not deferred

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.664
so you would actually
pay taxes on that $5,000.

00:01:20.664 --> 00:01:22.131
Immediately you're saying,"Hey gee.

00:01:22.131 --> 00:01:23.992
"This doesn't seem like
that great of a thing.

00:01:23.992 --> 00:01:24.995
"Why would I ever use it?

00:01:24.995 --> 00:01:27.019
"I have to pay taxes on
the money I've put in."

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:28.605
This is the interesting thing.

00:01:28.605 --> 00:01:34.128
In both situations, as long
as your investments stay in

00:01:34.128 --> 00:01:37.659
either traditional or Roth accounts

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:52.598
earnings are not taxed while in account.

00:01:52.598 --> 00:01:55.955
This is true for both of them.

00:01:55.955 --> 00:01:57.062
But you're still going to say, "Hey Sal.

00:01:57.062 --> 00:01:58.858
"The traditional still looks a lot better.

00:01:58.858 --> 00:02:02.400
"I had to pay taxes on the
Roth right from the get-go.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.721
"I didn't have to pay
it on the traditional.

00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:05.794
"Then they can both grow

00:02:05.794 --> 00:02:07.655
"and I can buy and sell my stocks

00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:09.123
"or invest in mutual funds

00:02:09.123 --> 00:02:10.526
"or whatever I do inside of them.

00:02:10.526 --> 00:02:11.671
"I don't pay taxes.

00:02:11.671 --> 00:02:13.593
"The traditional still looks better."

00:02:13.593 --> 00:02:15.336
Now, the interesting thing is what happens

00:02:15.336 --> 00:02:16.795
when you withdraw the money?

00:02:16.795 --> 00:02:19.085
There's a lot of special circumstances

00:02:19.085 --> 00:02:22.008
on when a withdrawal is qualified or not.

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:23.326
I'm not going to know the details

00:02:23.326 --> 00:02:24.808
I really just want to give you the essence

00:02:24.808 --> 00:02:27.059
of why the Roth is interesting.

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:33.036
Let's say you're over 59-1/2 years old

00:02:33.036 --> 00:02:34.105
and in the Roth.

00:02:34.105 --> 00:02:35.535
Your money has been there
for more than 5 years,

00:02:35.535 --> 00:02:36.533
it's been seasoned.

00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:38.133
I'm not going to go into
all of the particulars.

00:02:38.133 --> 00:02:41.354
The traditional IRA when you withdraw,

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:48.532
let's say we're older than 59-1/2 for both

00:02:48.532 --> 00:02:55.165
and then we do a withdrawal.

00:02:55.165 --> 00:02:58.630
In the traditional IRA
you have to pay taxes.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.130
You pay taxes, you're taxed.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:08.876
Ordinary income tax.

00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:16.165
While in the Roth IRA no taxes. Not taxed.

00:03:16.165 --> 00:03:17.796
We saw in the traditional IRA video

00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:19.065
that this has to be pretty good

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:21.130
when you're older than 59-1/2.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.462
You might be retired.

00:03:22.462 --> 00:03:24.129
You might be in a lower tax bracket.

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:25.959
You're going to pay lower taxes on it

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.211
and it's been deferred
for however many years

00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:29.993
your IRA has been in existence.

00:03:29.993 --> 00:03:31.796
This is especially interesting

00:03:31.796 --> 00:03:34.728
because over here you paid tax

00:03:34.728 --> 00:03:37.332
just on the original
amount that you've put in

00:03:37.332 --> 00:03:39.928
and then you'll allow that
original amount to grow

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:41.593
over many, many, many years

00:03:41.593 --> 00:03:44.065
and then all of a sudden
you're not taxed at all.

00:03:44.065 --> 00:03:47.291
That, all of a sudden, becomes
a little bit interesting.

00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:49.933
This seems like a pretty
good thing to have.

00:03:49.933 --> 00:03:51.378
We're going to actually
play with the numbers

00:03:51.378 --> 00:03:53.707
to see how they workout.

00:03:53.707 --> 00:03:56.397
Now, the other interesting
thing about the Roth

00:03:56.397 --> 00:04:07.622
is if you early withdrawal.

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:12.628
For a traditional IRA you pay 10% penalty

00:04:12.628 --> 00:04:16.960
on the withdrawal plus you get taxed.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.402
Plus taxes.

00:04:18.402 --> 00:04:22.066
On the Roth IRA if you're just
taking the original amount

00:04:22.066 --> 00:04:23.002
you've put in

00:04:23.002 --> 00:04:24.596
and I'll do this with a numerical example.

00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:26.872
If you're just taking
out your principal amount

00:04:26.872 --> 00:04:31.207
no taxes or penalty on the principal.

00:04:31.207 --> 00:04:49.887
No taxes or penalty on principal.

00:04:49.887 --> 00:04:51.198
And you would only have to pay

00:04:51.198 --> 00:04:53.728
even if it's a non-qualified withdrawal.

00:04:53.728 --> 00:04:56.335
There's all these special
circumstances, what's qualified

00:04:56.335 --> 00:04:57.749
and I'm not going to go to the details.

00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:04.805
You would only have to pay the 10% penalty

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:11.462
and taxes on earnings.

00:05:11.462 --> 00:05:12.526
One of the main reasons

00:05:12.526 --> 00:05:13.662
why I'm not going in
all the details is one:

00:05:13.662 --> 00:05:15.195
It would make the video
a little confusing,

00:05:15.195 --> 00:05:17.616
but also, the government
is constantly changing

00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:18.613
the details.

00:05:18.613 --> 00:05:20.467
I want you to be able to watch this video

00:05:20.467 --> 00:05:22.609
as many years in the
future and not to be dated

00:05:22.609 --> 00:05:24.531
so I don't want to go into
all of the different things

00:05:24.531 --> 00:05:26.359
that the government is
changing from year to year.

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:28.109
Let's just do a very basic example

00:05:28.109 --> 00:05:30.695
just to get the sense of things.

00:05:30.695 --> 00:05:37.732
Let's look at at a traditional IRA

00:05:37.732 --> 00:05:40.335
and then we have a Roth.

00:05:40.335 --> 00:05:41.878
Let me write IRA just to be clear

00:05:41.878 --> 00:05:48.214
that we're talking about an
IRA in both circumstances.

00:05:48.214 --> 00:05:49.932
Let's say my original income amount,

00:05:49.932 --> 00:05:51.996
let's say I've made more than $5,000.

00:05:51.996 --> 00:05:54.296
I'll just use $5,000 as my example

00:05:54.296 --> 00:05:55.396
and I'll also make another note.

00:05:55.396 --> 00:05:58.469
Roth IRA is subject to more limitations

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:00.336
in terms of your total overall income

00:06:00.336 --> 00:06:01.637
and that's also changing.

00:06:01.637 --> 00:06:03.400
I don't want to be
specific on the numbers.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.062
You could look that up.

00:06:05.062 --> 00:06:08.128
There are ways that you can
transfer traditional IRAs

00:06:08.128 --> 00:06:09.934
into Roth IRAs.

00:06:09.934 --> 00:06:11.805
That's a little bit of a loophole

00:06:11.805 --> 00:06:13.971
on being able to get around
some of those restrictions.

00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:16.062
But anyway, I won't go
into the details just yet.

00:06:16.062 --> 00:06:17.402
Just remember, Roth IRA,

00:06:17.402 --> 00:06:19.201
there are some more limitations

00:06:19.201 --> 00:06:22.266
on whether or not you
can put things into it.

00:06:22.266 --> 00:06:25.186
If you're tricky you might
be able to get around them.

00:06:25.186 --> 00:06:28.537
Let's say you have $5,000.

00:06:28.537 --> 00:06:30.774
And just so you know, the limits on IRA

00:06:30.774 --> 00:06:32.667
is they apply to Roth or traditional

00:06:32.667 --> 00:06:34.794
or any combination of the two.

00:06:34.794 --> 00:06:37.742
If you're starting with $5,000,

00:06:37.742 --> 00:06:43.206
so in the traditional IRA
you have 0 taxes initially.

00:06:43.206 --> 00:06:45.807
In your Roth IRA initially,

00:06:45.807 --> 00:06:49.398
let's say you have a 32% tax bracket

00:06:49.398 --> 00:06:51.201
just like in the previous video.

00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:56.196
32% of tax bracket.

00:06:56.196 --> 00:07:03.737
Then you'll pay 32% on
$5,000, 32% on $5,000.

00:07:03.737 --> 00:07:11.578
That's .32 x $5,000. That's $1,600.

00:07:11.578 --> 00:07:17.074
You're going to pay $1,600 in taxes.

00:07:17.074 --> 00:07:19.508
Your amount in the account,

00:07:19.508 --> 00:07:26.388
in your account, your principal,

00:07:26.388 --> 00:07:28.660
in your traditional IRA

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.271
and maybe I should write it out here.

00:07:31.271 --> 00:07:37.399
Starting with that $5,000 your principal

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:42.136
is going to be $5,000 here.

00:07:42.136 --> 00:07:45.939
You have to take 1,600 out for taxes

00:07:45.939 --> 00:07:55.869
so it's only going to
be $3,400 right there.

00:07:55.869 --> 00:07:58.201
Let's say in either situation

00:07:58.201 --> 00:08:01.467
you were to take that,
invest it in some stocks

00:08:01.467 --> 00:08:08.801
and then 5 years later it doubles.

00:08:08.801 --> 00:08:11.690
Let's say at some future point it doubles

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.133
and you sell those stocks.

00:08:14.133 --> 00:08:17.401
That becomes $10,000 in your account there

00:08:17.401 --> 00:08:20.995
and then this, you invest
it in stocks and it doubles.

00:08:20.995 --> 00:08:27.548
This becomes $7,800 in
your account right here.

00:08:27.548 --> 00:08:31.467
This is 5 years into the future.

00:08:31.467 --> 00:08:35.734
I'm just picking that into the future.

00:08:35.734 --> 00:08:41.267
Let's say we're still not
59-1/2 years old just yet.

00:08:41.267 --> 00:08:43.667
Now, we could just continue to leave

00:08:43.667 --> 00:08:46.533
either of these amounts in our account

00:08:46.533 --> 00:08:47.933
until we're 59-1/2.

00:08:47.933 --> 00:08:50.341
Let's say we have some type of need,

00:08:50.341 --> 00:08:54.932
we need to give a loan to our
brother-in-law or something.

00:08:54.932 --> 00:08:57.878
We really want to have
access to this money.

00:08:57.878 --> 00:09:00.403
Let's look at the situation
where we withdraw.

00:09:00.403 --> 00:09:04.134
If we were to withdraw,

00:09:04.134 --> 00:09:05.573
let's think of a couple of situations.

00:09:05.573 --> 00:09:10.812
If we were to withdraw $3,400.

00:09:10.812 --> 00:09:13.932
Let's say that exactly what
my brother-in-law needs

00:09:13.932 --> 00:09:15.204
just right now.

00:09:15.204 --> 00:09:17.267
If we were to withdraw $3,400

00:09:17.267 --> 00:09:20.094
in the traditional IRA sense,

00:09:20.094 --> 00:09:22.760
in the traditional IRA case.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.265
We take out $3,400. We're
going to have to do 2 things:

00:09:27.265 --> 00:09:29.673
First, we're going to
have to pay taxes on it.

00:09:29.673 --> 00:09:31.673
We're going to have to pay 32% of that

00:09:31.673 --> 00:09:33.733
assuming we're still in
the same tax bracket.

00:09:33.733 --> 00:09:42.349
$3,400 x .32 is equal to,

00:09:42.349 --> 00:09:48.520
we're going to have pay $1,088 in taxes.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:54.120
We're going to have to
pay $1,088 in taxes.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.799
We're also going to have to pay a penalty

00:09:55.799 --> 00:09:58.369
on this entire amount, on the $3,400.

00:09:58.369 --> 00:10:00.863
We're also going to
have to pay 10% penalty,

00:10:00.863 --> 00:10:05.466
$340 penalty.

00:10:05.466 --> 00:10:08.405
We're going to be left with
after paying all of these,

00:10:08.405 --> 00:10:11.916
let me get the calculator
out and let's see,

00:10:11.916 --> 00:10:15.207
the calculator right there.

00:10:15.207 --> 00:10:16.780
We're going to be left with

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:27.890
3,400 - 1,088 - $340 = $1,972.

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:31.984
We're left with $1,972.

00:10:31.984 --> 00:10:33.578
In the Roth IRA,

00:10:33.578 --> 00:10:35.282
when you needed that money all of a sudden

00:10:35.282 --> 00:10:37.282
and you decided to withdraw it early

00:10:37.282 --> 00:10:39.777
and we're only taking out $3,400.

00:10:39.777 --> 00:10:43.247
We're taking the amount that
was our original principal.

00:10:43.247 --> 00:10:45.781
In the Roth IRA we get the $3,400

00:10:45.781 --> 00:10:47.312
because that was our original amount

00:10:47.312 --> 00:10:51.987
and we pay no taxes or penalties.

00:10:51.987 --> 00:10:54.362
At any point in time on the Roth IRA

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.985
you can always take your principal out.

00:10:56.985 --> 00:10:58.528
In the other types of IRAs

00:10:58.528 --> 00:11:00.609
not only will you have to pay taxes on it,

00:11:00.609 --> 00:11:03.614
you're also going to have to
pay a penalty on top of that.

00:11:03.614 --> 00:11:07.196
The Roth IRA, one of
the very positive things

00:11:07.196 --> 00:11:09.050
is it gives you a lot of flexibility.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:12.850
Now, let's say you needed
to withdraw, I don't know,

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:19.186
let's say you needed to withdraw $4,000.

00:11:19.186 --> 00:11:23.789
This is another scenario, $4,000
at this same point in time.

00:11:23.789 --> 00:11:27.100
Within the traditional IRA scenario,

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.682
once again, you're
going to have to pay 32%

00:11:29.682 --> 00:11:31.933
of that in taxes. You're
going to have to pay

00:11:31.933 --> 00:11:38.681
4,000 x 32% in taxes

00:11:38.681 --> 00:11:40.272
and you're also going to have to pay

00:11:40.272 --> 00:11:45.230
+ $400 penalty.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:48.623
In the Roth IRA case, you pay nothing.

00:11:48.623 --> 00:11:52.071
You get the original
principal you have put in,

00:11:52.071 --> 00:11:55.665
that was your original amount, $3,400.

00:11:55.665 --> 00:11:57.290
In all of this, I'm assuming

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:01.201
that we're not 59-1/2 years old just yet.

00:12:01.201 --> 00:12:03.050
In the Roth situation,

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:07.344
you get the $3,400 free and
clear, tax and penalty free.

00:12:07.344 --> 00:12:16.088
But the other $600, you're
going to have to pay 32% taxes

00:12:16.088 --> 00:12:17.587
or whatever your tax bracket is

00:12:17.587 --> 00:12:20.518
and then you're also
going to have to pay $60,

00:12:20.518 --> 00:12:23.758
a 10% penalty on just
the earnings portion.

00:12:23.758 --> 00:12:25.512
Remember, 3,400 was your principal,

00:12:25.512 --> 00:12:29.115
then if you want to take
4,000 out, the 600 extra,

00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:30.384
that stuff that you earned.

00:12:30.384 --> 00:12:32.846
That stuff that was
grown from the principal.

00:12:32.846 --> 00:12:35.913
You're going to have to pay
plus another $60 penalty.

00:12:35.913 --> 00:12:38.981
But it's still a much better
situation if you do the math

00:12:38.981 --> 00:12:40.016
than this one here.

00:12:40.016 --> 00:12:42.114
In general, if you
think, if you're not sure

00:12:42.114 --> 00:12:43.846
whether you're going to need that money

00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:44.780
before you retire,

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.180
the Roth gives you a lot more flexibility.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.494
Now, let's go all the way to retirement.

00:12:50.494 --> 00:12:51.993
Let's go all the way to retirement.

00:12:51.993 --> 00:12:54.995
Let's say we didn't
ever withdrew any money.

00:12:54.995 --> 00:12:57.595
We invest it in another stock

00:12:57.595 --> 00:12:59.597
and so we go 10 years later.

00:12:59.597 --> 00:13:03.904
We never withdrew any money.

00:13:03.904 --> 00:13:05.823
We're just going to look at
the retirement situation.

00:13:05.823 --> 00:13:09.597
We go to our stock and we
sell it, our new stock.

00:13:09.597 --> 00:13:16.171
We get the 20,00 there,
here we get $15,600.

00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:17.729
Of course, in both of these situations

00:13:17.729 --> 00:13:19.996
its great that we're able
to buy and sell stocks

00:13:19.996 --> 00:13:21.529
inside of these retirement accounts

00:13:21.529 --> 00:13:22.831
and not pay taxes.

00:13:22.831 --> 00:13:24.661
If these were not sitting
in retirement accounts

00:13:24.661 --> 00:13:26.798
every time we bought and sold the stocks

00:13:26.798 --> 00:13:29.264
we would have to pay capital gains tax

00:13:29.264 --> 00:13:31.530
and you saw that in the previous video.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:33.534
Now, now that we are over,

00:13:33.534 --> 00:13:38.571
let's say we're 60 years old.

00:13:38.571 --> 00:13:42.661
We can now withdraw our
money from either situation.

00:13:42.661 --> 00:13:44.154
There's some other stipulations,

00:13:44.154 --> 00:13:45.409
your money has to be seized

00:13:45.409 --> 00:13:47.202
and has to be sitting
there for 5 years and all

00:13:47.202 --> 00:13:48.404
but I won't go into the details.

00:13:48.404 --> 00:13:50.865
Let's see what happens
when we withdraw the money.

00:13:50.865 --> 00:13:55.158
Let's say we have a 25% tax bracket now.

00:13:55.158 --> 00:13:57.399
25% tax bracket.

00:13:57.399 --> 00:14:00.670
We're retiree, we're earning
a little bit less money,

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.993
we are in a lower tax bracket.

00:14:01.993 --> 00:14:03.659
In this situation we're going to pay,

00:14:03.659 --> 00:14:06.730
when we withdraw it from a traditional IRA

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:15.529
we are going to pay 25% in
taxes which is $5,000 in taxes

00:14:15.529 --> 00:14:19.596
and we are going to be left
with $15,000 for ourselves

00:14:19.596 --> 00:14:22.731
to spend in our retirement years.

00:14:22.731 --> 00:14:25.729
In the Roth IRA situation,

00:14:25.729 --> 00:14:28.559
once we're over 60 years
old our tax bracket

00:14:28.559 --> 00:14:29.736
doesn't matter.

00:14:29.736 --> 00:14:38.664
We just get the money,
$15,600 free and clear.

00:14:38.664 --> 00:14:40.639
If you think about it in either situation,

00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:42.136
when we withdrew early,

00:14:42.136 --> 00:14:44.932
the Roth IRA was much more forgiving

00:14:44.932 --> 00:14:47.144
especially if we withdraw
less than the amount

00:14:47.144 --> 00:14:49.861
that we originally put in, $3,400.

00:14:49.861 --> 00:14:52.264
The Roth IRA does not tax us

00:14:52.264 --> 00:14:53.389
or give us penalties.

00:14:53.389 --> 00:14:55.472
It only does that on any
money that we earned,

00:14:55.472 --> 00:14:58.193
any money in excess of the $3,400.

00:14:58.193 --> 00:15:02.226
The traditional IRA
taxes us and penalizes us

00:15:02.226 --> 00:15:05.037
on everything.

00:15:05.037 --> 00:15:06.620
Even when we go into the future, remember,

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.768
in the traditional IRA

00:15:09.768 --> 00:15:11.197
we didn't pay any taxes to begin with

00:15:11.197 --> 00:15:14.337
but we had to pay taxes to end with.

00:15:14.337 --> 00:15:16.500
When we paid taxes in the end,

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.668
we're paying taxes not just
on what we've put in initially

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:22.123
we're also paying taxes on all of
our cumulative earnings, right?

00:15:22.123 --> 00:15:23.591
We originally put in 5,000,

00:15:23.591 --> 00:15:25.531
now we're paying taxes on 20,000.

00:15:25.531 --> 00:15:28.259
We're going to only end up with $15,000

00:15:28.259 --> 00:15:33.119
while in the Roth IRA we
don't pay taxes on anything.

00:15:33.119 --> 00:15:36.457
In return for being willing
to pay our taxes front loaded

00:15:36.457 --> 00:15:37.662
to pay them in the beginning,

00:15:37.662 --> 00:15:40.626
we'll never have to
pay taxes on that money

00:15:40.626 --> 00:15:42.542
or on any of the earnings

00:15:42.542 --> 00:15:43.457
that that money makes.

00:15:43.457 --> 00:15:45.623
Now, I fixed the numbers
here to make them close.

00:15:45.623 --> 00:15:48.366
Depending on your tax
bracket before and after

00:15:48.366 --> 00:15:51.457
or how much growth you
actually see in your earnings,

00:15:51.457 --> 00:15:53.210
one maybe better than the other.

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:54.591
But these are important considerations.

00:15:54.591 --> 00:15:57.957
I just want to let you
know the pros and cons.

00:15:57.957 --> 00:15:59.957
The Roth IRA tends to be better

00:15:59.957 --> 00:16:01.953
in terms of giving you this flexibility

00:16:01.953 --> 00:16:05.286
and not worrying to pay taxes at the end.

00:16:05.286 --> 00:16:06.662
There's one other thing,

00:16:06.662 --> 00:16:08.591
this is depending on how you view life,

00:16:08.591 --> 00:16:09.662
it might be a minor thing.

00:16:09.662 --> 00:16:12.796
In the traditional IRA, when you're 70-1/2

00:16:12.796 --> 00:16:17.685
they force withdrawal

00:16:17.685 --> 00:16:20.546
and then of course you have to
start paying taxes on things.

00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:25.733
In a Roth IRA, there's no age limit.

00:16:25.733 --> 00:16:29.733
That's another consideration
you might want to take into.
