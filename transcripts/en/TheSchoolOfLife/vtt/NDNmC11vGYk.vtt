00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.280
The secrets of happiness

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.060
1. Stop being so hopeful

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.080
Expect that most things are going to go wrong

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.880
marriage, job, holidays, kids

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.220
Look at the glass half empty and then feel grateful

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.600
Whenever things aren't quite catastrophic

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.120
2. Stop ranting about how awful other people are

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.320
Most annoying people aren't evil, they're just anxious or sad

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.160
Forgive them. They don't set out to hurt you

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.500
They are just under a lot of pressure

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.840
3. Think of Death a lot

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.560
Keep a skull on your table. You probably only got about 400,000 hours left

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.900
4. Love yourself

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.960
Stop thinking of yourself as a stupid idiot

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.720
Do something fun and nicer: a loveable fool

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.900
5. Make regular appointments to talk with someone you don't spend enough time with... you

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.440
Ask yourself what you really want and are anxious about

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.160
6. Stop trying to make yourself happy, it's impossible

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.420
Concentrate on cheering up other people

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.900
7. Look at yourself as differently i.e. 240 miles above the Earth

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.780
From this height, lots of things that are bothering you look the size they should always've been

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.060
8. Throw your phone of a cliff for a bit

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.320
So you can finally notice stuff

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.180
Specially your partner and your mom.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.960
9. Give up on the idea that you should be normal

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.960
The only normal people are people you don't know yet

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.640
Everyone is weird and that's totally ok
