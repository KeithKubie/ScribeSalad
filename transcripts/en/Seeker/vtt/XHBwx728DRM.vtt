00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.190
Why don’t cell phones work in airplanes?

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.260
The short answer is that when you’re 35,000
feet in the air going 500 miles per hour,

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.400
you’re just too far from a cell tower.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.559
But that got us thinking: how does wifi work
in an airplane?

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.460
Hi there!

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.970
This is Amy for DNews, and the question “Why
don't phones work in planes while they’re

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.970
in the sky?”

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:23.970
came to us through Twitter.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.340
Some of you know that they CAN work, if you’re
on a plane with wifi.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.680
From the passenger’s perspective, in-flight
wifi is as simple as turning on your computer

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.680
and connecting to the network.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.809
But there’s a lot more going on than we
see.

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.950
There are a couple of ways to connect to the
Internet in a plane.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.780
One is by a ground-based system sort of like
a cellular network.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.479
Stations set up around the country provide
overflying planes with contact points.

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:48.070
An antenna on the plane’s underside transmits
and receives signals to and from these ground-based

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.829
towers, bringing wifi into the plane.

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.620
But of course, this doesn’t work when you’re
flying overseas or out of range of the ground

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.620
network.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.309
The alternative is a satellite-based system
that uses an antenna on top of the plane that

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.299
talks to satellites in orbit sometimes in
conjunction with that antenna on the bottom

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:04.629
of the plane that talks to ground based towers.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.159
In both cases, the wifi signal you request
from your seat gets to the plane.

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.510
But that’s only half the battle since the
information has to get to you in your seat.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.880
And here’s where things get a little more
complicated.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.200
Wireless signals bounce around in small spaces
like airplanes, and not just off the walls.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.439
The seats, luggage, and even the passengers
in their seats can disrupt the electromagnetic

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.450
environment in an airplane and affect the
way a wireless signal moves.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.950
And if people are up out of their seats moving
around, and the drink cart is being pushed

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.720
down the aisle, well, that just disrupts the
environment more.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.030
This translates to a spotty internet connection,
one that not only varies from seat to seat,

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.090
it can vary depending on where your laptop
is placed on that tray table in front of you.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.249
Manufacturers are working on the problem.

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:42.619
In 2012, Boeing filled an airplane’s seat
with potatoes -- spuds apparently mimic the

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.729
electromagnetic disturbance of human flesh
-- to try and understand how wireless signals

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.049
bounce around to bring stronger and more reliable
wifi signals to future flights.

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.890
And providers are doing their part, too, beefing
up ground networks and developing new systems

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.509
that can transmit more data.

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.399
Do you guys use in-flight wifi, or do you
like having an excuse to go offline when you

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:01.399
fly?

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.740
