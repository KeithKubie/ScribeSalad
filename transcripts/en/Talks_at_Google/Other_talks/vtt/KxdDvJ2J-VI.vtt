00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.540
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Hi everyone. My name is
Toma Shaun. I'm a User-Experience Researcher

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.681
and I'm very happy to introduce you to Guy
Winch, a psychologist, who's gonna talk about

00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:16.090
complaint psychology. If you really want his
book, "The Squeaky Wheel," and you didn't

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.660
get it, please let the Authors at Google team
know and we'll purchase books for you. Go

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.660
ahead.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.589
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: All right. Thank you. Am I on?
Yes. Excellent. Alright.

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:38.129
So, welcome everyone and thanks for having
me, Toma. Today, I'm going to tell you how

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.960
our complaining psychology affects our lives
and our relationships.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.380
Now, I know the topic of complaints is not
one that elicits positive connotations for

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:57.050
most people, but I really hope to change that.
Case in point, I want to tell you about the

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:06.390
day my book came out. Like most writers, I
dreamed for years about the day I will be

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.060
able to see a book I wrote on the shelves
of a bookstore.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:18.090
So the day my book was published, I ran down
to my local bookstore with my favorite pen

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.130
in hand, because my agent said, "Oh, they're
going to ask you to sign books." So, I had

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.399
my pen. I ran up to the customer service desk
where the customer service manager was standing

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.560
and said, "I’m Guy Winch and my book just
came out."

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.420
And she said, "Winch. Oh. Let me see." And
she looked it up and she goes, "Oh. Here it

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.630
is. The Squeaky Wheel. Complaining? Ooh, I
hate people who complain. Ugh." And she turned

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.630
away.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.630
[laughter]

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:56.789
I realized I won't be needing my pen. But
I took comfort in the fact that if she hates

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:03.340
people who complain that much, she must really
love her job as a customer service manager.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.250
[laughter]

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:13.640
But I also understood how she felt. We complain
more today than ever before in history. We

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.390
complain about everything from the weightiest
global issues to the smallest details of our

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.550
daily lives.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.780
We complain about the actions of our favorite
television characters with the same immediacy

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:35.640
and passion as we do about the actions of
our spouse or our friends. And yet, even our

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:45.060
best complainers, our kvetching prodigies,
even the cream of our moaning crop rarely

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.960
get the results they want.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:57.310
Today, we are all squeaky wheels, but we don't
get the grease. We face daily frustrations

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:04.510
and irritations and we don't have a clue about
how to address them effectively. Now, I can

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.650
see your faces and know what some of you are
thinking but let me ask you this.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.710
The last time your partner or your roommate
or your colleague did something that really

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:23.180
annoyed you, did you say something to them
about it? If you did, did you get the result

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:30.040
you wanted? The last time a sales person was
rude to you in a store, did you speak to the

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.040
manager?

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.820
The last time the dish you ordered in a restaurant
was not cooked properly, did you send it back?

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.980
Complaints are a much bigger factor in our
life than we realize and not just because

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.530
we have so many of them, but mostly because
of what happens to us psychologically when

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.530
we do.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:01.620
The thing is the urge to complain triggers
a powerful and negative psychological mindset

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:09.960
that impacts our feelings and our behaviors
and dramatically affects our lives and our

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.470
relationships for the worse.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:19.709
And we don't even realize that is happening.
Now, when a psychologist tells you that the

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:28.419
mere urge to complain triggers powerful, hidden,
destructive forces inside your mind, I understand

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.650
that can sound like pure theory.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.800
[laughter]

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:39.900
So, the first topic I'll cover today is what
the research tells us about complaining psychology.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.060
I'll explain what this mindset does to us
and what our complaining psychology is costing

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.419
us in various aspects of our lives.

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.569
Then, I'll tell you what you can do about
it. I'll give you the recipe for preparing

00:04:53.569 --> 00:05:00.520
a Complaint Sandwich and I'll tell you how
to eat one as well. Google recently opened

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:07.439
a new call center. So, we'll talk about the
challenges those folks might be facing and

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:15.939
we'll end with an inspiring story about extra-large
brassieres and their occupants.

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:21.060
Hopefully by the end of today, I'll have changed
your minds about complaints so you can see

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:27.979
them for the opportunities they truly are.
But let's begin with the research. And here

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:34.930
we see the first gap between what we perceive
we do and what we actually do.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:41.189
Most people think they would speak up if they
were on the losing end of a bad deal. If something

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:46.539
you purchased arrived in the wrong size, if
it was broken, if it didn't do what it was

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:54.490
supposed to do, most of us think we would
complain. And yet, study after study demonstrates

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:02.659
that when we are dissatisfied with certain
purchases, 95% of us fail to complain to the

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:12.259
company in question, ninety-five percent.
Only 5% of us speak up to the company. And

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:17.289
when we ask people why they haven't spoken
up in these situations, this is what they

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:23.700
say. Here's how we justify why we don't complain.
We believe complaining to the company will

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.840
require too much time and effort.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:32.690
We believe the process of complaining will
be too annoying and aggravating. We believe

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:39.810
that even if we did complain, we won't get
a satisfying result. Now, these might seem

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.999
like compelling arguments except for one thing.

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:52.819
Those very same people will then relay the
tale of consumer woe to an average of 16 friends

00:06:52.819 --> 00:07:00.469
and acquaintances and getting re-aggravated
every time they do it, expending incredible

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:08.419
time and effort in doing it and resolving
nothing. So, do you see the paradox? We voice

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:14.880
our complaints to everyone except the people
who can actually resolve them.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:23.229
This same contradiction operates in every
sphere of our lives. When we feel hurt or

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:29.639
annoyed or disappointed by something our partners
or our friends or our family members did or

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:35.439
said, we usually don't voice complaints to
them for all the same reasons.

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:41.180
We believe it will require hours of talking
and discussion. We believe doing so will be

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:46.059
too aggravating because it will lead to an
argument. And we believe that even if we tried

00:07:46.059 --> 00:07:51.319
complaining to these people, it won't resolve
the matter to our satisfaction. In other words,

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:57.699
we use the very same reasons to justify why
we don't complain in our personal lives as

00:07:57.699 --> 00:08:00.529
we do in our lives as consumers.

00:08:00.529 --> 00:08:06.070
And here's the other similarity. Instead of
complaining directly to our family members

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:10.949
or to our friends or our colleagues when we're
upset with them, we complain about them to

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:17.069
our other family members, our other friends,
and our other colleagues. I mean, let's be

00:08:17.069 --> 00:08:18.069
honest.

00:08:18.069 --> 00:08:22.460
Locker room acquaintances are more likely
to hear what your spouse did to annoy you

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:30.050
than your actual spouse. Now sadly, all this
effort in complaining to everyone doesn't

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:35.520
work. And what it does do is convince us that
well, complaining doesn't work so why try?

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.500
And then the next time we're upset with something,
we're even less likely to voice it to the

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:47.700
people who can fix it for us. This is a textbook
example of a self-defeating prophecy and we

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:56.640
all do it. But perhaps the best illustration
of how broken our complaining psychology truly

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:03.850
is, is the global phenomenon known as Complaints
Choirs.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:11.450
This is the Chicago Choir. But all over the
world people are gathering in town squares

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:19.420
and concert halls to sing their complaints
to originally composed music, at times accompanied

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:25.830
by symphony orchestras. I wish I was kidding.
I'm not. You can look them up on YouTube.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:32.650
There are many of them with hundreds of thousands
of page views. Now, here is, for example,

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:39.130
is St. Petersburg Complaints Choir in Russia.
Here is the Tokyo Complaints Choir. Here is

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:44.960
the Cairo Complaints Choir, albeit before
the uprising. I'm not sure they're singing

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:45.960
currently.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.510
There are many, many others. Now, since this
phenomenon was a Finnish invention, here's

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:57.080
the Helsinki Complaints Choir. The Helsinki
Complaints Choir has two main complaints.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:03.120
Their first complaint is that their trams,
their public transportation systems smell

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.880
like urine.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:11.220
And their second complaint is they don't get
laid enough. Well, maybe they shouldn't take

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:15.390
the trams to their dates. Do you know what
I'm saying?

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.390
[laughter]

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:25.130
Here's why this phenomenon is so tragic. Think
of how many hours go into preparing the concepts

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:31.960
and the lyrics and the composing and the matching
outfits. If the Helsinki Choir stood outside

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:37.440
their City Hall and sang to their politicians,
"If you don't clean up our trams, we won't

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:42.000
vote for you," someone would clean their trams.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.150
But they don't do that. None of the choirs
do. They have this amazing platform and none

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:53.690
of the choirs use it to actually try and fix
the things they're singing about. None of

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:58.410
them. So, they sing in Times Square and their
concert halls and it's all very funny, but

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.380
nothing changes.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.940
By the way, I recently mentioned the Helsinki
Choir in a keynote address I gave a few weeks

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:10.320
ago because I thought if I mention one of
the American choirs, there's the Chicago and

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.450
Philadelphia and Memphis and others I didn't
wanna offend anyone in the audience.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:19.070
So, I did Helsinki and the minute I finished
my talk, a woman marches up to me and she

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:20.490
goes, "I'm from Helsinki."

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:21.970
[laughter]

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:26.990
So that's awkward. And then she says to me,
"Helsinki is a great city. It's where they

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:30.190
made Angry Birds."

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:32.740
[laughter]

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:37.670
And I'm thinking, Angry Birds? That's the
best she had? I mean, Helsinki is lovely.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:42.930
It's got far more going for it than Angry
Birds. But the thing about Angry Birds is

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:48.670
Angry Birds don't call each other up and go,
"Can you believe what those pigs did? They

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:55.060
stole my eggs. I'm just fuming about it."
They don't. Angry Birds take action.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.060
[laughter]

00:11:56.060 --> 00:12:04.150
They launch themselves at those pigs. Angry
Birds in Helsinki get stuff done. Angry people?

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:10.190
Not so much. It's true. You don't see choir
members launching themselves into the air.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:12.660
You don't see the choir members smashing into
the trams.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:13.660
[laughter]

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:18.540
By the way, I should point out no actual choir
members were hurt during the preparation of

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.540
these slides.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:24.890
[laughter]
The thing is the mindset we bring to complaining

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:31.640
situations is broken. We have a fundamental
apprehension about complaining. We have a

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.860
deep-seated belief that we will not be heard.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:40.760
We feel helpless and powerless about being
able to get results and so we don't even try

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:47.450
to complain effectively. But because we have
so many complaints, how we deal or rather,

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:53.060
not deal with them could have a real impact
on our lives and the evidence for that is

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.710
all around us.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:13:01.270
In terms of results, most of us have a shelf
in our closet, or our garage, where we put

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:07.150
all the purchases that arrived in the wrong
size or that were missing a crucial piece

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:12.070
that we were going to return, but we never
quite got around to making the call. I call

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.920
it "the shelf of complaining shame," frankly.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:20.830
But some people have clothing and programs
and electronics and hundreds and thousands

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:26.910
of dollars’ worth of products on that shelf.
Most people have pet peeves, for example,

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:32.960
about their partners; things their loved ones
do that drive them absolutely crazy.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:39.700
Sexual behaviors that can be distracting or
relationship habits that can be really hurtful

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:45.860
or personal habits that can be slightly revolting.
Now, we don't know how to complain about this

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:50.960
stuff and the more important stuff. And the
things is that those kinds of things can really

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:57.100
erode our feelings over time and hasten and
bring about the end of our relationships.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:02.340
In our communities, most of our neighbors
are upset about the same things we are. They

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:07.070
also think there should be a traffic light
on that corner. They also find it annoying

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:11.050
to arrive for a doctor's appointment on time
and then spend over an hour in the waiting

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.190
room anyway.

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:18.640
They also get annoyed when the local grocery
store doesn't take expired products off their

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:24.110
shelves. But no one speaks up about those
things. And have you ever spoken up about

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:31.050
such things? We don't feel we can do anything
about these situations, about these small

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.450
and not so small irritations when they happen.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:41.530
But walking around feeling defeated and upset
and powerless on a regular basis affects our

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:48.930
mood. And it affects our self-esteem. And
it can even affect our mental health. But

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:55.890
if we knew how to complain effectively, if
we had the tools, if we mastered the techniques

00:14:55.890 --> 00:15:01.630
that could get us results, if we had confidence
in our complaining ability, we could turn

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.280
all those problems around.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:10.201
And doing so would improve our quality of
lives in so many different ways. For example,

00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:17.880
currently only 1% of our complaints reach
company executives, reach the actual decision-makers

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:22.080
who can change things. So, that's why things
don't change.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:27.140
And if we complained more effectively and
they knew about it, they would improve products.

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:32.910
They would improve services. They would improve
their procedures. All things we would gain

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:38.440
from. Our relationships would become stronger
and more satisfying and longer lasting.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:43.540
We know from research that couples that are
able to discuss a complaint productively have

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:49.570
much higher marital satisfaction and much
longer marital longevity than couples who

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:57.800
do not. It's a really huge thing in relationships.
Our communities would function more smoothly

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.510
and do better for us.

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:05.120
For example, I'm sure some of you know this,
but when women spoke out about having to wait

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:11.340
twice as long for bathrooms than men in sporting
arenas and concert halls, places like New

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:16.450
York City passed the Potty Parity Bill. Have
you heard of it? Well, great. Some of you

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:19.110
have, most of them men for some reason.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:20.310
[laughter]

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:25.990
But now, the new Mets Stadium and Yankee Stadium
and new construction has twice as many stalls

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:32.440
for women than it does for men. Those things
really affect our lives when we do them. Getting

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:38.230
results when we have complaints would make
us feel empowered, assertive, and effective.

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:42.990
And all the books and the magazines that say
"feel empowered," well, they're getting something

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:48.340
very wrong because personal empowerment is
not about a feeling. It's about having actual

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:53.500
influence in your relationships, in your life.
If you don't, but you just "feel" empowered,

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.870
you won't "feel" empowered for long, I assure
you.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:01.530
But voicing meaningful dissatisfactions when
you have them, getting the people around you

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:07.280
to change what they're doing, or your community
to change what you're doing, that's the definition

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:13.879
of personal empowerment. In other words, we
have to stop managing our complaints in ways

00:17:13.879 --> 00:17:19.470
that are emotionally harmful to us and use
them as psychological tools that could make

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:21.259
us stronger.

00:17:21.259 --> 00:17:28.160
It's like Popeye and spinach, really. I'm
sure you all know Popeye the Sailor. He was

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:33.200
even a Google Doodle in December of 2009.
Are you familiar with it? OK. So for those

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:40.710
who aren't up on their Depression cartoons,
Popeye is a pipe-smoking sailor who gets strong

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:43.649
by eating spinach, mostly from a can.

00:17:43.649 --> 00:17:51.120
So, that's disgusting. But really, the spinach.
So, well complaints are like spinach. They

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:56.929
could make us all stronger if we use them
correctly, but we don't. It's as if Popeye,

00:17:56.929 --> 00:18:02.730
instead of eating the spinach, just stuffed
it into his pipe, smoked it, and got emphysema

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.710
and then thought, "Oh, complaints are bad."

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:13.149
No. How we use them is bad. So let's discuss
how to use complaints correctly: how to eat

00:18:13.149 --> 00:18:18.799
the spinach rather than smoke it; how to complain
effectively; how to get results and improve

00:18:18.799 --> 00:18:26.220
our quality of life. Now, to be able to complain
effectively, we have to master a fundamental

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.220
problem.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:37.410
We have to get our complaint through the other
person's defense mechanisms. Pause. Think

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:41.779
back to the last time you got home at night
and your significant other turned to you and

00:18:41.779 --> 00:18:49.370
said, "We have to talk." I'm assuming there
went your mood for the evening because you

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:52.120
immediately felt defensive like you were going
to be attacked.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:58.419
That's how we feel about complaints like we're
going to be attacked. And so, what it does

00:18:58.419 --> 00:19:04.740
is it triggers the fight or flight responses
when we even sniff a complaint coming our

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:10.080
way. We either want to raise the drawbridge,
flood the moat, and release the crocodiles.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:18.559
Or, we want to escape the situation as rapidly
as possible. For our complaint to be effective,

00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:24.200
we have to voice it in a way that's the least
likely to trigger the other person's defenses,

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:30.620
or at least trigger them on their lowest possible
setting. The problem is that our urge to complain

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:36.019
is at its all-time strongest when we are at
our most annoyed.

00:19:36.019 --> 00:19:41.039
But the angrier we sound, the more defensive
the other person gets and the less able they

00:19:41.039 --> 00:19:47.690
will be to take in our complaint. And there
is our complaining predicament. Our defensiveness

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:55.100
and their anger means we'll get an ineffective
result and someone ends up sleeping on the

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.100
couch.

00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:00.590
Now, to illustrate these dynamics and the
solutions to them, I'm gonna give you three

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:05.919
common examples of complaints I hear all the
time, both in my office from patients and

00:20:05.919 --> 00:20:10.639
from friends. I chose common ones that you
should be able to relate to. I'm gonna read

00:20:10.639 --> 00:20:15.059
you three scenarios and I want you to imagine
yourself in these scenarios.

00:20:15.059 --> 00:20:20.340
Here's scenario number one. You're waiting
for your significant other at the movie theater.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:25.110
You've been dying to see the new movie everyone
is talking about, but you've already missed

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:30.570
the first ten minutes of the film because
your honey, as usual, is late.

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:34.850
Now, let's randomly assign genders to these
scenarios just for illustration purposes.

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:42.730
And let's just randomly say the significant
other in this scenario is a woman. Just randomly.

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:47.730
Scenario two. Your significant other has been
working around the clock and you finally have

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:51.590
a free night together to enjoy a romantic
dinner.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:56.600
But you haven't been able to complete one
train of thought because every few seconds

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:02.619
your honey glances over at their Android or
smartphone to check or respond to emails.

00:21:02.619 --> 00:21:07.299
Now let's randomly say the significant other
in this scenario is a man. Again, randomly.

00:21:07.299 --> 00:21:14.470
And lastly, scenario three, you went through
major trouble for your significant other's

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:20.610
birthday and you threw them a surprise party
with all their friends. You wake up on your

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:26.669
birthday all excited to find a gift certificate
on the kitchen counter with a Post-it saying,

00:21:26.669 --> 00:21:29.149
"Happy Birthday Honey."

00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:33.960
Now, this one I typically hear from both genders.
Let's take a quick vote. Who says this significant

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:39.889
other is a woman in this one? Was an easy
vote. And a man? OK. So.

00:21:39.889 --> 00:21:40.889
[laughter]

00:21:40.889 --> 00:21:47.179
Apparently men are really bad gift-givers.
OK, so now we have our scenarios. Chronic

00:21:47.179 --> 00:21:54.029
lateness, smartphone attached like a Siamese
twin, and a birthday reciprocity failure.

00:21:54.029 --> 00:21:59.499
Now, I'm gonna give you some quotes how actual
people I know complain, this is their actual

00:21:59.499 --> 00:22:04.669
complaint. These are quotes, what they said
in these situations. Here's the lateness situation.

00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:10.820
"About flipping time. The movie started ten
minutes ago. I am sick and tired of you being

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.679
late all the time. I'm tired of it."

00:22:13.679 --> 00:22:19.009
And as you know, I practice in New York. So
yes, I did paraphrase one of those words.

00:22:19.009 --> 00:22:20.889
[laughter]

00:22:20.889 --> 00:22:27.279
Scenario two. The smartphone. "I swear if
you don't put that bleeping phone away right

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:33.299
now I will break it into a thousand pieces
and shove them down your throat." Yes. She's

00:22:33.299 --> 00:22:37.559
a delicate flower, that one.

00:22:37.559 --> 00:22:43.110
And scenario three, the gift. "You're giving
me a gift certificate for my birthday? Are

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:48.039
you kidding me? You gave your five-year old
nephew a gift certificate for his birthday

00:22:48.039 --> 00:22:55.379
and you think he's a spoiled brat." So, you
might have every right to feel furious or

00:22:55.379 --> 00:22:58.970
frustrated or hurt in these situations.

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:07.669
The question is are those complaints effective?
No. Does raising our voice or losing our temper

00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:14.460
motivate the other person to take responsibility?
No. Do curses and threats compel people to

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.799
think through their behavior, see the error
of their ways, and vow to change?

00:23:18.799 --> 00:23:27.809
No. If we want the other person to hear us,
to respond, to change, we have to forego the

00:23:27.809 --> 00:23:34.470
brief, albeit sweet satisfaction of telling
them off, of scoring points, of winning the

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:41.840
argument, and go for the far deeper and longer-lasting
satisfaction of getting a meaningful result.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:49.830
Sad as it is we cannot do both. The only way
to get the other person to hear us, to digest

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:55.989
what we're saying is to make our complaint
as delicious as possible by using the complaint

00:23:55.989 --> 00:24:03.860
sandwich. The complaint sandwich is a simple
technique that makes any complaint more effective.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:10.590
It involves sandwiching the meat, the actual
complaint between two positive statements,

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:16.619
the bread. And that does three things. It
prevents the complaint recipient from becoming

00:24:16.619 --> 00:24:21.989
too defensive. It focuses the attention of
the other person on our actual complaint,

00:24:21.989 --> 00:24:25.299
as opposed to on our anger or our attitude.

00:24:25.299 --> 00:24:31.730
And it increases the likelihood the complaint
recipient will respond positively. Now, the

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:37.009
structure of the complaint sandwich has three
elements. It's simple, but the details are

00:24:37.009 --> 00:24:43.659
not. So, let's look at them. The first slice
of bread, the positive statement, I call the

00:24:43.659 --> 00:24:44.659
"ear opener."

00:24:44.659 --> 00:24:50.389
And its purpose is to do just that, to keep
the ears of the complaint recipient open to

00:24:50.389 --> 00:24:56.649
our actual complaint to follow. But coming
up with a positive statement in some of these

00:24:56.649 --> 00:25:01.360
situations is trickier than it seems. When
I do this in my office with some patients--let's

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.889
say there's a husband who's annoyed with his
wife about something with the kids, and I

00:25:04.889 --> 00:25:09.450
say, "Give it a try." And he goes, "That's
no problem. Um, nice blouse."

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:10.450
[laughter]

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:16.580
No. No. Unless his complaint is about her
clothing, no. So, and let's look at what the

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:22.149
ear openers would be for our three situations.
Here is the lateness situation. "Honey, I

00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:27.019
know you make an effort to be on time." Now,
some of you might think, "She's always late.

00:25:27.019 --> 00:25:28.440
How is that something he can say?"

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:34.169
Well, people who are always late are actually
trying to be on time. They're constantly rushed

00:25:34.169 --> 00:25:39.379
and trying. They're trying to be on time.
They're just horrible at it. So, we can say

00:25:39.379 --> 00:25:45.200
you made an effort. Terrible, but you made
an effort. So, here's the second scenario--the

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.200
phone.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:51.539
"Babe, I know how hard it is to have a job
where they expect you to respond to emails

00:25:51.539 --> 00:25:55.070
after hour," because most people that have
that job would rather not so we can easily

00:25:55.070 --> 00:26:01.179
say that. And in the gift scenario, "I know
I'm not easy to shop for, especially on birthdays

00:26:01.179 --> 00:26:06.269
and holidays." And really, most adults aren't
easy to shop for because if we want something,

00:26:06.269 --> 00:26:07.269
we get it for ourselves.

00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:12.389
So, it's not, we can always say that. I think
that's an easy one. Now, the meat of the complaint

00:26:12.389 --> 00:26:18.110
sandwich is our actual complaint. And here,
the idea, the meat should be lean. We don't

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:23.259
want to marinate our meat in sarcasm or anger.
That doesn't do any good.

00:26:23.259 --> 00:26:30.059
And, we wanna stick to only one specific incident.
Now, yes. It's terribly tempting to point

00:26:30.059 --> 00:26:35.830
out all the other times the person was late.
All the dinners that were ruined because of

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:40.889
the smartphone. Every birthday and holiday
in which the gifts were inappropriate, starting

00:26:40.889 --> 00:26:43.049
with the Christmas debacle of 2003.

00:26:43.049 --> 00:26:50.119
But it's not useful. All that does is overwhelm
the other person and then they get defensive

00:26:50.119 --> 00:26:55.200
and they stop listening because they're busy
planning their rebuttal. That's what they’re

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.809
doing. And they're busy thinking of a counterattack
and they're busy wondering why they're with

00:26:58.809 --> 00:26:59.980
us in the first place.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.850
And do we realize our face looks funny when
we get that angry. So it's not useful.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:06.970
[laughter]

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:11.340
So let's look at what the meats would be for
our complaint situations. Here's the lateness

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:17.200
situation. "Waiting for you made me really
tense and irritable because I don't know how

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.940
late you'll be. I can't just switch these
feelings off when you arrive so then I can't

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.200
enjoy what we're doing."

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:28.139
And here you'll notice it's all "I" statements.
It's about explaining to the other person,

00:27:28.139 --> 00:27:32.070
"Here's what goes wrong for me." Not, "You're
late," or "You're inconsiderate." Here's what

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:37.929
happens. The second scenario is the phones.
"Unfortunately, it's impossible for me to

00:27:37.929 --> 00:27:43.190
relax, have a conversation and enjoy your
company when you're checking your phone every

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:46.190
few minutes. It's just too disruptive."

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:52.289
Again, these are "I" statements. And in the
third, "A gift card doesn't require much thought

00:27:52.289 --> 00:27:57.789
or effort, so regardless of what's in it or
where it's from, it just feels impersonal

00:27:57.789 --> 00:28:04.309
and disappointing." So it's a complaint, but
it's an explanation as well. The last slice

00:28:04.309 --> 00:28:07.789
of bread is a positive statement I call the
"digestive."

00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:12.529
And that is that spoon full of sugar that
helps the medicine go down. It also provides

00:28:12.529 --> 00:28:16.779
incentive for the other person to respond
positively because it should make it appear

00:28:16.779 --> 00:28:20.789
to them what they can do to rectify the situation.

00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:24.809
When we get a complaint and we know, "Oh,
we can do this and things will be better,”

00:28:24.809 --> 00:28:29.320
it's so much easier to just do this than when
somebody's just really upset and we're not

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:34.519
sure what we can do about it. So, and when
people ask me for complaining advice, I say,

00:28:34.519 --> 00:28:35.519
"Well, what's the scenario?"

00:28:35.519 --> 00:28:38.799
And they tell me. And I say, "Well, what is
it you want to achieve?" And they always look

00:28:38.799 --> 00:28:44.279
at me and they go, "Uhhh." They're not sure.
And the idea is, think it through because

00:28:44.279 --> 00:28:49.049
once you know what you actually want to achieve,
it'll really help to direct you in terms of

00:28:49.049 --> 00:28:51.039
how you complain, to whom you complain.

00:28:51.039 --> 00:28:56.789
It's very useful. Let's look at the digesters
for our scenarios. Here's the lateness one.

00:28:56.789 --> 00:29:00.690
"If you could promise to be on time when you
know something is important to me, I'll promise

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:05.570
to really appreciate it because I'll know
it took a huge effort." Now, it's hard to

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:07.340
get the late person to be on time.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:12.899
But that works so much better than the threats
and the anger. That motivates them to at least

00:29:12.899 --> 00:29:17.190
to trying. The second scenario with the phones.
"If we agreed to turn off our phones when

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:22.279
we're having dinner or talking about something
important it would allow me to enjoy our time

00:29:22.279 --> 00:29:24.470
together so much more."

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:29.119
And some people say to me, "Well I can't just
be off for an hour. I work for this investment

00:29:29.119 --> 00:29:35.230
bank or whatever." And I say, "Fine. Take
five minutes in the middle of the dinner.

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:37.379
Turn the phone on. Check. Respond and turn
it off again, but spend 55 minutes with the

00:29:37.379 --> 00:29:39.029
other person."

00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:46.379
And the last scenario is, there we go. "I
know you worry about getting me the wrong

00:29:46.379 --> 00:29:51.899
thing but I promise if it's obvious you put
thought into a gift, I'll always be pleased."

00:29:51.899 --> 00:29:53.249
Which is a nice way to say it.

00:29:53.249 --> 00:29:58.649
Now, when I work with couples and they start
using the complaint sandwich with one another,

00:29:58.649 --> 00:30:03.019
all of their arguments get easier because
the minute they see somebody racking their

00:30:03.019 --> 00:30:07.960
brain and starting with this ear opener thing,
the other person starts smiling and says,

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.629
"Oh, you're gonna serve me a complaint sandwich."

00:30:10.629 --> 00:30:14.980
And there's much less tension and then they're
actually discussing things. It's really useful.

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:21.369
It's like shorthand for "Let's not argue,
but" And it's really great. Now, complaining

00:30:21.369 --> 00:30:26.210
in a relationship is a two-way street. So
I also want to tell you how to eat a complaint

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:29.650
sandwich, or really how to respond to a complaint
whether it's served to you as a sandwich or

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:30.650
not.

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:37.980
When it comes to being on the receiving end
of a complaint, one of the most common mistakes

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:45.159
people make and by people I mean men is to
interrupt the other person with an explanation

00:30:45.159 --> 00:30:49.889
or a solution or an apology before they've
finished speaking. Familiar, is it?

00:30:49.889 --> 00:30:55.389
It should be. Now, all that does is frustrate
the other person more because from their perspective,

00:30:55.389 --> 00:31:00.669
until they've finished telling you why they're
upset, any solution or any apology you make,

00:31:00.669 --> 00:31:04.570
doesn't seem authentic 'cause you don't yet
know what you're apologizing for.

00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:09.889
So, principle number one. Do not interrupt
the initial complaint, however long it takes.

00:31:09.889 --> 00:31:16.110
If I can do that with my mother, you can do
that with other people because she goes on

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:17.919
forever.

00:31:17.919 --> 00:31:19.730
[laughter]

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:25.779
The other thing is verify you understand exactly
why the other person is upset. One of the

00:31:25.779 --> 00:31:31.039
most common things that happen is that one
person is complaining about X and the other

00:31:31.039 --> 00:31:32.619
person is complaining about Y.

00:31:32.619 --> 00:31:36.320
And so, they're actually not talking about
exactly the same thing. And then they both

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.809
feel unheard and they start to repeat themselves.
I'm sure you've had these arguments. You're

00:31:37.809 --> 00:31:42.869
saying the same thing. They're saying the
same thing. You can script their next response.

00:31:42.869 --> 00:31:47.679
You're going around and around. Nothing really
is happening, but you keep at it for some

00:31:47.679 --> 00:31:52.410
reason. That happens because you're not exactly
talking about the same thing. For example,

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:57.259
in the birthday gift scenario, if the person
just said, "I'm really annoyed about the gift."

00:31:57.259 --> 00:32:02.149
Then you might think, "Oh, because I left
it on the counter and didn't give it to her

00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:07.169
in person." Or, "because there wasn't a card."
Or because "maybe that wasn't the right store."

00:32:07.169 --> 00:32:11.659
Or, "maybe I exceeded the budget we had agreed
on." You can come up with five different scenarios

00:32:11.659 --> 00:32:13.399
of why they might be upset.

00:32:13.399 --> 00:32:18.369
So one thing I suggest is when the other person's
upset, verify you understand exactly what

00:32:18.369 --> 00:32:23.389
it's about. You can say, "I just want to understand
to make sure I understand exactly why you're

00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:28.269
upset. Is it this?" And by the way, that sentence
alone, relationship gold.

00:32:28.269 --> 00:32:32.929
Trust me. It really reassures the other person
you're trying to understand. So, do that.

00:32:32.929 --> 00:32:38.480
And the last thing is acknowledge the other
person's feelings. You might not feel it's

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:42.669
your fault. You might feel that they're in
the wrong. But it doesn't cost you anything

00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:44.700
to just acknowledge how they feel.

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:49.809
You're not taking responsibility by doing
that. You're not ceding any ground. You can

00:32:49.809 --> 00:32:56.399
certainly say, "Honey, I can imagine how furious
you were that I was 30 minutes late to a movie

00:32:56.399 --> 00:33:02.489
you wanted to see so badly." And then say,
"But your email said 8 o'clock, not 7:30."

00:33:02.489 --> 00:33:09.350
So understanding their feelings and conveying
that doesn't cost you anything. Being on the

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:15.979
receiving end of complaints is not easy for
anyone. But it is perhaps hardest of all for

00:33:15.979 --> 00:33:21.200
call center representatives, the people who
answer the phone when we call a customer service,

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:28.500
or a technical support, or a sales hotline
because they get yelled at for a living.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:33.869
Now, Google began offering free phone support
for its AdWords customers in North America,

00:33:33.869 --> 00:33:39.539
I think in April. And I haven't spoken to
any of those people, but their jobs are anything

00:33:39.539 --> 00:33:46.679
like those in other call centers, then they're
dealing with a huge amount of customer hostility.

00:33:46.679 --> 00:33:54.389
How much? Studies show that call center representatives
can deal with an average of ten hostile calls

00:33:54.389 --> 00:34:02.090
a day. And I want to be clear what I mean
when I say hostile. We're talking curses,

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:06.820
yelling, put-downs, insults, ridicule, personal
threats and even death threats.

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:12.860
Truly. Now think about it a moment. I mean
really ask yourselves have you ever called

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:19.089
a customer hotline and raised your voice?
Most of us have. And you might be nice people.

00:34:19.089 --> 00:34:24.039
Think about the not-nice people who do it.
Now, we wouldn't speak that way to anyone

00:34:24.039 --> 00:34:29.619
else in our lives, but when it comes to call
center employees, it's open season.

00:34:29.619 --> 00:34:35.260
And part of the reason is because of the systems
that some companies, not all, but some companies

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:40.789
put in place, really annoying systems. It
starts with the automated menus. They ask

00:34:40.789 --> 00:34:43.669
for your account number, your social security
number, your date of birth.

00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:50.629
They want to know your mother's maiden name,
the name of your first pet, the serial number

00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:54.129
of the washing machine that's at the bottom
of the machine, but it's bolted to your basement

00:34:54.129 --> 00:35:01.200
floor. Then you finally get through to a recording
who tells you, without a shred of irony, that

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.609
your time is really valuable to the company
who's very busy wasting it.

00:35:04.609 --> 00:35:06.059
[laughter]

00:35:06.059 --> 00:35:14.000
And then you finally get to a live person
and they have a foreign accent. Isn't that

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.520
annoying? OK. So, and that person then just
proceeds to ask you all the same questions

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:22.270
all over again, while mispronouncing your
name. Now, my name is simple.

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:26.980
Guy and Winch. It's one syllable apiece. And
yet, here's some of the things that I get.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:30.380
"How can I help you Mr. Wank?"

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:31.380
[laughter]

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:38.650
"Yes, Mr. Witch." And my favorite "Let me
bring up your account Mr. Wench. Can I call

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:39.650
you Gay?"

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:40.650
[laughter]

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:46.260
So, we were annoyed before we even called.
Let alone after that obstacle course, the

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:50.570
things is many companies have things in place
which they call "planned inconvenience."

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:54.650
And their idea is to make it that difficult
for customers to get through, so customers

00:35:54.650 --> 00:36:00.130
will drop out. Here's the genius. They then
have to hire fewer call center representatives

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:05.720
and great, they're saving money. Except that
when people actually do get through, they

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:11.440
have so much more anger and hostility which
they unleash on those call center representatives

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:14.070
that the call center representatives can't
take it.

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:20.140
And they end up leaving after a few months
or a year. Call center work is one of the

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:25.250
most stressful jobs that there are and it
has one of the highest drop-out rates of any

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:30.660
industry. People just can't take it. It affects
their mental health. It affects their physical

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:31.660
health.

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:35.460
And so, they leave. And what happens then
is those companies might have saved money

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:40.230
on the reps, but now they have to invest money
in hiring new people, in training new people,

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:44.190
and then guess what? Those new people are
less experienced so they don't know what they're

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:45.190
doing.

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:48.730
So they get even angrier, so they leave even
sooner. And on and on the vicious cycle goes.

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:55.410
Nobody wins. Now, while our anger might be
justified, the people we're calling are entry

00:36:55.410 --> 00:37:02.730
level employees with limited authority. And
civility and respect will illicit far more

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:05.990
help and effort on their part than yelling
and cursing.

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:11.070
I sometimes, when I'm really annoyed, will
say, "I'm glad to speak with you. I'm sorry

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:15.540
if I sound annoyed, I'm just really frustrated
and I hope you can help me, but it's really

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:19.900
not at you so please don't take it personally."
And that disclaimer alone? They go, "Oh, great."

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:26.059
And they're much happier about it. The things
is, what do companies do to help call center

00:37:26.059 --> 00:37:30.750
employees manage the stress? They tell them
in their brief week or so of training, "Ooh,

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:34.549
we're gonna give you techniques to manage
stress. Here's technique number one. You can

00:37:34.549 --> 00:37:36.940
ask the customer to stop yelling."

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:37.940
[laughter]

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:44.640
Glad we went for that one. "And here's another
technique," they say. "Write down the number

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:50.119
of curses because most customers only have
seven juicy curses in them." I mean, that's

00:37:50.119 --> 00:37:56.099
like saying to a boxer, "Let your opponent
keep hitting you in the face because eventually

00:37:56.099 --> 00:37:57.740
they'll get exhausted."

00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:58.740
[laughter]

00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:06.039
In other words, most companies do very, very
little to help their call center employees.

00:38:06.039 --> 00:38:11.330
The problem is the companies don't understand
complaining psychology. If they taught complaining

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:14.720
psychology to call center reps, it would help
them because A, they would understand where

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:19.170
the customers are coming from and it would
help them know how exactly to diffuse the

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:20.170
anger.

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:24.780
But companies, even the executives, don't
understand. They don't understand that complaints

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:30.079
are like gold to them. Companies spend tens
of thousands of dollars on focus groups. And

00:38:30.079 --> 00:38:32.450
complaints are free focus groups.

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:36.890
They're telling you about problems with your
products, or your procedures, or your services,

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:42.109
which you can just fix and avoid other problems
and avoid customers complaining or leaving

00:38:42.109 --> 00:38:48.440
or spreading bad word about you. But they
don't do it. The tragedy of our complaining

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:54.789
psychology is that most people know so little
about it, everyone loses.

00:38:54.789 --> 00:38:58.720
Our relationships suffer because we don't
know how to voice our satisfactions without

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:04.789
starting an argument. Our self-esteem suffers
because we feel powerless to get results.

00:39:04.789 --> 00:39:10.390
Call center employees suffer. Customers lose
and companies lose.

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:15.680
The good news is we can start turning that
around right now and make a difference in

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:22.170
our own lives and our own communities, because
there are only three things required to have

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:27.270
an impact for you, for anyone. We need complaining
savvy, which now you have a little bit of,

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:31.950
persistence and a belief that your complaint
is right.

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:38.470
Sometimes, only a few people can make a difference
in a community and sometimes it only takes

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:43.630
one person. And just to illustrate that point
of how much of a difference one person can

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:50.430
make, I'm going to tell you about Beckie Williams
and her extra-large brassiere.

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:57.069
Ms. Williams' story began in the fall of 2007,
when as a 25-year old copywriter for children's

00:39:57.069 --> 00:40:01.530
books in England, she was shopping for brassieres
in Marks and Spencer, which I don't know if

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:06.890
you know, it's one of the largest retailers
in all of England. And she noticed something

00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:08.140
strange.

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:14.730
Bras that were sized double D and larger,
had a two pound surcharge. That's three dollars

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:22.869
and change. And being in the larger category
herself, she was a little annoyed by the pricing

00:40:22.869 --> 00:40:28.960
discrepancy so she got home and dashed off
a letter to Marks and Spencer saying, "Why

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:29.960
am I paying more for my bras?"

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:34.609
And they wrote back saying, "Well, it's to
defray the costs of extra material the extra-large

00:40:34.609 --> 00:40:40.990
bras require." And she thought, "Well, my
blouses have extra material and I don't pay

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:45.819
more for those." So that didn't make sense
to her. So she wrote back to Marks and Spencer

00:40:45.819 --> 00:40:47.750
to point out all the flaws in their logic
and didn't hear from them.

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:56.809
Marks and Spencer didn't respond. So, she
was discussing this issue with some of her

00:40:56.809 --> 00:41:03.401
busty friends as she calls them when she realized
she doesn't like complaining without doing

00:41:03.401 --> 00:41:09.390
something. So she decided she's going to do
something. So she started a Facebook group

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:13.119
to petition Marks and Spencer about their
pricing discrepancy.

00:41:13.119 --> 00:41:21.250
And she called the group "Busts for Justice."
Busts for Justice immediately swelled with

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:27.849
over 100 new members. So much so that a journalist
in London saw the group and decided to write

00:41:27.849 --> 00:41:33.480
a small story about it in a London newspaper
in which Beckie Williams appeared outside

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:36.720
Marks and Spencer’s with one of her brassieres.

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:43.549
In the week following that national exposure,
the Busts for Justice Facebook group ballooned

00:41:43.549 --> 00:41:50.369
to huge proportions with over eight thousand
new participants. And we're counting people,

00:41:50.369 --> 00:41:56.160
by the way, as participants, who all started
writing the company and Marks and Spencer

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:59.450
thought we'll issue a statement.

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:03.270
And what their statement said was, "Very few
companies make those kinds of extra-large

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:07.579
brassieres. Those ladies should be grateful.
We're not willing to jiggle our price one

00:42:07.579 --> 00:42:14.300
bit." Which was slightly short-sighted on
their part. So the discussion boards, when

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:20.160
that happened on Busts for Justice, teemed
with activity and Marks and Spencer realized

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:21.160
"oops."

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:25.270
So they called Beckie Williams up for a meeting
in which they said to her, "We're gonna discuss

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:30.470
pricing options with our manufacturers in
China." Great. But then, the recession of

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:36.780
2008 hit. And in Great Britain as well. And
Marks and Spencer said, "Well, in this economic

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:39.440
climate there's nothing we can do."

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:45.990
And they stopped returning her calls. Now,
you might think, "Well, what more can she

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:52.599
do, this 25-year old?" Right? But Beckie Williams
had complaining savvy and she had persistence

00:42:52.599 --> 00:42:58.859
and she really believed she was right. So
here's what she did. In May of 2009, she went

00:42:58.859 --> 00:43:04.770
out and bought one share of Marks and Spencer
stock for roughly five dollars.

00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:09.829
And then she called the journalist that put
the story in the London paper and told her

00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:16.609
that she and some of her busty friends will
be attending the annual stockholders meeting

00:43:16.609 --> 00:43:21.839
of Marks and Spencer in July where they will
personally confront in person the Chair of

00:43:21.839 --> 00:43:26.059
the company about their discriminatory pricing
policies.

00:43:26.059 --> 00:43:30.450
And the journalist knew a good story when
she heard it and by the next morning, Beckie

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:36.480
Williams was on her way to London to tape
a segment in a very popular breakfast television

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:44.430
show in which she described the upcoming confrontation.
Forty-eight hours later, Marks and Spencer

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:45.579
folded.

00:43:45.579 --> 00:43:53.250
They not only agreed to price all bras equally,
they actually issued an apology to Beckie

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:59.420
Williams and her Facebook group. Now, being
a British company, they absolutely had to

00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:03.039
insert the obligatory pun. So, their apology
was "We Boobed!"

00:44:03.039 --> 00:44:04.910
[laughter]

00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:09.460
But finally taking advantage of the amazing
marketing opportunity that had been staring

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:16.890
them in the face all along, they announced
a one-week bra sale to usher in this new era

00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:20.700
of bra size equality.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:27.020
Beckie Williams started out by writing a letter
about a biased pricing policy and ending up

00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:33.339
creating change on a national level that affected
tens of thousands of women. And what's remarkable

00:44:33.339 --> 00:44:38.800
is she did all of it without lawyers, without
financing, without candlelit marches.

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:47.799
She only used three things we all have: complaining
savvy, assistance, and a belief she was right.

00:44:47.799 --> 00:44:53.660
Complaints can be powerful things. If we use
them correctly, they can truly be our spinach.

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:58.289
They can get us results when we have been
wronged. They can get our relationships back

00:44:58.289 --> 00:45:00.410
on track when they've derailed.

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:05.049
They can improve our communities and they
can help us feel stronger and better about

00:45:05.049 --> 00:45:10.910
ourselves. Complaints can help companies serve
their customers better by improving their

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:18.349
products and their services and becoming more
profitable by doing that. Life presents us

00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:23.349
with challenges and dissatisfactions every
single day.

00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:29.359
The next time you find yourself venting to
someone who can't fix the problem instead

00:45:29.359 --> 00:45:34.720
of to someone who can, remember that the door
to your own psychological revolution could

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:42.240
start with that very complaint. If instead
of just squeaking, you squeak effectively.

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:48.079
Thank you very much.

00:45:48.079 --> 00:45:50.809
[applause]

00:45:50.809 --> 00:45:53.119
So I think we're doing a Q&amp;A. I'll take the
As.

00:45:53.119 --> 00:45:54.119
[laughter]
Any Qs?

00:45:54.119 --> 00:46:02.829
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: I have a question.
Thank you very much for your talk. First of

00:46:02.829 --> 00:46:06.609
all, did you take an actor class somewhere,
sometime?

00:46:06.609 --> 00:46:08.500
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: I'm sorry?

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:13.369
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Did you take an
actor class sometime?

00:46:13.369 --> 00:46:14.369
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: A what class? A lecture class?

00:46:14.369 --> 00:46:15.369
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Actor.

00:46:15.369 --> 00:46:16.369
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: Actor class. No. I did not. Why?
I'm sorry. No.

00:46:16.369 --> 00:46:17.369
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: That's OK. The
second question is--

00:46:17.369 --> 00:46:18.369
[laughter]

00:46:18.369 --> 00:46:26.140
I think the--. You haven't so like really
described the fundamental problem behind the

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:34.930
lack of complaining is that people afraid
to confront other people. And those 5% who

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:44.510
do complain, they don't afraid to confront
other people in general. So how can people

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:48.810
like raise their ability to confront others?

00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:50.550
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: OK. That's a very good question,
but there are two aspects there. First of

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:55.109
all, many of our complaints are not gonna
be in-person confrontations. We can write

00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:56.829
letters. That's not very confrontative.

00:46:56.829 --> 00:47:03.059
But the whole idea, for example, of the complaint
sandwich is that it doesn't feel like a confrontation

00:47:03.059 --> 00:47:07.470
when you do it that way. It doesn't feel like
it to you, as a complainer, and it doesn't

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:11.859
feel like it to the other person. It feels
much more like a pleasant transaction.

00:47:11.859 --> 00:47:16.680
The whole idea of the confrontation is that
we wait and then we bring so much anger to

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:21.650
the complaining situation because of our psychology
that it turns into a confrontation. But my

00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:27.130
point is exactly that's the wrong approach.
We should just voice things. Do it pleasantly.

00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:32.260
Start positively. And it feels much less like
a confrontation and much easier for most of

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:51.160
us to do because most of us don't enjoy confrontations.
That's a great question. Thank you.

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.200
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: OK. Thank you.

00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.200
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Hello.

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.200
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: Hi.

00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:57.200
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Do you have any
recommendations on how to change the way people

00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:58.200
complain to you that aren't someone like your
partner that you can work constructively with?

00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:59.200
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: Yes.

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.200
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: So like strangers
on the street in New York, for example, that

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.200
seem to want to put their anger and frustration
onto me? For example.

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.200
[laughter]

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:03.200
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: I don't know what you're doing
to the people when you're walking down the

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.200
street.

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.200
[laughter]

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.200
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Do you want a
better example?

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:10.359
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: Well, the strangers in the street
in New York just specifically, it might be

00:48:10.359 --> 00:48:12.160
better to just keep walking. But--

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:21.150
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: So, I’ll give
you an example. So, I was hiking a few weekends

00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:26.940
ago and stopped at a restaurant after my hike
with my friend to have a beer and whatever,

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:29.069
or a snack, and we were stretching on the
porch--

00:48:29.069 --> 00:48:30.069
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: Mm-hmm.

00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:33.569
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: by our table
while we were waiting for our food. And then

00:48:33.569 --> 00:48:38.079
sat down when our food arrived and had a pleasant
meal. And when we left, the guy sitting next

00:48:38.079 --> 00:48:46.880
to us said under his breath, but loud enough
so we could hear it, "Thank God they're leaving."

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:52.599
And, "Get a gym next time." I just kept walking,
but this seems to happen to me all the time

00:48:52.599 --> 00:48:53.730
for some reason. I don't know why.

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:54.730
[laughter]

00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:56.960
And I can't really exactly go back to him
and say, "Hey, can you give that to me in

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:57.960
a complaint sandwich next time?"

00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:58.960
[laughter]

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:01.660
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: Well, no. But look. First of
all, I'm not sure where else you're stretching.

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:06.190
But other than that, but here's what you can
say. I mean, I would turn to the person and

00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:11.300
say, "You know if that really bothered you
all you had to do was say something." In other

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:12.619
words, I'm really--.

00:49:12.619 --> 00:49:18.010
Since I wrote my book, I've become horribly
annoying because I will actually, no, it's

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:21.520
true. I will actually educate people about
when they complain to me I'll give them pointers.

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:22.520
Like,--

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:23.520
[FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2 laughs]

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:28.280
"Oh, you know what? Your anger was OK, but
here's what you should really try."

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:29.280
[laughter]

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:32.599
And they're like, "What?" And I'm like, "You
see, you started by telling me that I'm a

00:49:32.599 --> 00:49:33.599
douchebag, but--

00:49:33.599 --> 00:49:34.599
[laughter]

00:49:34.599 --> 00:49:39.330
if in fact you started with a 'why' and then
gave me the douchebag, I would've listened

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:40.330
more." I mean, so it's very annoying, but
I'll go it.

00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:41.330
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: OK. That's really
helpful. Thank you.

00:49:41.330 --> 00:49:42.330
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: Any other stretchers?

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:43.330
[laughter]

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:44.330
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Don't you agree
that there's just a certain segment of the

00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:45.330
population that just complains for no reason?
They don't want results. It's just a way of

00:49:45.330 --> 00:50:00.780
whining or attention grabbing and what are
your thoughts on that?

00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:08.829
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: Absolutely. There are chronic
complainers. I talk about them in my book.

00:50:08.829 --> 00:50:13.019
I didn't really have time to address them
here. But there are chronic complainers. They're

00:50:13.019 --> 00:50:18.890
not a majority, but there are people who really
dissatisfied with everything.

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:22.960
It has much more to do with how they perceive
the world because they don't see themselves

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:27.519
as complaining. They just see their lives
as very bleak and they're responding to it

00:50:27.519 --> 00:50:33.829
accurately. But they don't want to hear solutions.
They don't want to be cheered up. They just

00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:38.950
want to be validated like, "Yes, things are
so terrible for you."

00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:39.950
[laughter]

00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:42.430
That's what makes them happy. If you try and
tell them things are not so terrible, they're

00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:46.450
not gonna be happy. But if you go, "Oh, that's
just terrible," you'll see the [sighs], they're

00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:47.579
just so pleased.

00:50:47.579 --> 00:50:48.579
[laughter]

00:50:48.579 --> 00:50:54.789
And maybe you know those people. And the thing
is yes, some people, and they're gonna complain.

00:50:54.789 --> 00:50:58.130
It's gonna be very, very hard to change them
but there aren't that many of them. But they

00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:03.099
usually, there's one or two around everywhere.
And once you know it you can just steer clear

00:51:03.099 --> 00:51:09.510
by just going, "Oh yes, that's terrible."
And keep walking and get into trying to, "No,

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:13.470
but it's really not that bad." 'Cause that
just, they'll tell you why it is and it'll

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:15.570
just go on forever. But yes, there are people
like that.

00:51:15.570 --> 00:51:31.660
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Hey. This actually
happened like last week. So, I was in a taxi

00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:48.950
and I, that was like very early in the morning
and I asked the taxi driver to take me to

00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:56.869
a place. And he charged me like extensively
strong.

00:51:56.869 --> 00:52:08.503
So I asked him to take me to a certain place
and then I changed the direction and I told

00:52:08.503 --> 00:52:13.609
him to go to another place and then he just
doubled the price.

00:52:13.609 --> 00:52:20.740
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: What do you mean? There was a
price on the meter and he just doubled it?

00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:26.410
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: No, it's not on
the meter. He initially told me it was like

00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:34.090
30 dollars or something and then later he
said 65. So, and then I tried arguing with

00:52:34.090 --> 00:52:44.069
him and then he started yelling at me. So
that was a position where I just couldn't

00:52:44.069 --> 00:53:00.770
help but then budge to him saying that, "OK,
whatever be it, I'll just pay it and leave."

00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:02.750
And ever since that night, I've complained
to three other people after that about the

00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:36.190
same situation. There was no other goal but
to complain about it, so how would you deal

00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:41.820
with such situation?

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:58.089
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: Look. I'll tell you what I would
do in that situation, but New York cabs is

00:53:58.089 --> 00:54:05.150
just another book, isn't it? But I would just
say to him, "Look, I can give you the extra

00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:15.890
money you want and I'll be writing a letter
to the TLC with all your information. Or,

00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:21.990
I can give you the money we agreed upon in
the first place plus a nice tip. It's your

00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:23.579
choice. You tell me what you want."

00:54:23.579 --> 00:54:36.810
I think that's the best you can do in those
kinds of scenarios. Do you know what the TLC

00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:46.770
is? It's the Taxi and Limousine Commission.
There's usually a number posted in cabs and

00:54:46.770 --> 00:55:04.579
livery cabs that you can. They have a number
for complaints. I never called it. I don't

00:55:04.579 --> 00:55:18.029
know how responsive they are. But yes, I would
offer the option.

00:55:18.029 --> 00:55:28.410
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Yeah, so I was
basically considering that option but then

00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:39.390
I just didn't go ahead and do it.

00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:43.109
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: But I think if you had, for example,
you would've felt better about it.

00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:49.250
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Yeah. Yeah.

00:55:49.250 --> 00:56:01.329
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: Hi. So, I'm one
of these people that never complains at restaurants,

00:56:01.329 --> 00:56:04.520
right? And I think and I've been thinking
about it while you've been talking and sending

00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:05.730
your food back is a huge hassle and it disrupts
your meal.

00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:06.770
You don't really want to do that. I don't
wanna be perceived as saying, "Hey, how about

00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:08.829
a round of free drinks?" Or, "Give me something."
And I'm trying to think of what the second

00:56:08.829 --> 00:56:11.630
slice of bread is in a sandwich if I were
to say, "Excuse me, everything is really great,

00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:16.099
but my steak is slightly underdone and I don't
quite know what I want from you. I just want

00:56:16.099 --> 00:56:17.099
you to know that I'm unhappy."

00:56:17.099 --> 00:56:18.099
[laughter]

00:56:18.099 --> 00:56:19.099
So I wonder what your recommendation is for
that second slice of bread.

00:56:19.099 --> 00:56:23.670
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: You need to figure out what you
want. I mean, and this is what I was saying

00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:28.099
because when you don't, A you do get stuck
and B, if you don't know, what's the manager

00:56:28.099 --> 00:56:29.509
gonna do? I mean multiple choice? Do you want
him to have to guess?

00:56:29.509 --> 00:56:32.940
The thing is in restaurants, here's the thing.
If something bothers you to the extent that

00:56:32.940 --> 00:57:00.990
you might not go back to that restaurant,
you're losing out and restaurant is losing

00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:04.309
out. So why I believe in sending things back
in certain restaurants, not at McDonalds.

00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:05.430
I don't like the fries.

00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:06.430
[laughter]

00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:12.191
But in restaurants, why I believe that's important
is because they will do something for you

00:57:12.191 --> 00:57:17.049
because they want you to come back. And if
that's gonna allow you to come back then I

00:57:17.049 --> 00:57:19.230
think you should do it.

00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:25.470
Now, usually when you return something they
expedite the order. They don't make you wait

00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:31.430
the other, unless you want another well done
steak, it might take a while. But I think

00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:38.210
it's important to give the restaurant an opportunity
to rectify the situation. And then, your digestive

00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:40.936
would be 'because I really like this restaurant
and I come here a lot and I'd like to keep

00:57:40.936 --> 00:57:44.079
coming here" for example. But you do have
to figure out what you want. Unfortunately.

00:57:44.079 --> 00:57:49.190
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: So, you spoke a
lot about how to deal with like companies

00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:54.150
and complaining or specifically in like, interpersonal
relationships and maybe this falls into the

00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:58.720
interpersonal relationships category, but
when, do have any special advice for the co-worker

00:57:58.720 --> 00:57:59.720
scenario?

00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:02.900
This may be different than someone you're
romantically involved with or a company or

00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:03.900
something.

00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:07.829
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: I don't want to put you on the
spot, but is there a specific complaint you're

00:58:07.829 --> 00:58:08.829
thinking?

00:58:08.829 --> 00:58:09.829
[laughter]

00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:10.829
By the way, are your colleagues?

00:58:10.829 --> 00:58:11.829
[laughter]

00:58:11.829 --> 00:58:14.460
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Well, I mean, so
actually it's really convenient 'cause the

00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:19.300
guy that I used to complain a lot about to
my wife, instead of to him, has actually quit.

00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:20.300
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: Excellent.

00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:22.359
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Yeah, it's perfect.

00:58:22.359 --> 00:58:23.359
[laughter]

00:58:23.359 --> 00:58:35.700
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: Does he get YouTube? I don't
know. All right.

00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:41.099
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: So, but at any
rate, it was just essentially like a low performance,

00:58:41.099 --> 00:58:46.570
low quality of work and just feeling like
no matter how many times we would talk about

00:58:46.570 --> 00:58:49.810
how things could be better or different, they
weren't.

00:58:49.810 --> 00:58:51.901
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: How did that impact you?

00:58:51.901 --> 00:59:00.390
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Well, because it
made more work for me or--.

00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:01.390
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: OK. I understand.

00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:02.390
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Or stuff like that.

00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:03.390
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: So look. So I do actually think
it's important. I mean at work when you're

00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:04.950
complaining in parallel, when you're complaining
to colleagues or co-workers, I think it's

00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:08.930
important to voice it. And you can say like,
"I really think you're making a big effort

00:59:08.930 --> 00:59:09.930
here or I really enjoy sharing the office
with you," or whatever the opener would be,

00:59:09.930 --> 00:59:10.930
"I really feel that in some cases you're not
doing enough and I'm carrying a little bit

00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:11.930
more of the load. So, I'm wondering if we
can discuss how to take our next project and

00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:12.930
give you a bigger slice of it to even it out
a little bit." Something like that.

00:59:12.930 --> 00:59:13.930
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: OK. So still just
another sandwich.

00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:14.930
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: It's always a sandwich.

00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:15.930
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: All right. Cool.

00:59:15.930 --> 00:59:16.930
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: Hi. Thank you
for your talk. It's been entertaining. I wanted

00:59:16.930 --> 00:59:17.930
to ask if you have any advice about choosing
your complaining battles. So if my husband

00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:18.930
says I complain about too many things, it
then falls on deaf ears, even if it's in a

00:59:18.930 --> 00:59:19.930
complaint sandwich.

00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:20.930
Is there, do you have some advice about what
to complain about?

00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:21.930
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: Yes. That's a really, really
important question so I'm really glad you

00:59:21.930 --> 00:59:22.930
asked it. We really have to think this through
in our relationships because you want, in

00:59:22.930 --> 00:59:23.930
general, 80% of what you say to your husband
to be either neutral or positive and 20% to

00:59:23.930 --> 00:59:24.930
be either directives or complaints.

00:59:24.930 --> 00:59:25.930
Directives are the "honey come to dinner."
Or complaints. No, I mean that's part of the

00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:26.930
thing. So you can't have it be too negative.
Even if they're actually doing things which

00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:27.930
warrant 50% complaining, you really have to
choose. You want the overall tone of your

00:59:27.930 --> 00:59:28.930
communications to be as positive as possible.

00:59:28.930 --> 00:59:29.930
So, A, you have to choose and prioritize and
B, you have to order them so that they're

00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:30.930
not too many coming at him at once. You wanna
sit down and him take one complaint seriously,

00:59:30.930 --> 00:59:31.930
fix that, and then voice another serious complaint
after that rather than just fire them off

00:59:31.930 --> 00:59:32.930
when you get home and then he just turns off
and he's not listening to them anymore.

00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:33.930
So, yes it's really important to prioritize.
The ones which are most emotionally meaningful

00:59:33.930 --> 00:59:34.930
to you are the ones I would start with, but
one. And make the general tone of your dialogue

00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:35.930
with him sound more positive before you do
that and then he'll be more opening to listen

00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:36.930
about your complaint, especially if you use
the sandwich.

00:59:36.930 --> 00:59:37.930
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: So, a follow-up
to that is I've noticed in some communications

00:59:37.930 --> 00:59:38.930
with my husband, and I'm sure other people
are familiar with this, that when someone

00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:39.930
complains about something the other person
says, "Well, you do that." So there's sort

00:59:39.930 --> 00:59:40.930
of complaining back.

00:59:40.930 --> 00:59:41.930
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: First of all, when you try the
sandwich you'll find that happens much, much

00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:42.930
less. Secondly, you can say, "That's a great
point. Since I'm the one that raised the thing

00:59:42.930 --> 00:59:43.930
I wanted to discuss, let's separate those
two discussions. Let's have this one first

00:59:43.930 --> 00:59:44.930
and I promise you I'll sit through the other
one when we're done with this one.

00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:45.930
But let's do one thing at a time." OK.

00:59:45.930 --> 00:59:46.930
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: Thank you.

00:59:46.930 --> 00:59:47.930
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: You're welcome.

00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:48.930
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #8: Hi. Thank you
for your talk. I just have a question regarding

00:59:48.930 --> 00:59:49.930
other people eating the complaint sandwich.
Unfortunately, there are often people in your

00:59:49.930 --> 00:59:50.930
lives that don't like eating any sort of complaint
sandwich, or any sort of feedback.

00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:51.930
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: Mm-hmm.

00:59:51.930 --> 00:59:52.930
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #8: And sometimes
they're just difficult people and you have

00:59:52.930 --> 00:59:53.930
to interact with them. How can you soften
or make them more accepting of a complaint

00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:54.930
sandwich when they are difficult people for
example?

00:59:54.930 --> 00:59:55.930
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: Well, in my book I get into this
a little bit because in certain scenarios

00:59:55.930 --> 00:59:56.930
you have to really fluff up that bread more
than in others. And so it could be that someone's

00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:57.930
difficult and they're resistant.

00:59:57.930 --> 00:59:58.930
That first slice of bread needs to be extra
fluffy. And it could be that you need to explain

00:59:58.930 --> 00:59:59.930
things in the meat section much, much more
so they understand it. But essentially, yes.

00:59:59.930 --> 01:00:00.930
Some people are just going to be very defensive,
not many, but if you really work those elements

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:01.930
of the sandwich correctly, and in the examples
I gave, the bread was very, it was half a

01:00:01.930 --> 01:00:02.930
sentence, a sentence.

01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:03.930
You can beef that up to three or four sentences
of a preamble and then put the meat in then

01:00:03.930 --> 01:00:07.279
add another three or four sentences in the
digestive and that will make it much easier

01:00:07.279 --> 01:00:09.910
for the other person to take in. It's not
a guarantee. Some people just won't, but you're

01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:14.050
best likelihood is to make the bread more
extensive on either end.

01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:17.450
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #8: Thank you.

01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:20.799
&gt;&gt;Guy Winch: All right. Thank you very much
everyone. I appreciate it.

01:00:20.799 --> 01:00:20.969
[applause]
