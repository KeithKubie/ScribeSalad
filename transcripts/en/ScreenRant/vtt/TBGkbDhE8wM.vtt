00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.809
For an added level of fun for fans, movies
and television shows have been known to include

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.180
easter eggs or subtle references that only
the most eagle-eyed viewers will find. But,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.970
Disney and Pixar take easter eggs and hidden
details to another level. Here are Screen

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.230
Rant's 10 amazing hidden details in Disney
films.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.359
Frozen Figures

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.700
Frozen catapulted to massive popularity with
help from the catchy and inspirational "Let

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.890
It Go," but the film also features a handful
of references to previous Disney and Pixar

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.719
movies, like Rapunzel and Flynn Rider from
Tangled attending Elsa's coronation. But you

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.539
have to look a lot closer to catch some of
Frozen’s other nods to Monsters Inc. and

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.890
Mickey himself. At Wandering Oaken's Trading
Post and Sauna, a wooden figurine of Mike

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.780
Wazowski can be seen sitting on the store’s
counter, while a Micky Mouse doll is hidden

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.039
on another shelf. Anna only decides to buy
winterwear – which was probably the right

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.770
call.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.020
King Triton's Guests

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.622
A lot of Disney’s references in animated
classics or Pixar films, the studio will occasionally

00:01:04.622 --> 00:01:05.622
add in a nod to other characters under the
Disney banner. In the scene in The Little

00:01:05.622 --> 00:01:09.430
Mermaid when King Triton makes his entrance
in Atlantis to a room full of guests, many

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.369
have spotted Goofy and Donald Duck sitting
in the crowd. But, a second before they become

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.930
visible, Kermit the Frog is shown seated farther
back in the audience, recognizable by his

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.570
green collar. We can only wonder why the Mickey
and Muppets characters chose not to sit together…

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.820
Spinning Wheel

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.060
The folk tale Sleeping Beauty has been told
and retold for centuries, but one element

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.450
that never changes is princess pricking her
finger on the spindle of her spinning wheel,

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.590
sending her into a deep sleep. The spinning
wheel played a big part in Disney's version

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.240
too, with an evil witch behind the trap, before
Prince Phillip saved her entire kingdom with

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.430
true love's kiss. But the spinning wheel apparently
survived, since it can be seen in Rapunzel's

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.829
tower in the beginning of Tangled, connecting
the two stories of a Disney princesses trapped

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.090
by a witch.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.360
Wreck-It Ralph Cameos

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.149
To populate the behind-the-scenes world of
arcade games in Wreck-It Ralph, animators

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.920
included tons of video game mascots and heroes.
Bowser, Pac-Man, Sonic the Hedgehog, Q*bert,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.730
and Frogger all make an appearance. But, in
one wide shot of Game Central Station, two

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.150
characters unrelated to video games can be
seen: Vladimir, one of Tangled’s thugs in

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.379
the Snuggly Duckling Pub, and Maximus, the
proud palace horse are walking in opposite

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:30.110
directions in the station. There's also a
dinosaur that closely resembles Tiny the T-Rex

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.709
from Meet the Robinsons, and those are only
the easter eggs and cameos that fans have

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.000
actually spotted.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.090
Charlotte's Storybooks

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.640
It's established early on in The Princess
and the Frog that southern belle Charlotte

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.060
La Bouff has an obsession with storybook princesses,
especially their dresses, which is how she

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.620
comes to be friends with Tiana, the daughter
of a seamstress. When Tiana kisses a frog

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.290
claiming to be a prince, and breaking the
spell accidentally makes a mess of Charlotte's

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.069
room, you can get a good glimpse of Charlotte's
book collection. If you look closely, one

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.500
storybook on a shelf is revealed to be Rapunzel,
the fairytale Disney's next princess film

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.150
would focus on in Tangled, giving a nod to
the following release.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.150
Apple

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.260
In 1986, Steve Jobs purchased the Computer
Graphics Division from George Lucas's Lucasfilm,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.780
establishing the independent company we now
know as Pixar. In honor of the man who also

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.190
founded Apple, Pixar has included nods to
the tech company or Jobs himself in a number

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.280
of films. Most notably, the titular robotic
hero of Wall-E makes the recognizable Mac

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:41.430
startup chime when he's done charging, and
Apple products like computers and iPods are

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.000
shown throughout Toy Story 3.Finally, after
passing away in 2011, the end credits of Brave

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.920
featured a dedication to Jobs in memory of
his contribution to Pixar. That last one may

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.620
not necessarily be hidden, but it's worth
mentioning.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.269
Kristoff's Boogers

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:02.790
It isn’t that often that filmmakers include
messages in the credits, but aside from special

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.540
thanks, sometimes credits can be used for
one last joke. In the end credits of Frozen,

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.390
the filmmakers included a message to assure
audiences that Kristoff's assertion that “all

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:20.269
men eat their own boogers” is his opinion
only, and it does "not reflect the views or

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.320
opinions of The Walt Disney Company or the
filmmakers.” It seems Disney, like Kristoff,

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.930
takes the issue of ingesting nose mucus very
seriously.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.419
Andy's Postcard

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.139
There are multiple theories circulating the
web about all the connections between Disney

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.620
and Pixar films, and certain easter eggs lend
more credence to these theories than others.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.150
For instance, one shot from Toy Story 3 confirms
that the series' main human character, Andy,

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.620
exists in the same world as Carl and Ellie
Fredricksen from Up. If you look closely at

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.310
the bulletin board in Andy's room, there's
a postcard from the couple that includes the

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.180
address of their beloved yellow house, before
it's transported to South America, of course

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.110
(For some reason our version doesn’t have
this but I added Stills clearly showing it).

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.860
Nemo Takes a Swim

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.680
Disney's Brother Bear may not be as popular
or critically acclaimed as the studio's other

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.240
movies, but the animated feature focused on
the idea of family like many of Disney and

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.610
Pixar's films. Plus, Brother Bear features
a blink-and-you'll-miss-it nod to Pixar's

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.560
notably more popular 2003 release, Finding
Nemo, about a father searching for his son.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.180
If you don't look close enough at the group
of salmon, it's easy to miss the clownfish

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.520
hiding among them. It seems Nemo wasn't lost
at 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney, Australia, but

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.060
swimming with salmon on the other side of
the world.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.970
Tangled's Book Collection

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.789
Most of the hidden easter eggs inside Disney
movies only manage to reference one movie

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:50.000
at a time, but one shot in Tangled features
nods to three other princess films. When Rapunzel

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.500
and Flynn Rider are poring over an atlas while
at the festival of lights in Corona, books

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.990
referencing other films can be seen. One open
book displays the story from the opening sequence

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.690
of Sleeping Beauty, and two others are the
storybooks containing the tales of Beauty

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.460
and the Beast and The Little Mermaid. It's
unclear if Rapunzel has read the fairytales

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.289
of her fellow Disney princesses, but it's
a nicely hidden reference to their films.

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.130
So what did you think of our list?

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.490
