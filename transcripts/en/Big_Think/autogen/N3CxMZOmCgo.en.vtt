I believe that the challenges we're

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669
I believe that the challenges we're
 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:03.020
I believe that the challenges we're
facing

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030
facing
 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.640
facing
globally as a business community and as

a species are getting so large and and
 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.530
a species are getting so large and and
so complex that the way we do business

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540
so complex that the way we do business
 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.810
so complex that the way we do business
has to fundamentally change and and the

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820
has to fundamentally change and and the
 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.950
has to fundamentally change and and the
big pivot is about a deep change in the

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960
big pivot is about a deep change in the
 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.810
big pivot is about a deep change in the
priorities of business kind of a flip

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820
priorities of business kind of a flip
 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.230
priorities of business kind of a flip
from worrying about short-term earnings

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240
from worrying about short-term earnings

from worrying about short-term earnings
first and then getting to some of these

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699
first and then getting to some of these
 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.509
first and then getting to some of these
kind of shared challenges we have only

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519
kind of shared challenges we have only
 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.009
kind of shared challenges we have only
when you know there's pressure from

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019
when you know there's pressure from
 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.929
when you know there's pressure from
outsiders or there's maybe quick wins or

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939
outsiders or there's maybe quick wins or
 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.400
outsiders or there's maybe quick wins or
kind of easy wins that companies can

kind of easy wins that companies can
 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.260
kind of easy wins that companies can
pursue and flipping that so that we're

pursue and flipping that so that we're
 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.830
pursue and flipping that so that we're
operating businesses in a way that

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840
operating businesses in a way that
 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.299
operating businesses in a way that
tackles our biggest challenges and works

trade-off between trying to manage these
big challenges in a profitable way and

green products or green services they
weren't very good for a long time so

weren't very good for a long time so
 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.880
weren't very good for a long time so
there's a sense that Green was somehow

there's a sense that Green was somehow

there's a sense that Green was somehow
not good for business it wasn't out of

nowhere but that's really a dated view
we now have a situation where the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869
we now have a situation where the
 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.510
we now have a situation where the
challenges are so vast and the world is

issues that's the point of the big pivot
 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.880
issues that's the point of the big pivot
so that we will find a profitable path

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890
so that we will find a profitable path
 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.950
so that we will find a profitable path
to do it and we have so many options now

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960
to do it and we have so many options now
 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.899
to do it and we have so many options now
there's a whole category of things that

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909
there's a whole category of things that
 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.149
there's a whole category of things that
companies do that save money very

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159
companies do that save money very

in part Green is about doing more with

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890
in part Green is about doing more with
 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.310
in part Green is about doing more with
less that's just good business and so

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320
less that's just good business and so
 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.230
less that's just good business and so
that part of the agenda has become much

that part of the agenda has become much
more normal in companies and they're

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740
more normal in companies and they're
 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.660
more normal in companies and they're
finding ways to cut costs dramatically

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670
finding ways to cut costs dramatically
 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.789
finding ways to cut costs dramatically
that's the easy stuff but we're now

that's the easy stuff but we're now
 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.710
that's the easy stuff but we're now
finding even the things that seemed very

finding even the things that seemed very
 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.630
finding even the things that seemed very
