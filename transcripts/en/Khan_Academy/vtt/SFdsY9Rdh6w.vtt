00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.380
So far, we looked at
open-end mutual funds

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.450
that can kind of grow and shrink
depending on how many investors

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.250
want to invest in that fund.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.560
They can grow by
creating new shares

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.726
and selling those shares
to the general public.

00:00:13.726 --> 00:00:16.100
And they can shrink because
someone who wants their money

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.610
back goes to the
fund and says, you

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.130
have to buy this back
from me at the end NAV,

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.482
at the net asset
value, per share.

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:26.190
But the problem with
it, actually there's

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.180
a couple problems, is
that the manager here

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.170
has to always keep a little
cash set aside in case some

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.760
of the investors come
to him and say, hey,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.690
I want you to buy my share back.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.717
I want liquidity.

00:00:37.717 --> 00:00:39.800
And the other thing that
they have to worry about,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.591
at least from the
investor's point of view,

00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:45.600
is they can only buy or
sell at the end of the day.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.110
And that will only happen at
the net asset value per share.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.184
And on top of that,
the fund manager,

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:52.600
or whoever's running
the fund, has

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.760
to worry about
actually transacting

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.136
between all of these
different investors.

00:00:58.136 --> 00:00:59.510
Now, on the other
side of things,

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.230
we looked at the
closed-end fund.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.000
The closed-end fund
couldn't kind of dynamically

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.740
grow and shrink by creating new
shares, or by buying them back.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.350
But what was good about them
is, is that they were freely

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.150
trading on exchanges, maybe
on the NASDAQ or the New York

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.100
Stock Exchange.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.370
And because there was none of
this kind of back and forth

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.580
between the fund
managers, or whoever

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.000
was kind of doing the operations
of the fund and the investors,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.600
they didn't have
to put cash aside.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.150
And they didn't have to have
all of this kind of overhead

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.400
in dealing with the investors.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.566
Now, you're probably saying,
well isn't there a way?

00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:35.810
Or maybe there's a way to
get the best of both worlds?

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.950
A fund that could
grow dynamically,

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.370
that could create
new shares when

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.150
there was demand from investors.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.130
But at the same time,
those new shares

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.960
could be traded
on an open market.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.250
And that combination, or
you can kind of view it

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.920
as a combination of the
two, actually exists,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:00.990
and they're called
exchange traded funds,

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.682
or ETFs for short.

00:02:03.682 --> 00:02:04.890
And you might say, hey, wait.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.160
Isn't a closed-end
fund exchange traded?

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.960
And it is.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.630
These actually do trade
hands on the stock exchanges.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.780
But these are officially ETFs.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.745
When someone tells you an ETF,
the way to think about it,

00:02:17.745 --> 00:02:19.510
it's a combination of both.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.880
But what it does is it
limits of the interaction.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.320
So when you have just a
regular, open-end mutual fund

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.700
any individual investor
can come to the fund

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.260
say, here is my share.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.400
Buy it back from me.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.490
Eliminate that share.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.370
And that creates a
lot of overhead here.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.390
On an exchange traded
fund only approved people,

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.580
and these are usually
large institutions,

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.900
can go to the fund
and say, I want

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.472
to buy or redeem a
big block of shares.

00:02:46.472 --> 00:02:47.930
So an exchange
traded fund, instead

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.390
of creating one
share of time, it

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.430
might create 5,000, or 10,000,
or 100,000 shares at a time.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.280
And on the other side
of things, if someone

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.050
wanted to redeem
their shares, they

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.630
would redeem 5,000,
10,000, or 100,000 shares

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.860
at the same time.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.300
And what's good there from
the funds point of view,

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.065
is that they don't
have to deal with all

00:03:05.065 --> 00:03:06.440
of these small transactions.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.870
They can do big transactions
with big entities.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.840
So that saves them
cost on overhead.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.430
And since these big
people go and kind of

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.687
by these big blocks of shares,
they can then go and sell them

00:03:19.687 --> 00:03:21.520
in the open market, or
they could trade them

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.410
in the open market.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.680
So if want to buy in to an ETF,
instead of buying it directly

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.540
from the ETF you
would buy it from one

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.740
of these big institutions
that buy big blocks of shares.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.120
So they're now
buying a big block

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.670
of-- maybe this is 10,000
shares right over here.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.670
And then they will trade
in the open market.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.820
So you kind of get the
best of both worlds and.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.130
In general, ETFs
also have lower fees.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.880
And they have lower
fees one, because they

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.671
don't have to do all
of this back and forth

00:03:50.671 --> 00:03:52.710
between each
individual investor.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.760
And most ETFs are
not actively managed.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.220
And when I say actively managed
I'm talking about the situation

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.080
where you had Pete.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.660
And Pete says that he's just
an awesome stock picker.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.200
He can beat the market.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.139
He can do all of-- you know he
really researches companies.

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:08.680
And he thinks that
there's some value

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.110
that he creates by doing that.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.850
When something is
not actively managed,

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.270
and exchange traded funds tend
to not be, they're saying,

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.690
look, we're just going
to buy the market.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.680
Or we're just going
to buy some commodity.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.810
So when you go into an
exchange traded fund,

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.320
you're really just trying
to buy some asset class,

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.690
maybe it's the S&amp;P 500.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.720
Maybe it's some type of
exchange traded funds

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.840
that buys gold as assets.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.280
Or maybe it's buying some
other type of commodity.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.027
And so because it's
not actively managed,

00:04:35.027 --> 00:04:36.610
the argument would
be, that they don't

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.972
need as much in management fees.

00:04:37.972 --> 00:04:39.180
So they will have lower fees.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.540
So it's a combination, they
can grow arbitrarily large,

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.140
and some of the largest exchange
traded funds are super huge.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.190
They have much lower fees.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.010
And they have this tradability.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.610
You can trade them at any
kind of second on the market.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.110
You don't have to
wait until the end

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.390
of the day like
an open-end fund.
