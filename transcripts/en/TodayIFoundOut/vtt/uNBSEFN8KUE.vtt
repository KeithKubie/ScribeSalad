00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:13.850
“Elementary, my dear Watson“, sometimes
quoted as, “Elementary, dear Watson“,

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.009
is one of those phrases that everybody knows
the character of Sherlock Holmes said.

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.330
You know, just like everyone knows that Kirk
said “Beam me up Scotty” and Darth Vader

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.460
said, “Luke, I am your father”.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.330
The thing is, none of those characters ever
said any of those things.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.169
They said things that were similar, sure,
but they never actually said those exact words,

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.079
despite the fact most think that they did.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.530
Like “Luke, I am your Father“- which was
actually, “No, I am your father“- Holmes

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.129
never said “Elementary my dear Watson”
in any of the original 56 short stories or

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.140
4 novels starring his character.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.539
The closest he comes is in, The Adventure
of the Crooked Man.

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:56.140
In this story, Holmes uses both the word “Elementary”
and the phrase, “my dear Watson“, in somewhat

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.140
close proximity.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.989
The two, however, are not uttered together:

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.030
“I have the advantage of knowing your habits,
my dear Watson,” said he.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.810
“When your round is a short one you walk,
and when it is a long one you use a hansom.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.710
As I perceive that your boots, although used,
are by no means dirty, I cannot doubt that

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.530
you are at present busy enough to justify
the hansom.”

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.530
“Excellent!”

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.970
I cried.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.250
“Elementary,” said he.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.610
Beyond that, there are only 7 other instances
of the word “elementary” being uttered

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.260
in the official Sherlock Holmes works, though
he does say “my dear Watson” numerous

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.150
times, with the phrase appearing in about
2/3 of the stories, sometimes several times

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.150
within a given story.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.740
It’s noted by Sherlockian.net, one of the
foremost sources on everything to do with

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.040
Sherlock Holmes, that although Holmes never
uses the oft misquoted phrase, “elementary,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.430
my dear Watson“, he does use the phrase,
“exactly, my dear Watson” in 3 different

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.430
stories.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.290
For example in His Last Bow, where Holmes
uses the phrase in a shoddy attempt to mask

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.290
the obvious sexual tension between himself
and his man servant…

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.290
Or, you know, to agree to Watson’s point.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.290
So where did the phrase “Elementary, my
dear Watson” come from?

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.930
Well the first known, or at least recorded
use of the phrase was in the 1915 novel, Psmith,

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.340
Journalist written by P.G.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.350
Wodehouse.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.020
We should point out that the book in no way
shape or form stars Sherlock Holmes (in fact,

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.159
the Sherlock Holmes stories were still being
published at this point).

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.989
We should also point out that, though Psmith,
Journalist was published as a novel in 1915,

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.069
it was a serial before that, putting the date
of the first known usage of the phrase as

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.230
1909.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.800
The exact first known instance of the “Elementary,
my dear Watson”, which appears in that work

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.800
is as follows:

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.010
“I fancy,” said Psmith, “that this is
one of those moments when it is necessary

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.140
for me to unlimber my Sherlock Holmes system.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.140
As thus.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.390
If the rent collector had been there, it is
certain, I think, that Comrade Spaghetti,

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.090
or whatever you said his name was, wouldn’t
have been.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.100
That is to say, if the rent collector had
called and found no money waiting for him,

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.190
surely Comrade Spaghetti would have been out
in the cold night instead of under his own

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.260
roof-tree.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.120
Do you follow me, Comrade Maloney?”

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.000
“That’s right,” said Billy Windsor.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
“Of course.”

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.860
“Elementary, my dear Watson, elementary,”
murmured Psmith.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.860
Wodehouse’s work was noted to have taken
obvious cues from Doyle’s, as you probably

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.690
guessed from the fact that Wodehouse ended
up writing one of the most enduring quotes

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.920
for a character he didn’t create.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.750
So when was the first time someone playing
Sherlock Holmes actually said this?

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.860
That isn’t completely clear.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.440
The first well documented actor playing Sherlock
Holmes to use the phrase was one, Clive Brook

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.370
in a 1929 film, The Return of Sherlock Holmes.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.490
Another theory sometimes put forth is that
it was perhaps the stage actor, William Gillette

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:26.340
in 1899, preceding not only Clive Brook’s
1929 film, but also the P.G.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.380
Wodehouse serials quoted above.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.360
Though this could potentially be true, evidence
that has survived to today points to Gillette

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.510
using a slight variation on the phrase in
one of his stage productions, rather than

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.510
the exact phrase.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.900
The production, aptly called, Sherlock Holmes:
A Drama In Four Acts which was written in

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.819
part by Gillette in 1899, features a line
that read as follows, “Elementary, my dear

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:47.819
fellow!

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:48.819
Ho!

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:49.819
(*Sneer) Elementary“.

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.140
This is noted as being a bastardized version
of the “Exactly, my dear Watson” line

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.140
Doyle used in his own work several years earlier
and the line used by Brook 30 years later

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:10.670
is noted to be a natural evolution of Gillette’s
own line.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:17.940
So just to make sure you’re following this.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.390
“Elementary, my dear Watson“, was never
once uttered in the accepted canon of Sherlock

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.240
Holmes, the line as we know it is actually
a bastardized version of a bastardized version

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.860
of a similar line used in an earlier Sherlock
Holmes story.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.380
Does the fact that Sherlock Holmes never actually
said this line make it any less quotable?

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.380
Probably, yes.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.530
But what the hell, the story of how it came
to be is so convoluted it’s kind of fitting

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:58.700
for a Sherlock Holmes fact, don’t you think?
