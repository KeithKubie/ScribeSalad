00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.930
Now that you have a product idea, it is
time to move to the validation process.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.830
Remember that a lot of ideas look
great on paper, but fail in real life.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.280
Validating your idea
could help you determine

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.000
if your idea is as good as it sounds.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.410
&gt;&gt; As you validate your idea,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.070
you may find that your idea
isn't as good as you thought.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.810
In that case,
you might need to generate new ideas, or

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.990
combined new ones with new ones.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.900
Just be careful that you don't get
stuck at this point in the course.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.970
We want you to put something
in front of users and

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.960
understand the process of going
from an idea to a product.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.530
&gt;&gt; One way to validate your idea,
is to do user research.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.960
In the next videos, you will learn how
to do user research from Tomer Sharon,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.550
our researcher in Google New York.
