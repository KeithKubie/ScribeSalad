00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.305
This episode was proudly
made possible by Subaru.

00:00:06.305 --> 00:00:28.332
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:28.332 --> 00:00:29.790
For as long as I
can remember, I've

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.120
had a soft spot for
love and melancholy.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.400
And I think those two things are
intimately interrelated, right?

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.420
Love and sadness-- they
exist in the same space.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.030
There's a reason the
filmmaker Cameron

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.750
Crowe uses the term happy, sad
to describe those moments that

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.810
move us, that swell us, that we
become engorged with emotions.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.812
And we're also a
little bit like,

00:00:52.812 --> 00:00:55.020
oh man I'm not so sure if
that's making me that happy

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.520
or if I'm sad-- I
can't really tell.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.500
And Roland Barthes explored
this beautifully in his book

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.720
"A Lover's Discourse."

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.720
There's a couple lines
in it that I really love.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.410
He says--

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.670
"The first thing
we love is a scene,

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.390
which is seen for
the first time.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.192
Curtain parts, and what
had never been seen

00:01:12.192 --> 00:01:15.000
is devoured by the eyes.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.630
It's distinct, abrupt, framed.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.230
It is already a memory."

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.210
And this is the line
that really gets me.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.685
This idea that when
we're struck by love,

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:27.240
it is Immediately
already a memory.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.100
The moment is happening,
and you're already

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.202
mourning the fact that
the moment will end.

00:01:32.202 --> 00:01:38.590
This intertwining of melancholy,
of loss, that is literally

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.040
embedded in the
experience of rapture

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.280
is what's so unique and
mesmerizing about love

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.610
but also what
makes it so tragic.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.350
Right?

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.040
There's a reason
that Roland Bathes

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.390
cites love as, "the
romantic solution

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.820
to the problem of death."

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.230
That our lovers act as
stand-ins in a staged, managed,

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.060
resurrection.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.910
Where the pilgrim without
faith can die and live again.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.860
These death and
re-birth simulations

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.150
allowing us to finally--
to turn our lovers

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.039
into Gods and Goddesses.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.530
To be saved by them.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.722
It's every pop song,
it's every romantic movie

00:02:13.722 --> 00:02:14.430
you've ever seen.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.523
You know the feeling,
it moves us to tears.

00:02:17.523 --> 00:02:18.106
But who cares.

00:02:18.106 --> 00:02:20.411
Because as Camus
says, "Life should

00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:22.974
be lived to the point of tears."

00:02:22.974 --> 00:02:26.070
So, fall in love, or die trying.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.570
Right?
