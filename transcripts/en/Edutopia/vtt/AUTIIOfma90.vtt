00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.550
- [Teacher] What's another strategy?

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:11.862
- Uh, area model.

00:00:11.862 --> 00:00:12.940
- [Teacher] Area model, okay
who wants to do an area model?

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.840
- [Narrator] Because the
Lab school staff gets

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.450
regular opportunities to
participate in learning walks,

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.090
both as participants and also as hosts,

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.850
it really strengthens the
culture of the school,

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.370
helps build the shard vision

00:00:25.612 --> 00:00:27.762
and allows a spirit of
continuous learning.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.040
- The Lab school is located
on a university campus,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.390
in the College of Education

00:00:38.711 --> 00:00:39.544
and we have a dual mission to serve

00:00:39.544 --> 00:00:40.670
the children at the school,

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.670
which is currently kindergarten
through grade eight

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.180
as well as pre-service teachers.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.130
- Learning Walks is a
big part of our mission.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.440
It gives people who are
teaching in our school

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.450
as well as people who are
learning how to be teachers

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.966
the opportunity to watch
other people teach,

00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:54.799
which you don't generally get casue

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:56.840
you're in your classroom
teaching all the time.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.060
- [Margaret] A Learning Walk is just

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.571
a structured observation through a school.

00:01:01.571 --> 00:01:03.780
It's used for continuous
growth and improvement.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.270
It is important that all
teachers get to experience

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.220
what it's like to observe in
other teacher's classrooms

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.380
and learn from others as
well as to have teachers

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.660
come in and visit them
and learn from them.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.850
- I really like Learning Walks,

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.190
especially as a fairly new
teacher to this building.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.000
It's really helped me gain perspective

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.760
on what my students have experienced.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.850
It facilitates this, we're
all in this together,

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.010
what can we learn from each other?

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.750
Some of the times the best
things that are going on

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.330
are happening in your own building

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.284
and you might miss them

00:01:33.284 --> 00:01:34.780
because you're doing your own thing too.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.380
- He can run at a rate
of 11 feet per second.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.940
- The Learning Walks follow
a pretty specific protocol.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.970
It starts with an overview of the process

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.050
and sets some parameters
for participation.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.830
Thanks everyone for joining
our Learning Walk team today.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.210
A focus is identified
for the Learning Walks

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.330
and it can be a really broad focus,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.590
like teaching and learning

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.520
or a pretty specific focus,
like classroom management.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.800
Today's Learning Walk focus
is going to be on Math.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.633
We're going to be looking at

00:02:00.633 --> 00:02:02.360
the power of mistakes and struggle,

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.020
rich mathematical tasks and
assessment for a growth mindset.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.730
Learning Walk participant's role is to

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.210
observe what's happening and know that

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.650
they're going to get
an opportunity to talk

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.020
about those things later

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.270
but to avoid making
judgements and to reframe

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.150
any kind of thinking along
those lines into questions.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.313
- Did you understand Miles' answer?

00:02:24.313 --> 00:02:25.146
- Yes.

00:02:25.146 --> 00:02:26.580
- How would you know
that you made a mistake?

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.328
- [Margaret] Participants
are encouraged to take notes

00:02:29.328 --> 00:02:31.190
and jot down what they
observe, what they see,

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.780
what they hear and also
what their questions are,

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.880
things they wonder about.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.790
It gives us a snapshot of
other teacher's teaching.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.465
- How many do I have across here?

00:02:40.465 --> 00:02:41.822
- 14.

00:02:41.822 --> 00:02:44.980
- And it reminds us of, oh
they did an exit ticket,

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.890
I really keep forgetting to do those,

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.510
I need to pull those back in.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.690
You know, we catch those little things

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.160
because we're always watching
and trying to get new ideas.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.560
The Learning Walk for teachers,

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.060
I think is really beneficial.

00:02:58.228 --> 00:03:00.860
- I do carry a timer
and I rely on that timer

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.530
to keep the Learning Walk moving.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.410
After going through
all of the observations

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.090
is a time for reflection

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.410
and we generally start
the reflection process

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.760
by having a few broad
reflection questions.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.540
Take a minute and look over
the reflection questions.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.320
Reflection is probably the most valuable

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.710
part of the Learning Walk.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.610
One of my favorite
reflection questions is,

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.740
does anyone want to start
and share any questions,

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.010
wonderings, surprises that you noticed?

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.510
- Kindergartners, when they
were done with the task,

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.880
they partner up with the next person done

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.840
and I added that to my ideas that I might

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.680
apply in my classroom, I
thought that was really neat.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.800
- Anything that you would
recommend to be changed?

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.760
- I would always like to see,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.230
like two minutes longer in each class.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.550
- The amount of time is always hard

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.790
but the benefit of going
to six different classrooms

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.980
in a short amount of time is that you get

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.780
a glimpse of many classrooms instead of

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.380
an extended observation of one

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.360
and now you know where
you might want to go back

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.060
and do some more observing
in that specific classroom.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.700
- This is the first Learning
Walk that I've been on.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.580
It was clear after
being on this today that

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.530
it's a powerful tool
because I could see what

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.120
my colleagues were doing
in grades behind me

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.540
and then grades all the
way up to middle school.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.665
So I can see where I fit in that picture.

00:04:21.665 --> 00:04:23.320
- What would the clock look like up here?

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.080
And then when we get here, it would be...

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.340
- You know, I never get to
step outside and go next door

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.060
and see what my colleagues are doing.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.670
I'm always here so,

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.892
I think that's really powerful.

00:04:32.892 --> 00:04:34.532
- These are fifth graders, right?

00:04:34.532 --> 00:04:36.870
- It's amazing how when
teachers go into classrooms,

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.440
even if they're different levels

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.020
and different content
areas from what they teach,

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.530
what they can learn from each other

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.270
and I've never had a Learning Walk where

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.390
people didn't walk away with some ideas

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.700
about something new that they saw,

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.640
something they want to try,

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.590
something that they were interested in.
