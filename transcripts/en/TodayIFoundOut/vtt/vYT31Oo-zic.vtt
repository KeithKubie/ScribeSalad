00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.450
The great Jackie Robinson accomplished an
amazing amount in his lifetime both on and

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.620
off the field.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.020
Despite all the adversity and pressure he
experienced, he somehow managed to put up

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.750
legitimate Hall of Fame numbers doing what
is often described as the hardest thing in

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.810
all of sports- hitting a round ball with a
thin round stick.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.720
One thing that he didn’t do, something that’s
often credited to him, was become the first

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.820
African American person to play in the Major
Leagues.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.910
That was something that had been done at least
three times before Robinson made his historic

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.800
Major League debut on April 15, 1947.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.790
Now if you happen to be a trivia buff and
knew that already, odds are you think the

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.030
first was actually Moses Fleetwood Walker,
the second was his brother Weldy Walker, and

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.620
you’re probably scratching your head trying
to come up with the third.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.540
It turns out, that’s probably not correct
either, although the verdict is still slightly

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.590
out on the matter (being a very recent discovery).

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.210
The real first African American to play in
the major leagues, and the only former slave

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.130
to do so, is now generally thought to be a
man by the name of William Edward White.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.430
Eighteen year old White, who at the time was
a student at Brown, replaced an injured Joe

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.299
Start in one single game in the Majors, playing
for the National League Providence Grays on

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.979
June 21, 1879.

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.509
This was five years before Fleetwood Walker
would make his Major League debut.

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.729
In that game, White went 1 for 4 and scored
a run in a game the Grays won 5 to 3.

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.369
While not a lot is known about White, what
is known is that he officially claimed he

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.340
himself was “white” and not of African
heritage (his skin color apparently being

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.200
light enough to pass as such).

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.520
This is why up until very recently he wasn’t
given credit for being the first African American

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.570
to play in the Majors, with that honor going
to Moses Fleetwood Walker.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.920
This all changed when members of the Society
for American Baseball Research, more commonly

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.030
known as “SABR”, uncovered the fact that,
according to an 1870 U.S. census, White’s

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.869
mother was a woman named Hannah White, one
of the 70 slaves owned by the person William

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.450
White listed as his father according to Brown
University’s records- Andrew Jackson White.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.619
Hannah’s other two children also appear
to have been fathered by Andrew Jackson White.

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.619
A.J.

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:15.340
White also left the bulk of his estate to
Hannah’s three children when he died, including

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.900
William White, though he only acknowledged
them as “the children of my servant Hannah”,

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.480
rather than his own children.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.480
In the context of solving the mystery of whether
William White was the first African American

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.140
to play in the Majors, the important bit in
the Will is that he named William the child

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.040
of Hannah, which backs up what the U.S. census
stated.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.160
Thus, with the evidence at hand so far, it
appears William White was the first African

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.130
American to play in the Majors.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.430
As to why he never played again after that
game, it isn’t known, but of course speculation

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.600
is that his heritage was discovered, though
it may have simply been that a better player

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.600
was in the wings, as his replacement was future
Hall of Famer Jim O’Rourke.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.390
Whatever the case, the person long considered
to have been the first African American to

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.030
play in the Majors was, as mentioned, Moses
Fleetwood Walker.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.920
Walker made his Major League debut on May
1, 1884 playing for the Toledo Blue Stockings

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.630
against the Louisville Eclipse.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.660
He had been playing for the then minor league
Blue Stockings when the team was added to

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.030
the American Association, which later became
the American League.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.350
By all accounts, Walker was no less of an
amazing player than the great Jackie Robinson,

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.480
and is deserving of a lot of credit for what
he went through during his time in the Majors.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.890
How good was he?

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.520
Let’s just qualify the stats with the fact
that Walker was a catcher… who caught without

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.430
a glove or any other major protection, as
was common at the time.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.190
Needless to say, catchers of the day were
incredibly injury prone and rarely did well

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.400
offensively because of the beating they took
behind the plate.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.770
Walker had it worse than most because many
of the pitchers didn’t want to let a black

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.130
man ostensibly tell them what to do by calling
the pitches.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.900
As one pitcher, Tony Mullane, stated:

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.900
[Walker] was the best catcher I ever worked
with, but I disliked [the] Negro and whenever

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.860
I had to pitch to him I used to pitch anything
I wanted without looking at his signals.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.440
As a result, Walker was in the unenviable
position of crouching behind the plate attempting

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.340
to catch baseballs with no protective gear
nor glove and not knowing the location nor

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.540
what pitch was going to be thrown.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.990
Despite this, in his 42 games played in the
Majors, he batted .263 (some accounts claim

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.990
.264).

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.320
Now that might not sound impressive, but you
should consider the fact that this was well

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.299
above average in his day- the rest of his
team combined for an average of just .231

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.440
with the league average just .240 the season
he played.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.669
Further, as catchers took an incredible beating
(and still do today, though to a drastically

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.060
lesser extent), most catchers typically batted
between .100-.200 in his day.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.650
He was so good with his bat, that when he
was too beat up to catch, they’d typically

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.439
put him in the outfield so as not to lose
his offensive production.

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:45.310
He also had to overcome the same type of obstacles
as Jackie Robinson, including death threats,

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.500
constant personal and physical attacks, and
certain players refusing to play if Walker

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.009
was allowed on the field, such as future Hall
of Famer Adrian “Cap” Anson (the first

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:58.229
major leaguer to accumulate more than 3,000
hits, finishing with 3,481).

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:04.639
In fact, Fleetwood Walker’s brother, Weldy
Walker, who also played in the Majors (5 games),

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.220
blamed Anson for the banning of African American
players in the Minor and Major leagues in

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.220
the first place.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.020
(In truth, Anson’s despicable antics probably
didn’t have nearly that much to do with

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.900
it, though Anson was quite vocal about his
opinions on the matter and not shy at all

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.490
about trying to pressure others into advocating
for the same stance.)

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.800
For instance, in Anson’s first encounter
with Walker, Walker was supposed to have the

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.070
day off, but when manager Charlie Morton heard
that Anson and his team, the White Stockings,

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.699
were refusing to play if Walker was allowed
on the field, he put Walker in the lineup

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:35.770
and told Anson that not only would they be
forfeiting the game if they refused to play,

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.039
but they’d also forfeit the money from ticket
sales.

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.840
Once money was brought into it, Anson and
the White Stockings begrudgingly agreed to

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.840
play.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.010
After being injured to the point where he
couldn’t bat, Fleetwood Walker’s Major

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.940
League career ended up being over.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.970
Once he was healed up, he continued his career
in the minors (which in 1887 boasted 13 African

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.599
Americans despite rampant segregation).

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:59.750
He also played in a few other leagues before
finally both the National League and the American

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.490
Association decided on their “gentleman’s
agreement” to not sign any African American

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.060
player, with that decision trickling down
to other leagues that had not already instituted

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.279
similar bans.

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:12.939
Robbed of the ability to play in the American
and National Leagues as well as most others

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:17.479
of any note at the time, Fleetwood Walker
left baseball, as his brother also later did

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:21.150
after playing and managing in a Negro league
that ultimately failed.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.229
The two went on to various business ventures,
at which they were seemingly quite successful,

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:29.689
such as owning an operating a hotel, a movie
theater, as well as a series of restaurants.

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:33.099
Fleetwood Walker even attempted to get patents
on a few different pieces of equipment he

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:37.499
invented for showing “moving pictures”;
he also held a patent for a certain type of

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:39.259
exploding artillery shell.

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:43.629
The two also became involved in politics with
Weldy Walker serving on the Executive Committee

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:47.930
of the Negro Protective Party, which was formed
in response to the government turning a blind

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.879
eye on the frequent lynchings that occurred
at the time.

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:53.889
The two also owned and operated the newspaper,
The Equator.

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:57.939
I’ll close this with an excerpt from an
open letter from Weldy Walker to the President

00:06:57.939 --> 00:07:03.870
of the Tri-State League published in The Sporting
Life on March 14, 1888, after African Americans

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.129
were officially banned from playing in those
leagues when a law permitting them to be signed

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:09.430
was repealed by the league:

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.509
…It is not because I was reserved and have
been denied making my bread and butter with

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:18.259
some club that I speak; but it is in hopes
that the action taken at your last meeting

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:21.020
will be called up for reconsideration at your
next.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.180
The law is disgrace to the present age, and
reflects very much upon the intelligence of

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:30.280
your last meeting, and casts derision at the
laws of Ohio- the voice of the people- that

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.370
say all men are equal.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:36.809
I would suggest that your honorable body,
in case that black law is not repealed, pass

00:07:36.809 --> 00:07:40.460
one making it criminal for a colored man or
woman to be found in a ball ground.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.419
There is now the same accommodation made for
the colored patron of the game as the white,

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:49.210
and the same provision and dispensation is
made of the money of them both that finds

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.469
its way into the coffers of the various clubs.

00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:55.979
There should be some broader cause–such
as want of ability, behavior, and intelligence–for

00:07:55.979 --> 00:07:57.559
barring a player than his color.

00:07:57.559 --> 00:08:00.259
It is for these reasons and because I think
ability and intelligence should be recognized

00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:04.490
first and last–at all times and by everyone–I
ask the question again, why was the “law

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:05.490
permitting colored men to sign repealed, etc.?”

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:08.509
Yours truly, Weldy W. Walker

00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:11.599
While on the whole the Walker brothers did
quite well for themselves financially in their

00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:15.689
lives after baseball, particularly considering
the racial obstacles they had to deal with

00:08:15.689 --> 00:08:19.539
at the time, Fleetwood Walker was once attacked
by a group of white men.

00:08:19.539 --> 00:08:22.879
During the ensuing melee, Walker killed one
of the men, Patrick Murray.

00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:27.060
The remaining attackers attempted to kill
Walker, but he escaped, though was later arrested

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.089
and imprisoned.

00:08:28.089 --> 00:08:32.260
Somewhat surprisingly given attitudes at the
time, on June 3, 1891 at the conclusion of

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:59.110
his trial, a jury of all white men acquitted

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:16.320
Walker 

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:31.899
on all charges.
