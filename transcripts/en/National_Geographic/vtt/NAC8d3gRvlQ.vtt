NARRATOR: Macaques are
great with their hands.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.734
They peel fruit, climb trees,
and do each other's hair.

00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:28.033
But on these islands, they do
something no other macaques do.

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:31.500

00:01:10.467 --> 00:01:13.533
They use rocks as
tools to shuck oysters.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.367
Macaques don't
normally eat them,

00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:22.100
but when they were
stranded by the rising sea,

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.867
they needed new
ways to get a meal.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.500
They weren't born
with this skill.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.600
A smart monkey had
to work it out.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.867

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.667
This is something only
complex brains can do--

00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:50.667
not just sense and
react, but learn, adapt,

00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:52.633
and problem solve.
