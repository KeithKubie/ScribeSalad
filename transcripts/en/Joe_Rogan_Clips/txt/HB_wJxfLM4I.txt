Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience in a way. I think that one of the cultural jobs this podcast has performed, and this is like whether deliberately or not, is it demonstrates that the old political lines that we used to comfortably abide within a starting to sort of break down, cause you know like something like an obvious signifier of a particular type of person IEI go hunting now we have to accept is coupled with your view that the agricultural industry needs to be regulated and it's disgusting. Now they're, you know, they're, we have complete and total agreement and we both can see that the way that legislation is set up is biased towards corporate interests, commercial interests and profit. Yeah. And so for me, bloody whether or not, you know, Chris Pat Prime in the name of sheep, I think he had no problem, man. Whoa, whoa. That's not, I don't need to spend my time worrying about that.

Speaker 1:          00:54          I'm a little bit like Alex Jones, like with the, why are we worrying about flat earth if they've got them babies and all of that stuff is, I feel like why don't we focus on the things that are making a genuine difference to the uh, the way people are living lives. Yeah. And it seems to me that the one of the priorities is in a new global landscape that we're living with. What are the dominant forces and what are the goals of the dominant forces and how detached or those goals from the lives of what you might say are ordinary people or the majority of people to use it less complex term.

Speaker 2:          01:26          And what's probably most terrific about reforming the system is that the people that are going to suffer the most are the people that are the poorest. So if you think of like a fast food in particular, right? There's a lot of like really poor people that re rely on fast food because it's very inexpensive. If you go and you can get a lot of calories for a small amount of money, right? But if you go from the fast food restaurant and then you'd go down the line to factory farming and then somehow know that they eliminate factory farming and they say, no, no, if you're going to raise animals, you have to have the same sort of standards that we would expect if we knew you. If we were there, we want pastures, we went animals living in the wild. We want, I mean, you know, fenced in, but like living like an actual animal, not this crazy warehouse bullshit.

Speaker 2:          02:12          You guys are running well, that's going to up our operation costs. Well then that's how it's going to be. So then the beef becomes far more expensive. Now the beef becomes far more expensive than what a fast food. What are the restaurants do? Well, they're going to have to make things more expensive too. So who's going to suffer the poor people who's going to suffer with cheap meat and supermarkets, poor people that can't afford it now. But I think that what happens though is you start to put, you have started to pull a Fred that reveals how the, the fabric

Speaker 1:          02:37          of our culture is corrupted because it shouldn't be more expensive than the reason it's more expensive is because everything is put into a capital based ideology. We're already, I've heard many times on this show you discussing universal basic income. This is that the beginning of looking at alternative economic models and there's an argument for saying everyone has the right to nutritious diet. Everyone has the right to a safe home. You know, so like if we start prioritizing those ideas above these organizations have the right to maximize profit, we were holding a snake, then maximizing profit that's getting taken off the table. And then there comes your counterargument about innovation. Well, I would say if innovation slows no problem because we've all, we've decided as a culture to prioritize housing and nutrition for the majority of people. Now you can still say that starts to, you know, that's, that's kind of socialism but, and I don't think that that can work on a, on a continental scale.

Speaker 1:          03:33          I think you have to, we have to break down centralized systems, whether those are corporate, centralized systems or national, I feel that we, these two, the time has gone where there's too much diversity. Like they're not too, they're probably always was diversity. People are different. We are influenced by our culture is our schools, our education, our class, our race is all of these factors. And then to expect us all to live in this sort of single bandwidth of this is what America is all, this is what France is or this is what England is. People at these two different now. But what it does, it seems like the standards we were adhering to unconsciously or otherwise, he's, these groups have the right to make as much money as they can and to interfere with that is an American or British or wherever it was. Cause you know, beyond the national ideas, I'm sure. So you know for me that's the, you pull that thread out. It's the poor that will suffer within, no, we have to rule out the poor suffer. So we had, so what happens in the end, you start to get into redistribution of resources, managing and regulate in the power of the most powerful people. And whenever that conversation starts, it gets shut down because we want to conserve,

Speaker 2:          04:37          even in a capitalist system. Wouldn't it be more ethical if everybody started from the same starting block? Well, that's what's wrong with the world, right? What's wrong with the world that some people are in a, they have a terrible hand of cards you've been dealt. You know, and my point about food is that the people that are going to see they're going to suffer the most are the people that rely on the cheap food. Yes, you'll play as that cheat food gets pulled away, then a lot of those supermarkets in a lot of those, um, fast food stores that rely on that factory farm food, you know, they're going to be in a bad situation. Things are gonna be much more expensive. And if things are much more, if it, and if they make animals live, like, um, what is that guy's name? Uh, Polyface farms.

Speaker 2:          05:20          Joel's Salitan. Yeah, he's a fascinating cat. I had him on my podcast before he sort of a farm reformist. And what he believes is that these animals should live just like animals. When he has pigs, he puts them in a, a fenced area, but he moves the fence Darya every day. So like the pigs move to a different spot and so they're just constantly forging and eating acorns and uh, but they're, you know, they're living like a pig. They're living in a natural, they're not living in some crazy warehouse. Yes it does. Same with his chickens. He has this mobile chicken coop and he moves it from pasture to pasture. And this is how

Speaker 1:          05:58          he operates his entire farm. Yes. It seems again the appointment it's been, we've talked about earlier that we ought to like if we look at, no one knows what's right. So perhaps what we could try and do is replicate what we do naturally. And so there is an argument that naturally we do hunt. There is a, an argument that naturally we do eat meat. There isn't actually grow food too though. Right. Is an argument that like total saying, like getting into organic gardening, if you have your own garden man mean that is like one of the most Karma free things ever. If you can figure out a way to have your own compost, your own garden, and you don't ever have to rely on anybody else for your food, well then you're not participating in that shit at all. Do you think that the spirit of entrepreneurship could be turned to designing these systems?

Speaker 1:          06:42          Do you think the only thing that incentivizes people is maximum profit? I do too. I think that it is possible that people would sit around and go, how do we organize a society that is fair and just that doesn't kill people's individualism or creativity or right to pursue different goals are to be who they are and belief who you know. But like I feel like there's so much fog in the air. People don't know what they actually believe in because there's so much powerful cultural influence, so much toxin, physical toxin, literal toxins and toxicity, cultural toxicity. You know, how are, how am I to, Eh protect my children from cultural influences that tell them, do you have to look this way, be this way, behave that way. These are the things that call, if you're not this, you're not a man. If you're not this, you're not a woman.

Speaker 1:          07:23          You know, like w like, you know, as a parent, I feel the obligation to create an environment where they can grow up to be who they are. I mean, in fact it me, and then when you've sort of scaled it up to a society, you know, how can we start to recognize, look is this time to look at different systems for living. And I, what I feel is people want to be involved in that, in the power systems that affect them. Like if you have a group of a hundred people, they want a bit bow to run their own schools, run their own care systems, run, it'd be in charge of them. And I've not just be some little beam of energy flicked about by cultural forces that they can't reach or touch. It's alien a in and like one of the things in Marxism and that you know, and I know very little about this subject, did he say that when capitalism reaches a certain point, people will be glossed, alienated.

Speaker 1:          08:10          They feel like a cog in a machine. No one will have no pride in their work. No one will know what it's like to make a whole bicycle and finger look, I made that. You'll just, you're the guide that makes the pedals now fuck off home. You know, now like, you know, like I've listened to enough Jordan Peterson to understand that there are limitations to what socialism and Marxism can achieve. But just because you know, capitalism is better than feudalism, that doesn't mean that's the end of the conversation that we shouldn't be looking for. Fair about. I'm more just ways of living. Well.
