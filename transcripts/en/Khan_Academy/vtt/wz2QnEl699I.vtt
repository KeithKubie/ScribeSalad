00:00:01.258 --> 00:00:03.712
- [Sal] Hi this is Sal and
I'm here with Jeffrey Rosen

00:00:03.712 --> 00:00:05.706
who's the head of the
National Constitution Center

00:00:05.706 --> 00:00:07.216
in Philadelphia.

00:00:07.216 --> 00:00:09.557
In the first video we did an overview

00:00:09.557 --> 00:00:11.918
of the entire Article
Two of the Constitution

00:00:11.918 --> 00:00:14.153
which covers the powers of the presidency,

00:00:14.153 --> 00:00:17.301
and now we're gonna jump
in a little bit deeper.

00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:19.332
Jeffrey one of the things
that surprises me about

00:00:19.332 --> 00:00:22.354
Article Two is for a job as
important as the President,

00:00:22.354 --> 00:00:25.706
it's an awfully short amount of text.

00:00:25.706 --> 00:00:26.658
- [Jeffrey] It is.

00:00:26.658 --> 00:00:29.978
Article One, defining the powers
of Congress is much longer.

00:00:29.978 --> 00:00:32.635
The Framers were much more
concerned about tyranny

00:00:32.635 --> 00:00:35.120
in Congress than tyranny in the Executive,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.432
and because there is so much
wiggle room in Article Two,

00:00:39.432 --> 00:00:41.763
presidential practice has
been really important,

00:00:41.763 --> 00:00:43.908
and obviously the most important
president in establishing

00:00:43.908 --> 00:00:47.682
that practice was our first
president, George Washington.

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:49.519
- [Sal] This is this idea
that because it was short

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.373
it left out a lot of what
a president maybe could do

00:00:53.373 --> 00:00:57.861
or could not do and that's
why our first president,

00:00:57.861 --> 00:01:00.476
the precedent that he
set was really important

00:01:00.476 --> 00:01:03.917
for how people perceived
the powers of the President.

00:01:03.917 --> 00:01:06.258
- [Jeffrey] Yes, it's a nice homonym,

00:01:06.258 --> 00:01:09.163
he was a both a president and
set this important precedent

00:01:09.163 --> 00:01:12.040
and because the Framers knew
that Washington was gonna be

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.211
the first president, he
takes office in 1789,

00:01:16.211 --> 00:01:18.778
right when the Constitution is ratified,

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:20.842
they trusted him to
establish these precedents

00:01:20.842 --> 00:01:22.940
which have been followed to this day.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.718
- [Sal] And just a little
bit of historical context,

00:01:24.718 --> 00:01:27.395
in 1776 is the official
founding of the country,

00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:29.008
the Declaration of Independence,

00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:31.821
the official start of
the Revolutionary War.

00:01:31.821 --> 00:01:34.699
Although I'm sure you have
skirmishes before that.

00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:36.697
Then we have the Articles of Confederation

00:01:36.697 --> 00:01:38.655
that get ratified in 1781.

00:01:38.655 --> 00:01:41.494
It was deemed that it was too weak,

00:01:41.494 --> 00:01:43.506
essentially of a confederation and then

00:01:43.506 --> 00:01:45.928
our Constitution gets ratified 1789,

00:01:45.928 --> 00:01:48.277
same year that Washington takes office

00:01:48.277 --> 00:01:49.410
as our first president.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.863
- [Jeffrey] Exactly right.

00:01:51.863 --> 00:01:54.574
As soon as he takes office,
Washington faces this dilemma

00:01:54.574 --> 00:01:56.562
that's not answered by the Constitution.

00:01:56.562 --> 00:02:00.168
And that's does he recognize
the French Revolution

00:02:00.168 --> 00:02:04.254
who have just killed and
guillotined Louis XIV.

00:02:04.254 --> 00:02:05.859
So Washington has these three choices,

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:08.704
he can stand by the monarchy
and condemn the Revolution,

00:02:08.704 --> 00:02:11.325
he can recognize the French
Revolutionaries as the

00:02:11.325 --> 00:02:14.608
rightful government or he
can say it's not my choice

00:02:14.608 --> 00:02:16.753
and all of our former treaties are void.

00:02:16.753 --> 00:02:19.093
He consults his cabinet,
decides to recognize

00:02:19.093 --> 00:02:21.952
the Revolutionaries and that
establishes the precedent

00:02:21.952 --> 00:02:24.941
that Presidents now have
unilateral power to recognize

00:02:24.941 --> 00:02:28.276
or de-recognize foreign governments.

00:02:28.276 --> 00:02:29.860
- [Sal] And that's interesting
'cause when we're looking at

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.640
Section Two which at least
talks something about treaties,

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.325
it says that the President
can make treaties,

00:02:35.325 --> 00:02:37.694
I'll underline this.

00:02:37.694 --> 00:02:40.143
The President can make
treaties provided two thirds

00:02:40.143 --> 00:02:42.502
of the Senators present concur.

00:02:42.502 --> 00:02:44.896
It talks about ambassadors
but it doesn't talk about

00:02:44.896 --> 00:02:48.283
the recognition of foreign countries.

00:02:48.283 --> 00:02:49.953
And as you point out
the French Revolution,

00:02:49.953 --> 00:02:53.528
things started in 1789, as
you get into the early 90's

00:02:53.528 --> 00:02:55.962
the Revolution continues
and Washington says well,

00:02:55.962 --> 00:02:59.907
do we recognize the
government of Louis the XVI

00:02:59.907 --> 00:03:02.270
that helped America during
the French Revolution

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.350
or do we recognize the
Revolutionaries who seem

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.784
to have a lot more in common
with us in terms of their

00:03:06.784 --> 00:03:09.523
principles around government,
at least of the stated ones.

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:11.677
And he decides that
well, it's not written in

00:03:11.677 --> 00:03:13.629
the Constitution here but as President,

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:18.291
I can make that decision to
recongize the Revolutionaries.

00:03:18.291 --> 00:03:20.585
- [Jeffrey] Absolutely.

00:03:20.585 --> 00:03:23.584
That leads to another series
of important questions

00:03:23.584 --> 00:03:26.016
which you just flagged, who exactly gets

00:03:26.016 --> 00:03:28.616
to negotiate the treaties.

00:03:28.616 --> 00:03:32.624
And Washington has, soon
after the French Revolutionary

00:03:32.624 --> 00:03:35.949
recognition, he wants to
negotiate a treaty with Britain,

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.326
it's called the Jay Treaty.

00:03:37.326 --> 00:03:39.460
So he secretly sends Gouverneur Morris,

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.229
who's the Framer who
is most responsible for

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:43.404
drafting the Preamble to the Constitution,

00:03:43.404 --> 00:03:47.087
as an unofficial emissary
or negotiator to Britain

00:03:47.087 --> 00:03:50.730
and they negotiate the
treaty and then Washington

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.507
designates John Jay as the envoy.

00:03:53.507 --> 00:03:56.178
The Senate doesn't endorse
the diplomatic mission,

00:03:56.178 --> 00:03:58.506
Jay is getting his orders
straight from Washington.

00:03:58.506 --> 00:04:01.850
After the deal is reached,
then Congress, after the fact,

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.346
approves of Washington's
diplomatic entrepreneurship.

00:04:05.346 --> 00:04:07.834
So this establishes the
really important precedent

00:04:07.834 --> 00:04:10.550
that the President can send
emissaries to negotiate

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.119
treaties which are approved by Congress

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:14.895
after the fact, and that
precedent is seized on by

00:04:14.895 --> 00:04:17.452
President Thomas Jefferson
who negotiated for

00:04:17.452 --> 00:04:20.300
the really important purchase
of the Louisiana Territory

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.875
on the spot without Congressional approval

00:04:22.875 --> 00:04:25.649
and gets Senate approval after the fact.

00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:27.979
- [Sal] Famously negotiated
with Napoleon Bonaparte

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:31.064
because he frankly, his navy
had been destroyed at Trafalgar

00:04:31.064 --> 00:04:33.709
so he was in no position to
protect something halfway

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:35.244
across the world (laughing).

00:04:35.244 --> 00:04:37.808
- [Jeffrey] And this drove
Jefferson's critics crazy

00:04:37.808 --> 00:04:40.355
'cause Jefferson is this big proponent,

00:04:40.355 --> 00:04:43.348
before he becomes President,
of limited Presidential

00:04:43.348 --> 00:04:47.014
authority and he becomes
President and he seems

00:04:47.014 --> 00:04:50.145
to expand it by seizing on
this treaty negotiation power

00:04:50.145 --> 00:04:52.614
that isn't explicitly in the Constitution

00:04:52.614 --> 00:04:56.925
and hugely increases the
landmass of the United States.

00:04:56.925 --> 00:04:58.193
- [Sal] And the importance
of these precedents,

00:04:58.193 --> 00:05:00.639
just to go back to
Section Two, it does say,

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.963
"He shall have power
by and with the advice

00:05:02.963 --> 00:05:04.998
"and consent of the
Senate to make treaties,

00:05:04.998 --> 00:05:08.197
"provided two thirds of the
Senators present concur."

00:05:08.197 --> 00:05:11.271
And your point is that the way
it's written in Section Two,

00:05:11.271 --> 00:05:13.483
it's not clear whether you need the advice

00:05:13.483 --> 00:05:16.261
and consent beforehand
or whether they just

00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:18.325
kind of approve after the fact.

00:05:18.325 --> 00:05:22.158
Washington, his term was
from 1789 until 1797,

00:05:23.885 --> 00:05:26.400
he assumed that no, I should be able to go

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.859
and very nimbly negotiate
these things without

00:05:28.859 --> 00:05:30.786
having to involve the entire Senate.

00:05:30.786 --> 00:05:32.863
And once it's negotiated
I need to go to them

00:05:32.863 --> 00:05:35.010
and get them to approve it.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.843
Jefferson, who was in
power from 1801 to 1809,

00:05:40.294 --> 00:05:42.083
kind of further reinforced that precedent,

00:05:42.083 --> 00:05:43.959
said hey, I'm just gonna
negotiate this thing

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:45.237
and then get it approved.

00:05:45.237 --> 00:05:47.648
- [Jeffrey] That's exactly
right and that allows Jefferson,

00:05:47.648 --> 00:05:50.741
when he gets approval for the
Louisiana Purchase in 1803,

00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:52.694
to get the Senate to
approve the treaty and

00:05:52.694 --> 00:05:55.356
to persuade the House to
finance the legal structure

00:05:55.356 --> 00:05:56.671
for the new territory.

00:05:56.671 --> 00:05:58.054
He probably couldn't have
done that if he hadn't

00:05:58.054 --> 00:06:01.467
worked out the negotiating
details in advance.

00:06:01.467 --> 00:06:04.445
- [Sal] Another element that
the second paragraph here

00:06:04.445 --> 00:06:07.500
of Section Two talks about is,
with the advice and consent

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.088
of the Senate, this is talked about a lot.

00:06:10.088 --> 00:06:11.917
The Constitution tries
to set up the Senate

00:06:11.917 --> 00:06:15.888
as where the President
goes to test his ideas,

00:06:15.888 --> 00:06:17.388
get some thinking.

00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:21.210
But Washington also decides that well,

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.955
it's not that efficient
to talking to all these

00:06:22.955 --> 00:06:25.492
elected officials, maybe
I'll set my own body

00:06:25.492 --> 00:06:27.645
that I talk to more frequently.

00:06:27.645 --> 00:06:29.186
- [Jeffrey] That's exactly right.

00:06:29.186 --> 00:06:32.204
As we talked about before,
Section Three of the Constitution

00:06:32.204 --> 00:06:35.304
seems to say that the
President can consult Congress

00:06:35.304 --> 00:06:37.692
for advice in all sorts of situations.

00:06:37.692 --> 00:06:40.605
He can convene both houses.

00:06:40.605 --> 00:06:42.398
He can adjourn them and so forth,

00:06:42.398 --> 00:06:44.720
but Washington established this precedent

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.052
of using a cabinet, and that's a term that

00:06:47.052 --> 00:06:49.280
doesn't appear anywhere
in the Constitution.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.446
Despite the part of the
Constitution that also allows

00:06:52.446 --> 00:06:57.410
the President to seek the
opinions of the various officers,

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.954
Washington informally
sought his cabinet's advice.

00:07:01.954 --> 00:07:04.210
And today although the
cabinet meets less frequently

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.881
than it did before, the
Presidential Cabinet

00:07:06.881 --> 00:07:10.676
or Cabinet meetings is
established as a precedent

00:07:10.676 --> 00:07:12.676
in the Executive Branch.

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:18.501
- [Sal] The last piece
that this Section Two also

00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:20.979
talks about the ability of the President

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:24.181
to make appointments,
anything from ambassadors,

00:07:24.181 --> 00:07:27.021
other public ministers,
consuls, judges, Supreme Court,

00:07:27.021 --> 00:07:29.037
and other officers of the
United States and it also talks

00:07:29.037 --> 00:07:33.081
about Inferior Officers which
are more junior officers

00:07:33.081 --> 00:07:35.431
that some Presidents can do that without

00:07:35.431 --> 00:07:38.048
getting approved by Congress.

00:07:38.048 --> 00:07:40.775
This is also up for some interpretation

00:07:40.775 --> 00:07:43.620
and Washington's precedent's
important there as well.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.597
- [Jeffrey] It is, Washington
was very frustrated by

00:07:46.597 --> 00:07:51.275
the Senate and basically
decided to cut it out and

00:07:51.275 --> 00:07:53.740
not to seek advice and consent in person.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.832
One account says that when
he left the Senate Chamber,

00:07:55.832 --> 00:07:58.515
he said he'd be damned if
he ever went there again.

00:07:58.515 --> 00:08:02.133
He didn't seek the Senate's
written advice before making

00:08:02.133 --> 00:08:04.393
big decisions like treaty
negotiations and he just

00:08:04.393 --> 00:08:06.875
preferred to consult the Cabinet.

00:08:06.875 --> 00:08:09.446
That Cabinet had huge and
important disagreements.

00:08:09.446 --> 00:08:11.771
Again we know from the musical Hamilton,

00:08:11.771 --> 00:08:13.896
Hamilton and Jefferson disagree about

00:08:13.896 --> 00:08:16.707
the constitutionality of the
Bank of the United States,

00:08:16.707 --> 00:08:18.287
they both give their opinions,

00:08:18.287 --> 00:08:20.809
Washington listens to both
and he sides with Hamilton

00:08:20.809 --> 00:08:23.149
over Jefferson and decides to
bless the constitutionality

00:08:23.149 --> 00:08:25.185
of the bank, he got that from his Cabinet

00:08:25.185 --> 00:08:27.838
and not from Congress.

00:08:27.838 --> 00:08:30.289
- [Sal] And then finally
in this appointment,

00:08:30.289 --> 00:08:34.148
to what degree can the
President unilaterally

00:08:34.148 --> 00:08:35.942
take people out of
their jobs, fire people,

00:08:35.942 --> 00:08:37.744
that is also left to interpretation.

00:08:37.744 --> 00:08:39.853
- [Jeffrey] That's right,
Washington established the ability

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:43.236
for President unilaterally
to fire executive officers

00:08:43.236 --> 00:08:44.974
or executive department heads.

00:08:44.974 --> 00:08:47.930
Since the Senate textually
has the power to hire

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.687
department heads, you
could have read Article Two

00:08:50.687 --> 00:08:53.889
to allow it to have a mirror
role in firing them as well

00:08:53.889 --> 00:08:57.778
but the Supreme Court blessed
this idea that the President

00:08:57.778 --> 00:09:01.124
can dismiss people on his own,
there was an important case

00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:03.440
called Meyers Against United
States which said that

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.970
the Vesting Clause which
we talked about earlier

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.627
gave the President both the
authority to execute the law

00:09:08.627 --> 00:09:10.772
and to remove executive officials.

00:09:10.772 --> 00:09:12.919
There are other cases like
the Humphrey's Executor case

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:15.570
from 1935 which said
that Congress could limit

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:19.158
the President's ability to
remove certain commissioners.

00:09:19.158 --> 00:09:21.180
But the broad precedent
that Washington established

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.264
is that the President's unitary authority

00:09:24.264 --> 00:09:28.431
allows him alone to fire
Executive Branch officials.

00:09:29.458 --> 00:09:31.399
- [Sal] Fascinating, well
thanks so much Jeffrey,

00:09:31.399 --> 00:09:33.366
this is super valuable.

00:09:33.366 --> 00:09:36.283
- [Jeffrey] Thanks, great to talk.
