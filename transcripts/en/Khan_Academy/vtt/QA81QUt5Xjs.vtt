(audience laughing)
- All right.

00:00:01.868 --> 00:00:03.278
So very exciting.

00:00:03.278 --> 00:00:05.109
We're here at Khan Academy with the team

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:08.109
and we have some students
from Khan Lab School as well

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.341
with the, I'd say legendary
Francis Ford Coppola,

00:00:12.341 --> 00:00:14.508
most known for filmmaking.

00:00:15.673 --> 00:00:19.594
Obviously The Godfather
movies, Apocalypse Now, Patton.

00:00:19.594 --> 00:00:20.552
I think by the time you were in--

00:00:20.552 --> 00:00:21.723
- The Outsiders.

00:00:21.723 --> 00:00:23.473
- The Outsiders, yes.

00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:27.707
You have more Academy
Awards than most of us,

00:00:27.707 --> 00:00:29.928
(audience laughs)

00:00:29.928 --> 00:00:31.617
but not just, I mean,
I think the one thing

00:00:31.617 --> 00:00:33.983
that we're all gonna learn today is

00:00:33.983 --> 00:00:36.190
as much as Francis is a legend

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.865
and knows so much and
is so steeped in film

00:00:38.865 --> 00:00:41.187
that his interests go well beyond film.

00:00:41.187 --> 00:00:44.187
Obviously wine now and other things.

00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:49.375
Maybe a good place to
start since you are known

00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:51.604
so much as a legendary filmmaker

00:00:51.604 --> 00:00:53.100
is how did you get into that?

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.723
What was your arc from maybe being

00:00:55.723 --> 00:00:57.653
the age of some of these
students at Khan Lab School,

00:00:57.653 --> 00:00:59.167
you know, in your middle school

00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:01.516
to eventually becoming a filmmaker?

00:01:01.516 --> 00:01:03.757
- Well, for some reason my father,

00:01:03.757 --> 00:01:06.746
who was a classical musician,

00:01:06.746 --> 00:01:09.192
moved every eight months it seemed

00:01:09.192 --> 00:01:12.730
and we were always in a new
house, in a new neighborhood,

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.892
and I was always the new kid at school

00:01:15.892 --> 00:01:18.656
and my name was Francis, so they was,

00:01:18.656 --> 00:01:20.755
"Oh, that's a girl's name."

00:01:20.755 --> 00:01:24.924
So I got all of the typical
hazing when you're the new kid,

00:01:24.924 --> 00:01:27.378
but I was very good at science.

00:01:27.378 --> 00:01:29.932
I was very interested in
science and electricity

00:01:29.932 --> 00:01:34.454
and I used to love to read
the lives of the inventors

00:01:34.454 --> 00:01:36.840
and I felt I knew all about that,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.794
so much to this extent that
when my father asked me

00:01:39.794 --> 00:01:42.313
what I wanted to be when I grew up,

00:01:42.313 --> 00:01:44.241
I said, "A nuclear physicist."

00:01:44.241 --> 00:01:46.685
And he said to me, "Francis,
you can't flunk algebra

00:01:46.685 --> 00:01:49.748
"three times in a row and
be a nuclear physicist."

00:01:49.748 --> 00:01:51.307
And I said, "Why not?"

00:01:51.307 --> 00:01:53.946
But nonetheless, I was discouraged

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:56.448
that I could ever be a scientist,

00:01:56.448 --> 00:01:57.599
which is what I wanted to be,

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:59.891
because I was not good at math.

00:01:59.891 --> 00:02:01.629
So whenever I went to a new school--

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:03.172
- But you were very strong at geometry.

00:02:03.172 --> 00:02:05.520
- I was very, I won the geometry medal.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.941
- [Interviewer] Yes, so it's that.

00:02:06.941 --> 00:02:09.369
- I was really good at geometry,
but geometry you can see

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.362
and you can see the whole all the time.

00:02:13.362 --> 00:02:16.313
Sometimes it's not
clear, but you see it all

00:02:16.313 --> 00:02:18.966
and I was good at that.

00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:21.598
So whenever I went to a new school,

00:02:21.598 --> 00:02:23.875
I would always head to
the theater department

00:02:23.875 --> 00:02:25.396
because they always needed people

00:02:25.396 --> 00:02:29.126
who were good with
electricity and technology

00:02:29.126 --> 00:02:30.841
and also that's where the girls were.

00:02:30.841 --> 00:02:31.897
(audience laughs)

00:02:31.897 --> 00:02:33.259
And I wanted to meet them.

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:34.815
(audience laughs)

00:02:34.815 --> 00:02:38.442
So I figured if I was around
the theater department working,

00:02:38.442 --> 00:02:40.422
I would get to meet the girls.

00:02:40.422 --> 00:02:42.539
I could've also gone to the football team

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:45.228
where they had girls, but
I didn't qualify for that.

00:02:45.228 --> 00:02:47.098
(audience laughs)

00:02:47.098 --> 00:02:49.704
An interesting note to understand me

00:02:49.704 --> 00:02:51.213
is that when I was nine years old,

00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:53.567
I was paralyzed with polio,

00:02:53.567 --> 00:02:56.234
which was a big epidemic in 1949

00:02:57.195 --> 00:03:01.362
and it struck kids, many many
many children were paralyzed

00:03:02.341 --> 00:03:07.157
until only a few years
later I think, 1951, '52,

00:03:07.157 --> 00:03:11.074
they developed a vaccine
and the Sabin vaccine,

00:03:12.105 --> 00:03:16.180
but my generation, polio was
the scary children's disease

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.284
and I got it and I missed the sixth grade

00:03:19.284 --> 00:03:21.530
because I couldn't walk,

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.099
but through the wonderful
hospices of the March of Dimes,

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.729
it was a charity called
the March of Dimes.

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:32.896
Everyone donated dimes to
it and they sent a therapist

00:03:34.244 --> 00:03:36.962
who slowly brought me back to the ability

00:03:36.962 --> 00:03:39.278
to walk about a year and a half later.

00:03:39.278 --> 00:03:42.390
- Wow, and so how did you go from

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.408
that state you're talking about

00:03:43.408 --> 00:03:46.584
where you were a little bit
involved with drama and theater

00:03:46.584 --> 00:03:49.588
to actually deciding that
you wanted to be a filmmaker

00:03:49.588 --> 00:03:51.379
and actually making films?

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.637
- Well, I had an older
brother, five years older,

00:03:53.637 --> 00:03:56.379
who was a very good
student and very handsome

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.394
and very accomplished and
wonderful to me by the way

00:04:00.394 --> 00:04:03.371
and I just wanted to be like him.

00:04:03.371 --> 00:04:07.308
In fact, he was already
interested in writing stories

00:04:07.308 --> 00:04:10.276
and his name was August Floyd Coppola

00:04:10.276 --> 00:04:14.731
and I just thought that was so
cool that I made my own name,

00:04:14.731 --> 00:04:17.478
Francis Ford Coppola, just to imitate him.

00:04:17.478 --> 00:04:19.123
(audience chuckles)

00:04:19.123 --> 00:04:20.971
- [Interviewer] Ford, it
was not part of your name?

00:04:20.971 --> 00:04:23.298
- Ford is my middle name, but I used it

00:04:23.298 --> 00:04:26.455
because my brother had,
but I was born in Detroit

00:04:26.455 --> 00:04:29.140
and my middle name was after Henry Ford

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.340
'cause my father, who
was a classical musician

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.789
played for the Detroit Symphony.

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:36.661
In those days, they
were the big orchestras

00:04:36.661 --> 00:04:40.296
who were on the radio,
that was The Ford Hour.

00:04:40.296 --> 00:04:43.840
- And so as your brother,
so how did that tie in too?

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.339
- Well, I just wanted to
be like him if I could.

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:47.877
You know, when you're five years apart,

00:04:47.877 --> 00:04:50.129
there's no contest of you competing.

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:51.917
He can beat you up, he's smarter than you.

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:53.681
(audience chuckles)
But he was so kind to me

00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:56.270
and encouraged me that I thought

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.753
that if he had, he was so good at school

00:04:58.753 --> 00:05:00.372
that the family foot, he was gonna be

00:05:00.372 --> 00:05:05.199
the first doctor in our
Italian American family.

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:06.828
So I thought I would be an eye doctor

00:05:06.828 --> 00:05:09.626
so I could work with lenses and prisms

00:05:09.626 --> 00:05:14.251
'cause I always loved prisms
and what light can do in a lab.

00:05:14.251 --> 00:05:17.033
So later in college, he flipped

00:05:17.033 --> 00:05:18.685
and became a philosophy major

00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:21.898
and told my father he
was gonna be a novelist,

00:05:21.898 --> 00:05:23.953
so then I said, "Well,
I'll be a playwright then."

00:05:23.953 --> 00:05:25.809
(audience laughs)

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:28.137
So when I went, was ready in high school

00:05:28.137 --> 00:05:31.295
to consider college, I thought I would try

00:05:31.295 --> 00:05:34.545
to become a drama major and eventually,

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:39.775
I entered school as a playwrighting major,

00:05:39.775 --> 00:05:43.805
but I of course worked in the
technical part of the theater,

00:05:43.805 --> 00:05:45.530
doing the lighting and stuff.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.063
One day when I was up on
a ladder hanging a light,

00:05:48.063 --> 00:05:50.781
I saw the teacher, who
was always the director,

00:05:50.781 --> 00:05:54.158
the shows were always
directed by faculty members,

00:05:54.158 --> 00:05:56.683
and I saw the teacher telling the kids,

00:05:56.683 --> 00:06:00.351
the actors, oh, you go here,
I thought I could do that.

00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:03.185
So in college, I started to direct plays

00:06:03.185 --> 00:06:06.185
and ultimately I was going to try to

00:06:07.216 --> 00:06:09.692
be a writer and director in the theater

00:06:09.692 --> 00:06:11.629
and in the theater in our country,

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:13.829
the great theater graduate school,

00:06:13.829 --> 00:06:15.713
there are actually several great ones,

00:06:15.713 --> 00:06:18.435
but one of the great ones
is the Yale Drama School,

00:06:18.435 --> 00:06:20.091
which is a graduate school.

00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:23.882
So I was gonna be, go right
to the Yale Drama School

00:06:23.882 --> 00:06:28.639
and one afternoon, I was in
around the plaza of the college.

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:30.953
I pretty much just hung
around the drama department.

00:06:30.953 --> 00:06:32.489
That was my life.

00:06:32.489 --> 00:06:34.340
I noticed a little theater that said

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.423
today, 4:00 screening of
Sergei Eisenstein's film

00:06:39.369 --> 00:06:41.411
Ten Days That Shook the World.

00:06:41.411 --> 00:06:44.235
I'd never heard of Sergei Eisenstein

00:06:44.235 --> 00:06:46.979
and it was a silent film,
but I had nothing to do

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:48.136
and I went in and there were about

00:06:48.136 --> 00:06:50.847
maybe six other people in the theater.

00:06:50.847 --> 00:06:54.937
No one was that interested
and it was truly silent

00:06:54.937 --> 00:06:57.241
and it lasted almost four hours

00:06:57.241 --> 00:06:59.824
and I had never seen a
film like that in my life,

00:06:59.824 --> 00:07:02.667
that the editing itself made up

00:07:02.667 --> 00:07:04.442
for the fact that there was no sound.

00:07:04.442 --> 00:07:06.847
When they shot machine
guns, you could hear them

00:07:06.847 --> 00:07:10.233
just by the way it was edited
because this Eisenstein,

00:07:10.233 --> 00:07:13.009
who was a film director in the '20s,

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:17.176
invented and came up with new
ways of cutting film together,

00:07:18.248 --> 00:07:22.429
which is spoken of in his era as montage.

00:07:22.429 --> 00:07:25.711
The curious thing that
you could take a shot

00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:27.436
and cut it next to another shot

00:07:27.436 --> 00:07:30.031
and it means something different
than either of the shots

00:07:30.031 --> 00:07:32.465
is a kind of magic alchemy

00:07:32.465 --> 00:07:35.220
and I was just so impressed with that

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.030
that I said, "I'm not going
to the Yale Drama School.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.253
"I wanna go to the UCLA Film School."

00:07:41.253 --> 00:07:43.569
I changed my whole life and went on

00:07:43.569 --> 00:07:46.660
to be a film student in America

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.190
at a time when no film student

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.081
had ever gotten to make a feature film.

00:07:51.081 --> 00:07:53.353
- So that raises the question.

00:07:53.353 --> 00:07:56.406
What was it about either the
mindset that you took to it

00:07:56.406 --> 00:07:59.083
or how you developed
yourself or even just fortune

00:07:59.083 --> 00:08:00.509
that put you in the right place

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:03.011
that allowed you to do that
which you just described?

00:08:03.011 --> 00:08:06.222
A lot of students weren't
able to make a feature film.

00:08:06.222 --> 00:08:10.125
- Well, in college in
the drama department,

00:08:10.125 --> 00:08:12.854
I became very Machiavellian.

00:08:12.854 --> 00:08:14.900
Do any of you know what that word means?

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:19.406
You all know that
Machiavelli was a minister.

00:08:19.406 --> 00:08:23.573
He was actually on the outs
with the prince in Florence

00:08:24.994 --> 00:08:28.111
and his name was Niccolo Machiavelli.

00:08:28.111 --> 00:08:30.560
So he wrote a little book about,

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.239
a handbook for princes and
how to double cross people

00:08:34.239 --> 00:08:35.900
and how to do all those,

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.899
what we now call Machiavellian things.

00:08:37.899 --> 00:08:39.262
There was more to him than that,

00:08:39.262 --> 00:08:41.316
but he's famous for that little book.

00:08:41.316 --> 00:08:43.827
That little book you can
read in about two hours.

00:08:43.827 --> 00:08:47.757
It's called The Prince
and it's all the rules of

00:08:47.757 --> 00:08:49.562
doing all those political things.

00:08:49.562 --> 00:08:52.107
I became very Machiavellian in college

00:08:52.107 --> 00:08:53.153
(audience laughs)

00:08:53.153 --> 00:08:57.021
because I wondered why
only the faculty members

00:08:57.021 --> 00:09:00.406
got to direct all the
plays and no students.

00:09:00.406 --> 00:09:02.381
So I did a little research
and I learned that

00:09:02.381 --> 00:09:05.531
the plays were paid for by the fees

00:09:05.531 --> 00:09:09.317
the students paid upfront for so-called

00:09:09.317 --> 00:09:11.772
co-curricular activities
or extracurricular.

00:09:11.772 --> 00:09:16.280
In other words, the
yearbook or the newspaper

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.230
or the drama department, those
were all considered clubs

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:24.084
and they were funded by student fees.

00:09:24.084 --> 00:09:27.159
There were two clubs
when I went to college

00:09:27.159 --> 00:09:30.231
at Hofstra College,
which is where the debate

00:09:30.231 --> 00:09:33.148
that Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump had

00:09:34.097 --> 00:09:35.672
two debates ago, was Hofstra College.

00:09:35.672 --> 00:09:38.129
That theater that they
were in, I know backwards.

00:09:38.129 --> 00:09:39.497
(Francis and audience laugh)

00:09:39.497 --> 00:09:43.244
So what I did is I became the president

00:09:43.244 --> 00:09:47.764
of both the musical comedy
club and the drama club,

00:09:47.764 --> 00:09:49.463
which were very different kinds of kids,

00:09:49.463 --> 00:09:54.461
but I became president of both
and I merged them together

00:09:54.461 --> 00:09:56.300
and then having merged them together,

00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:00.050
I made a rule that you
couldn't be in a show,

00:10:01.412 --> 00:10:03.721
to act in a musical or a play,

00:10:03.721 --> 00:10:06.541
unless you had not
missed the club meetings

00:10:06.541 --> 00:10:09.623
or at least you couldn't
have missed three in a row

00:10:09.623 --> 00:10:11.488
because no one ever went
to the club meetings.

00:10:11.488 --> 00:10:13.133
(audience laughs)

00:10:13.133 --> 00:10:14.447
Then but I did a good thing with it.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.598
We had the meetings, but I also invited

00:10:16.598 --> 00:10:19.791
everyone who wanted to to do
a little experimental workshop

00:10:19.791 --> 00:10:22.614
or a little one act play,
so the meetings were good,

00:10:22.614 --> 00:10:26.417
but during the meeting, I had
a vote and passed the rule

00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:29.132
that faculty members
could not direct shows

00:10:29.132 --> 00:10:31.248
that were funded by student money.

00:10:31.248 --> 00:10:32.274
(audience laughs)

00:10:32.274 --> 00:10:34.989
So suddenly all these drama
teachers who had come there

00:10:34.989 --> 00:10:37.872
so they could direct the
big show couldn't direct it.

00:10:37.872 --> 00:10:40.296
So I was the only student
who wanted to direct.

00:10:40.296 --> 00:10:42.844
(audience laughs)

00:10:42.844 --> 00:10:44.799
- Did you actually run for president

00:10:44.799 --> 00:10:47.250
of two separate clubs
and enact those rules

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.519
with that in mind, that
I will get enough support

00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:51.855
by forcing people to go to these meetings

00:10:51.855 --> 00:10:55.456
and two clubs to allow
myself to direct the shows?

00:10:55.456 --> 00:10:57.367
- Well, it's a funny thing about power.

00:10:57.367 --> 00:10:58.834
(audience laughs)

00:10:58.834 --> 00:11:01.933
You don't necessarily know
that you're amassing it,

00:11:01.933 --> 00:11:03.334
but you sort of do.

00:11:03.334 --> 00:11:04.736
(audience laughs)

00:11:04.736 --> 00:11:06.241
But I was going in that direction

00:11:06.241 --> 00:11:07.589
and it worked very well for me

00:11:07.589 --> 00:11:11.117
because I got to do, not only
could I direct a production,

00:11:11.117 --> 00:11:15.009
but I used the strength
of having the finance,

00:11:15.009 --> 00:11:18.349
which was coming from the
club, we did ambitious shows.

00:11:18.349 --> 00:11:20.304
We did original musicals.

00:11:20.304 --> 00:11:22.997
We did a production of A
Streetcar Named Desire.

00:11:22.997 --> 00:11:24.526
We did all these wonderful things

00:11:24.526 --> 00:11:26.227
and many of the things were wonderful

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:30.394
that brought life to the drama
department because of it.

00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:34.564
- How did you, so in college,
you get this great experience.

00:11:34.564 --> 00:11:37.339
You're directing it sounds
like big productions.

00:11:37.339 --> 00:11:41.756
How did that translate when you
first did your first movies?

00:11:41.756 --> 00:11:43.498
You did the screenplay for Patton.

00:11:43.498 --> 00:11:44.930
And you were quite young.
- Well, I went to the UCLA.

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.682
In those days, there were two
or three big film schools.

00:11:47.682 --> 00:11:51.849
There was UCLA and USC and
in New York, there was NYU.

00:11:52.821 --> 00:11:56.855
To make it more clear for you,
Marty Scorsese went to NYU.

00:11:56.855 --> 00:12:00.943
George Lucas went to
USC and I went to UCLA.

00:12:00.943 --> 00:12:02.004
(audience chuckles)

00:12:02.004 --> 00:12:03.738
No one from any film school had

00:12:03.738 --> 00:12:06.649
ever made a feature movie, ever.

00:12:06.649 --> 00:12:10.984
So I sort of went to
UCLA with a big advantage

00:12:10.984 --> 00:12:14.038
'cause I had been a theater student

00:12:14.038 --> 00:12:17.653
and a theater student, one
of the fundamental things

00:12:17.653 --> 00:12:22.418
a theater student has to learn
is about writing and acting.

00:12:22.418 --> 00:12:25.785
Well, writing and acting
are the magical ingredients

00:12:25.785 --> 00:12:28.750
of any theater or cinema or performance.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:29.678
You could see a movie

00:12:29.678 --> 00:12:31.612
and it could have beautiful photography

00:12:31.612 --> 00:12:33.799
and it can have great art direction,

00:12:33.799 --> 00:12:37.056
but if it has terrible
acting and a dumb script,

00:12:37.056 --> 00:12:38.385
it's not gonna be successful.

00:12:38.385 --> 00:12:41.434
Yet, a film that has a wonderful script

00:12:41.434 --> 00:12:44.071
and wonderful acting that
has terrible photography

00:12:44.071 --> 00:12:48.065
and terrible art direction and
everything else can be a hit.

00:12:48.065 --> 00:12:51.787
So I always say that acting and writing

00:12:51.787 --> 00:12:55.954
is the water, is the oxygen
and hydrogen that make water,

00:12:57.176 --> 00:13:00.422
that if you focus on the
writing and the acting,

00:13:00.422 --> 00:13:03.394
of course you want the
music and the photography,

00:13:03.394 --> 00:13:05.396
everything to be beautiful,

00:13:05.396 --> 00:13:09.182
but those are really where
the magic I think happens.

00:13:09.182 --> 00:13:13.349
So having come from theater,
I knew a lot more about acting

00:13:14.315 --> 00:13:16.022
than any of the cinema students,

00:13:16.022 --> 00:13:18.110
who were much more into the camera.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:20.567
The great film director
Orson Welles once said

00:13:20.567 --> 00:13:21.830
that you can learn everything

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:24.812
about how to make movies in a weekend,

00:13:24.812 --> 00:13:26.474
meaning the camera, the editing

00:13:26.474 --> 00:13:29.656
and more or less, of course
that's a little overdoing it.

00:13:29.656 --> 00:13:32.746
He, when he made his first
film, had a great photographer,

00:13:32.746 --> 00:13:34.933
but nonetheless, it's somewhat true.

00:13:34.933 --> 00:13:36.981
The camera and stuff is not the hard part.

00:13:36.981 --> 00:13:39.613
The hard part is the
writing and the acting.

00:13:39.613 --> 00:13:42.600
So having focused on that in theater,

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.015
I had an advantage when I
went into the film school

00:13:46.015 --> 00:13:48.106
because there were philosophy students.

00:13:48.106 --> 00:13:51.523
Terrence Malick was a philosophy student.

00:13:52.784 --> 00:13:55.882
They were crazy to get
their hands on cameras

00:13:55.882 --> 00:13:59.395
and I had already worked with actors

00:13:59.395 --> 00:14:04.132
and also there's a sort of
prejudice against actors.

00:14:04.132 --> 00:14:05.034
I don't know if you know what I'm saying,

00:14:05.034 --> 00:14:07.050
but there's a sort of jock mentality

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:09.024
about actors among the film crews.

00:14:09.024 --> 00:14:11.488
They think oh my god, they're such a,

00:14:11.488 --> 00:14:12.822
you know, what do they do after?

00:14:12.822 --> 00:14:15.340
Well, what an actor does is really hard

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.259
because if you play a violin,

00:14:18.259 --> 00:14:20.503
not only do you have to be
able to play the violin,

00:14:20.503 --> 00:14:24.268
you've got the violin
between you and audience.

00:14:24.268 --> 00:14:27.723
The actor has to sort of
do what a violinist does,

00:14:27.723 --> 00:14:31.175
except his instrument
is himself or herself.

00:14:31.175 --> 00:14:34.065
So it's really terrifying to be an actor

00:14:34.065 --> 00:14:37.869
and at the same time fight
the self-consciousness

00:14:37.869 --> 00:14:39.829
that anyone would have.

00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:43.338
So I always approached movies and theater

00:14:43.338 --> 00:14:46.588
with tremendous respect for the actors.

00:14:47.854 --> 00:14:51.103
The actors, actresses today
like to be known as actors

00:14:51.103 --> 00:14:54.900
because it comes from the verb, to act.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.814
It's the one who acts.

00:14:56.814 --> 00:15:00.771
Not that you act a role,
which it indirectly means,

00:15:00.771 --> 00:15:04.291
but it's the actor means
the principle person

00:15:04.291 --> 00:15:05.928
making movement within the story.

00:15:05.928 --> 00:15:08.509
It could be a man or a
woman, could be an actor.

00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:11.568
Actress is sort of like
professoressa, you know?

00:15:11.568 --> 00:15:14.235
Lady professor, it's diminutive.

00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:17.138
So at any rate, I had this advantage of

00:15:17.138 --> 00:15:18.488
having been a drama student

00:15:18.488 --> 00:15:20.776
and also having been enough Machiavellian

00:15:20.776 --> 00:15:24.179
that I could conspire,
which is what you have to do

00:15:24.179 --> 00:15:27.120
to get a movie off the ground,
certainly in those days,

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.524
to try to conspire to
put together a movie,

00:15:30.524 --> 00:15:32.051
which I did and I got to make.

00:15:32.051 --> 00:15:33.717
Because I was the first student

00:15:33.717 --> 00:15:36.953
to really make a feature film,

00:15:36.953 --> 00:15:41.290
some other students from USA
heard about this weird guy,

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:43.606
notably George Lucas, who was about

00:15:43.606 --> 00:15:45.417
four years, five years younger than me.

00:15:45.417 --> 00:15:47.074
Four years younger than me.

00:15:47.074 --> 00:15:50.107
So he kind of came around,
this skinny kid with a beard

00:15:50.107 --> 00:15:53.550
when I was directing a
picture at Warner Brothers

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:54.784
and this kid is watching me.

00:15:54.784 --> 00:15:58.043
Everyone on the show
is old and wore suits.

00:15:58.043 --> 00:15:59.427
He was this skinny kid with a beard

00:15:59.427 --> 00:16:01.157
and I looked at him looking at me

00:16:01.157 --> 00:16:02.570
and I said, "Well, what do you see?"

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:04.127
And he said, "Not much."

00:16:04.127 --> 00:16:05.727
(audience laughs)

00:16:05.727 --> 00:16:07.927
With that, we became friends immediately.

00:16:07.927 --> 00:16:09.999
(audience laughs)

00:16:09.999 --> 00:16:11.400
We started hanging out together

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.532
and ultimately he became
sort of an assistant.

00:16:13.532 --> 00:16:14.806
He wouldn't say that now,

00:16:14.806 --> 00:16:16.975
(audience laughs)
but because he was younger

00:16:16.975 --> 00:16:20.142
and I've known George Lucas
throughout all of his career.

00:16:20.142 --> 00:16:23.982
Produced his first movies like THX 1138

00:16:23.982 --> 00:16:27.110
and American Graffiti before he went

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:31.393
off on his own to do the
astonishing work that he did

00:16:31.393 --> 00:16:32.468
and he's remained my friend.

00:16:32.468 --> 00:16:34.405
He's one of the few directors who still

00:16:34.405 --> 00:16:36.374
lives more or less in Northern California.

00:16:36.374 --> 00:16:39.011
I think Solomon knows him.

00:16:39.011 --> 00:16:40.330
(Interviewer laughs)
(audience laughs)

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.326
Did I answer your question?

00:16:41.326 --> 00:16:43.290
(audience laughs)
- No, absolutely,

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:44.445
but just following up on George

00:16:44.445 --> 00:16:46.757
as something you just told
me, which I found fascinating,

00:16:46.757 --> 00:16:51.272
but the more I hear your
story, I'm connecting dots.

00:16:51.272 --> 00:16:53.365
You aren't just known for writing

00:16:53.365 --> 00:16:54.450
and directing these great films.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:56.007
There's also a famous character

00:16:56.007 --> 00:16:59.189
in popular fiction that
is based off of you.

00:16:59.189 --> 00:17:00.595
- Yep.

00:17:00.595 --> 00:17:01.886
That's Han Solo

00:17:01.886 --> 00:17:03.398
(audience gasps and laughs)
because George felt

00:17:03.398 --> 00:17:07.629
that I was, that I just
took crazy reckless chances

00:17:07.629 --> 00:17:09.809
and would jump off a
mountain without knowing

00:17:09.809 --> 00:17:11.465
what was down there to land on

00:17:11.465 --> 00:17:13.148
and that I would end up with no money,

00:17:13.148 --> 00:17:15.364
so he created, you can look it up.

00:17:15.364 --> 00:17:17.341
Say Francis Coppola Han Solo

00:17:17.341 --> 00:17:19.055
(audience laughs)
and you'll, you'll find that.

00:17:19.055 --> 00:17:21.323
So I'm sort of a dashing failure.

00:17:21.323 --> 00:17:24.339
(audience laughs)

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:26.640
- How do you, do you agree with that?

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.891
Do you see yourself in Han Solo?

00:17:28.891 --> 00:17:29.812
- Well, I know what, you know,

00:17:29.812 --> 00:17:31.429
George is what I used to call,

00:17:31.429 --> 00:17:33.724
I always call an old stick in the mud

00:17:33.724 --> 00:17:35.547
'cause George is very conservative,

00:17:35.547 --> 00:17:39.241
although his imagination is
wild, but in his personal life,

00:17:39.241 --> 00:17:41.574
he's pretty conservative
and I'm the opposite.

00:17:41.574 --> 00:17:45.491
I'm much more, I'm not
afraid of taking chances

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:50.281
and taking risks because
so far what we know,

00:17:50.281 --> 00:17:53.534
you get this one life and the worst thing

00:17:53.534 --> 00:17:55.378
that could possibly happen when you're

00:17:55.378 --> 00:17:57.938
this old, old, old man or old woman

00:17:57.938 --> 00:18:00.516
to, say, be there, getting ready to die,

00:18:00.516 --> 00:18:02.952
saying, "Oh, I wish I had done this.

00:18:02.952 --> 00:18:04.984
"I wish I had done that."

00:18:04.984 --> 00:18:06.916
That's, you don't wanna do that.

00:18:06.916 --> 00:18:09.693
In my case, I'm gonna say,
"Oh, I got to make movies

00:18:09.693 --> 00:18:11.590
"and I got to see my kids make movies

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:12.904
"and I got to make wine

00:18:12.904 --> 00:18:14.966
"and I got to do experimental workshops."

00:18:14.966 --> 00:18:16.701
I'm gonna be so busy talking about

00:18:16.701 --> 00:18:18.400
all the things I got to do,
(audience chuckles)

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.229
that when I die, I'm not gonna notice it.

00:18:20.229 --> 00:18:22.536
(audience laughs)

00:18:22.536 --> 00:18:25.284
(audience applauds)

00:18:25.284 --> 00:18:28.896
And that's my recommendation.
(Interviewer laughs)

00:18:28.896 --> 00:18:31.893
- So, and I think that
connects to another thing that,

00:18:31.893 --> 00:18:34.291
and it's pretty obvious
when people hear you,

00:18:34.291 --> 00:18:37.309
but above and beyond this,
I mean, learning itself

00:18:37.309 --> 00:18:39.994
and I think this is a
connection between yourself

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:42.877
and what we try to do
here at Khan Academy.

00:18:42.877 --> 00:18:44.860
At its core, learning is a bit of

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.557
a passion of yours, in and of itself.

00:18:47.557 --> 00:18:49.394
- Well, it totally makes sense.

00:18:49.394 --> 00:18:52.786
I mean, in life there are many
wonderful things you can do.

00:18:52.786 --> 00:18:54.470
There are many pleasurable things.

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:58.180
Many of them unfortunately
have a bad side.

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:01.965
Drinking wine and alcohol in moderation

00:19:01.965 --> 00:19:05.481
can be a wonderful thing, but
too much will make you sick

00:19:05.481 --> 00:19:08.151
or anything you do that brings pleasure.

00:19:08.151 --> 00:19:10.213
If you think girls are great
and you're running after girls,

00:19:10.213 --> 00:19:11.967
then your wife is gonna,
(audience chuckles)

00:19:11.967 --> 00:19:15.121
I've been married 53
years, so I know the value

00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:17.954
of having one wife for a lifetime.

00:19:20.627 --> 00:19:21.765
So you can't do that.

00:19:21.765 --> 00:19:25.730
So if you eat too much, you'll
just get disgustingly fat,

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.061
which I have a problem with.

00:19:28.061 --> 00:19:29.129
(audience chuckles)

00:19:29.129 --> 00:19:33.375
But in life, learning
is as much a pleasure

00:19:33.375 --> 00:19:36.230
as any of those things
and there's no bad part.

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:39.032
There's no, it doesn't bite you back.

00:19:39.032 --> 00:19:40.973
You can't learn too much and overload.

00:19:40.973 --> 00:19:43.258
Oh, I've over learned this
month, I just don't feel well.

00:19:43.258 --> 00:19:45.243
(audience and Interviewer laugh)

00:19:45.243 --> 00:19:48.273
The only thing I know like
learning like that is music,

00:19:48.273 --> 00:19:50.231
in that I don't know any way,

00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:51.748
unless maybe if you're listening

00:19:51.748 --> 00:19:55.605
to eardrum-breaking rock and
roll where it could be bad,

00:19:55.605 --> 00:19:57.964
but music is generally good for you

00:19:57.964 --> 00:19:59.601
and we can talk about that

00:19:59.601 --> 00:20:02.470
because there's a philosophy that believes

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:07.146
that music is the only way
that we can really understand

00:20:07.146 --> 00:20:10.455
what's really out there,
beyond our senses.

00:20:10.455 --> 00:20:13.561
Any rate, so learning, I always thought

00:20:13.561 --> 00:20:14.568
when I was a little kid,

00:20:14.568 --> 00:20:16.456
if they said to me, "You know, Francis,

00:20:16.456 --> 00:20:19.453
"you're about to learn
about this and about that

00:20:19.453 --> 00:20:21.203
"and you're gonna learn about algebra

00:20:21.203 --> 00:20:23.236
"and algebra comes from the Arabs.

00:20:23.236 --> 00:20:25.032
"It was called al jabr

00:20:25.032 --> 00:20:26.903
"and they probably
learned it from the Greeks

00:20:26.903 --> 00:20:29.246
"and it's really an
exciting way to solve."

00:20:29.246 --> 00:20:32.179
No one ever told me at the
beginning of my education

00:20:32.179 --> 00:20:34.640
what a lot of joyous fun it was.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.213
It always had me scared that I was gonna

00:20:37.213 --> 00:20:39.896
get that visit from Miss
Henchman to my father

00:20:39.896 --> 00:20:42.038
and then I would get a, you know.

00:20:42.038 --> 00:20:44.107
In those days, there was you got hit

00:20:44.107 --> 00:20:48.263
if you got bad report cards, which I did,

00:20:48.263 --> 00:20:52.434
but no one ever told me the
exciting side of learning

00:20:52.434 --> 00:20:53.628
and not only that, I used to,

00:20:53.628 --> 00:20:56.085
oh, how much school am I gonna?

00:20:56.085 --> 00:20:57.433
You're never out of school.

00:20:57.433 --> 00:20:59.683
I'm 77 and I learn so much.

00:21:00.576 --> 00:21:01.705
Every night I'm learning.

00:21:01.705 --> 00:21:03.309
Now I'm learning about genetics,

00:21:03.309 --> 00:21:04.846
which is really fascinating,

00:21:04.846 --> 00:21:08.955
about the human genome and
the chromosomes and the genes

00:21:08.955 --> 00:21:11.492
and it's amazing to
know that the scientists

00:21:11.492 --> 00:21:15.907
didn't even understand
it really until the '80s.

00:21:15.907 --> 00:21:16.865
I mean, that's recent.

00:21:16.865 --> 00:21:19.694
Some of you were probably,
well, not you guys,

00:21:19.694 --> 00:21:21.194
but some of you were born
(audience laughs)

00:21:21.194 --> 00:21:23.490
in the '80s and imagine,
they didn't even understand

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:28.131
how the gene worked (coughs)
and they don't entirely now.

00:21:28.131 --> 00:21:30.823
Well, that's what I'm learning about now.

00:21:30.823 --> 00:21:33.507
It's thrilling, it's so exciting.

00:21:33.507 --> 00:21:37.502
Or to learn about history
and understand really,

00:21:37.502 --> 00:21:40.268
we all know that the world is troubled

00:21:40.268 --> 00:21:44.762
and that a lot of it focuses
on the Middle East and Islam,

00:21:44.762 --> 00:21:46.909
but no one knows that
really you have to go back

00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:50.473
almost to the first
World War to understand

00:21:50.473 --> 00:21:55.039
the bad feelings that were
engendered at that time

00:21:55.039 --> 00:21:59.039
and also that Islam is
not, Islam was the zenith

00:22:01.274 --> 00:22:05.441
of intellectual study and
science in the 13th century,

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:10.350
in terms of, well, it's interesting

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:13.560
'cause in Islam, you have
to pray five times a day

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.900
and you have to point when
you pray towards Mecca.

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:22.299
So it was to their advantage
to really understand time

00:22:22.299 --> 00:22:25.761
so they knew they would pray
at the right time each day.

00:22:25.761 --> 00:22:29.381
So they studied the heavens
to be masters of time

00:22:29.381 --> 00:22:33.047
and the reason that Islamic
science knew so much

00:22:33.047 --> 00:22:37.385
about the heavens and
time was for that reason.

00:22:37.385 --> 00:22:39.776
It's because they, and they wanted to

00:22:39.776 --> 00:22:41.213
point in the right direction,

00:22:41.213 --> 00:22:43.372
so they brought so much to us

00:22:43.372 --> 00:22:46.955
in these areas of
astronomy and navigation.

00:22:48.962 --> 00:22:53.129
Of course Islam, those states
were close to Ancient Greece,

00:22:54.068 --> 00:22:56.076
so they preserved a lot of the knowledge

00:22:56.076 --> 00:22:58.080
that had been in Greek and that's how

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.163
we still have such things as algebra.

00:23:02.653 --> 00:23:04.415
- Yeah, and before we open it up

00:23:04.415 --> 00:23:07.568
for some questions from the audience,

00:23:07.568 --> 00:23:09.389
how did we get connected?

00:23:09.389 --> 00:23:11.001
What was your connection,

00:23:11.001 --> 00:23:12.324
how did you bump into Khan Academy?

00:23:12.324 --> 00:23:14.762
- Well, I ran across the name

00:23:14.762 --> 00:23:17.795
and that you had a course in algebra

00:23:17.795 --> 00:23:20.236
and I said, "Why was I so stupid

00:23:20.236 --> 00:23:23.498
"that I couldn't grasp algebra?"

00:23:23.498 --> 00:23:26.442
So I looked at the
beginning algebra course

00:23:26.442 --> 00:23:27.777
and I said, "Gee, if I had had this,

00:23:27.777 --> 00:23:29.227
"I wouldn't have failed algebra

00:23:29.227 --> 00:23:31.163
"three times and I understand."

00:23:31.163 --> 00:23:33.449
No one ever explained it that there was,

00:23:33.449 --> 00:23:37.062
that this was a method
for solving problems.

00:23:37.062 --> 00:23:39.276
I always used to say, "Why
do I care what X means?

00:23:39.276 --> 00:23:42.290
"I wanna know what something
that I know means."

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:43.442
(audience laughs)
But no one explained to me

00:23:43.442 --> 00:23:47.198
that it was essentially a procedure,

00:23:47.198 --> 00:23:50.505
an algorithm as you wish, to
learn how to solve a problem.

00:23:50.505 --> 00:23:51.532
They didn't say that to me.

00:23:51.532 --> 00:23:52.925
They just said, "You're in bad trouble.

00:23:52.925 --> 00:23:55.321
"You're flunking algebra."

00:23:55.321 --> 00:23:58.942
Since I wasn't at the
school from the beginning,

00:23:58.942 --> 00:24:02.258
I was a new kid, I just
assumed I was stupid,

00:24:02.258 --> 00:24:04.278
which is what they told me.

00:24:04.278 --> 00:24:08.445
- Yep, so with that, let's
open it up for some questions.

00:24:11.574 --> 00:24:13.509
- Hi, Mr. Coppola, I'm Karina.

00:24:13.509 --> 00:24:16.069
I'm on the props team, so
you know we share that.

00:24:16.069 --> 00:24:17.046
Thank you so much for coming.

00:24:17.046 --> 00:24:19.371
This has been educational and hilarious

00:24:19.371 --> 00:24:20.491
(audience laughs)
at the same time.

00:24:20.491 --> 00:24:22.171
Outside of human genetics,

00:24:22.171 --> 00:24:24.659
what learning do you feel like
you still have to accomplish

00:24:24.659 --> 00:24:27.665
and what excites you now about film?

00:24:27.665 --> 00:24:30.005
- Well, what excites me about film,

00:24:30.005 --> 00:24:32.059
there are many fields that interest me.

00:24:32.059 --> 00:24:35.205
I mean, history, philosophy.

00:24:35.205 --> 00:24:37.917
Philosophy is the study of how to think.

00:24:37.917 --> 00:24:40.044
I mean, what's better
than learning how to think

00:24:40.044 --> 00:24:41.611
because you have to realize when

00:24:41.611 --> 00:24:45.044
these early people occupied the Earth,

00:24:45.044 --> 00:24:48.143
they didn't, no one was
there to teach them anything,

00:24:48.143 --> 00:24:50.776
so they had to decide for themselves

00:24:50.776 --> 00:24:53.794
and using the thought process
of, well, there's earth,

00:24:53.794 --> 00:24:56.424
there's fire, there's water, there's air.

00:24:56.424 --> 00:24:58.222
Maybe these are the basic elements.

00:24:58.222 --> 00:25:01.887
They just were using their
ability to think to uncover,

00:25:01.887 --> 00:25:04.609
so that's a wonderful
field, but in terms of film,

00:25:04.609 --> 00:25:06.235
what's interesting to me about film

00:25:06.235 --> 00:25:08.652
is that in the last 15 years,

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:12.298
film which used to be a photochemical,

00:25:12.298 --> 00:25:14.578
in other words, we used
to have photographic film

00:25:14.578 --> 00:25:17.021
that you'd put in a mechanical device

00:25:17.021 --> 00:25:18.917
and would take a series of stills

00:25:18.917 --> 00:25:22.795
and then you had to send it
to the lab and develop it.

00:25:22.795 --> 00:25:27.371
In the last 15 years, all of
the elements of filmmaking

00:25:27.371 --> 00:25:29.698
have changed from photo, mechanical

00:25:29.698 --> 00:25:32.132
and mechanical to digital, electronic.

00:25:32.132 --> 00:25:35.503
So the editing machine
really is a computer now

00:25:35.503 --> 00:25:39.283
in which you compress the
images and put it in a computer

00:25:39.283 --> 00:25:42.145
and then you can cut them
together as you wish.

00:25:42.145 --> 00:25:45.812
The camera has become
so high in its quality

00:25:46.919 --> 00:25:50.910
that a digital camera is
sufficient to take the picture,

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:54.498
which only 35 millimeter
film used to be able to take

00:25:54.498 --> 00:25:57.096
and the projector in
the theaters you go to

00:25:57.096 --> 00:25:58.294
when you go to the movie theaters,

00:25:58.294 --> 00:26:00.927
they're not loading up cans of film.

00:26:00.927 --> 00:26:03.652
They're also digital and there's possible

00:26:03.652 --> 00:26:05.120
to connect to them through satellite.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:09.633
So in the last 15 years,
everything about filmmaking

00:26:09.633 --> 00:26:14.118
or cinema has changed totally
to a different technology

00:26:14.118 --> 00:26:18.114
and my feeling is that
how could that happen

00:26:18.114 --> 00:26:19.913
without to some degree it changed

00:26:19.913 --> 00:26:22.564
the essence of what a movie is?

00:26:22.564 --> 00:26:25.639
Because now it's being
made so totally differently

00:26:25.639 --> 00:26:27.473
that perhaps there are new horizons

00:26:27.473 --> 00:26:30.492
that wouldn't have been
possible in the old days

00:26:30.492 --> 00:26:33.138
when it was really a piece
of photographic film.

00:26:33.138 --> 00:26:37.211
New things that we can do
that we couldn't do before

00:26:37.211 --> 00:26:39.196
and that's sort of personally what I'm,

00:26:39.196 --> 00:26:42.262
I'm experimenting with
something I call live cinema.

00:26:42.262 --> 00:26:43.288
What is live cinema?

00:26:43.288 --> 00:26:46.871
Live cinema means it's,
in my case, a story

00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:52.441
told like a movie, looks like a movie,

00:26:53.999 --> 00:26:57.419
except the actors are actually
doing it live in that moment.

00:26:57.419 --> 00:26:59.502
Now we all know that
they do live television,

00:26:59.502 --> 00:27:01.140
like some of you probably saw

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.807
Peter Pan or The Sound of Music,

00:27:04.867 --> 00:27:07.089
but whenever you see a
live show on television

00:27:07.089 --> 00:27:10.530
or a soap opera or something,
it looks like television.

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:12.433
It doesn't behave like a movie.

00:27:12.433 --> 00:27:14.703
Yet, when we see a movie on television,

00:27:14.703 --> 00:27:15.777
we know it's a movie.

00:27:15.777 --> 00:27:18.180
Even though it's coming on the same way,

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:19.170
it looks like a movie.

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:21.237
The way the story is told is different.

00:27:21.237 --> 00:27:25.552
The shots are telling the
action in a different way,

00:27:25.552 --> 00:27:27.572
so what I'm interested in is

00:27:27.572 --> 00:27:31.158
learning how it to be cinema still,

00:27:31.158 --> 00:27:33.186
that it looks and behaves like a movie.

00:27:33.186 --> 00:27:37.296
You wouldn't know that
it's even not a movie,

00:27:37.296 --> 00:27:40.073
except the actors are doing
it live in that moment.

00:27:40.073 --> 00:27:43.283
Then to do that, I did
two workshops recently,

00:27:43.283 --> 00:27:46.788
one at UCLA and one in
Oklahoma Community College

00:27:46.788 --> 00:27:50.288
where the school invited me
to work with their students

00:27:50.288 --> 00:27:54.736
and let me do my idea there,
as an experimental workshop,

00:27:54.736 --> 00:27:58.903
what we call a proof of concept,
to see if you could do it.

00:27:59.851 --> 00:28:02.167
I learned so much that
I wrote a little book

00:28:02.167 --> 00:28:03.570
that I'm just finishing called

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:05.734
Live Cinema and Its Techniques

00:28:05.734 --> 00:28:09.539
and it's my hope personally
that I would get the opportunity

00:28:09.539 --> 00:28:12.731
before I do the final,
oh, I got to do this,

00:28:12.731 --> 00:28:15.231
I got to do that, to get to do

00:28:16.255 --> 00:28:19.838
some live cinema as
something I've written.

00:28:21.222 --> 00:28:23.479
I wanna remind you all that I used to be

00:28:23.479 --> 00:28:27.001
a drama counselor in a camp when I was 17,

00:28:27.001 --> 00:28:29.889
so I used to just, all summer,

00:28:29.889 --> 00:28:32.212
first week I'd do plays
with the six-year-olds,

00:28:32.212 --> 00:28:34.846
then I'd do plays with the
seven and eight-year-olds,

00:28:34.846 --> 00:28:36.597
then the nine and 10-year-olds,

00:28:36.597 --> 00:28:38.857
and then finally at the end of the summer,

00:28:38.857 --> 00:28:42.950
we'd bring the boys at
15 and the girls at 15

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:45.689
from the nearby girls
camp and do a musical.

00:28:45.689 --> 00:28:47.178
Boy, was that an experience.

00:28:47.178 --> 00:28:49.468
(audience laughs)

00:28:49.468 --> 00:28:51.507
- Hi, Mr. Coppola, my name is Jia.

00:28:51.507 --> 00:28:54.049
I work on the sustainability
team here at Khan Academy.

00:28:54.049 --> 00:28:55.536
It's such an honor to have you here.

00:28:55.536 --> 00:28:57.119
I'm a huge fan of your films.

00:28:57.119 --> 00:29:00.420
I also love the films of
your daughter, Sofia Coppola.

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.384
I wanted to ask what kind
of advice did you give her

00:29:03.384 --> 00:29:05.557
when she was starting out her film career

00:29:05.557 --> 00:29:07.870
and also how did you balance your role

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:10.603
both as her father and as co-producer

00:29:10.603 --> 00:29:12.330
of some of her own films?

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:13.163
Thank you.

00:29:13.163 --> 00:29:17.603
- Well, Sofia was always a
very precocious little kid.

00:29:17.603 --> 00:29:21.270
She was, even at age
six and seven, she was.

00:29:22.266 --> 00:29:23.718
I remember I once took her when she was,

00:29:23.718 --> 00:29:26.864
I mean, five or four, we all had to make,

00:29:26.864 --> 00:29:29.281
on Godfather II, we had to
go to Dominican Republic

00:29:29.281 --> 00:29:33.225
and we flew in this plane
and we got off in Miami

00:29:33.225 --> 00:29:36.638
and it was really hot and humid

00:29:36.638 --> 00:29:39.998
and I said to her, "Sofia,
how do you like Miami?"

00:29:39.998 --> 00:29:42.241
She said, "It's not my
ami, it's your ami."

00:29:42.241 --> 00:29:43.988
(audience laughs)

00:29:43.988 --> 00:29:47.405
So I knew I was in for a ride with Sofia,

00:29:48.413 --> 00:29:50.090
but it's interesting, she came to me

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:53.056
when she was around 21, 22

00:29:53.056 --> 00:29:56.121
and she said, "Dad, I'm
interested in fashion

00:29:56.121 --> 00:29:59.030
"and I'm interested in
fashion photography."

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:01.909
And she'd done some modeling
and designing clothes.

00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:03.726
"And I'm interested in writing stories,

00:30:03.726 --> 00:30:07.072
"but I really want to
be a painter and paint.

00:30:07.072 --> 00:30:09.271
"Am I just a dilettante?"

00:30:09.271 --> 00:30:12.485
I said to her, "You know,
parents always make the mistake

00:30:12.485 --> 00:30:15.177
"of wanting their kids
to focus in on something.

00:30:15.177 --> 00:30:16.823
"I'm telling you the opposite.

00:30:16.823 --> 00:30:17.891
"Don't focus.

00:30:17.891 --> 00:30:21.035
"Do everything you love
because if you learn

00:30:21.035 --> 00:30:23.768
"about everything you love, one day,

00:30:23.768 --> 00:30:25.583
"what you're meant to do in your life

00:30:25.583 --> 00:30:27.988
"will just come together for you

00:30:27.988 --> 00:30:29.569
"and it will be something that

00:30:29.569 --> 00:30:31.383
"makes use of all the different things.

00:30:31.383 --> 00:30:33.316
"Someday you'll find what you wanna do

00:30:33.316 --> 00:30:34.601
"and it will involve stories

00:30:34.601 --> 00:30:37.175
"and it will involve fashion
and all those things."

00:30:37.175 --> 00:30:39.007
And it turned out that a few years later,

00:30:39.007 --> 00:30:42.507
she made her short film at her high school

00:30:43.485 --> 00:30:46.326
and I could see that
she had a lot of talent.

00:30:46.326 --> 00:30:49.523
So I do think that parents often because,

00:30:49.523 --> 00:30:54.419
you know, we in the past, there
was a terrible depression,

00:30:54.419 --> 00:30:56.926
way before, in the '30s,

00:30:56.926 --> 00:30:59.613
but people were
traumatized that their kids

00:30:59.613 --> 00:31:03.176
needed to study something
they could make a living with

00:31:03.176 --> 00:31:07.718
and the best way to do
that is just don't special,

00:31:07.718 --> 00:31:10.355
I think that people may disagree,

00:31:10.355 --> 00:31:12.011
but don't specialize too young

00:31:12.011 --> 00:31:14.199
because being interested in one thing

00:31:14.199 --> 00:31:15.800
might stop you from thinking

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.004
you could be interested in another thing.

00:31:17.004 --> 00:31:19.186
Be interested in everything you can be.

00:31:19.186 --> 00:31:21.297
Everything you love,
you should learn about

00:31:21.297 --> 00:31:23.738
because then one day, it
will all come together

00:31:23.738 --> 00:31:25.272
and be useful for whatever it is

00:31:25.272 --> 00:31:28.979
you choose you wanna do with your life.

00:31:28.979 --> 00:31:31.396
That was the case with Sofia.

00:31:34.845 --> 00:31:38.693
- Hello, I'm Sam from
KLS and I was wondering

00:31:38.693 --> 00:31:41.367
if you could travel back
in time to middle school,

00:31:41.367 --> 00:31:43.599
would you do anything differently?

00:31:43.599 --> 00:31:46.365
- What's middle school,
what grade is middle school?

00:31:46.365 --> 00:31:47.454
- [Sam] Sixth through eighth.

00:31:47.454 --> 00:31:49.734
- Well, sixth grade I was paralyzed

00:31:49.734 --> 00:31:53.028
in bed watching television.
(audience laughs)

00:31:53.028 --> 00:31:54.646
Watching television day and night

00:31:54.646 --> 00:31:57.536
and that was before the remote
control, so I was stuck.

00:31:57.536 --> 00:31:58.933
I couldn't walk to change it.

00:31:58.933 --> 00:32:00.038
(audience laughs)

00:32:00.038 --> 00:32:03.524
I was a prisoner of mid '50s television,

00:32:03.524 --> 00:32:06.342
but you know,
(audience laughs)

00:32:06.342 --> 00:32:10.509
my school, I went to 22 schools
before I went to college,

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:14.695
so I was always, I felt like an outsider.

00:32:14.695 --> 00:32:16.695
I had no friends at all.

00:32:17.808 --> 00:32:19.685
You don't have time to make friends

00:32:19.685 --> 00:32:22.875
when you're there for six
months and I always did badly,

00:32:22.875 --> 00:32:25.116
so I was always in trouble with my father.

00:32:25.116 --> 00:32:27.813
I wish that I had the sense to say,

00:32:27.813 --> 00:32:31.723
when he was coming at me,
seeing my report card,

00:32:31.723 --> 00:32:34.609
with his belt folded in his
hand, I wish I had said,

00:32:34.609 --> 00:32:37.020
"But you take me out of
school every six months,

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:39.951
"so how can I possibly get good marks?"

00:32:39.951 --> 00:32:43.725
So I was a sad lonely
kid through middle school

00:32:43.725 --> 00:32:46.346
and wanted to have friends

00:32:46.346 --> 00:32:47.993
and kept moving to different places

00:32:47.993 --> 00:32:50.135
and when you move as far away

00:32:50.135 --> 00:32:53.180
as from New York to California,
it's really different.

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:56.461
In those days, L.A, Los Angeles

00:32:56.461 --> 00:32:57.662
was so different from New York.

00:32:57.662 --> 00:32:58.738
They didn't have baseball.

00:32:58.738 --> 00:33:01.778
They didn't have comic book stores.

00:33:01.778 --> 00:33:03.892
They didn't have White Castle hamburgers.

00:33:03.892 --> 00:33:05.379
(audience laughs)

00:33:05.379 --> 00:33:09.866
So I was just miserable at
your age, I hate to say,

00:33:09.866 --> 00:33:12.705
but Hemingway, Ernest
Hemingway, the writer,

00:33:12.705 --> 00:33:14.513
the famous American writer, said that

00:33:14.513 --> 00:33:15.469
if you wanna be a writer,

00:33:15.469 --> 00:33:17.170
you should have an unhappy childhood.

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:20.869
So I had an unhappy childhood.
(audience laughs)

00:33:20.869 --> 00:33:23.733
- Hi, I'm Angelie from Khan Lab School

00:33:23.733 --> 00:33:25.741
and I was just wondering
what were some struggles

00:33:25.741 --> 00:33:29.074
that you had directing your first movie?

00:33:32.091 --> 00:33:36.099
- Well, my real first movie
was a little horror film

00:33:36.099 --> 00:33:39.432
that I made in Ireland when I was about,

00:33:40.279 --> 00:33:43.862
I mean, a feature film,
when I was about 21

00:33:44.912 --> 00:33:48.245
and you know, I guess what struck me was

00:33:49.661 --> 00:33:51.091
I always have been a person with

00:33:51.091 --> 00:33:53.868
a lot of good ideas or good imagination

00:33:53.868 --> 00:33:56.093
and I would always see all these things,

00:33:56.093 --> 00:33:57.402
but when you make a film,

00:33:57.402 --> 00:33:59.439
you have to take what's in your mind

00:33:59.439 --> 00:34:01.281
and what is your imagination

00:34:01.281 --> 00:34:04.896
and you have to find
practical ways to do it

00:34:04.896 --> 00:34:07.196
and it's not always as easy as you think,

00:34:07.196 --> 00:34:11.726
that it's kind of what they
say in car terminology,

00:34:11.726 --> 00:34:13.492
when the rubber meets the road.

00:34:13.492 --> 00:34:16.624
In other words, the world
of imagination and fantasy

00:34:16.624 --> 00:34:19.380
is wonderful because you have no limits.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:22.637
It's just as, you can just
cook something up in your mind,

00:34:22.637 --> 00:34:25.640
but then to translate that into a form

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.849
that other people can see and enjoy

00:34:27.849 --> 00:34:29.808
involves a lot of practical stuff,

00:34:29.808 --> 00:34:33.975
of scheduling and budget and
the shot you had in mind,

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:37.320
you can't really fit it in.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.750
It's not like you thought.

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:42.689
So you have to learn as part
of the creative process,

00:34:42.689 --> 00:34:46.285
to learn to be inventive and flexible,

00:34:46.285 --> 00:34:48.444
to try to, there's two roads.

00:34:48.444 --> 00:34:51.789
There's what you imagined
and to what you can do

00:34:51.789 --> 00:34:53.801
and you have to be the one between those

00:34:53.801 --> 00:34:58.708
and use whatever cleverness
you can to get there.

00:34:58.708 --> 00:35:01.165
So when I made my first
film, I realized that

00:35:01.165 --> 00:35:04.251
the practical side was
really very important

00:35:04.251 --> 00:35:08.761
or you wouldn't get the
great ideas in the film.

00:35:08.761 --> 00:35:11.269
- So just to close out
and I think all of us

00:35:11.269 --> 00:35:12.370
would love to sit here all day

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:15.413
and continue to, or all the whole week,

00:35:15.413 --> 00:35:19.246
(audience chuckles)
but just to finish off,

00:35:19.246 --> 00:35:20.917
there's some parallels
between what we're doing

00:35:20.917 --> 00:35:22.555
and things that you're interested in

00:35:22.555 --> 00:35:24.154
and that you have experience in,

00:35:24.154 --> 00:35:26.884
especially as, you know,
you just talked about film,

00:35:26.884 --> 00:35:29.127
going into a new era with the technology.

00:35:29.127 --> 00:35:30.683
Obviously, we're trying to do things

00:35:30.683 --> 00:35:32.096
along those lines in education,

00:35:32.096 --> 00:35:33.324
trying to reach a lot of folks.

00:35:33.324 --> 00:35:36.340
What advice in any form would
you have to everyone here,

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:38.558
both the students and the
members of Khan Academy

00:35:38.558 --> 00:35:40.604
as we go off on our journey?

00:35:40.604 --> 00:35:43.587
- Well, all human beings
and all animals really

00:35:43.587 --> 00:35:46.554
seem to be good at play, we like to play.

00:35:46.554 --> 00:35:49.039
It's a natural thing we do

00:35:49.039 --> 00:35:53.420
and we have to realize
that work that we do

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:56.159
later in life is really
a development of that.

00:35:56.159 --> 00:36:00.326
So I try to keep the work I
do as much like play as I can.

00:36:02.265 --> 00:36:03.770
I can make a quick demonstration,

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:05.368
if you want a quick--
- Absolutely.

00:36:05.368 --> 00:36:07.451
- Could I have, where can I get

00:36:07.451 --> 00:36:10.428
about this group of kids in a circle?

00:36:10.428 --> 00:36:11.505
Where is there room to do that?

00:36:11.505 --> 00:36:13.744
- All right, y'all wanna
get in a circle here?

00:36:13.744 --> 00:36:15.675
- Go over there where we can see you.

00:36:15.675 --> 00:36:16.754
- Okay.
(audience chuckles)

00:36:16.754 --> 00:36:19.065
- This is an acting exercise.
- All right, good.

00:36:19.065 --> 00:36:20.177
(audience chattering)
- So in the center,

00:36:20.177 --> 00:36:21.187
no, no, not that many.

00:36:21.187 --> 00:36:23.077
Just the ones over there.
(audience laughs)

00:36:23.077 --> 00:36:24.417
- Okay, how many you want?

00:36:24.417 --> 00:36:25.992
- Well, everyone sitting down here.

00:36:25.992 --> 00:36:27.310
Go make a circle over there.

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:29.783
I would do it with everyone,
but I don't see a space.

00:36:29.783 --> 00:36:32.346
Now make a circle, all hold
your hands in a circle.

00:36:32.346 --> 00:36:34.051
(audience chuckles)

00:36:34.051 --> 00:36:35.585
Okay, good.

00:36:35.585 --> 00:36:38.109
Now make the circle as wide as you can.

00:36:38.109 --> 00:36:40.026
Come out to me right now.

00:36:40.026 --> 00:36:40.955
Is that about it?

00:36:40.955 --> 00:36:42.180
Little more.

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:43.013
Okay.

00:36:43.013 --> 00:36:44.382
Now this is an acting exercise.

00:36:44.382 --> 00:36:47.299
Actors have to be very concentrated

00:36:48.578 --> 00:36:51.292
because they have to appear,

00:36:51.292 --> 00:36:52.809
when someone says something to them,

00:36:52.809 --> 00:36:54.235
they have to make it seem as though

00:36:54.235 --> 00:36:56.336
they're seeing it for the first time,

00:36:56.336 --> 00:36:58.358
like if you say something in a play,

00:36:58.358 --> 00:37:00.272
it's in the script, so you
know you're gonna say it,

00:37:00.272 --> 00:37:03.246
but how do you do, so we play a game.

00:37:03.246 --> 00:37:04.237
When I work with actors,

00:37:04.237 --> 00:37:06.013
I try to make it as much fun as I can.

00:37:06.013 --> 00:37:08.181
This game is called Sound Ball

00:37:08.181 --> 00:37:10.091
and the way it's played,
if I go like this,

00:37:10.091 --> 00:37:10.924
- [Interviewer] All right.

00:37:10.924 --> 00:37:12.850
- I have an imaginary ball, right?

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:14.120
Boom boom boom.

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.651
I'm gonna throw it to you.

00:37:16.651 --> 00:37:17.737
You catch it.

00:37:17.737 --> 00:37:20.211
Now, here's the, now throw it back to me.

00:37:20.211 --> 00:37:21.044
Okay.

00:37:21.044 --> 00:37:21.877
Now I'm gonna throw it to you,

00:37:21.877 --> 00:37:23.240
but I'm gonna make a
sound when I throw it.

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.073
You ready?

00:37:24.073 --> 00:37:25.177
Bop.

00:37:25.177 --> 00:37:27.471
Now when you catch it,
you catch it with bop.

00:37:27.471 --> 00:37:28.304
- Bop.

00:37:28.304 --> 00:37:29.137
- [Francis] And then you throw it to me,

00:37:29.137 --> 00:37:32.124
you give it your own sound you want to.

00:37:32.124 --> 00:37:32.957
- [Girl In Orange] Boop.

00:37:32.957 --> 00:37:34.234
- Boop, okay.
(audience chuckles)

00:37:34.234 --> 00:37:36.451
So when you catch it, you catch it

00:37:36.451 --> 00:37:38.430
with the sound the person threw it to you

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:41.480
and this is to teach actors concentration

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.600
'cause they don't know when a line

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.019
is gonna come to them, all right?

00:37:45.019 --> 00:37:46.186
So here we go.

00:37:47.353 --> 00:37:48.527
Can you do it?

00:37:48.527 --> 00:37:50.196
Throw the ball to him.

00:37:50.196 --> 00:37:51.238
Throw the ball to anyone you want.

00:37:51.238 --> 00:37:52.321
Make a sound.

00:37:53.228 --> 00:37:54.061
- Zap.

00:37:55.062 --> 00:37:56.800
- [Francis] Catch it with the sound.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:57.633
- Zap.

00:37:57.633 --> 00:38:00.334
- [Francis] And throw
it with another sound.

00:38:00.334 --> 00:38:02.063
- Um, zoom.

00:38:02.063 --> 00:38:03.262
- [Girl In Orange] Zoom.

00:38:03.262 --> 00:38:04.323
Woosh.

00:38:04.323 --> 00:38:05.507
- Woosh.

00:38:05.507 --> 00:38:06.639
Zing.

00:38:06.639 --> 00:38:08.238
- Zing.
- Make it louder.

00:38:08.238 --> 00:38:09.721
- [Boy In White] Plop.

00:38:09.721 --> 00:38:10.554
- Plop.

00:38:12.336 --> 00:38:13.169
Sound.

00:38:13.169 --> 00:38:15.512
(everyone laughs)

00:38:15.512 --> 00:38:17.747
- [Francis] You gotta
do it a little faster.

00:38:17.747 --> 00:38:19.236
Go ahead.

00:38:19.236 --> 00:38:20.534
- Preedooldoo.

00:38:20.534 --> 00:38:22.055
- Preedooldoo.

00:38:22.055 --> 00:38:23.153
Dang.

00:38:23.153 --> 00:38:24.986
- [Boy In White] Dang.

00:38:24.986 --> 00:38:26.383
Um.

00:38:26.383 --> 00:38:27.576
- Um.

00:38:27.576 --> 00:38:28.999
Zing.
- Can you do it faster?

00:38:28.999 --> 00:38:30.216
- Zing.

00:38:30.216 --> 00:38:31.175
(blows raspberry)

00:38:31.175 --> 00:38:32.757
(audience chuckles)

00:38:32.757 --> 00:38:33.860
- [Girl In Orange] Zip.

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:34.693
- Zip.

00:38:35.861 --> 00:38:36.900
Boom.

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:38.352
- Boom.

00:38:38.352 --> 00:38:39.518
Ding.

00:38:39.518 --> 00:38:40.523
- Ding.

00:38:40.523 --> 00:38:42.198
(squelches)

00:38:42.198 --> 00:38:43.254
- Now don't make it hard.

00:38:43.254 --> 00:38:45.230
Make the sounds clear so they can do it.

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:47.241
Now what we're gonna do is
we're gonna do the same thing.

00:38:47.241 --> 00:38:48.074
We'll go a little faster

00:38:48.074 --> 00:38:49.947
and I'm gonna throw a second ball in.

00:38:49.947 --> 00:38:51.871
(audience groans and laughs)
Really hard, ready?

00:38:51.871 --> 00:38:53.700
I'll start it, ready?

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:54.533
Bop.
- Bop.

00:38:55.473 --> 00:38:56.831
Bing.
- Bing.

00:38:56.831 --> 00:38:57.748
Zip.
- Boop.

00:38:58.629 --> 00:38:59.712
- [Boy In White] Boop, boop.

00:38:59.712 --> 00:39:01.253
Ball noise.
- Ball noise.

00:39:01.253 --> 00:39:03.674
- Something.
- Something.

00:39:03.674 --> 00:39:04.507
- Boom.

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:06.605
(laughs)

00:39:06.605 --> 00:39:08.970
- [Francis] We'll do it once
more, but you get the idea.

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:11.298
You have to be aware if you're an actor.

00:39:11.298 --> 00:39:13.916
You have to be aware and
not look like you're aware,

00:39:13.916 --> 00:39:15.436
but if someone's gonna throw you the ball,

00:39:15.436 --> 00:39:16.877
you wanna be there to catch it.

00:39:16.877 --> 00:39:18.223
You ready, I'm gonna do it again.

00:39:18.223 --> 00:39:19.065
- Bop.

00:39:19.065 --> 00:39:20.397
- Bop, zing.

00:39:20.397 --> 00:39:21.937
- [Boy In White] Zing.

00:39:21.937 --> 00:39:22.770
Zoop.

00:39:24.221 --> 00:39:25.638
- [Francis] Zoop.

00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:28.397
- Ding.
- Ding.

00:39:28.397 --> 00:39:29.871
Bop.
- Bop.

00:39:29.871 --> 00:39:30.704
Zip.
- Zip.

00:39:31.868 --> 00:39:34.088
Bing.
- Bing, boop.

00:39:34.088 --> 00:39:35.320
- [Boy In White] Boop, zop.

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.261
- [Francis] Wop.

00:39:36.261 --> 00:39:37.204
- [Boy With Blonde Bangs] Zop, wop.

00:39:37.204 --> 00:39:38.673
(audience laughs)

00:39:38.673 --> 00:39:39.611
- You get the idea.

00:39:39.611 --> 00:39:41.999
(audience applauds)

00:39:41.999 --> 00:39:43.666
Thank you very much.

00:39:44.808 --> 00:39:46.928
But there are 1,000,000 acting games

00:39:46.928 --> 00:39:49.571
they call theater games that we could play

00:39:49.571 --> 00:39:52.985
and whenever possible, if you can work

00:39:52.985 --> 00:39:55.094
and develop something
that you wanna develop,

00:39:55.094 --> 00:39:56.957
like in this case, concentration,

00:39:56.957 --> 00:39:58.921
it's better to do it
through the form of play

00:39:58.921 --> 00:40:00.473
because then the day becomes fun.

00:40:00.473 --> 00:40:02.973
So I try to make all the work,

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:05.210
especially creative work

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:08.094
'cause that's so much fun as you know,

00:40:08.094 --> 00:40:10.421
as much play as possible.

00:40:10.421 --> 00:40:12.150
- Awesome, well, thank
you, thank you so much.

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:13.436
I think this is gonna be a huge treat.

00:40:13.436 --> 00:40:15.147
This was a treat for us and
I think everyone watching

00:40:15.147 --> 00:40:17.656
on Facebook and online, so thank you.

00:40:17.656 --> 00:40:18.489
- Thank you.

00:40:18.489 --> 00:40:19.446
Thank you, thank you.
(audience applauds and cheers)
