00:00:00.403 --> 00:00:01.880
- [Voiceover] You're at a
florist store and you're

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.016
interested in buying some
type of a potted flower.

00:00:05.016 --> 00:00:08.561
And you ask the florist, "What
type of flowers do you sell?"

00:00:08.561 --> 00:00:12.118
And he says, "Well we sell
four types of flowers, we sell

00:00:12.118 --> 00:00:15.500
"roses, tulips, sunflowers, and lilies."

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.759
And you say, "What type of
pots could I put them in?"

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.159
And he says, "Well you could
pick any flower, and then you

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:22.359
"could pick any of our three
pots, we have brown pots,

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.359
"we have yellow pots,
and we have green pots."

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:29.972
So, the question that I ask to you is,

00:00:29.972 --> 00:00:34.619
how many types of, I guess,
flower and pots put together can

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:38.019
you walk out of this florist store with?

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:40.479
For example, you could get
a rose and a brown pot,

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:42.699
you could get a rose and a green pot.

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:45.199
Or you could get a yellow pot
that has a sunflower in it.

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.359
Or a yellow pot that has a lily in it.

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.379
So, how many scenarios could you walk out

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.219
of that store with?

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.719
And like always, I'll encourage
you to pause the video

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.741
and try to figure it out on your own.

00:00:57.741 --> 00:00:59.151
Let's think through it.

00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:03.399
I'll just write the first
letters, just to visualize

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.180
or just so I don't have
to write down everything.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.180
So, you could have a brown pot,
you could have a yellow pot,

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.939
or you could have a green pot.

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:15.709
You difinitely have to pick a
pot, so you're going to have

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:16.899
one of those.

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:19.828
And then for each of these
three, there's four possible

00:01:19.828 --> 00:01:21.223
flowers you could have.

00:01:21.223 --> 00:01:24.159
You could have a rose with the brown pot,

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.539
you could have a rose with the yellow pot,

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.767
you could have a rose with the green pot.

00:01:27.767 --> 00:01:31.599
You could have a tulip with the brown pot,

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:34.779
a tulip with the yellow pot,
a tulip with the green pot.

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:39.779
You could have a sunflower
with each of the three pots,

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:44.659
or you could have a
lily with the brown pot,

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.929
a lily with the yellow pot,
and a lily with a green pot.

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.839
So, how many scenarios
are we talking about?

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:56.839
Well, we had three pots, so
we have three pots right over

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:00.419
here, and we have four possible
flowers to put in the pots,

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:04.434
and so we see that we have
four possible flowers for each

00:02:04.434 --> 00:02:05.168
of the three pots.

00:02:05.168 --> 00:02:10.108
It's going to be three times
four possibilites, or 12.

00:02:10.108 --> 00:02:11.749
You see them right over here.

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:15.739
This is brown with rose, brown with tulip,

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.739
brown with sunflower, brown with lily.

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.411
Yellow with rose, yellow with
tulip, yellow with sunflower,

00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:20.895
yellow with lily.

00:02:20.895 --> 00:02:23.239
So, if we count these, one,
two, three, four, five, six,

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.939
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.699
Twelve possible pot, flower scenarios

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:33.699
to walk out of that florist store with.
