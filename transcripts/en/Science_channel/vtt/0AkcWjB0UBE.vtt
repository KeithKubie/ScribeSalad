Narrator: WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY,

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:07.373
YOU NEVER
QUITE HAVE THE RIGHT COINS

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:09.375
FOR THE SNACK YOU WANT.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:13.079
HOW DOES THE MACHINE KNOW
TO SEND BACK ANYTHING FAKE

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:15.548
AND KEEP TRACK
OF HOW MUCH YOU'VE PAID?

00:00:17.816 --> 00:00:21.821
THE MACHINE DECIPHERS
COINS WITH PINPOINT ACCURACY.

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:26.592
LIGHT SENSORS MEASURE THE SIZE,

00:00:26.592 --> 00:00:29.895
AND ELECTROMAGNETS
DETECT THE METAL TYPE,

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:32.932
IDENTIFYING THE COINS
IN SPLIT SECONDS

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:35.902
AND SORTING THEM INTO COLUMNS,

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:40.740
DIVERTING FAKES
TO THE REJECT CHUTE.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.809
WHEN CHANGE IS DUE,

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.013
THE COLUMNS CAREFULLY
RELEASE ONE COIN AT A TIME...

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:52.786
...TUMBLING INTO THE CHUTE.

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:55.855
THESE 85 PARTS WORK TOGETHER

00:00:55.855 --> 00:01:00.359
TO COUNT 15,000 COINS A YEAR

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.930
AND RELEASE YOUR SNACK
AT THE TOUCH OF A BUTTON.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.432
BUT WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY,

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:09.702
THERE'S NOTHING MORE FRUSTRATING
THAN YOUR SNACK GETTING STUCK.

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:12.872
HOW DO TODAY'S GENERATION
OF VENDING MACHINES

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:16.843
MAKE SURE
YOU GET YOUR TREAT EVERY TIME?

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:20.213
HIDDEN BEHIND THE KEYS,

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:24.250
A COMPUTER ORDERS
1 OF 32 MATCHBOX-SIZED MOTORS...

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:30.256
...TO TURN THE SPIRAL
360 DEGREES.

00:01:34.593 --> 00:01:37.196
AS THE SNACK FALLS,

00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:42.034
IT BREAKS A LINE
OF 10 INFRARED BEAMS.

00:01:42.034 --> 00:01:44.303
IF NOTHING CROSSES THE BEAMS,

00:01:44.303 --> 00:01:48.441
THE COMPUTER
MAKES THE COILS TURN AGAIN.

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:53.646
WITH THIS INGENIOUS TECHNOLOGY,
YOU'LL ALWAYS GET YOUR SNACK

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:55.615
AND NEVER LEAVE HUNGRY.
