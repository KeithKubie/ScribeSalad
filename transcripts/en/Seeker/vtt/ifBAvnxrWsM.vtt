00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.640
It’s been six-and-a-half years since Fukushima
Dai-ichi was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.810
And now, nuclear plant radiation has showed
up somewhere scientists didn’t expect -- the

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.810
beach.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.700
A nuclear plant like Fukushima has nuclear
fuel rods inside of a water bath.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.699
The bath helps regulate their temperature,
because nuclear rods heat up due to radioactive

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:19.699
decay.

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.259
They’re hot all the time, even when they're not part of fission.

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.609
When Fukushima’s plant was hit by a tsunami,
the systems that kept the water baths cool

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.529
stopped working, the rods overheated, and
had a melt-down, literally.

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.980
To try and stop it, they ran seawater (the
nearest cold thing) over the melting fuel

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.980
rods…

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.090
This made the water radioactive, as cesium-137
(a byproduct of the radioactive uranium) is

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.820
water soluble, but did help cool the rods.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.700
Then they had to clean up the radioactivity.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.220
Though radiation is invisible to us, it’s
just really tiny particles that get caught

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.860
on dust, then on your clothes.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.600
80 percent of the decontamination, specifically of people,
after Fukushima can be simply: removing any clothing being worn

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.910
They also had to get the dust out of the environment.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.920
In the case of Fukushima, 4 centimeters (1.6”)
of topsoil was bagged up and hauled away.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.070
That said, you have to know the radiation
is there before you can clean it off.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.620
A new study of the beaches around Fukushima
found more radioactive Cesium-137 than expected.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.210
Turns out they overlooked the beaches around
the plant.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.060
Radioactive particles are often called “sticky.”

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.760
they stick to surfaces, plants, clothes, soil.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.340
And in this case, after the company ran seawater
through the plant, and the tsunami receded, that seawater spread radiation

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.700
throughout the seafloor (and elsewhere), but
scientists thought it would stay in the water

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.200
around the plant, in Fukushima harbor.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.310
They were wrong.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.930
Instead, it got into the sand, and re-leached
into the sea and groundwater stretching for

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:47.930
miles.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.420
In a new paper, the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution and Kanazawa University hypothesize

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.390
the Cs-137 stuck to the sand, and is now slowly
being washed away, spreading low levels of

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.200
radiation around the region.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.500
Turns out, sand is like a big sponge, and
the sticky particles get trapped inside.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.550
Now that they know it’s there, they can
start the cleanup.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.520
Normally, radiation showers are literally
just washing the radioactive dust off your

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.360
body.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.569
Rain washes it out of the street and soil.

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.550
Over time, it ends up dispersed so much, that
even if there are a few particles here and

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.820
there, it’s no longer dangerous.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.340
It sucks, and you don’t want to think about
it, but it won’t hurt you -- like birds

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.420
pooping in a water reservoir.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.020
After a meltdown, people use the same tools
as anywhere else to clean low-radiation areas.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.420
Brooms, mops, brushes, shovels.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.280
They wipe down surfaces… wash their hair…
it’s funnily similar to other clean-up jobs,

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.780
except one pesky difference… any tools used
are now considered radioactive and have to

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.790
be stored safely after the cleanup.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.739
In this new paper they showed seawater makes
the particles less sticky over time.

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:01.190
So, eventually, the beach will return to normal
but for now they’re sort of stuck with it.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.430
And it’s good that they know that it’s
there.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.220
It’s important to note, this is not enough
radiation for the Japanese population to worry

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.220
about.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.220
They’re very clear on that.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.000
(And it’s definitely not an issue if you’re
in the US or elsewhere -- we have a video

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
about it).

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.190
Instead, this new research is highlighting
the beach problem so future nuclear plant

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.850
designers can realize just how far-reaching
any possible pollution can be.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.110
The moment people say “radiation” a lot
of people flip out.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.680
But unless you’re living near the Fukushima
plant: you’ll be fine.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.960
Worry about radiation from the sun, that’s
more pressing.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.780

We’ve also got a video here about Chernobyl.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.120
That plant is still a disaster, so they’re
building a giant shield over it.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.409
FYI As Fukushima cleanup continues, people
have actually repopulated the city near the

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:07.550
plant.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.299
They’re wary, but not wrecked.
