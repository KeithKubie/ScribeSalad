00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.440
Our first step in the proof is to
understand the difference between

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.980
the maximum matching that
the algorithm finds eventually and

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.920
the intermediate matchings that
the algorithm produces along the way.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.440
Although actually,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.830
we'll state the key claim in terms of
two arbitrary matchings, M and M prime.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.180
And actually, I want you to help me out.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.470
Think about the graph containing edges
that are in M but not in M prime or

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.250
vice versa and tell me which of
the following statements are true.
