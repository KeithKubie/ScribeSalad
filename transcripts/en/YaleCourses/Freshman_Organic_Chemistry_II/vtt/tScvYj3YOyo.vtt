1
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.420
Well from the happy Hubba by gather,
you're as eager as I am to get this over.

2
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.850
So the last lecture is,
is a review of what we've done before actually,

3
00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:15.990
but it's focused on synthetic chemistry.
In particular,
the sentence,

4
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.530
the synthesis of Cortisone,
which is a natural product.

5
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.140
Cortisone looks like this.

6
00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:26.250
It's one of these steroids which you remember have three six membered rings than

7
00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:30.150
a five membered ring and various alcohols and ketones and so on.

8
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.760
And in fact,
the,
this,
this lecture originated with a book,

9
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.700
uh,
called advanced organic chemistry,

10
00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:42.550
although I've used it so much that you can't tell it from the spine anymore.
Uh,

11
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.670
that was written in 1961 when I was taking organic chemistry by Louie feezer at

12
00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:49.081
Harvard,

13
00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:53.820
who was the person I had had a f I was having at that time for this course.

14
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.460
Uh,
he was,
uh,
uh,
very good,

15
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.350
a synthetic organic chemist and he worked a lot on steroids.
In fact,

16
00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:04.380
in 1936 he wrote this book,

17
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.870
which is called chemistry of natural products related to finance three.

18
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.260
Finance three is a thing like three benzene rings,
bing,
bing,
bing.

19
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.330
So you see steroids are related to finance three.

20
00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:20.070
And so that's what this book was about.
He also was,

21
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.190
he was a stylish guy,
uh,
before I got there.

22
00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:26.070
It was reported that he walked around with a gold headed cane.

23
00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:29.370
He had dropped that affectation by the time I arrived,

24
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.320
but he still smoked like a chimney,

25
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:34.890
although at that time he was on the surgeon general's committee about smoking

26
00:01:34.891 --> 00:01:37.510
and health and he absolutely quit then and went on.

27
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.540
But he ultimately succumbed to lung cancer.
So a,

28
00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:47.140
this is a way a homage to him.
Uh,
these are some of the,
uh,

29
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.180
steroids,
the ones that are a sex hormones.

30
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.230
So very small amounts of them go around and make various things happen in your

31
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:55.890
body.

32
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.060
And they began up at the top left with cholesterol and you can see how various

33
00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:03.570
enzymes oxidize it.
Put a ketone here and alcohol here,

34
00:02:03.571 --> 00:02:08.400
make an unsaturation and so on to make all these important,
uh,
compounds.

35
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.081
In fact,

36
00:02:10.081 --> 00:02:15.081
they were recognized as so important that work on steroids awarded four Nobel

37
00:02:15.271 --> 00:02:19.440
prizes between 1927 and 1950.
Right?

38
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.500
And another three between 1965 and 1975 which was at least part due to,

39
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.320
to work on steroids,
right?

40
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.960
The awards in 1927 and 28.

41
00:02:30.961 --> 00:02:35.961
We're determining the structure and the one in 1965 recognize the synthesis of

42
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:40.260
it.
You have to know the structure before you can synthesize it.
Obviously.

43
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.131
In fact,

44
00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:46.131
the ones at 19 and 27 and 28 were for determining the wrong structure.

45
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.350
The thing that got the Nobel prize for it was this structure,

46
00:02:49.351 --> 00:02:53.280
which doesn't have three,
six membered rings,
big,
big,
big like that.

47
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.660
But it got settled in the 1930s.
Okay.

48
00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.230
So by 1950,

49
00:02:59.231 --> 00:03:04.030
the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine was awarded to Kendall Rice Stein and

50
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:08.830
show Walter for their discoveries relating to the hormones of the Adrenal
Cortex,

51
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:11.050
their structure and biological effects.

52
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.640
So Kendall and Rice Stein where organic chemist and show Walter was a

53
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:20.050
physiologist,
uh,
and uh,
hunches.

54
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.170
Nobel address said the air of pessimism regarding rheumatic disease in general

55
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:29.440
and rheumatoid arthritis in particular still finds expression in some of the

56
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:30.910
modern writings and text.

57
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.490
But then he goes on to describe how he had a patient at the Mayo Clinic,
uh,
who,

58
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.560
who,
uh,

59
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.190
65 year old patient who an unusual story a few days before he came.

60
00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:46.210
He was painfully affected with rheumatoid arthritis.
It had been for four years,

61
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.560
then jaundice suddenly developed and within a week,
most of his arthritis,

62
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.810
meth manifestations had disappeared.

63
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.760
The jaundice last five weeks and the rheumatic arthritis did not relapse until

64
00:03:57.761 --> 00:04:01.270
several weeks after the jaundice had disappeared.
The thought occurred,

65
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:03.850
instead of being relentlessly progressive,
this disease,

66
00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:08.080
rheumatoid arthritis may be potentially reversible more so than we'd believe,

67
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.090
perhaps rapidly.
So,
so during the next five years,
from 29 to 34,

68
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.000
while the organic chemists,
we're determining the true structure,

69
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.540
observations were made on 16 patients with chronic arthritis or fibrositis in

70
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:24.400
whom jaundice of different types and degrees developed.

71
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.510
If the jaundice was deep enough and was characterized by bill,

72
00:04:27.511 --> 00:04:30.610
a rube anemia of the direct reacting type,

73
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:34.300
the rheumatic symptoms quickly diminished or disappeared for varying lengths of

74
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:37.900
time and then gradually returned.
And furthermore,

75
00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:40.900
it was noted that during pregnancy people lost that.

76
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:44.410
So there was something that was thought to be some hormone that would do this.

77
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.600
Uh,
so,
uh,
they figured that out.
You can read that yourself.

78
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.350
Okay.
Uh,
so they took rice die and then the,
the,
the uh,

79
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.740
Swiss chemist took a thousand kilograms of the adrenal glands from cattle,

80
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.850
uh,

81
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.850
and was able to get at one kilogram of dry residue from that and follow the

82
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:09.190
activity is the partial parceled out in clean,

83
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.170
including using Gerard's ketone reagent t remember we talked about,

84
00:05:14.171 --> 00:05:18.040
that's a thing that makes a hydra zone and that it has a permanent cad,

85
00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:20.500
ionic charge.
So it'll take a ketone into water,

86
00:05:20.501 --> 00:05:22.930
then you can take it off and it'll go back into the organics.

87
00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:27.510
That was a powerful way of separating these ketones.
And um,

88
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.250
so there we go.
So they got seven,
eight grams of a ketone out of that.

89
00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:36.880
So this was this fish up to extract ketones and we've talked about that before.

90
00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:39.910
So I'm just going to click through it very rapidly to show how it was

91
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:44.770
synthesized and how we know what it did.
Okay.

92
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.010
Only when pure crystal and homogeneous substances were produced,

93
00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:50.650
where they tested as far as possible biologically.

94
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.540
So accurate determination that chemical structure was given priority in nearly

95
00:05:55.541 --> 00:06:00.410
all cases that could,
this could be elucidated in all its details.
So now by 19,

96
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.590
by the mid 1930s,
they had what the structures were and here were,
uh,

97
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.690
some of these steroids from the Adrenal Cortex,
29 of them,

98
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.490
of which these five,
uh,
were particularly important as active.

99
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.500
Right now,
those two you notice are on the top cortisol.

100
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.770
It has an Ooh group in that top left here and below it is cortisone,

101
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.560
right?
The ketone.
Okay.
Uh,

102
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.730
so though that position 11 and the position 17,

103
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:33.570
where were particularly important,

104
00:06:33.571 --> 00:06:36.740
then you have to have that ketone at 11 to get a cortisone.

105
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.840
The introduction of an oxygen atom and position a 11 of the steroid skeleton is

106
00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:45.920
one of the major difficulties in this synthetic production of cortisone.
Why?

107
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.150
Because it's so far away from any other functional groups.

108
00:06:49.151 --> 00:06:52.550
It's not alpha to something or on the Beta position where an Alphabait

109
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.780
unsaturation could be used.
Right.
The preparation of this subject,

110
00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.840
the substance from dysoxia cholic acid still remains a long and laborious way,

111
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:04.460
even when so many improvements to it had been discovered.

112
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.240
If it is wished to obtain cortisone more simply,
there remain two ways,

113
00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:13.241
either total synthesis or the discovery of a better qualified raw material

114
00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:16.790
that's close in structure to this that then you can convert into this for

115
00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:18.890
medical purposes.
Both will be tried.

116
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.900
The prospects of a total synthesis are difficult to access to access.

117
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.561
Okay,

118
00:07:24.561 --> 00:07:28.400
so it's going to be tough to do this either total synthesis or got find a better

119
00:07:28.401 --> 00:07:30.680
raw material.
And there's a footnote.

120
00:07:30.681 --> 00:07:34.640
There are be Woodward referred to the partial synthesis of an acid,

121
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:39.290
which is already very closely related to cortisone nine April,

122
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.910
1951 in Boston mass.
And it gives a reference here.
Okay,

123
00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:45.290
so,
uh,
this,

124
00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:50.291
this book that I talked about uses as an example of a total synthesis Woodward's

125
00:07:50.301 --> 00:07:54.680
synthesis in 1951 of cortisone.
And this is it,

126
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.690
but we're going to go through it slowly.

127
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.960
So this is the thing he wanted to make,
right?
It's got these four rings,
a,
B,
c,

128
00:08:02.961 --> 00:08:07.100
and d,
and obviously it's going to take a lot of steps to get there.
And you'll,

129
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.270
uh,
so the first goal is to make rings C and,
d.

130
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.400
Why did I put a question mark on d?

131
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.320
It's a six membered ring,
not a five membered rings.

132
00:08:19.321 --> 00:08:23.300
So he's got something clever in the back of his mind when he thinks of that as

133
00:08:23.301 --> 00:08:24.860
the first thing he wants to make.

134
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.750
And that will be a handle that double bond on the far right.

135
00:08:29.751 --> 00:08:34.130
A handle to allow modification to make the ring a smaller size and put the

136
00:08:34.131 --> 00:08:37.350
functionality that you need on there.
Okay.
And,

137
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.360
and this double bond at the top left of ring c is a thing that's going to allow

138
00:08:42.531 --> 00:08:46.640
us to get access to put the ketone on there.
Okay.

139
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:50.210
And down at the bottom,
this ketone is a handle.

140
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.970
It's at this position down here,
here,

141
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.250
this is going to be handled to build the ring's a and B.

142
00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.690
<v 1>So we'll see how that works.
So this compound was known and ready,</v>

143
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:05.310
readily available and cheap,
so you could get a lot of it to start with.
Okay.

144
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:10.380
So the first reaction he did was to build ring d onto that.

145
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:11.850
How did they do that?

146
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:18.120
What kind of reaction could build ring d make these bonds that are highlighted

147
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:21.210
in blue here?
Anybody got an idea?

148
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.660
Yeah,
it deals all the deals.
All the reaction.
Right?
Okay.

149
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.630
So he did that and do this standard old deals,

150
00:09:30.631 --> 00:09:33.870
all the reaction that you put that ring on.
But notice that's going to,

151
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:38.220
when you put those,
when,
when the dying sits down on top of that double bond,

152
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:42.420
the methyl and the hydrogen are going to be on the same side.
Right?

153
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:46.590
Whereas over here,
they want to be on opposite sides.

154
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.293
Right.

155
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:52.260
So we better get that fixed up so that they won't have the wrong stereo isomer.

156
00:09:52.261 --> 00:09:53.400
When we get to the end.

157
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:58.910
Can you see any way to change it so that this hydrogen is no longer a pointing

158
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.360
down but pointing up?

159
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.263
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

160
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.860
<v 1>What's,
yeah,
Amy.</v>

161
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:07.403
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

162
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:13.050
<v 1>Ah,
Mitsa Nobu in births and alcohol.
If you have an alcohol,</v>

163
00:10:13.051 --> 00:10:17.280
you can go from right handed to lefthanded.
Right?
But this is no alcohol here.

164
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:20.880
What functionality is handy role?

165
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:24.293
<v 2>Okay,</v>

166
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.790
<v 1>what's special about the position of that age?</v>

167
00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:32.643
<v 2>Pardon?</v>

168
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:39.590
<v 1>We want to pull that hydrogen off and put it back on on the other side.</v>

169
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.000
Is there any way they're resilient hydrogens in here?
Ayesha?

170
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:51.260
Ah,
Ian Olina late.
All right.
Okay.
So,

171
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:55.970
uh,
so we wanted to go to that and you do it with base.

172
00:10:56.090 --> 00:11:00.230
It's an needle late and this and the Trans isomer is more stable so it goes all

173
00:11:00.231 --> 00:11:03.260
over there.
Okay,
bye.
The EDA late.

174
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:07.580
And now we're going to make the ketones into alcohols.

175
00:11:07.581 --> 00:11:10.370
Can you think of a reagent that could do that?
This is review.

176
00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:18.170
What kind of reagent is necessary?
A reducing agent.

177
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.770
Something that'll add hydride to the carbon eel.
Any ideas?

178
00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.480
Pardon me?
Hydrogen Peroxide.
Good idea everyone.

179
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.960
Why?
It's an oxidizing agent,
not a reducing agent.
Okay.

180
00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:40.000
Okay.
Lithium aluminum hydride does the trick.
Okay,
so you'll do that.

181
00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:45.780
Now what they want to do is get from this dial now over here to a ketone in an

182
00:11:47.221 --> 00:11:51.640
unsaturation.
You already have an unsaturation here.
Okay.

183
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:56.200
So,
uh,
let's think about how we do that.
We could,

184
00:11:56.510 --> 00:12:00.340
the oxidation levels turn out to be the same,
right?

185
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.260
So you just use acid to eliminate at la,

186
00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:08.520
I sit in water so you can protonate and get that cat eye in,

187
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.590
right?
But why get that cat eye on?

188
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.910
Why not protonate here and get the cat eye on the bottom are protonate here and

189
00:12:15.911 --> 00:12:19.090
lose methanol and get the cat eye on there.
Well,

190
00:12:19.091 --> 00:12:23.080
the cat eye and here is no good because it's a sigma,
it's in the sigma system.

191
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.790
It's not conjugated with the double bond.
This one is Al Alec.

192
00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:30.190
But that one would be at Lilly too.
Right?

193
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:35.610
But if you make that one,
then the resonance structure is here.
There's Pas,

194
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:40.390
there's the vacant orbital,
the low Lumo is here and here,
right?

195
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.790
And it's adjacent to the unshared pair on oxygen.

196
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.530
So that's the one you want to do.

197
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:49.870
So it takes off the one they want to take off at the top.
You get that right?

198
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:55.330
Okay.
Now you do an Allen Lilly rearrangement of,

199
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.570
of Ooh,
right.

200
00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:01.790
So are you complete the Alec Arrange Rearrangement?

201
00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:05.050
You took it off here and you put it on here.

202
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.450
Now what functional group do you have now?

203
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.863
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

204
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.120
<v 1>when you have O,
h n o r on the same carbon,</v>

205
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:20.490
Roy,
he tau.
What does it do when you,

206
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:26.100
what does the heavy key towel do?
Loses alcohol.
Right?

207
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:31.710
So the heavy asset towel here,
treat it with acid.
Protonate lose that.

208
00:13:31.711 --> 00:13:35.160
And you've got the ketone now,
right?
So we,
we've got it to here,

209
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.910
but we need to get this,
Ooh,
off to get down to what?

210
00:13:38.911 --> 00:13:43.260
He wants to build this over here.
So he treats it with a Siddique and hydride,

211
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:48.530
right?
What does an alcohol do with a CD?
Can Hydride the Oh,

212
00:13:48.531 --> 00:13:51.570
a tax.
The Carbon Eel acetate leaves.

213
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:56.250
It's a substitution reaction that an ACL carbon,
right?

214
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.370
So you've put acetate on here.
Okay.

215
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.630
And now to get from here to here,
we have to change and Oh,

216
00:14:03.631 --> 00:14:08.130
on the ring into an h on the ring.
What kind of reagent do we need

217
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.970
change?
We need a reducing agent,
right?
So like a metal.
So we use the zinc.

218
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:17.040
So zinc comes in,

219
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:21.910
gives the electrons the acetate leaves,
right?

220
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:26.790
So we generate this and I and then that double bond and ina late.

221
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.760
But of course this is a resonance structure of it.

222
00:14:29.761 --> 00:14:33.660
And you put a proton on the ad.
I end down there.
So he's got to that.

223
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:39.230
So now we're ready for the next step and the next step is to build,

224
00:14:39.271 --> 00:14:41.730
ring be all right.

225
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:46.470
And also to protect the double bond here so we'll won't react when another

226
00:14:46.471 --> 00:14:48.990
double bonds react.
Okay?

227
00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:52.940
And this thing here on B building,

228
00:14:52.941 --> 00:14:57.440
this thing on B will be a handle to construct ring a.

229
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.073
<v 2>Okay.</v>

230
00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:06.090
<v 1>And that double bond here gives you access to that place,
which is,</v>

231
00:15:06.091 --> 00:15:09.510
remember where we need to put a ketone,
which is sort of off in left field.

232
00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.040
Okay.
So the first thing is to re build,
ring be.

233
00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:19.130
Did you ever see a thing like that where from a,
from a ketone.

234
00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:23.400
Here we build a whole six membered ring down here.

235
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:31.820
We saw it two lectures ago.
Yeah,
the Robinson annulation.
Okay.

236
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.560
So what we need is ethyl vinyl Quito,
not methyl vinyl ketone,

237
00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:40.160
but Ethel,
in order to get this extra methyl group in here.
So this thing,

238
00:15:40.161 --> 00:15:44.570
which normally would be methyl vinyl ketone is now ethyl vinyl ketone.

239
00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.980
So we'll have that methyl group on there.
Okay?
So Ethyl Vinyl Ketone,
right?

240
00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:51.710
Generate the eternal eight,
uh,

241
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:56.120
does a conjugate edition or sometimes called a Michael Edition,
right?

242
00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:01.570
Make that [inaudible] an ion protonated and now make the other Ian laid and iron

243
00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:06.260
and have it attack the carbon eel to make the beginning of that double bond.

244
00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:11.180
What would you call that kind of reaction if you make this analyte react with

245
00:16:11.181 --> 00:16:14.570
this and end up with an Alpha Beta unsaturated ketone.

246
00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.690
So you have a ketone attack.

247
00:16:17.691 --> 00:16:21.020
Another key tone to give an Alpha Beta unsaturated Quito.

248
00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:25.910
Remember what you call that?
Aldol you still have a week?
Don't panic.

249
00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:27.763
<v 2>Okay.</v>

250
00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:32.260
<v 1>Okay.
So we're going to do an aldol reaction and then,
and then,</v>

251
00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.930
and then get over here.
Okay?

252
00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:39.250
Now what we do there in order to make this protected group is treat with Osmium

253
00:16:39.251 --> 00:16:42.150
tetroxide.
We know that that makes a dial.

254
00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:46.510
We talked about that when we were talking about a para cyclic reactions.

255
00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.670
Okay?
So you can get the dye all,

256
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.840
then you make the dial into this carbon with two more methyls on it.

257
00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.540
What kind of,
what kind of functional group is this?

258
00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:57.700
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

259
00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.730
<v 1>two.
Oh,
ours on the same carbon.</v>

260
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.250
That's a full asset towel,
right?

261
00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:10.730
And you make it by reacting or Ketone ketone acetone with the dial.

262
00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:16.050
Okay?
That,
so we're going to get this key towel or acid towel.
Okay?

263
00:17:16.051 --> 00:17:20.010
Now we need to go across from here to here,
right?

264
00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.550
And what we're doing is removing this double bond,

265
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:26.183
<v 2>okay?</v>

266
00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:30.910
<v 1>So that's done with catalytic hydrogenation,
right?</v>

267
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.860
And notice that's why we had to protect this double bond here because it would

268
00:17:35.861 --> 00:17:38.800
have been destroyed.
And if it was destroyed,

269
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:41.560
then you'd have no functionality out here.

270
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:45.400
In order to change the six ring into five membered ring and put the other stuff

271
00:17:45.401 --> 00:17:50.370
on.
So you had the,
you had to first protect this,
then get rid of this one.

272
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.000
Okay?
So now he's got this compound

273
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:59.700
and now he's going to work on ring D or department.
He's going to,

274
00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:03.420
we're going to knock ring d off while we work on ring so the whole slide won't

275
00:18:03.421 --> 00:18:04.740
fill up.
Okay.

276
00:18:04.741 --> 00:18:09.240
So we'll just take that big thing up there and work on ring a now,

277
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.790
what kind of reaction by make ring a,

278
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.820
an Alpha Beta unsaturated ketone here?

279
00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:17.190
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

280
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.920
<v 1>Any reactions that you have?
Alphabait unsaturated ketones.</v>

281
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.700
Aldol reaction.
So that's what we're going to be looking for,

282
00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:27.660
but there's some problems as you'll see.
So we're going to do that.

283
00:18:27.661 --> 00:18:31.530
We're going to get this and then an algal reaction on that.

284
00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.920
We'll make this and we can get this by adding the anti and here conjugate to an

285
00:18:38.461 --> 00:18:42.000
Alpha Beta unsaturated ketone here.
What do we call it?

286
00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:44.080
<v 2>Okay.</v>

287
00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:48.310
<v 1>What do you call that kind of reaction?
The whole thing.</v>

288
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:51.610
Te Te to start from here and build this ring.

289
00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:56.920
Build ring.
You said it before,
Rob Robinson.

290
00:18:56.921 --> 00:18:58.870
Annulation we're going to do it again.
Okay.

291
00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.960
So that would be ready for the ALDOL.

292
00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:07.030
And now this double bond here is even closer to where we needed in order to make

293
00:19:07.031 --> 00:19:10.540
that ketone.
Okay.
Now how do you do that?
Now there's a problem,

294
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:14.080
you'd have to make the eternal light to do the Robinson animation,

295
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:18.970
but this is where you formed the eternal light down there.
Not this,

296
00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:21.760
you could remove one of these hydrogens would make an ina late,

297
00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:26.530
or you could remove,
remove one of those hydrogens and make an anti in there,

298
00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:31.570
which would be Allah Lake with it.
I had an eye on there,
which is an Ino eight,

299
00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.360
right?
So this one is called a vanilla Gus analyte.

300
00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.630
It's got an extra double bond in between,
but still it,

301
00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.760
it would behave as an Adelaide.

302
00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.530
But the problem is that this one is more reactive.

303
00:19:44.531 --> 00:19:46.210
You want to make the analyte here,

304
00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:51.520
which you can do by removing one of those purple ages,
right?

305
00:19:51.521 --> 00:19:54.640
And then having their anti and be there as a resonance structure.

306
00:19:54.641 --> 00:19:59.641
That's fine except that these are the ones that get pulled off easier.

307
00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:04.740
So what do you do?
You go ahead and pull these off,

308
00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.440
tie 'em up somehow with something else,

309
00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:11.790
then get the other one and then come back and take off what you had put on their

310
00:20:11.791 --> 00:20:15.480
use of protecting group.
Okay.

311
00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:19.350
And notice incidentally that there's another age here that could also be pulled

312
00:20:19.351 --> 00:20:22.380
off that would have a resonance structure was the anti in here.

313
00:20:22.381 --> 00:20:27.130
So there are lots of possibilities.
Okay.
You want to get that and I,

314
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.820
which is like that and I n okay,
so,

315
00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:35.880
so first you have to protect the more reactive Alpha position and they do that

316
00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:37.920
by that.

317
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.270
That's just abbreviating what's above make the eternal eight attack.

318
00:20:42.271 --> 00:20:44.990
That carbon eel,
which has a leaving group on it.
Yeah.

319
00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:53.650
So the och three,
we'll leave and generate this dykey tone.
Right.

320
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.970
That's like a climax and reaction that we talked about last,
last time were at,

321
00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:03.010
at ELA to tax an Ester and the,
and the alcohol leaves.
Right.

322
00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:07.840
And then that gets attacked by an amine to give this

323
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:15.520
and that dehydrates,
it's like making an alphabet unsaturated ketone,

324
00:21:15.521 --> 00:21:18.610
except it has this nitrogen on it now,
which helps out.

325
00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.820
The unshared pair on the nitrogen is stabilized by this.

326
00:21:21.821 --> 00:21:25.960
You can draw a resonance structures that put charge on the oxygen.
Okay.

327
00:21:25.961 --> 00:21:30.280
So this is like an alto and Alpha Beta unsaturated ketone also noticed it's an

328
00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.530
intimate,
okay.

329
00:21:32.531 --> 00:21:37.420
So that's tied up the downstairs part and now you can proceed with making the

330
00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:39.430
anti a new one,
right,

331
00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:44.431
which is going to add to there and hopefully by a Robinson methyl vinyl ketone

332
00:21:44.441 --> 00:21:48.190
or pardon me,
it would be a,
yeah,
methyl vinyl,
Quito.
And this time,

333
00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.910
because the first time we had to put the ch three in there,

334
00:21:51.911 --> 00:21:54.090
where do we use that [inaudible] apartment?

335
00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:58.990
Me when we use this ina laid over here.
Now,
now we don't need a ch three,

336
00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.740
uh,
here,
here.
So we don't need it.
We can use methyl,

337
00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:06.850
except it doesn't work.
The reaction doesn't work.

338
00:22:06.851 --> 00:22:10.600
So you have to do something a little more around about,
okay.

339
00:22:10.601 --> 00:22:14.500
So that doesn't work,
but you can,
uh,

340
00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:19.740
you can add,
add it to,
if you can't add it to methyl vinyl ketone,

341
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:21.610
you can add it to the double bond here.

342
00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:26.440
Do a conjugate addition to this sort of like a ketone to that night trial.

343
00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.350
Okay.
So the [inaudible] adds to this carbon,

344
00:22:29.351 --> 00:22:33.160
generate the anti and next to the night trial done protonated and you've got

345
00:22:33.161 --> 00:22:37.740
that conjugate addition again.
Okay.
Uh,

346
00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.990
now,
uh,
but the,
the,
this,

347
00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:45.370
the problem is there's a ca the ch three here could be either up or down,

348
00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:49.270
right?
You could have added to either face of that an island.
Right?

349
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:52.060
So here's what,

350
00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:56.170
here's what they said in the paper about that the protected ketone was condensed

351
00:22:56.171 --> 00:22:58.910
with a Carrillo night trial.
That's that compound with Cy.

352
00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:03.550
And I end up at the top in the presence of aqueous Triton on B and t,
butanol,

353
00:23:03.551 --> 00:23:06.360
benzene,
Eh,
try Triton be

354
00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:12.440
in,
I'm not sure what the end is any in TV.
Oh,
in it,

355
00:23:12.441 --> 00:23:16.120
the eyes left out in t butanol,
benzene,
solvent,

356
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:21.480
and the product on basic hydrolysis yielded this long name thing as a mixture of

357
00:23:21.551 --> 00:23:25.030
two isomers.
That's the problem.
That's a mixture of two isomers.

358
00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:28.460
And that's just lore,
whether you're going to get something like that and it,

359
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:31.330
sometimes you just have to suck it up.
That's not a,

360
00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:34.150
because there's no hydrogen you can pull off here,
right.

361
00:23:34.151 --> 00:23:36.610
To make it come on the other side.
That's just the way it is.

362
00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:41.020
So you've got to throw away a certain amount of your stuff.
Okay.
So that's tough,

363
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.600
right?
So then they used a,
uh,

364
00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.740
strong base and water,
uh,

365
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:53.720
which removed this protecting group,
right?
Made it back into the,

366
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:58.840
uh,
to the ch two here,
okay.
And at the same time,

367
00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:04.010
it was strong enough that it hydrolyzed the night trial to make a carboxylic

368
00:24:04.011 --> 00:24:04.844
acid there.

369
00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:10.910
So now treat that with acid protonate there.
Then protonate here,

370
00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:12.860
making that cat ion,

371
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:17.690
but that can attack the carbon eel to get that,

372
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:22.340
which can then lose a proton.
So you've got a six membered ring.

373
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:28.930
So we made it
not quite,
we got the wrong element there.

374
00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:31.870
Oxygen instead of carbon at the bottom,
right?

375
00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.770
So we need another carbon in the system,
right?

376
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:40.420
So protonate their cad ion eliminate,

377
00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.350
we got that double bond,
okay.

378
00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.440
But now we need to convert that into ring a,

379
00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.920
we need to put that extra blue methyl group on there.
Okay?

380
00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:55.060
So the way to do it is that use methyl grin yard.

381
00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:59.620
So the methyl minus adds to the Carbon Eel,
and that is alleving group.

382
00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:09.310
Okay.
And that's an analyte.
So it becomes a ketone.

383
00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:14.680
And we've got this thing here,
okay.
So we're getting close.
It's closer now.
Okay.

384
00:25:14.681 --> 00:25:18.730
You do an alcohol and you have ring A.
Okay.

385
00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:22.570
So this is a typical thing that happens.

386
00:25:22.571 --> 00:25:25.480
It looked like a Robinson had Alation might go directly there,

387
00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:29.080
but it didn't work.
So they do a work around,
okay,

388
00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:35.080
so now a is all set and now we need to work on ring d,
which is,

389
00:25:35.081 --> 00:25:38.980
remember a six membered ring and it needs to be a five membered ring.
Okay?

390
00:25:38.981 --> 00:25:43.600
So we'll put it up in the corner and start working on that.
Okay.

391
00:25:43.601 --> 00:25:44.760
So the first thing that that,

392
00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:48.220
what they're going to go for is to make it a five membered ring that has an

393
00:25:48.221 --> 00:25:52.870
ester group coming off.
So you have that carbon group that we're gonna want.
Okay.

394
00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:55.630
So the first thing they do is treat it with acid and water.

395
00:25:55.631 --> 00:25:56.620
What do they do that for?

396
00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:00.603
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

397
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:05.720
<v 1>What's that going to do with that compound?
Ayesha?</v>

398
00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:10.550
Right now you get rid of the protecting group.

399
00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:13.000
You want to be able to work on that double bond now.

400
00:26:13.001 --> 00:26:15.850
So you'd take the protecting group off that you had on there when you were doing

401
00:26:15.851 --> 00:26:20.050
a catalytic hydrogenation.
Okay,
so now,

402
00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:21.573
um,

403
00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:27.900
now that we've got the dial and now treat it with a per ionic acid,

404
00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.820
do you remember what that does?

405
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:37.310
Is it oxidizes a dial to cleave the carbon carbon bond in between,

406
00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:42.730
right?
And make two carbonyl groups.
Okay?

407
00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.630
So at first did a ads and then it,

408
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:50.190
that's just an intermediate transient intermediate comes apart to give to

409
00:26:50.191 --> 00:26:53.520
aldehydes.
And now how are you going to get a five membered ring?

410
00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.610
<v 2>All
right?</v>

411
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:05.250
<v 1>You could make an eternal eight here,
attack that carbon eel</v>

412
00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:09.800
or make an needle eight here,
attack this carbon eel.

413
00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:14.090
Those are going to give different products,
right?

414
00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:20.270
What you would need to do is to have,
is to have this analyte attack,

415
00:27:20.271 --> 00:27:23.330
this carbon eel.
If you want to make that compound rather than have the,

416
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:28.520
have this,
uh,
have this,
uh,
this thing form,
react with,

417
00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.590
with that one,
have,
have this,
eat a light,

418
00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:35.570
react with that one and get the carboxylic acid down here.
Okay?

419
00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:39.230
It turns out that base with Al Doll,
uh,

420
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:42.650
could be either that way or that way.

421
00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.770
And luck made it go the right way this time.

422
00:27:45.771 --> 00:27:50.480
Robinson and Alation didn't work before,
but this one worked the right way.
Okay.

423
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:54.350
And then we've got an Aldehyde.
We need the carboxylic acid.

424
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:59.240
So he used a dichromate oxidation,
which we talked about the oxidize and alcohol.

425
00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.600
And of course you don't stop at the Aldehyde,
you go onto the acid,

426
00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:06.260
but you need the Ester.
So now they're going to make the ester.

427
00:28:06.261 --> 00:28:09.710
You could do Fischer esterification,
but that's an equilibrium.

428
00:28:09.711 --> 00:28:13.760
And this stuff is becoming very precious because all the work that you've put

429
00:28:13.761 --> 00:28:17.360
into it.
So you want to do this in the highest possible yield.

430
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:23.000
So they use dyes or methane,
remember,
which is the way of doing it.

431
00:28:23.001 --> 00:28:28.001
It really take to change the acid and methanol into methyl ester and really high

432
00:28:29.091 --> 00:28:33.240
yield.
Okay?
So that's a dangerous compound to work with.
It's,

433
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:37.760
it's much as much more expensive and cumbersome than doing a methyl,

434
00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:42.770
uh,
Fischer esterification,
but it gives a really high yield.

435
00:28:42.771 --> 00:28:47.120
So that's what they did.
Okay.
Uh,
so now,
uh,

436
00:28:47.121 --> 00:28:48.080
they had this cop,

437
00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:52.130
they had the ketone here and now they made it into an alcohol.

438
00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:56.720
Now this looks nuts,
right?
They already had the Quito in there,

439
00:28:56.721 --> 00:29:01.520
which is what they want,
right?
And the double bond here,
right?

440
00:29:01.521 --> 00:29:04.070
They've got it.
Why do they backtrack?

441
00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:09.670
They backtracked because it was already known from 1918.
Well,
uh,

442
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:13.100
so they used the borrow hydride this time to reduce the,

443
00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.590
to reduce the ketone do an alcohol without,

444
00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:20.420
if they'd lift used lithium aluminum hydride it would have reduced the Esther to

445
00:29:20.421 --> 00:29:22.850
an alcohol.
They didn't want to do that.
Right?

446
00:29:22.851 --> 00:29:26.540
So you have to choose the reagents carefully when there's possible competition

447
00:29:26.541 --> 00:29:28.970
like that.
Now it was 19 nine,

448
00:29:28.971 --> 00:29:33.110
it was found out that this alcohol could be separated.

449
00:29:33.111 --> 00:29:35.810
The two e Nao Timmers easily.

450
00:29:35.811 --> 00:29:39.740
That was already known like 50 years before.
Right?
So,

451
00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:44.710
so they in order see all this stuff they'd been doing started with,

452
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:49.660
with a chiral material.
So they've got both right and left handed stuff there,

453
00:29:49.661 --> 00:29:51.850
and they want only the one,
the one iga antibody.

454
00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.370
Ultimately they've someplace they're going to have to separate it.

455
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:59.620
And this is where they do the separation because it turns out if you put this in

456
00:29:59.621 --> 00:30:04.480
together with this digit tonin stuff,
which itself notice has a six,
six,

457
00:30:04.481 --> 00:30:07.150
six,
five steroid inside,

458
00:30:07.151 --> 00:30:10.560
it does complicated serpiginous as it's called.
Uh,

459
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:13.960
then those things come together.
Uh,

460
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:17.350
and what precipitates is just one hand.

461
00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:22.180
The other one stays in solution,
right?
So this was obviously [inaudible],

462
00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.660
but anyhow,
they got that.
And now having made this,

463
00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:31.290
it turned out that previous studies of cortisone had shown that if you had this,

464
00:30:32.291 --> 00:30:35.470
you could make this from it,
right?

465
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:39.130
So this in this is called a total synthesis,

466
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:44.430
but in fact it's a formal total synthesis or a relay synthesis.

467
00:30:44.741 --> 00:30:47.680
Because by the time they got here,
they had very little material.

468
00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:49.960
So they couldn't do a bunch more steps.

469
00:30:49.961 --> 00:30:53.650
But it was known that those steps could be done because people had already done

470
00:30:53.651 --> 00:30:54.820
them.
Right?

471
00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:59.230
So they could then start with material which had been made from cortisone or

472
00:30:59.231 --> 00:31:02.050
some other sterile and then carry it through.

473
00:31:02.051 --> 00:31:04.960
But there was no point in doing it because people had already done those

474
00:31:04.961 --> 00:31:07.900
reactions.
And this is,
so this is the paper,

475
00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:13.060
this is the whole paper that described the total synthesis of cortisone.

476
00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:17.350
Woodward was not a man of many words,
right?

477
00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:21.910
There actually had been a previous paper of about two pages about about making

478
00:31:21.911 --> 00:31:26.590
the precursor that we showed,
right?
So,
so he then had this,

479
00:31:26.591 --> 00:31:31.270
he did a,
he reduced this double bond,
right?

480
00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:35.410
But notice it didn't reduce this what?
It didn't reduce.
Pardon me?

481
00:31:35.411 --> 00:31:39.160
It did reduce this one and this one but didn't reduce this one.
So again,

482
00:31:39.161 --> 00:31:44.161
this is testing the various methods you're using to make sure what's,

483
00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:46.180
what's going to react and what isn't.

484
00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:48.490
Why didn't they want to get rid of that double bond?

485
00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.680
Cause that's the one that's going to give them the handle to get that ketone in

486
00:31:53.681 --> 00:31:58.120
up there,
which is a very difficult position.
Okay,
so,

487
00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:01.690
and then they could do sodium borohydride that made the alcohol that we showed

488
00:32:01.691 --> 00:32:06.670
you before,
right?
But notice that the borough hydride didn't attack here.

489
00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.220
It only attacked down here.
Okay.

490
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:14.310
Then they made the acetate from that alcohol and now they've got to convert this

491
00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.910
to cortisone.

492
00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:22.030
At this point in our synthetic work are our synthetic work intersects the lines

493
00:32:22.031 --> 00:32:26.860
previously laid down in the extensive prior investigations by many groups.

494
00:32:26.861 --> 00:32:29.980
So he goes through some of these groups,
hymen and Feeser,

495
00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:32.440
that's the guy that wrote this story,
right.

496
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:37.710
Have recently converted the asset Toxi Esther three into this compound five.

497
00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:41.840
So the reference to that,
it was work at 1951.

498
00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:46.370
So what they did was to,
uh,
let's see.

499
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:50.990
Uh,
okay.
That's they,
well,
whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.

500
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.260
You're doing a lot of stuff here.
Okay.
Reaction for oh,

501
00:32:54.261 --> 00:32:56.930
reference for reference five then referenced six,

502
00:32:57.170 --> 00:33:02.170
puts that thing on up there and then a reference a seven puts the alcohol in or

503
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:05.450
whatever.
Uh,

504
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:09.730
and finally the double bond by Maddix and Kendall.
Well,

505
00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.050
Kendall remembers the guy that got the Nobel prize,

506
00:33:12.051 --> 00:33:15.950
the chemist at the Mayo Institute.
Okay.
Okay.

507
00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:18.110
So that did it.
They had it,

508
00:33:18.111 --> 00:33:23.111
they'd solve the intellectual artistic problem of how you can start with simple

509
00:33:23.181 --> 00:33:26.360
available compounds and make cortisone.
Right?

510
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:32.750
But what was the yield?
Right?
Think of better at about yield.

511
00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:33.830
Okay.

512
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:38.360
Suppose you do 39 steps and each step has an 80% yield,

513
00:33:38.361 --> 00:33:42.410
which isn't so bad as you've found in lab.
Right?
Okay.

514
00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:47.860
Then the overall yield is 0.01% if you take 0.8 to the 39th power,

515
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:52.100
but there's a different way to go about it.

516
00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:55.010
Like what's called a convergence synthesis,

517
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:59.660
where you make several big pieces and then link the pieces together.

518
00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:04.550
So the distance in number of steps for many one starting material to the product

519
00:34:04.551 --> 00:34:07.970
is smaller than having all 39 in a row,
right?

520
00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.700
So you could start with something that does nine steps.

521
00:34:10.701 --> 00:34:15.290
Say that makes a another nine steps sequence makes be another.
Make see it.

522
00:34:15.291 --> 00:34:20.291
Another makes d and now you put a and B together and c and d together to make

523
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:22.400
enf and then you put them together.

524
00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:27.700
And now the distance is only a nine steps plus two steps for any given starting

525
00:34:27.861 --> 00:34:31.010
material and you get a 9% yield.
Right?

526
00:34:31.011 --> 00:34:35.180
So convergence synthesis has real advantages.
Now,

527
00:34:35.181 --> 00:34:39.320
how got a practical cortisone synthesis that could make something that people

528
00:34:39.321 --> 00:34:43.770
could afford to use?
Well,
there's cortisone.
Remember that's what,
that's what the,

529
00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:47.240
the Nobel laureate said,
there are two things you can do.

530
00:34:47.241 --> 00:34:51.800
Either do a total synthesis or get a better starting material than it was then

531
00:34:51.801 --> 00:34:56.690
available.
So choose a inappropriate,
readily available starting material.
Okay.

532
00:34:56.691 --> 00:34:59.120
Does oxy Coley Casad a bile acid,

533
00:34:59.121 --> 00:35:03.080
which you can get from slaughter houses or get the glands from which to make it

534
00:35:03.081 --> 00:35:07.730
from slaughterhouses.
Okay.
It comes from ox bile.
So in 1946,

535
00:35:07.731 --> 00:35:12.731
49 Merc made a kilogram of cortisone from 600 kilograms of that bile acid,

536
00:35:14.031 --> 00:35:17.450
which came from an enormous about of stuff from the slaughterhouse.

537
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:20.840
But notice why that was a good starting material.

538
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:23.810
It has all the rings in place of the right size,

539
00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:29.120
right properly and is properly methylated.
So it's got the skeleton,

540
00:35:29.121 --> 00:35:30.110
the carbon skeleton,

541
00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:35.320
it's got all those things in the right stereochemistry right?

542
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:40.410
It's got here,
uh,
functionality,

543
00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:45.060
functional groups at or near at least some of the proper positions.

544
00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:49.950
Right?
You're going to have to fiddle around out here somehow.
Right?

545
00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:55.020
But
how are you going to do that?
Right.

546
00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:56.950
Well,
you could imagine a go,

547
00:35:57.010 --> 00:36:00.540
they were able to go in 12 steps to that and we're not going to go through what

548
00:36:00.541 --> 00:36:04.680
those next 20 steps are that allow you to get the red thing.
But you can imagine,

549
00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:08.790
you could imagine things like do a Broman nation at a tertiary position.

550
00:36:08.791 --> 00:36:13.590
Maybe you could do that.
Uh,
then then may eliminate Hbr,

551
00:36:13.591 --> 00:36:15.360
maybe could go the wrong way.

552
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:18.350
Then maybe you could cleave the double bond and make the ketone.

553
00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:23.280
Then maybe you could do Alpha Broman nation to the adjacent to the ketone and

554
00:36:23.281 --> 00:36:25.500
then make alcohols from that.
Something like that.

555
00:36:25.501 --> 00:36:29.100
You can imagine that's not what was done.
That wouldn't be 20 steps,
right?

556
00:36:29.101 --> 00:36:32.610
It didn't work that way.
But you can imagine ways that you could get at it.

557
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:37.470
So they did it in 20th steps.
Okay.

558
00:36:37.471 --> 00:36:42.471
So then they got cortisone and they could sell it in 1949 for $200 a gram having

559
00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:47.280
made it by 32 step sequence.
Okay.

560
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:52.680
But there's another style,
another compound called diaas genet and dialysis.

561
00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:57.690
Jenine also has the right set of rings and the right stereochemistry and

562
00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:01.050
functionality.
And in a good place,
right?

563
00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:05.780
And it's abundant in a Mexican Yam.
And Russell Marker,

564
00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:10.290
uh,
who was an organic chemist at Penn State University,
uh,

565
00:37:10.291 --> 00:37:11.490
went exploring.

566
00:37:11.491 --> 00:37:15.780
He sort of quit and went down to Mexico and looked around to see if he could

567
00:37:15.781 --> 00:37:20.781
find natural things that gave that contained a lot of this and some the roots of

568
00:37:21.451 --> 00:37:25.180
this Yam.
Some of them are,
you know,
uh,
our,
uh,
uh,

569
00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:29.970
20 or 50 kilograms and a fair percentage of it is this stuff,

570
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:34.140
right?
So he,
he was able to find a good source of this,
right?

571
00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:39.150
And it could be converted in five steps into progesterone,
a female hormone,

572
00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:42.810
right?
And so in 1943,

573
00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:48.020
he got 10 tons of that Yam and from it made three kilograms of progesterone,

574
00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:53.520
which was then worth a quarter million dollars,
which is in,
in 1943,

575
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:56.700
which is like,
I dunno,
you know,
$5 million.

576
00:37:56.701 --> 00:37:59.130
Now he had the world's supply of progesterone,

577
00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.930
which is a pregnancy hormone.

578
00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:08.490
And so it was selling in 1955 for 48 cents a gram,
right?

579
00:38:08.491 --> 00:38:11.610
Instead of this $200 grabbed stuff.
Okay.

580
00:38:11.611 --> 00:38:14.910
But there's a problem if you want to get cortisone in this way because there's

581
00:38:14.911 --> 00:38:18.840
no foothold to get out that position rather than that one or that one or that

582
00:38:18.841 --> 00:38:21.570
one or that one or that one or that one or that one.
Right.

583
00:38:21.571 --> 00:38:24.180
How are you going to put the ketone in?
Right.

584
00:38:24.181 --> 00:38:29.181
And this is where it was found actually by this guy here or by his research

585
00:38:29.551 --> 00:38:31.110
group.
Uh,
Fredrick Heil,

586
00:38:31.111 --> 00:38:34.320
who was an undergraduate and graduate student here was the director of research

587
00:38:34.321 --> 00:38:35.920
at Upjohn and Upjohn

588
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:40.450
<v 0>research in Kalamazoo.
They found out that they had some of this,</v>

589
00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:45.250
a mold started growing on a dish that was in a window sill.

590
00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:48.610
And when you put it on here,
it put a ketone in that position.

591
00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:55.480
Okay.
For me,
put,
put the alcohol in that position.

592
00:38:55.481 --> 00:38:59.680
But then once you got the alcohol here and they are home free.
Right.
Okay.
Now,

593
00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:04.150
so a Woodward had done the total synthesis of cortisone and he did a lot of

594
00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:08.710
total synthesis,
like the strychnine synthesis here.
Uh,

595
00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:11.620
I thank Professor Saunders who took these pictures.

596
00:39:11.621 --> 00:39:15.450
He was still a graduate student at this time in 1954 when strict me was

597
00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:20.350
synthesized a,
and no,
the interesting thing about Woodward,

598
00:39:20.351 --> 00:39:24.940
he,
there was a real cult of personality is still is among older people because

599
00:39:24.941 --> 00:39:26.590
young people don't know who he was anymore

600
00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:35.290
because he was such an artist.
I mean,
designing these things,

601
00:39:35.291 --> 00:39:38.860
this is an art,
but you have to really know a lot to see the art in it.

602
00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:43.570
And he has no bell citation actually said for his outstanding achievements in

603
00:39:43.571 --> 00:39:45.610
the art of organic synthesis.

604
00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:49.870
I don't think there's ever been another Nobel citation that said art in it.

605
00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:51.850
So he made a lot of these things here.

606
00:39:51.851 --> 00:39:54.370
Here was strictly in a very challenging thing.

607
00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.980
And so when they got done,

608
00:39:56.981 --> 00:40:01.870
they drew it very carefully on the blackboard and the postdocs who had worked on

609
00:40:01.871 --> 00:40:06.160
it.
Uh,
Alice was a faculty member from the University of Bristol in England.

610
00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:10.240
Hunger was a German Danika and Shanker where we're from.

611
00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:13.380
Switzerland and Cava was an American who,
uh,

612
00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:18.370
went to be a professor at,
uh,
at,
uh,
Penn.
Right.

613
00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:23.080
But you notice the,
uh,
in,
in when he got the note,

614
00:40:23.081 --> 00:40:27.730
when Woodward got the Nobel Prize,
his colleagues wrote this in science magazine,

615
00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:30.070
Woodward style is polished,

616
00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:32.890
showing an insight and sense of proportion that afford,

617
00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:37.600
afford him strong convictions and a well developed a dramatic sense.

618
00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:41.620
So you can see how just,
you know,
the ways lighting is cigarette there.

619
00:40:41.621 --> 00:40:45.520
It looks sort of a dramatic to me and look,
look at his signature.

620
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.090
He always signed minuscule signatures,
right?

621
00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:52.000
There are be Woodward,
right?

622
00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:56.020
And they also put a check mark on it,

623
00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:00.700
but they finished the synthesis and down in the bottom wrote fic coat.

624
00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.120
So,
you know,
Latin that,

625
00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:06.310
but that as I talked to victor bears in the classics department,

626
00:41:06.311 --> 00:41:09.570
that's not a proper Latin word,
but fate chair,

627
00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:12.820
it means they made it right?

628
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:15.800
So that's what they almost got it right of it that way.

629
00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:20.470
But I did that on the blackboard.
But one of the hallmarks of,
of,
uh,

630
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:25.710
Woodward style was that he always wore the same color blue suit and blue tie.

631
00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:31.360
So I,
so that's Woodward blue tie.
And in fact,
students,

632
00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:36.110
uh,
students painted one Halloween,
painted his parking place that light blue.

633
00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:41.150
And I know where they got the paint because I got it.

634
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:49.760
Okay.
So then in 1973,
they did this real pinnacle of,

635
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:53.330
of synthesis that synthesize vitamin B 12.

636
00:41:53.331 --> 00:41:56.060
You can't imagine all the problems that were faced by this.

637
00:41:56.061 --> 00:42:00.560
And it was a collaborative work between a Woodward and ash and Mosers laboratory

638
00:42:00.561 --> 00:42:03.680
at,
at the Ata Hod and Zurich and Switzerland.
Right.

639
00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:08.830
And in connection with this work is where Woodward discovered stereo chemical

640
00:42:09.021 --> 00:42:13.520
control by orbital symmetry.
Those are called the Woodward Hoffman rules,

641
00:42:13.521 --> 00:42:15.560
you know,
con rotation,
dis rotation.

642
00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:19.590
And it was while working on this that he discovered that,
hey,

643
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:23.810
they had a hundred coworkers at these two labs working on this.

644
00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:26.180
All of them very,
very talented,

645
00:42:26.181 --> 00:42:31.181
including this Guy Yoshito Kishi who was a faculty member from cute from Nagoya

646
00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:36.290
University who had come to work on this project with,
with uh,
with Woodward.

647
00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:40.370
And this is what Woodward wrote about him went in pure and applied chemistry in

648
00:42:40.371 --> 00:42:44.420
1971 he wrote about working on the beat 12th synthesis.

649
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:49.130
The first prep preparation of Cora generalized afforded striking testimony of

650
00:42:49.131 --> 00:42:52.460
the experimental skill of its discovered,
Dr Yoshito Kishi,

651
00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.540
all the operations had to be conducted with every conceivable precaution and

652
00:42:56.541 --> 00:42:59.990
respect,
a purity of reagents,
exclusion of oxygen and moisture,

653
00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:01.970
and with the greatest possible speed.

654
00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:07.180
So he was a real wizard in the laboratory and he then joined the Harvard Faculty

655
00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:08.870
after that and then succeeded.

656
00:43:08.871 --> 00:43:12.620
Woodward is professor of Harvard after Woodward's untimely death,

657
00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:15.320
and we've seen his name before,
not for this.

658
00:43:15.321 --> 00:43:19.370
He ultimately synthesized Paly toxin,
this compound,

659
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:24.380
which has a see 123 h,
two or 13 eno,

660
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:28.670
53 right?
It's got 42 functional groups,

661
00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:31.430
which were protected in eight different ways.

662
00:43:31.431 --> 00:43:35.090
So you could remove some of them and put others on and so on.
Right?

663
00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.820
It has 62 Steria agentic centers.

664
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:42.500
It has seven double bonds that could be either a or z.

665
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:47.330
So there tend to the 20th Stereo isomers problem possible.
Right.

666
00:43:47.331 --> 00:43:51.620
And it was done convergently so they made eight different pieces,
right.

667
00:43:51.621 --> 00:43:53.570
And then put those pieces together.

668
00:43:53.571 --> 00:43:58.160
So you'd get no yield at all if you did this in a sequential synthesis.
Right.

669
00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:02.240
But they actually made it right.
And it was not,

670
00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:04.430
although that was just a tour de force,

671
00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:09.820
it's related to practical stuff because we talked last fall about this asi a

672
00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:14.210
drug which,
which has a lot of similarity to that.
Right.

673
00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:17.540
And the week after we spoke about it in class,

674
00:44:17.541 --> 00:44:21.140
the FDA approved it for treating metastatic breast cancer.

675
00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:24.140
I remember we talked about whether that that was pending at the time.

676
00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:28.610
And you'll notice that the leader of this group was Kishi the guy.

677
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:33.630
So he had cut his teeth on Paly toxin for synthesize and things like this so

678
00:44:33.631 --> 00:44:37.020
that this drug can now be made synthetically,

679
00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:41.160
practically and sold as a drug that way.
It's just incredible.

680
00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:46.290
Okay.
So organic synthesis has come a long way from urea.

681
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:51.020
Remember what volar wrote to parts alias in 1828 that about the experiment on,

682
00:44:51.021 --> 00:44:55.200
he reacted cyanic acid with ammonia and tried at crystal and substance appears,

683
00:44:55.201 --> 00:44:58.560
which is an Ert baby.
Neither like signed eight nor like ammonia.

684
00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.640
So that's the story.

685
00:45:02.641 --> 00:45:06.090
But first that a little bit of thanks and credits,
uh,

686
00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:11.520
first to George Maxfield who was my high school chemistry teacher.
Uh,

687
00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:16.620
they,
they,
uh,
I remember his doing,

688
00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:19.890
he,
we,
we'd be working on something.
He wouldn't be doing anything at all.

689
00:45:19.891 --> 00:45:20.850
And he'd go like this.

690
00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:28.290
And the other thing he said he did was he said you'd make something,

691
00:45:28.291 --> 00:45:33.000
you put it in a bottle and sell it to your neighbor.
So that's,
I'm quoting him

692
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:39.670
and there's a Theodore Roosevelt Williams who is my first college professor at

693
00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:43.290
College of Wooster and then fees,
or we talked about,

694
00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:48.740
and Bartlett and Conant was his boss who had two phd advisors,

695
00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:51.980
a physical chemist,

696
00:45:51.981 --> 00:45:56.040
Twu Richards who got the Nobel prize and organic chemist eep Kohler,

697
00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:59.700
who was very,
these,
these,
these three pictures were all taken at Yale.

698
00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:04.500
That was when sterling was,
was dedicated.
This was at a meeting in 1931,

699
00:46:04.501 --> 00:46:09.360
when Bartlet was just a 20,
uh,
24 years old.

700
00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:14.190
Right.
And,
uh,
but Kohler never went to meetings.

701
00:46:14.191 --> 00:46:17.520
He never left Harvard.
People would come there to talk to him,

702
00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:21.410
but he wasn't interested in that.
He just taught all the time.
Right.

703
00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:25.770
And he's Kohler's the one that made,
uh,
that finally resolved alley.

704
00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:30.300
Remember we talked about Vantiff or that event off had predicted it,

705
00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:32.220
but Kohler's the one that made it.

706
00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:37.470
So Kohler was a student of Remsen who was at Johns Hopkins and Richard's studied

707
00:46:37.471 --> 00:46:40.080
with Osvaldo.
Remember the guy that didn't believe in atoms?

708
00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:45.030
And then the next generation back was fitting who,

709
00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:48.720
who discovered the pinnacle reaction.
Right.

710
00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:53.820
And the one person I couldn't find a picture of was Carl Schmitt,

711
00:46:53.821 --> 00:46:56.160
who was,
who was at Riga in Latvia.

712
00:46:56.610 --> 00:47:00.900
But he was described by Austin as the tall thin man with a small head and strong

713
00:47:00.901 --> 00:47:05.430
nose,
ice,
gray hair and a thin beard and a very nice person.
Right.

714
00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:09.300
And Schmidt had worked both with [inaudible] and volar.

715
00:47:09.301 --> 00:47:12.330
He was first a student of volar who recommended him to leaving,

716
00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.040
fitting had worked with volar.

717
00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:19.610
So we're back to those guys and then to Galeo sack and but sales and then to

718
00:47:20.041 --> 00:47:23.630
bear a bear to lay who was a colleague of Lavoie Oza.

719
00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:26.400
And wrote how to name compounds.

720
00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:31.100
But there there's some other heroes to whom we should pay homage,

721
00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:34.390
even if they weren't our ancestors.
I,
you know,

722
00:47:34.391 --> 00:47:36.610
this is right.

723
00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:42.500
<v 2>Who is this Emile Fisher,</v>

724
00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:46.520
<v 0>the last lecture
Kerner,</v>

725
00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:49.940
the other guy who did a real proof in the 19th century,

726
00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:53.090
James Clark Maxwell.

727
00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.290
<v 2>All right,
remember him?</v>

728
00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:00.100
<v 0>Cooper,
right?
That,</v>

729
00:48:00.101 --> 00:48:03.700
that surveillance of carbon Lovaas Yay.

730
00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:10.270
And Robert Hook,
there's no known picture of Hook,
right?

731
00:48:10.271 --> 00:48:12.640
Because Newton probably destroyed it.

732
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:18.610
That's true.
Right?
But this,

733
00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:23.670
this is a picture of somebody using hooks apparatus and Hook was a hunchback and

734
00:48:24.251 --> 00:48:28.030
he drew that picture.
And I like to think that might be a self portrait,

735
00:48:28.031 --> 00:48:31.750
although I certainly doubt it.
But Hook was certainly a great guy.

736
00:48:31.751 --> 00:48:35.260
And then of course we have a lot of people,
you have to pay homage to it.

737
00:48:35.261 --> 00:48:39.580
Yale too,
like a Sillivan with his tee shirt that says,

738
00:48:39.581 --> 00:48:40.414
how do you know,

739
00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:46.930
or a giant who's this hips,
right?

740
00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:51.910
And on Zaga those two Gibbs was,
was uh,

741
00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:55.810
are arguably the smartest guy in the 19th century,

742
00:48:55.811 --> 00:48:58.240
are certainly among the top half dozen or so.

743
00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:01.660
And own soccer was the same in this century.
Right.

744
00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:05.710
And I actually had on soccer as a colleague,
we overlapped for a few years.

745
00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:11.170
Okay.
I mean,
he's like fine month was in awe of on Zucker.

746
00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:15.970
Right.
And when Ozarka got the Nobel prize,
when they called to inform him,

747
00:49:15.971 --> 00:49:17.290
he asked what for?

748
00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:21.910
Because he had done so many things that could have gotten the Nobel prize.
Okay.

749
00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:24.070
And then,
you know,
this is,

750
00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:26.380
<v 2>yeah.</v>

751
00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:30.000
<v 0>[inaudible] these are the colleagues I've enjoyed having around for awhile and</v>

752
00:49:30.001 --> 00:49:33.900
he came in and told people how he determined the heat of vaporization of carbon

753
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:39.950
and that would,
you know,
why Berg and here's professors,

754
00:49:39.951 --> 00:49:44.700
Ziegler who gave,
these are people who gave lectures in the course.

755
00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:48.750
Right.
And of course,
you know who's next,
not a faculty member,

756
00:49:48.751 --> 00:49:53.480
but a graduate student from Yale.
All right.

757
00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.880
And then someone who's almost from Yale,
Leslie's laser.
Oh,

758
00:49:56.881 --> 00:49:59.610
Vich who spoke to you last semester.
He's from Israel,

759
00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:03.690
but he comes so often to visit that,
well,
call him an honorary Yalie.

760
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:08.850
Okay.
And then,
uh,
the,
these people we quoted,

761
00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:14.550
remember he's the guy that originated,
how do you know?
Hourly?
Right?

762
00:50:14.551 --> 00:50:17.870
And she's the one that does it now.
And here,

763
00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:22.380
this is my wife and that's John's wife.
And here's,

764
00:50:22.381 --> 00:50:27.381
this was a night before last over across the street here at a meeting that

765
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:31.140
Connecticut,
Connecticut Science Teacher's Association,
uh,

766
00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:35.020
when this plaque was awarded to my wife for,

767
00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:37.130
and she's sitting back here

768
00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:43.180
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

769
00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:50.820
<v 0>and next to her is the biology professor from Boden who I've quoted and she's</v>

770
00:50:51.551 --> 00:50:52.650
saying back there too.

771
00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:59.020
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

772
00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:03.340
<v 0>and then these are the kids.
I mean,
this is the next generation,
right?</v>

773
00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:05.530
And they're here with Caroline Doty.

774
00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:09.870
You know who Caroline and is a basketball player at Yukon.
Uh,

775
00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:12.500
so we'd gone to the Yukon Gay,
so I don't know what they're going to do.

776
00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:17.050
They might be a scientist,
they might be sadness.
It might be basketball players,

777
00:51:17.051 --> 00:51:19.510
they might be lawyers,
doctors.
Right.

778
00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:23.740
But you guys are going to be that too.
And you're going to be their teachers,

779
00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:28.300
right?
Or they're healers,
or Lord Forbid,

780
00:51:28.301 --> 00:51:29.650
defend them in court or something

781
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:31.960
<v 2>like that.
Right.</v>

782
00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:37.880
<v 0>Okay.
So there you are.
So I want to thank all of the students,
not only you guys,</v>

783
00:51:37.881 --> 00:51:39.050
but many years.

784
00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:41.673
<v 2>Okay.</v>

785
00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:45.161
<v 0>So thanks.</v>

786
00:51:45.161 --> 00:51:49.810
We'll ever review on Monday and rule one 10 there's going to be a symposium
here.

787
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:51.340
So at class time on Monday,

788
00:51:51.341 --> 00:51:55.900
we'll have a review down the hall and good luck on the final,
and that's it.

789
00:51:56.140 --> 00:52:01.140
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
