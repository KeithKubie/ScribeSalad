00:00:00.322 --> 00:00:03.710
Ubuntu comes with a firewall
pre-installed called ufw, but

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.550
it's not currently active.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.820
You can verify this by typing command,
sudo ufw status.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.240
Status: inactive.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.370
Let's start adding some
rules to our firewall,

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.570
then we'll actually turn it on.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.970
If we think back to the wall
of boxes from our last video,

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.280
we were initially blocking
all incoming requests.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.070
This is a good practice, as it makes
it much easier to manage your rules.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.950
Just block everything coming in,
then only allow what you need.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.270
We'll establish this default,
deny incoming, by using this rule.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.020
We can also establish a default rule for
our outgoing connections,

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.790
any request our server is trying
to send out to the internet.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.940
We'll set this rule by using this
command, sudo ufw the default rule,

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.300
allow all outgoing.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.970
Go ahead and check the status of your
firewall by typing, sudo ufw status.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.670
You'll see that it's currently still
inactive, which is a good thing.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.770
We're just configuring our firewall now.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.650
We actually have to turn it on ourselves
once we have everything how we want.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.820
If we were to turn the firewall on now,

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.310
we'd we blocking all incoming
connections including SSH, which means

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.200
our server would be dead in the water
and completely inaccessible to us.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.470
It's now time for us to start
configuring the firewall to support

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.570
the various ports and
the applications we know we'll need.
