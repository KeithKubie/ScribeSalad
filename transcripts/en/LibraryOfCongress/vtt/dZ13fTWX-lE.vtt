00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.390
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: Good evening.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.710
&gt;&gt; Evening.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.580
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: I'm Jane
McAuliffe, the Director

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.600
of National and International
Outreach here at the Library

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.580
of Congress, and I'd
really like to welcome you

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.580
to tonight's event, which
concludes the first term

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.530
of our 22nd Poet
Laureate Consultant

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.300
in Poetry, Tracy K. Smith.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.230
As I'm sure you know, the
Librarian of Congress,

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.230
Dr. Carla Hayden, has
appointed Tracy Smith

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.510
to a second term
as Poet Laureate.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.810
And she was eager to do

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.060
so because Tracy has already
accomplished a great deal

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.060
in her signature
laureate project.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.760
With this project, Tracy
seeks to bring more poetry

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.920
to rural communities,
communities like Fairfield,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.680
California where she grew up.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.820
This spring, with pilot trips
to New Mexico, South Carolina,

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.050
and Kentucky, Tracy developed
the model for how she plans

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.200
to spend her second term.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.790
And also on behalf
of the Library,

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.390
I'd like to thank Senator
Tom Udall of New Mexico,

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.890
Congressman James
Clyburn of South Carolina,

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.300
Congressman Brett Guthrie of
Kentucky, and their staffs,

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.520
of course, and the Kentucky
State Center for the Book.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.260
I'd like to thank all of them
for making Tracy's spring trips

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.160
so incredibly successful.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.800
Tonight, in a talk
entitled "Staying Human,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.000
Poetry in the Age
of Technology,"

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.770
Tracy will tell you
more about her project.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.880
She'll also make the case
for poetry as a reprieve

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.070
from the noise of the
21st century life.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.610
And she'll read a selection of
her work, including some poems

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.570
from her new anthology,
"American Journal,

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.240
Fifty Poems for Our Time,"

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.200
which is being published
jointly with the library.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.800
After that, Ron Charles,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.680
Editor of the Washington
Post's Book World and the host

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.480
of our Life of a Poet
series, will talk with Tracy

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.520
about her poetry and her plans

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.980
for the next year
as Poet Laureate.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.390
I'm very happy that all
of you could be with us

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.890
for this special
evening, so please join me

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.960
in welcoming our United States
Poet Laureate, Tracy K. Smith.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.760
Thank you.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:04.430
[ Applause ]

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.550
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Thank you.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.960
Good evening.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.560
It's such a delight and
an honor to be back here

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.420
in this wonderful,
wonderful building.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.970
I wanted to talk about why
poetry feels so important

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.640
to me now and a little
bit about, you know,

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.950
what taking this sense of
mission into other parts

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.000
of the U.S. has felt like.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.660
And I look forward to
continuing that conversation

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.460
with Ron Charles the
second half of the program.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.810
Poetry is not the
language we live in.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.840
It's not the language of our
day-to-day errand running

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.160
and obligation fulfilling,
not the language

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.880
with which we are asked

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.580
to justify ourselves
to the outside world.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.890
It certainly isn't the language

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.480
to which commercial
value has been assigned.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.190
But poetry, which
awakens our senses,

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.530
frees us from the tyranny
of literal meaning,

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.920
and assures of the credible
reality of emotional truth,

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.360
puts us in touch with
something bigger than language,

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.950
something I believe each
of us was perhaps fluent

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.530
in before the moment

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.810
when language became our
chief vehicle for meaning.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.540
Before I go any farther, let
me say that this lecture,

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.740
like the poetry I
write, is the product

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:54.130
of a particular imagination, one
as informed by belief in a vast

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.080
and mysterious, and yet
orderly and purposeful,

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.580
universe as by a deep
curiosity about the voices

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.360
and lives of strangers.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.080
Furthermore, I'm
operating on the notion

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.950
that poetry can save
me from disappearing

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.740
into the narrow version
of myself I may be tempted

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.870
to resort to when I
feel lazy or defeated,

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.260
or when my greedy
ego takes over.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.690
I'm operating on the belief
that poetry can restore me

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.600
to the large original
self I haven't

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.780
yet fully learned to recognize.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.660
Poets have different
names for that self.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.380
Stanley Kunitz called it
a, quote, "pool of energy

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.770
that has nothing to do
with personal identity,

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.690
but that falls away from self,

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.630
blends into the natural
universe."

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.020
Emerson believed it lived in the
same place the inner voice does,

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.960
and that it had access to
the large whole of which each

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.090
of us are but small parts, what
he called the oversoul, quote,

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.870
"the silence, the
universal beauty."

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.050
Elizabeth Bishop's
view of such oneness,

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.230
at least in her famous
poem, "In the Waiting Room,"

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:21.090
is less consoling, "Suddenly,
from inside came an oh of pain,

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:26.490
Aunt Consuelo's voice,
not very loud or long.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.820
I wasn't at all surprised.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.580
Even then, I knew she was
a foolish, timid woman.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.740
I might have been
embarrassed, but wasn't.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.690
What took me completely by
surprise was that it was me,

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.440
my voice, in my mouth.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.550
Without thinking at all,
I was my foolish aunt.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.960
I -- we were falling, falling."

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.860
One of poetry's great effects,

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.080
through its emphasis upon
feeling, association, music,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.030
and image -- things we
recognize and respond

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.670
to even before we
understand why --

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.290
is to guide us toward the part
of ourselves so deeply buried

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.120
that it borders upon
the collective.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.250
Now I feel strongly about
poetry for what it offers

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:23.120
in these terms, but I also, more
and more, recognize its value

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.770
as a remedy to the
various things

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:30.510
that have bombarded our lines
of sight and our thought space,

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.740
and that tamper with our
ability, or even our desire,

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.420
to listen to that
deeply-rooted part of ourselves.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:43.260
I'm talking about the many
products, services, networks,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:49.370
trends, apps, tools, toys, as
well as the drugs and devices

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.700
for remedying their effects,
that are pitched at us nonstop

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:58.500
in our browser sidebars, in
the pages of print media,

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:03.200
embedded in movies and TV
shows, on airplanes, and taxis,

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.080
and trains, and even
toilet stalls.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:11.860
I guess more and more, I see the
technology we live listening for

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:16.820
and peering into as the primary
and most effective vehicle

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.840
of that sales pitch, so
much so that I now wonder

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:25.630
which came first, the device, or
whatever the device is urging us

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.470
to click on and pay for?

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:33.150
The glib, facile, simplistic,
and prefabricated language

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:37.470
by which we as consumers are
constantly surrounded is a

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:42.810
language that flatters us, that
urges us to indulge ourselves,

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:47.490
to get away from it all,
to be unique by opting in,

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:51.240
talking back, liking us on
Facebook, leaving a review,

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.490
sharing, retweeting, etcetera.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:58.840
It's a self so smooth that
its terms have infiltrated the

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:03.920
language of other facets of
daily life, that of education --

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.740
Rate Your Professor -- does
she make the material relatable

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.750
and easily digestible?

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.230
Or did you have to work
to learn something?

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.050
[Laughter] What are the job
outcomes and earning potentials

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:20.050
of your intended major?

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:24.350
Individual selfhood has
taken on a different tenor.

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:27.060
We brand ourselves.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.810
What an awful herb, aligned
as it is with the practice

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:34.790
of burning the owner's
initials into flesh.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:38.760
We vie for followers
on social media.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:43.600
We turn our experience into
content that can be assimilated

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.200
and liked quickly
and reassuringly

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.420
by others in our network.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:52.140
Friendship is different
now, too.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:56.520
We have allowed conversation
to be splintered and atomized

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.270
by the devices we invite to
interrupt and distract us.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:04.810
We aren't listening to what
or whom we think we are.

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:08.540
I go so far as to say
that much of the time,

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.800
perhaps as an unconscious
comping mechanism,

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.850
we aren't listening at
all, not to other people,

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.380
and least of all, to ourselves.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.070
We can't afford to.

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:23.130
What does this have
to do with poetry?

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:27.890
Well, as a writer, I'm convinced
that one of the only defenses

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:31.890
against the degradations of
our market-driven culture is

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:35.780
to cleave to language
that fosters humility,

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:39.690
awareness of complexity,
commitment to the lives

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:43.710
of others, and a
resistance to the overly-easy

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.000
and the patently false.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.350
Poetry is one vehicle for this
humanizing, reanimating version

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.660
of language, because
the features

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:58.460
of a poem insist upon a
different values system.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:02.610
Rather than numbing or drowning
out the difficult-to-describe

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:07.000
but urgently-sensed feelings
that are part of being human,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.200
poetry invites us to tease them
out, to draw them into language

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:17.290
that is rooted in intricate
thought and strange impulse.

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:20.520
Rather than putting up a
buffer between ourselves

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.670
and those outside our immediate
sphere, poems devise means

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:30.580
to contemplate those others and
to take in their perspectives.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.380
Rather than solving,
side-stepping,

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.630
or denying problems,
poems bear witness

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.680
to dark facets of experience.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.940
They give us vocabulary for the
terror, the shame, the regret,

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.580
as well as the terms
of hope resulting

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.170
from the choices we make
and those we consent to.

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.910
In other words, poems
say, "Hey, come here,

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.600
let me tell you what
it was like."

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.650
And they ask us to submit to
another experience of reality.

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:07.820
They disorient us from our home
base, and they teach us to admit

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:11.320
and submit to the
feeling of vulnerability,

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:16.100
to act upon empathy and
curiosity, and to follow along,

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:21.520
allowing sense to accrue at its
own pace and upon its own terms.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:25.660
If you do that enough times
with a poem, you might begin

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.940
to think differently
about actual strangers.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.550
You might also begin
to recognize

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.910
that there are new
possibilities of feeling

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:36.260
and awareness available to you,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.120
ones that take you far
beyond those pitched to you

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.090
by the marketing teams, the
corporations whose products are,

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:47.030
at the moment, enjoying
a good run.

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:51.280
In case I haven't
said it clearly,

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.220
the language circulating
upon the surface

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:59.260
of the 21st century is in the
business of pulling us away

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:03.430
from the interior, the
reflective, the singular,

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:07.530
the impractical, and
the unsummarizable.

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:09.650
In such a current, the language

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:13.630
of poetry is a
radically-rehumanizing force,

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:17.910
because it is one of the only
generally-accessible languages

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:20.190
that rewards us for
naming things

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:23.610
in their realness
and their complexity.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.600
And despite what social
media would have us believe,

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:31.150
it is not the language of
sharing and following or buying

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.300
and wearing, but rather,
that of bearing deep

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.780
and unabashed witness to
the urgencies and upheavals

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:43.140
of lived experience that
comes closest to brining us

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:48.810
into visceral proximity with
the lives and plights of others.

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:52.250
That's not just distraction,
and it's not a luxury.

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:55.640
It's a means of
self-preservation,

00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:00.230
a way of affirming commitment
to the belief that our lives can

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:04.430
and should matter to one
another and to ourselves.

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:07.780
So this might be a
good time for a poem.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:15.010
Can we listen to Laura Kasischke
read her poem "Heart/Mind"?

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:19.070
&gt;&gt; "Heart/Mind," A bear
batting at a beehive,

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:21.900
how clumsy the mind
always was with the heart,

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.180
wanting what it wanted.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.870
The blizzard's accountant.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:29.310
How timidly the heart approached
the business of the mind,

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.490
counting what it counted.

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:34.240
Light inside a cage,
the way the heart.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.590
Bird trapped in an
airport, the way the mind.

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:40.720
How it flashed in the floor of
the phone booths, my last dime.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.650
And this letter I didn't send,
how surprising to find it now,

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:50.570
all this love I must have felt."

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:51.870
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: I
love how that sounds

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:54.900
like a landline phone
call from long distance.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.750
And sometimes maybe
that's what poems are like,

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:01.140
they return us even
just to the recent past

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:03.710
that feels so remote and real.

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:08.580
I think any successful poem
teaches you how to read it --

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:10.340
in this case, hear it.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:15.230
And Laura Kasischke's poem
"Heart/Mind" provides a roadmap

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.900
to that process,
beginning with the title.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:22.370
You don't have it in front
of you, but heart slash mind.

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:24.730
So the first thing a
reader might ask is what is

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.410
that slash meant to signal?

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:32.300
Is the poem called
heart slash mind?

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.940
Is it heart mind?

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:40.110
Or as a participant in a
conversation that I had recently

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:42.770
at a men's addiction
rehabilitation center

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:48.060
in Kentucky pointed out,
perhaps it is heart over mind,

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.660
an emotional reversal

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.600
of the common notion
of mind over matter.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.840
So the poem invites you
to question and theorize,

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:01.260
and then it begins to tell
you what it thinks of itself.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:05.960
In this poem, the early stanzas
-- I'm going to repeat them --

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.270
with metaphors that
unfold into concrete

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:14.010
and surprising visceral examples
over the span of a few lines,

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:16.890
they set up a pattern
that becomes useful

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:21.340
to the reader once the poem
becomes more spare and gestural.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:24.210
So I'll read the first
few stanzas again.

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:31.400
"A bear batting at a beehive,
how clumsy the mind always was

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:35.970
with the heart, wanting
what it wanted.

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:38.560
The blizzard's accountant.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:43.620
How timidly the heart approached
the business of the mind,

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.870
counting what it counted."

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.430
I love what happens when
I get these strange images

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:52.350
that give me an intense,
you know, like feeling.

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:53.970
"A bear batting at a beehive."

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:55.900
Not only do we have all
those really fun Bs,

00:16:55.900 --> 00:17:02.270
but you have an image of
this big animal angrily

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:04.130
and hungrily swatting
at something.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.160
And you have a sense of danger
on both sides of the equation,

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.940
threat and counterthreat.

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:14.130
So the poem begins
with this strange sense

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:16.340
of fraught balance.

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:21.620
And then "How clumsy," which
characterizes that bear.

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:25.150
So it's not such a threat,
it's just ham-fisted.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:28.980
"How clumsy the mind
always was with the heart."

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.190
And suddenly, the
heart is the hive.

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.840
There's something in
there that is wanted

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.630
and also worth protecting.

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:37.150
"Wanting what it wanted."

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:40.290
So those first four lines of
the poem guide you into a sense

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:43.730
of all of the potential
registers of emotion

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:47.500
that are making this
metaphor happen.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.340
And the second -- or the
third stanza, rather,

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:52.420
does the same thing, "The
blizzard's accountant."

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.730
Now I don't have a
way of picturing that.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:57.810
I'm already kind
of like on alert

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:01.400
from having had some senses
activated by the first metaphor,

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.490
but I've got to let this next
stanza show me what to see.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:08.640
"How timidly" -- okay,
maybe that's the accountant

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.930
in the stanza -- "How timidly
the heart approaches the

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:13.230
business of the mind."

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:17.450
Of course, what kind of math
would suffice in the face

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:20.080
of a blizzard's worth of snow?

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:25.450
And yet, "Counting what it
counted," the heart persists.

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:31.290
By the time in the poem
that we reach the lines,

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:35.360
"Light inside a cage,
the way the heart" --

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:41.350
which ends with a dash --
"Bird trapped in an airport,

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:44.570
the way the mind," dash,

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:48.380
we can instinctively see
the little drama that is

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:51.110
to be played out in
our imaginations.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:53.990
Those lines become a
shorthand for a process

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:58.690
that we are now educated and
equipped to complete on our own.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:01.840
Yet, even having taught us how
to work with what we've come

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:06.120
to expect, the poem still
manages to surprise us.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.420
I love this.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:11.060
I think every poem -- every
fully-realized poem finds a way

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.970
to surprise its reader.

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:15.190
Moreover, as a poet,
I understand

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:18.660
that a poem is only
finished, only fully-realized,

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.240
if it succeeds in alerting me

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.030
to something I couldn't
have been capable of seeing

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:26.590
at the outset, something
I couldn't have known

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:30.650
to say were it not for all of
the things that the process

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:33.850
of writing the poem
has led me to say.

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:36.270
Kasischke's poem moves
through images of the heart

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:40.270
as an indomitable beacon,
something uncageable,

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:42.640
and then the image of
the mind as trapped,

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.910
bumping up against invisible
barriers, forever barred

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:47.720
from where it seeks to go.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:51.580
And then she leaps from there
to the sense of frustration

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:56.090
and desperation in that image
of the last dime on the mucky,

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:58.870
disgusting phonebooth floor.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:03.220
Speaking of technology,
let me concede

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.520
that there are some things

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.540
that have definitely
been improved upon.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.630
All of the visceral feelings
that the poem draws upon

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:14.950
from its very opening
work to invest its arrival

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:17.710
with a palpably-felt urgency.

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:20.900
I don't believe it was a plan,
something outlined and plotted

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.060
from the start, but rather than
moving through the register

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:28.320
of those different distinct
feelings created the momentum

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.960
that pulled Kasischke to
the poem's closure which,

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.480
incidentally, resists metaphor.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:39.820
Perhaps by now, the poem is free
from the need for corollaries,

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.370
invested as it is
in the confluence

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:44.250
of newly-activated feelings.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.350
These are the final
lines of the poem,

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:53.200
"This letter I didn't send,
how surprising to find it now,

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.820
all this love I must have felt."

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.820
And how does this poem
speak to my concerns

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.420
about market-driven language?

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:06.890
Well, I think about it this
way, we don't read poems only

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:09.310
for the rhetorical
stance they take

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:13.310
or for the arguments they
may actively or subtly make

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:15.990
about their conscious material.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:19.580
We also -- and I'd
argue mostly --

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.680
read the for how they
direct our attention in ways

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.190
that are antithetical
to mere utility.

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:30.390
In "Heart/Mind," Laura Kasischke
is no making editorial-like

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:35.190
claims against the language of
the marketplace or of commodity,

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:39.220
but in urging us to think
and respond as it does,

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.740
the poem persuasively
unsettles the unthinking

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:47.000
or automatic ways we
often experience content,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.600
language, and narrative.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.200
It is in this manner that this

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:56.140
and other poems invite our
dissatisfaction with the view

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.670
of the world as a place
mad up mostly of resources

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:02.020
to exhaust or consume.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.470
Let's listen to another poem.

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:13.450
This is called "Music from
Childhood" by John Yau.

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:21.910
&gt;&gt; "Music from Childhood," You
grow up hearing two languages.

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:24.970
Neither fits your fits.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:29.890
Your mother informs you moon
means window to another world.

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:34.720
You being to hear words mourn
the sounds buried inside

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.650
their mouths.

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:40.950
A row of yellow windows
and a painting of them.

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:45.420
Your mother informs you moon
means window to another world.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:50.540
You decide it is better to step
back and sit in the shadows.

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:54.840
A row of yellow windows
and a painting of them.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:01.170
Someone said you can see a blue
pagoda or a red rocket ship.

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:06.570
You decide it is better to step
back and sit in the shadows.

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:11.760
Is it because you saw a black
asteroid fly past your window?

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:17.850
Someone said you can see a blue
pagoda or a red rocket ship.

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:20.630
I tried to follow
in your footsteps,

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.710
but they turned to water.

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:29.370
Is it because I saw a black
asteroid fly past my window?

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:33.710
The air hums -- a circus
performer riding a bicycle

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:35.440
toward the ceiling.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.670
I tried to follow
in your footsteps,

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:41.090
but they turned to water.

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:46.150
The town has started sinking
back into its commercial.

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:51.270
The air hums -- a circus
performer riding a bicycle

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:52.570
toward the ceiling.

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:56.850
You grow up hearing
two languages.

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:59.390
Neither fits your fits.

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:04.100
The town has started sinking
back into its commercial.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:08.820
You begin to hear words mourn
the sounds buried inside

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.120
their mouths.

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:16.550
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: So this
poem behaves quite differently.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:22.920
Firstly, you probably noticed
a little bit of repetition.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:26.090
Not enough to make you confident
of a pattern that you were going

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:27.780
to be able to anticipate.

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:31.140
So this poem is a pantoum,
which means the second

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:37.540
and fourth lines of the poem
occur further down, only once.

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:40.260
And then the next
stanza, the lines that sit

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.000
in that place will
occur further down.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.060
And so it creates this sense
of eerie deja vu a little bit.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.210
It's almost like you're
being gaslighted --

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:50.510
do -- did I hear that?

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:51.810
Do I know that?

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:53.800
How do I know that?

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.100
-- which I think serves some

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.290
of the other behavior
in this poem, right.

00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:02.000
You probably notice there are
statements that don't finish,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.480
and there are shifting pronouns.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.870
There's a you that's
being addressed that seems

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.580
like may be the speaker
talking to himself.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:12.960
Then later, that you seems
to become a specific person,

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.200
"I tried to follow
in your footsteps,

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.000
but they turned to water."

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.250
There are visual
images in the poem.

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:23.050
There's a sense of place.

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:26.640
But none of it feels anchored

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.330
so that I could confidently
say these are the terms

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:32.100
of this person's life.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:36.200
What I do feel confident of is
what seems to accrue emotionally

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.590
through the poem, this sense
of searching, of turning back,

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:45.400
or recalling something
that's partially clear.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:50.730
There's even an interesting
way that some of the --

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:52.690
you don't have the line
breaks in front of you,

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:55.770
so you have to trust
me -- but the lines --

00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:58.130
you know, one line leads
into another in a way

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:00.850
that almost feels
linear and logical,

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:02.400
and then something shifts.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:06.500
So in the second stanza of
the poem, this beautiful line,

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:11.060
"You begin to hear words
mourn the sounds buried inside

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:12.580
their mouths."

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:18.790
I can't tell you exactly what
that means, but mourn, sounds,

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:22.330
buried, mouths creates a kind
of authority for the line

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.650
that I'm going to dell
upon a little bit more.

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:28.190
And I think of loss, I think
of language and voices.

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:32.090
But then the next line -- so
"Buried inside their mouths.

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:34.830
A row of yellow" -- and
maybe this is just me,

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:37.790
but after mouths, and I see "a
row of yellow," I think, "Okay,

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:40.690
maybe teeth or something
is what I'll see next."

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:42.980
But now, "A row of
yellow windows,

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:44.280
and a painting of them."

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.520
So suddenly we go from
this almost philosophical,

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:52.320
mournful perspective to
a shifted gaze of looking

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.900
out -- maybe looking out.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.050
Maybe it's just a
painting of someone --

00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:59.040
something that is
looked out upon.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:03.920
So it's a poem that's not
going to guide you by the hand,

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.530
but if you surrender to it,

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:08.130
you get to feel many
different things.

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:12.450
I come away from this poem
thinking about maybe someone

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:14.630
who really did grow up
in a household with more

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:19.050
than one language, but I also
feel the sense of interiority

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:23.440
and privacy that's so active
in this poem that I feel

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:27.690
that any person anywhere
is living in two languages,

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:29.700
the language of the
self and the language

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.360
that comes from outside.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.800
I shared this poem at Cannon
Air Force base in Clovis,

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:39.660
New Mexico with men and women
enlisted in the Air Force,

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:43.620
and airbase employees,
and military spouses.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.860
So it's the kind of poem, as
I mentioned, that requires you

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:49.470
to let go of that wish
for linear narrative

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:54.310
and respond instead to the
tone, the accrual of images,

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:55.970
to the almost haunting effects

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:59.220
of hearing every line
repeated once and no more.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.310
I asked what people noticed.

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:05.460
That's the question I ask
the students in my classrooms

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:06.930
as well as the audience members

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:10.280
who have attended readings
I've given in rural communities

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.480
in New Mexico, South
Carolina, and Kentucky

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.920
over the last several months.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:19.610
And just ask with the
Kasischke poem, which in a room

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:23.540
of men working to overcome
addiction activated very

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:27.330
specific memories of struggling
with similar questions of mind

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:32.190
over reason -- or reason
versus feeing or urge,

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:36.310
John Yau's poem reminded airmen
of their time in the service,

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:39.450
of seeking, perhaps, to follow
in the footsteps of a parent

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:41.660
or family member, and
then finding themselves

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.370
in their own lives,
lost at times

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:47.450
without a clear model or guide.

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:50.400
The poem, with its
sense of rootlessness,

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:54.010
of struggle to make sense
of disparate languages,

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:57.520
also reminded people of
displacement, the kind one feels

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.770
in childhood or adolescence,

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:03.370
as well as the kind one feels
upon being deployed say,

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:05.860
or being uprooted
again and again

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:08.150
by assignments in
different places.

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:11.070
One audience member spoke
about the occasional feelings

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:16.090
of social or racial isolation he
sometimes feels in the service.

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:18.600
Just as none of the addicts
felt the need to argue

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:22.230
that Kasischke's poem
is about addiction,

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:25.870
nobody at the men's rehab
center felt the need

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:29.100
to say Yau's is a
poem about being --

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:33.050
I'm sorry, nobody at Cannon Air
Force Base felt the need to say

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:37.360
that Yau's is a poem about
being in the armed forces.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.310
But in both cases, the
poems afforded listeners

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:45.400
with new images, new metaphors,
and new vocabularies for living

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:50.600
with the feelings indigenous to
their lives, whoever they were.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.680
That's one of the
remarkable things poems do,

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.320
one of the ways poems
lead us first more deeply

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:01.560
into ourselves, and then more
naturally toward the areas

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.680
of common feeling we
share with others.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.590
That's how poems teach us to
recognize that there are forms

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:11.000
of community that exist
across or in spite

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.800
of the obvious dividing lines
we're taught to respect.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:20.070
My rural outreach project,
even in just three pilot trips,

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:25.010
has awakened a belief
in the real possibility

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:28.420
that we might learn to
become open to participation

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:32.560
in real-time communities
forged along varied

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.750
and sometimes unlikely lines.

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:38.440
And it's urged a powerful
submission to feelings

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:44.270
of shared vulnerability,
humility, doubt, and trust.

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:46.870
It's been a privilege to
share my own work and the work

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:49.930
of other contemporary
poets with strangers --

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:54.310
strangers that crowd-sourcing
algorithms tell me I ought

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:57.190
to have nothing in
common with --

00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:00.670
and to hear people say
things like, "I'm white.

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:01.970
You're black.

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:03.270
I'm from this place.

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:04.630
You're from another.

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:06.800
And yet, when you talk
about your father,

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.520
you restore my own
father to me."

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.230
This happens again and
again, though the vocabulary

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:14.110
for connection is
different from person

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:16.630
to person and poem to poem.

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:20.490
I think my interest in such
a project is an extension

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:23.940
of my own belief or
wish that Americans

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:27.350
of all backgrounds might
have something quietly urgent

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:29.850
and humanizing to
offer one another.

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:32.470
But in order to get to it, we
have to turn down the volume

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:36.340
on all the many sources
seeking to sell us on the notion

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:40.480
of an unmendable divide, because
that's what they're doing.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:45.170
They're selling us on a
product, which is strife.

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:50.740
In order to get to community,
we have to go quiet, slow down,

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:54.520
allow ourselves to be
both vulnerable and brave,

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.760
and approach one another with
an idea as simple as, "I'm me.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.060
You're you.

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:01.360
We're not the same.

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.530
And yet, perhaps we can feel
safe here together talking abut

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:07.920
something as simple as a poem."

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:12.610
Poems encourage the notion that
your life must be as important

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:16.330
to you as mine is to me.

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:19.240
And they encourage the
more difficult notion

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:22.940
that your life must
be as important to me

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:27.100
as my own life is, that
I can only truly honor

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:31.860
and protect myself by
honoring and protecting you.

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:35.080
Now maybe that last
bit is a distant dream,

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.420
the purview of a few great poets

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:41.060
and philosophers,
but I hope it isn't.

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:44.620
Either way, I believe that
poetry helps bridge the gap

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:50.130
between self-centeredness, and
tribalism, and true compassion.

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:51.690
Poems do this in myriad ways.

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:56.680
One of them is by helping to
inoculate us against the catchy,

00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:00.090

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:48.590
I think it has to do with
fear, because the question

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:52.770
that often follows that
is why is it so hard?

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:54.070
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:57.700
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: And
I think, you know, it --

00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.730
part of it probably
has to do with the way

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:03.950
that we're taught to,
you know, want to be able

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:07.290
to summarize things, prove
that we've comprehended,

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:09.900
demonstrate our knowledge
and expertise.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.960
Part of it, I think,
has to do with the way

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.040
that tests produce
a lot of anxiety.

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.640
And so we think, "This
poem is out to get me."

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:17.940
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:19.890
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Some of it
has to do with a question --

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:24.220
that awful question
that many people ask,

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:26.280
"What do you think this
poem is trying to say?"

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:28.880
Do you know what it would mean

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.340
to America's high
school students

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:33.640
to see the Poet Laureate of
the United States stand there

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:39.050
and say, "I don't know
exactly what that means"?

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.130
It's such a rebuke
of 1000 horrible high

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:44.620
school experiences.

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:51.880
Yeah, the position of the
Poet Laureate is tantalizingly

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.490
undefined, isn't it?

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:54.960
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: It is.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.550
Yeah, which is a kind
of freedom, you know.

00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:58.850
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And terror.

00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:01.340
I mean, it's a strange position.

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:03.560
It's [inaudible] and funded
by the federal government,

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.230
but not officially answerable
to the federal government.

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:08.410
You don't have to write a poem
for Donald Trump's birthday

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:11.510
or any other occasional
things like that.

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:18.670
[ Laughter ]

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:19.970
He's not here, is he?

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:24.380
[Laughter] What inspired
you to go

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:27.270
on the road with this project?

00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:35.220
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: I had this
wish to test out this idea

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:38.160
that if we can stop trying

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:43.630
to tell ourselves what other
people think, and just talk,

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:49.780
we can maybe find ourselves not
yelling, not, you know, enraged,

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:51.560
and maybe hearing
something that's useful

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:55.210
and that resonates somehow.

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:58.500
I grew up going to church,
and I remember feeling that.

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.750
I remember feeling,
"I love these people.

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:03.940
I see them, but I don't agree
with them on everything.

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:06.270
And yet, somehow this is
a community that works."

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:09.180
And I think families
are like that, too.

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:11.720
And so why can't a
nation be like that?

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.270
So I had this fantasy
that poetry could be one

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:18.200
of these topics that urges
us to be quiet and, you know,

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.170
all of the adjectives
that I talked about.

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:25.420
And I said that, "I wonder if it
would be possible to, you know,

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:28.950
go out there and say something
meaningful to each other

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:30.810
through the vehicle
of this artform?

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:34.190
And then the opportunity
presented itself.

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:35.960
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Why did
you focus on rural areas?

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:39.330
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Well, as a
writer, I spend most of my time

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:42.710
in -- you know, going to
cities or college towns.

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:45.710
And then I feel like
there's this tendency

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:50.720
to divide our sense of what
America is into two regions.

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.560
I mean, it's silly because
it's such a big place.

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:56.620
But we have, you know,
the urban, coastal region,

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:59.750
and then the rural center.

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:05.360
And so I thought, "Well, I spend
a lot of time in these urban,

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:08.110
coastal places -- or
places where people

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:12.040
who will soon graduate from a
college will probably go to."

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.340
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.010
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: "So
why not see what happens

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:18.440
if I can cross that
line somehow."

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.320
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And when you
went to these towns, who came?

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.530
Were they, you know,
beret-wearing hipsters?

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:24.240
Or were they people
that surprised you?

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:27.230
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Well, some
of the towns are so small

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:29.190
that it was people
who were aware

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:32.310
that an event was happening,
and that's something

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:34.250
that doesn't usually happen.

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:35.550
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Nice.

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:39.050
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: So a
pretty healthy cross-section.

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:44.330
When we were in South
Carolina, the locations

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:48.710
that Representative Clyburn
had kind of curated for us --

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:52.060
because he was excited
to sort of take ownership

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:55.340
of his district -- were
connected historically.

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:58.270
They had a strong
sense of participation

00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:00.010
in the Civil Rights Movement.

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:04.240
And I think that meant
that many of the people

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:07.260
who came were members
of a black church

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:09.890
that we visited, and they came.

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:14.420
There were alumni and community
members of the school --

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.360
Old Summerton High School,
which was one of the schools

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:18.810
that was desegregated
during the group of suits

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:20.480
around the Brown v.
Board of Education.

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.350
So there were members of that
graduating class who came.

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:26.670
Many people in those communities
came out because they said, "Oh,

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:28.310
there's a black woman
doing something

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:29.610
on this national scale.

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:33.450
I want my kids who are
black to see this."

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:38.920
Similar thing happened, but in
the opposite terms when I was

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:43.470
in another community -- it will
come to me sometime tonight.

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:46.820
That's the problem with
doing things so quickly --

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:48.450
where it was a white
family who said,

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:50.710
"We live in a town that's
really racially divided,

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:54.210
and I want my kids to be
able to cross that line.

00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:55.790
So I want them to come here
and hear what you have to say."

00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:58.020
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Just coming
is a crossing of barriers.

00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:00.020
Did you get responses
that surprised you,

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:01.560
that you hadn't expected at all?

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.830
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Well, I
don't know what I was expecting.

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:08.560
I was like a little
bit just curious.

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.580
So anything felt useful.

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:14.680
There were people
who wrote poetry,

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:17.340
who in some places said,
"I'll read a poem."

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.720
You know, so we have
some great recordings.

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.550
Not here tonight, but of people
saying, "Here's a chance.

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:23.850
I'm going to read a poem."

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:25.490
There was someone at Cannon
Air Force Base who said,

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:28.630
"I write poems in
this secret journal

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:30.660
that I don't want
anybody to see,

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:32.420
but I'll read you a couple now."

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:35.130
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Wow.

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:39.310
You read a variety of poems, not
just your own -- other people's.

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:42.000
What kinds of poems
went over well?

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.110
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Well, the two
that I shared tonight are two

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:45.540
that I've read before.

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:49.430
And I felt like going over
well means people, you know,

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:52.240
listen and have theories about
the poem, or even just want

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:54.030
to talk about what the
poems remind them of.

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:55.330
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:56.630
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: So those --

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:57.930
and there are two others

00:40:57.930 --> 00:40:59.250
that like perhaps
we'll hear tonight --

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:00.550
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes, we will.

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:02.250
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: -- that are
-- behave in different ways.

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:04.030
You know, one that
goes back to childhood

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:08.540
and narrates a somewhat-familiar
experience, and then aligns it,

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:11.760
I think, with a larger sense.

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.030
And another that's
a family story

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:20.050
about addiction within a family.

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:25.400
Yeah, people are -- if they
know I'm bot going to test them,

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.360
if they know that I -- and this
is something that I kind of go

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.770
out of my way to say
is I'm just curious.

00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:33.010
This is what I say
to my students.

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:34.310
What do you notice?

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:36.750
Anything that you notice
is useful and valuable

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:40.170
to talk about, maybe it will
activate somebody else's feeling

00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:42.120
of something else
that they noticed.

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.420
So just let's hear it.

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:46.820
Maybe it's because
it's a community

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:48.120
where people know each other,

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.550
but there hasn't been
a sense of timidity.

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:51.580
People -- so in some ways,

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:53.650
most of the poems I've
gone over because --

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:54.950
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's great.

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:56.250
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: --

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:57.550
people have kind of
wanted to talk about them.

00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:58.850
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's --

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:00.150
now you have a new
collection coming out,

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:01.450
"Wade in the Water,"
next Tuesday?

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:02.750
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: It's out.

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:04.050
It's been out for a
couple of Tuesdays.

00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:05.350
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Tuesdays?

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:06.650
Okay. It's a beautiful
collection.

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:11.900
I wonder if you'd read
the title poem for us?

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:13.200
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Sure.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.500
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: On page 15.

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.300
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Thanks.

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:19.090
[ Laughter ]

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:21.720
So this poem narrates
an encounter.

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.580
I hope it's somewhat clear,

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:26.330
but I'll tell you I
attended a ring shout,

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:29.380
and that's where this
scene that occupies most

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:31.090
of the poem took place.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:36.570
"Wade in the Water" for the
Geechee Gullah Ring Shouters.

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:39.520
One of the women greeted me.

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.900
"I love you," she said.

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:45.190
She didn't know me,
but I believed her,

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:51.260
and a terrible new ache rolled
over in my chest like in a room

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:55.230
where the drapes
have been swept back.

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:58.800
"I love you, I love
you," as she continued

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.930
down the hall past
other strangers,

00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:06.760
each feeling pierced suddenly
by pillars of heavy light.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:09.680
I love you, throughout
the performance,

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.500
in every hand clap, every stomp.

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:19.750
I love you in the rusted iron
chains someone was made to drag

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:24.130
until love let them be
unclasped and left empty

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:26.870
in the center of the ring.

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:31.680
I love you in the water
where they pretended to wade,

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:35.360
singing that old blood-deep
song that dragged us

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:38.600
to those banks and cast us in.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:39.950
I love you.

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:43.580
The angles of it
scraping at each throat,

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:47.990
shouldering past the swirling
dust motes in those beams

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:53.550
of light, that whatever we now
knew we could let ourselves feel

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:56.260
knew to climb.

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:58.940
Oh, woods.

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:03.590
Oh, dog. Oh, tree.

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:09.610
Oh, gun. Oh, girl, run.

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:14.150
Oh, miraculous many gone.

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:17.950
Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord.

00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:24.320
Oh, Lord, is this love
the trouble you promised?

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:30.670
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What
does it mean in this poem

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:35.490
to say I love you to a stranger,
which seems so much at the heart

00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:37.700
of what you're talking about?

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.540
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Well, that's
the question that set that poem

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:42.940
into motion, because someone
did greet me and say that,

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:47.350
and it felt like such a gift,
and it hurt at the same time.

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:50.380
And it allowed so
much to come out --

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:52.070
so many conflicting feelings.

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:53.430
And --

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:55.860
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And not because
you doubted here sincerity?

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:57.160
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: No,
I didn't, actually.

00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.850
She -- I could have,
because she said it

00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:01.010
to every single person
that she met.

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:02.340
But there was no doubting it.

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:03.640
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No.

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:04.940
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: It was like a
really genuine, beautiful thing.

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:06.240
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.540
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: You
know, vulnerable-making

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:09.270
for both people gesture.

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:11.860
And so I wanted to just go
back to that and try and figure

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:15.630
out what -- where that came
from and what it had given me.

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:18.710
I don't know what it means, but
I have a feeling that we kind

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:20.110
of need to learn what it means.

00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:21.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:22.710
Yes, in these times.

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:24.010
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Yeah.

00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:25.310
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What does
it mean to be Poet Laureate

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:28.020
in these contentious times when
everything from what's decent

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:32.510
to what's science is a
matter of such hot debate?

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:38.070
[ Laughter ]

00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:41.600
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Well, I
feel like it's added urgency

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:46.690
to my belief that we are better
when we're more attentive,

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:51.190
when we can sort of say,
"I'm not going to accept this

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:55.060
like word package without
parsing it and testing its

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:58.080
like validity in whatever
terms that are valid, you know,

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.880
like emotional or otherwise.

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:07.470
And I've got to move -- I'll
be better equipped to just be

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:09.140
in this world if I'm
willing to move away

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:10.900
from what I'm certain of --

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:12.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.500
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: --
and say there's got

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.580
to be something I
can stand to learn,

00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:19.820
got to be something I don't
recognize about myself

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:23.290
that could somehow, if
I can face it, help.

00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:26.850
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Your example is
quite different than the role

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:29.520
that many writers are
playing in this era,

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.590
which is to be very
political -- very political.

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:35.120
You're being political
in a very different way

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:38.110
that I think is really
provocative.

00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:39.910
Last year you said
in an interview,

00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:43.590
"Poetry helps me contend
with the smallness of spirit,

00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:46.970
the greed, the dishonest,
the disregard for the lives

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:50.160
of others at the root
of American politics."

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.510
Now fortunately, we've
moved beyond all that.

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:57.150
[ Laughter ]

00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:59.980
In your introduction
to "American Journal,"

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:03.940
which is an anthology you'll
be bringing out this fall,

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:07.230
you say that you, "hope these
poems might make us a little

00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:09.870
less alien to each other."

00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:12.600
That's such a great goal.

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:17.200
How can a poem do that?

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.370
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Well, you
know, it does it in a lot

00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:22.050
of small ways that I
hope add up to something.

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:25.160
One, it says, well, I'm
sitting here in this chair

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.680
where I'm comfortable, and
I'm reading about something

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:32.800
that makes me have to sort
of start from scratch and try

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.350
and understand, because
I want to.

00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:36.660
I want to do that work.

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:37.960
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:39.260
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Oh, this
is something that's connected

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:40.560
to a voice, a theoretical
person.

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:41.860
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:43.800
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Somehow, I'm
moving away from my own sense

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:47.230
of being and into
another person's.

00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:49.490
That -- I do believe
that's good practice.

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:51.000
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right,
modeling the way we should be

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.300
as citizens more.

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:53.600
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Yeah.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:56.320
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Would you
read a poem called "Refuge"?

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.620
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Sure.

00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:59.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In your
new book on page 73.

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:09.850
Can they buy these books
out there in the lobby?

00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:11.150
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:12.790
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay, good.

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:14.590
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith:
Product placement.

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:20.530
[ Laughter ]

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:27.570
"Refuge," Until I can
understand why you fled,

00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:30.280
why you are willing to bleed,

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:34.980
why you deserve what I
must be willing to cede,

00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:39.870
let me imagine you are my
father in Montgomery, Alabama,

00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:44.190
walking to campus rather
than riding the bus.

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:46.270
I know what they call you.

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:50.120
I know what they try to
convince you you lack.

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:55.470
I know your tired ankles, the
sudden thunder of your laugh.

00:48:55.470 --> 00:49:01.360
Until I want to give you what I
myself deserve, let me love you

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:09.050
by loving her, your sister
in a camp in Turkey, 16,

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:11.530
deserving of everything.

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:16.190
Let her be my daughter who
has curled her neat hands

00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:19.550
into fists, insisting
nothing is fair,

00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:22.200
and I have never loved her.

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:29.250
Naomi, lips set in a scowl,
young heart ransacking itself.

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:33.830
Let me lend her passion to
your sister and love her

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:41.080
for her living rage, her need
for more, and now, and all.

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:44.560
Let me leap from sleep
if her voice sounds

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:47.740
out afraid from down the hall.

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:53.870
I have seen men like your father
walking up Harrison Street now

00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:56.110
that the days are
getting longer.

00:49:56.110 --> 00:50:01.380
Let me love them as I loved my
own father whom I phoned once

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:03.760
from a valley in my life

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:09.750
to say what I feared I'd never
adequately said, voice choked,

00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:15.590
stalled, hearing the silence
spread around us like weather.

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:18.830
What would it cost
me to say it now,

00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:21.870
to a stranger's father
walking home

00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:25.300
to our separate lives together?

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:31.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
just a gorgeous poem

00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:34.410
which reenacts the
Golden Rule at the center

00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:35.890
of all the world's
faiths, at the center

00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:37.680
of every ethical system is

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:41.950
that we should feel what
someone else is feeling.

00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:44.550
"Until I understand
you," the poem begins,

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:47.660
which is a pretty
hopeful line, that we will

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:49.960
if we make the effort.

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:52.050
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Or we'll be
like those kids at the table

00:50:52.050 --> 00:50:53.990
like 12:00 after
everyone's to bed still

00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:55.290
with like a couple
Brussels sprouts.

00:50:55.290 --> 00:50:58.810
But either way, there is time.

00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:00.110
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah, that --

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:04.990
it's just such a
poem for this moment.

00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:09.170
We've got a recording of a poem
called "Second Estrangement."

00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:10.720
Can you set that up for us?

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:14.860
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Sure, this
is a poem by Aracelis Girmay,

00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:18.730
a poet who -- it comes from
her most recent collection,

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:21.100
which is called "Black
Mariah," and it's thinking

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:24.670
about the African diaspora in
different parts of the world.

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:27.350
I think those are the
large, thematic questions.

00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:34.490
But more urgent or salient
is the sense of displacement

00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:38.710
that maybe any person
can have field access to.

00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:41.020
So this is a poem
that kind of builds

00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:46.240
that in these really familiar
and very visceral terms.

00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:54.760
&gt;&gt; "Second Estrangement," Please
raise your hand, whomever else

00:51:54.760 --> 00:52:00.500
of you has been a child,
lost in a market or a mall,

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:04.620
without knowing it at
first, following a stranger,

00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:10.230
accidentally thinking he is
yours -- your family or parent,

00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:15.300
even gabbing for his hands, even
calling the word you said then

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:21.660
for father, only to see the
face look strangely down,

00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:26.630
utterly foreign, utterly
not the one who loves you.

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:30.200
You, who are a bird,
suddenly stunned

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:33.870
by the glass partitions
of rooms.

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:40.420
How far the world you
knew, and tall, and filled,

00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:43.250
finally, with strangers.

00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:47.530
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What I
love about that poem is

00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:52.830
that it reenacts that sense of
alienation and fear in a way

00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:55.260
that makes us feel
like everyone else.

00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:57.790
It overcomes the very
problem it enacts,

00:52:57.790 --> 00:52:59.790
which is incredibly clever.

00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:01.150
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: I love
the way it kind of guides you

00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:03.100
into that, too, because
you don't know that's

00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:04.400
where you're going.

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.610
I mean, the title might
alert you to something,

00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:09.350
but it's also "Second
Estrangement."

00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:12.640
But it begins, "Please
raise your hand."

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.560
I think that's the first line.

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:16.210
And I -- you know,
I'm a good student.

00:53:16.210 --> 00:53:17.510
I want to do it.

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:20.620
And then, you know,
"Whoever else among you."

00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:24.600
And then we descend step by step
into this feeling of, you know,

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:26.760
first you're just
alone in a mall.

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:28.060
Or then you're lost.

00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:29.560
And then you're without
this person.

00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:32.150
And then we realize, you know,
there's a private language,

00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:35.710
"The word you used
then for father."

00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:38.320
Again, it almost could behave
like that John Yau poem.

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:40.010
Maybe there's a real
language barrier,

00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:43.190
or maybe it's just I'm
not at home anymore.

00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:46.150
And that image of the bird --

00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:49.280
birds in the wrong places
come up in poems, I guess.

00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:50.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:51.880
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith:
But it creates

00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:53.200
that feeling of abrupt shock.

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.500
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:56.040
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: And
so all of the, you know,

00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.390
willingness that we
have demonstrated

00:53:58.390 --> 00:54:03.440
to follow this poem leads us to
that same place of being lost,

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.560
and scared, and stuck.

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:07.850
And the poem can sort
of speak to that.

00:54:07.850 --> 00:54:09.810
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And I --
just -- we've all felt that.

00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:12.470
There is a connection.

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:14.370
As much anxiety as
there's been recently

00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:16.520
about the political
contention of our age,

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:18.030
it's not the worst
it's ever been.

00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:20.670
We've got the Civil
War back there.

00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:24.020
And several of your poems
are inspired by the Civil War

00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:27.080
and draw actual text from the
Civil War in fascinating ways.

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:30.390
Can you tell us about that

00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:32.840
and read a poem called
"Declaration"?

00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:34.510
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Sure.

00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:40.290
The Civil War kind of
got drawn into this body

00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:42.040
of work by the Smithsonian.

00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:46.430
I was invited by the National
Portrait Gallery in the year

00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:51.220
that was leading up to the 150th
anniversary of the beginning

00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:54.920
of the Civil War to contribute
a poem for an exhibition.

00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:57.280
There were going to be
portraits and poems.

00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:02.610
And I had to sort of say I
want to do this because I want

00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:06.710
to write a poem, but I don't
know how to make myself want

00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:08.160
to write about the Civil War --

00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:09.460
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:11.290
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: -- which
I've never liked learning about.

00:55:11.290 --> 00:55:14.500
I was talking with another
black writer recently

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:16.560
about how every time we
would get to that moment

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:20.750
in history growing up where it
was slavery and the Civil War,

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:22.950
we as the black kids in
the classroom were made

00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:26.650
to feel ashamed like how could
this have happened to us?

00:55:26.650 --> 00:55:27.950
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:31.130
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: And so I
was conditioned to feel like,

00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:32.430
"Ugh, here we go again."

00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:34.440
But I wanted to do
it, so I said,

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:39.880
"What would black soldiers have
experienced in this conflict?"

00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:42.130
And I found a couple
of really great books

00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:45.140
that just contain all
these primary documents

00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:48.010
that prevented me from
doing what I wanted to do,

00:55:48.010 --> 00:55:50.880
which would be to write
something in my own voice,

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:54.400
and urged me simply to
listen and bring these voices

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.330
into conversation
with each other.

00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:57.740
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What
were these documents?

00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:59.550
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith:
Letters that soldiers

00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:01.360
and their families had
written to each other

00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:03.500
and to Abraham Lincoln.

00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:04.800
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay.

00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:06.270
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: And
depositions that veterans,

00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:08.950
and their widows, and
descendants had given

00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:14.330
after the war, well into the
20th century in an attempt

00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:15.800
to get the pensions that they

00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:17.830
as veterans should
have been entitled to,

00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:20.440
but that they were denied
because, having been born

00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:22.660
into slavery, they didn't
have birth certificates,

00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:23.960
marriage licenses.

00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:26.570
They didn't have anything
attesting to the fact

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:29.190
that they had changed their
names after emancipation.

00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:31.280
And so they got stiffed,
basically.

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:32.750
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh, wow.

00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:34.570
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: So
that's where that came from.

00:56:34.570 --> 00:56:37.090
And then suddenly, this
history felt so alive,

00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:39.400
and active, and relevant.

00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:40.700
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right,
because you were hearing voices

00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:42.000
that are usually
suppressed in history books.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.130
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Yeah, or that
get -- yeah, they're suppressed,

00:56:44.130 --> 00:56:45.930
or they're just absent,
you know, or they're --

00:56:45.930 --> 00:56:49.230
they get reduced to well,
this happened to these people.

00:56:49.230 --> 00:56:54.640
And so then I said, "I want
to go deeper into this."

00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:56.330
So then the document
of the Declaration

00:56:56.330 --> 00:57:01.010
of Independence seemed like
another source to say, "Well,

00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:05.330
what would it say to now if
I could have my way with it?"

00:57:05.330 --> 00:57:09.010
So this is the poem that came
from that, and it's an erasure.

00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:15.200
So there are what I think of as
the specific terms that clarify

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:19.400
that this is a, you know,
complaint against the King

00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:22.970
of England, and suddenly it
felt like it was large enough

00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:27.280
to include other voices.

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:33.320
"Declaration," He has
sent hither swarms

00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:38.670
of officers to harass
our people.

00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:48.680
He has plundered our, ravaged
our, destroyed the lives of our,

00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:56.540
taking away our,
abolishing our most valuable,

00:57:56.540 --> 00:58:01.870
and altering fundamentally
the forms of our.

00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:05.500
In every stage of these
oppressions, we have petitioned

00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:09.980
for redress in the
most humble terms.

00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:14.050
Our repeated petitions
have been answered only

00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:17.280
by repeated injury.

00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:22.430
We have reminded them of the
circumstances of our immigration

00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:26.370
and settlement here,
taken captive

00:58:26.370 --> 00:58:29.710
on the high seas to bear.

00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:34.790
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
said very briefly

00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:36.200
as you began it's an erasure.

00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:38.100
Can you explain that
a little more?

00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:39.400
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Oh, sure.

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:43.090
So if I looked at the whole
document, and deleted most

00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:47.330
of it, and tried to
hear a quieter voice

00:58:47.330 --> 00:58:48.980
under that official voice.

00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:53.600
And I didn't set out to do
that really, I don't think.

00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:57.010
I was reading it to
see okay, what can I --

00:58:57.010 --> 00:58:59.740
I was actually trying to write
a poem about Thomas Jefferson,

00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:03.300
so I was reading it to see
what I could get from him.

00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:06.870
And then I heard this other
thing saying, "Forget about him.

00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:09.170
Listen to this."

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:11.670
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Would
you read the poem called

00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:13.990
"I Will Tell You the
Truth About This"?

00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:15.290
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Sure.

00:59:15.290 --> 00:59:16.590
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And maybe
explain the background

00:59:16.590 --> 00:59:17.890
of that poem.

00:59:17.890 --> 00:59:19.190
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Sure, so
this is the Civil War poem

00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:20.720
that I was talking about.

00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:25.820
And it's just a collection
of letters,

00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:28.240
some almost in their entirety,

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:32.960
written by these black
soldiers and their families.

00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:35.400
And then there are a couple of
sections -- it's a long poem,

00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:37.270
so I'll read you
those two sections,

00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:38.570
do you think, or just the one?

00:59:38.570 --> 00:59:39.870
Oh, you want me to
read the first letter?

00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:41.170
Okay.

00:59:41.170 --> 00:59:44.320
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Is this a single
letter, or a composite of --

00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:45.970
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith:
This is one letter.

00:59:45.970 --> 00:59:48.850
All of these are
just actual letters.

00:59:48.850 --> 00:59:55.610
And even the spelling I left
because it seemed urgent.

00:59:55.610 --> 00:59:58.420
"I Will Tell You the Truth
About This, I Will Tell You All

00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:00.430
About It," Carlisle,

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:05.810
Pennsylvania, November
21st, 1864.

01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:10.970
Mr. Abraham Lincoln, I want
to know, sir, if you please,

01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:15.250
whether I can have my son
released from the Army?

01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:17.930
He is all the support
I have now.

01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:21.290
His father is dead,
and his brother

01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:25.660
that was all the help I had,
he has been wounded twice.

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:28.890
He has not had anything
to send me yet.

01:00:28.890 --> 01:00:33.770
Now I am old, and my head
is blossoming for the grave.

01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:38.660
And if you do, I hope the
Lord will bless you and me.

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:42.730
They say that you will
sympathize with the poor.

01:00:42.730 --> 01:00:46.690
He belong to the eight
regiment colored troops.

01:00:46.690 --> 01:00:48.160
He is a sergeant.

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:51.720
Mark Welcome is his name.

01:00:52.890 --> 01:00:55.270
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Did you know
that these letters existed?

01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:56.570
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Uh-uh, no.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:01:01.840
I'll tell you the book
that they are collected in.

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:06.650
I'm sure they're probably
here in this great building.

01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:12.950
But this is how I found
them, "Families and Freedom,

01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:15.420
a Documentary History of
African American Kinship

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:19.420
in the Civil War Era," which
is edited by Ira Berlin

01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:21.080
and Leslie S. Rowland.

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:24.850
And that was published
in 1997 by the New Press.

01:01:24.850 --> 01:01:27.640
And then the depositions
are collected in "Voices

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:31.260
of Emancipation, Understanding
Slavery, the Civil War,

01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:34.870
and Reconstruction Through the
U.S. Pension Bureau Files,"

01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:38.370
edited by Elizabeth Regosin
and Donald R. Shaffer.

01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:40.480
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: They're
just incredibly poignant.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.540
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Yeah, I mean,
I feel like it should be --

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:45.030
this is what we should have
been reading in those classes --

01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:46.330
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:48.460
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: -- where I
felt so called out, you know --

01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:49.760
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:52.810
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: -- because
they do what so little does,

01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:56.890
which is to restore the sense
of humanity and actually

01:01:56.890 --> 01:02:00.420
like blood, and life, and
voices, and stories to history.

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:01.720
You know, I mean,
I shouldn't say

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:03.470
so little else does,
but so often --

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:04.770
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:06.070
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: -- it's not
the first version of history

01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:07.370
that you get as a student.

01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:08.670
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No, right.

01:02:08.670 --> 01:02:09.970
Now you were in South
Carolina and Kentucky,

01:02:09.970 --> 01:02:11.830
places where debates about how

01:02:11.830 --> 01:02:14.990
to memorialize the Civil War
are still running pretty hot.

01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:16.960
Did that subject come up?

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.750
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith:
Well, this poem came up.

01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:21.050
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

01:02:21.050 --> 01:02:23.040
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith:
And it was something

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.440
that I think people heard in
a way that's really similar

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:26.740
to how I heard those voices.

01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:30.760
It was something that, you
know, people would come

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.860
up to me afterward -- so when
I'm reading my own poems,

01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:34.540
I don't always say,
"Okay, what do you notice?"

01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:37.860
Because that seems
wrong [laughter].

01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:42.350
So if somebody notices
something,

01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:43.930
maybe they'll say it afterward.

01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:47.710
And this is the poem that people
want to talk about because,

01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:52.360
you know, it does that for
them, too, in some way.

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:56.030
When we were in South
Carolina, we were in a place

01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:59.190
where I think the 55th
Massachusetts Volunteers had

01:02:59.190 --> 01:03:01.820
fought, and that
was commemorated.

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:06.150
And so there was, you know, a
sense of this is our history.

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:07.830
This is here in a way, too.

01:03:07.830 --> 01:03:09.130
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right, yeah.

01:03:09.130 --> 01:03:14.610
You're going to read a poem
called, "The Political Poem."

01:03:14.610 --> 01:03:15.910
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Okay.

01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:19.100
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What
is the function

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:22.240
of a political poem
in an age like ours?

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.300
It seems different than it
was during the Vietnam War,

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.900
during the Civil Rights era.

01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:29.050
What is a political
poem nowadays,

01:03:29.050 --> 01:03:30.350
and how does this poem you're

01:03:30.350 --> 01:03:33.770
about to read answer
that question?

01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:35.990
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Well,
I think a political poem

01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:44.180
in any age is valuable if it
can challenge the easy sense

01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:46.360
of us versus them.

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:48.220
So political poems that
fail don't do that.

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:50.500
They say, "I'm on the
us, which is good."

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:51.800
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:54.400
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: "And I'm
going to call out these thems."

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.680
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Just
propaganda, rallying cry.

01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:58.650
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Yeah, even
if you're thinking in terms

01:03:58.650 --> 01:04:01.270
of justice, you're making
bad art if that's the way

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:02.570
that you're going to do it.

01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:05.000
So I think a good
political poem says okay,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.700
perhaps this is what
I as a person believe,

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:10.400
but I've got a question, and
I'm going to have to explore it

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:13.570
in ways that are going
to put that on the line,

01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:14.870
and call it into question,

01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:17.580
and move me toward an
uncomfortable sense

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:21.980
of perhaps complicity
or implication in part

01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:24.050
of the problem as I see it.

01:04:24.050 --> 01:04:29.030
I want to do an organic kind
of like walkthrough and think

01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:32.150
about what I'm made
to acknowledge.

01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:37.560
I feel like there are lots
of poems that do that.

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:38.860
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:41.380
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: I
liked adding the title

01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:43.660
"Political Poem" to this
poem because that's --

01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:45.750
makes you feel like, "Oh, God.

01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:49.120
What is going to come at me?"

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:50.420
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:52.140
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: And this is
a poem that wasn't even written

01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:53.640
with politics in mind.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:54.940
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Really?

01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:56.240
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Yeah.

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:57.540
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Because it
definitely plays with that theme

01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:59.390
and plays with its title in
a very witty, conscious way.

01:04:59.390 --> 01:05:00.690
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Yeah.

01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:04.330
No, this was a poem
that I wrote thinking

01:05:04.330 --> 01:05:06.510
about like -- I was in Vermont.

01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:09.730
I was -- I actually was having
a dream that I was in a room

01:05:09.730 --> 01:05:11.610
where there was a poem on a --

01:05:11.610 --> 01:05:15.000
like as a mural on a wall that
I was reading aloud to somebody.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.780
And then I said, "This is
not a poem by somebody else.

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:20.680
If I wake up, this
can be my poem."

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:24.910
So I got up and sat
-- I was in Vermont,

01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:27.020
so I think Robert
Frost's, you know,

01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:29.510
mowers were probably in the air.

01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:33.990
And I recaptured to the
extent that I could that poem.

01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:36.100
And I published it, and it
was called, "The Mowers."

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.400
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh!

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:41.110
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: And then
later I read it, and I said,

01:05:41.110 --> 01:05:44.750
"I think this is going
to make more sense

01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:46.650
if I change the title.

01:05:46.650 --> 01:05:47.950
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:49.250
Or it makes different sense.

01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:50.550
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith:
Yeah, better sense.

01:05:50.550 --> 01:05:51.850
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes, 54.

01:05:51.850 --> 01:05:53.190
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Okay.

01:05:53.190 --> 01:06:01.670
"Political Poem," If those
mowers were each to stop

01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:05.720
at the whim say of a greedy
thought, and then the one off

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:10.420
to the left were to let his
arm float up, stirring the air

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:16.410
with that wide, slow,
underwater gesture meaning hello

01:06:16.410 --> 01:06:20.720
and you there, aimed at the
one more than a mile away

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:25.570
to the right, and if he,
in his work, were to pause,

01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:30.940
catching that call by sheer
wish and send back his own slow,

01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:37.720
one-armed dance meaning yes and
here as if threaded to a single,

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:40.790
long nerve before
remembering his tool

01:06:40.790 --> 01:06:43.770
and sheering another
message into the earth,

01:06:43.770 --> 01:06:47.780
letting who can say
how long grays passed

01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:50.570
until another thought
or just the need

01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:55.580
to know might make him stop
and look up again at the other,

01:06:55.580 --> 01:07:01.460
raising his arm as if to say
something like still and oh.

01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:04.760
And then to catch the
flicker of joy rise

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:10.250
up along those other legs and
flare into another bright yes

01:07:10.250 --> 01:07:13.260
that sways a moment
in the darkening air,

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:17.980
their work would carry them
into the better part of evening,

01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:21.740
each mowing ahead and
doubling back, then looking

01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:27.430
up to catch sight of his echo,
sought and held in that instant

01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:34.580
of common understanding, the God
and speed of it coming out only

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:41.630
after both have turned back to
face the sea of yet and slow.

01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:45.660
If they could, and if what
glimmered like a fish were

01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:50.170
to dart back and forth across
that wide, wordless distance,

01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:52.830
the day, though gone,

01:07:52.830 --> 01:07:56.700
would never know the
ache of being done.

01:07:56.700 --> 01:08:02.720
If they thought to, or would,
or even half wanted, their work,

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:07.960
the humming human engines pushed
across the grass, and the grass,

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:13.330
blade after blade
assenting, would take forever.

01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:16.390
But I love how long
it would last.

01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:18.750
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: How could

01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:25.960
such a poem help us rethink
the political standoff we find

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:27.970
ourselves in?

01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:31.660
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Well,
it's kind of begging, one,

01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:36.950
to change the scale upon which
we're thinking and say okay,

01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:41.790
it's easy to get mad at like a
big group of -- a demographic.

01:08:41.790 --> 01:08:43.090
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

01:08:43.090 --> 01:08:45.400
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: But if
you reduce it to one person

01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:48.670
out there doing his version of
what you're over here doing,

01:08:48.670 --> 01:08:50.180
maybe it would feel different.

01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:51.480
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes,
that's lovely.

01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:55.000
It's really, really lovely.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.560
There's a whole bunch of people
nearby you need to talk to.

01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:04.280
In the introduction to "Wade
in the Water," you write,

01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:07.030
"This is why I love poems.

01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:08.750
They invite me to
sit down and listen

01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:11.000
to a voice speaking
thoughtfully and passionately

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.510
about what it feels
like to be alive.

01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:15.890
Usually, the someone doing the
talking, the poem's speaker,

01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:18.070
is a person I'd never
got the chance

01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:21.510
to meet were it not
for this poem."

01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:24.160
More and more, the
way we get our news,

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.790
the way we interact
online through Facebook

01:09:26.790 --> 01:09:30.670
and other social media, we
only interact with people

01:09:30.670 --> 01:09:32.090
who think just like we do.

01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:35.230
We don't see people that
don't think like us.

01:09:35.230 --> 01:09:36.530
We silence them, we avoid them,

01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:38.930
we listen to the
right news, etcetera.

01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:43.700
Could we listen to a poem
called "My Brother at 3 A.M."?

01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:45.900
And can you tell
us about that poem?

01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:47.200
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Oh, yeah.

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.500
This is by Natalie Diaz.

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:51.620
It's from a collection called
"When My Brother Was an Aztec."

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:55.080
And so there's this family
in the center of the book.

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:57.590
It's on such a mythic
scale that I don't know

01:09:57.590 --> 01:10:01.240
if it's a real-life family
or if it's an imagined family

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:04.550
that allows a certain
dramatic situation to play out.

01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:08.670
But there's a brother in that
family who is an addict and is,

01:10:08.670 --> 01:10:14.340
you know, causing all of this
upheaval, changing the way

01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:18.890
that the speaker of the poems
thinks about herself, about,

01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:21.730
you know, what she belongs
to, what the threats are.

01:10:21.730 --> 01:10:27.340
But it's also a book that
is kind of like testifying

01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:31.060
to what it feels like to grow
up as a Native American kid

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:39.420
in the United States and to
feel, I guess, unseen, unvalued,

01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:43.380
or seen through a
caricature lens.

01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:45.670
So there are these -- and then
it's a book that's also got some

01:10:45.670 --> 01:10:48.740
really beautiful love poems
and poems that kind of play

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:52.530
with literary history in
beautiful, moving ways.

01:10:52.530 --> 01:10:55.860
But this is a poem that
is kind of haunting.

01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:57.190
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes, yes.

01:10:57.190 --> 01:11:00.370
Can we hear that now?

01:11:00.370 --> 01:11:03.120
&gt;&gt; "My Brother at 3 A.M."

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:08.440
He sat cross-legged, weeping
on the steps when Mom unlocked

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:10.630
and opened the front door.

01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:11.950
"Oh, God," he said.

01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:15.560
"Oh, God. He wants
to kill me, Mom."

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:20.260
When Mom unlocked and opened
the front door at 3 a.m.,

01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:22.430
she was in her nightgown.

01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:24.430
Dad was asleep.

01:11:24.430 --> 01:11:29.190
"He wants to kill me," he told
her, looking over his shoulder.

01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:32.640
Three a.m. and in her
nightgown, Dad asleep.

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:33.940
"What's going on?"

01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:35.240
she asked.

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:36.550
"Who wants to kill you?"

01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:38.880
He looked over his shoulder.

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:40.180
"The devil does.

01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:42.310
Look at him, over there."

01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:44.650
She asked "What are you on?

01:11:44.650 --> 01:11:46.830
Who wants to kill you?"

01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:51.340
The sky wasn't black or blue,
but the green of a dying night.

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:52.820
"The devil.

01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:55.020
Look at him, over there."

01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:57.510
He pointed to the corner house.

01:11:57.510 --> 01:12:02.890
The sky wasn't black or blue,
but the dying green of night.

01:12:02.890 --> 01:12:07.230
Stars had closed their eyes
or sheathed their knives.

01:12:07.230 --> 01:12:09.840
My brother pointed
to the corner house.

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:12.920
His lips flickered with sores.

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:17.170
Stars had closed their eyes
or sheathed their knives.

01:12:17.170 --> 01:12:20.020
"Oh, God. I can see
the tail," he said.

01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:21.900
"Oh, God. Look."

01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:25.050
Mom winced at the
sores on his lips.

01:12:25.050 --> 01:12:27.580
"It's sticking out
from behind the house.

01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:30.150
Oh, God. See the tail," he said.

01:12:30.150 --> 01:12:32.530
"Look at the goddamned tail."

01:12:32.530 --> 01:12:36.940
He sat cross-legged,
weeping on the front steps.

01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:41.880
Mom finally saw it, a
hellish vision, my brother.

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:45.090
"Oh, God. Oh, God," she said.

01:12:45.090 --> 01:12:51.700
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It doesn't seem
like a political poem at all,

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:54.360
except that it forces us

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:59.760
to do what you hope poetry will
make us do, which is to cross

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:04.550
over barriers, to sympathize,
to feel in ways we didn't --

01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:05.970
do with people we
didn't think we knew.

01:13:05.970 --> 01:13:10.450
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Yeah, it's
a poem that kind of urges you

01:13:10.450 --> 01:13:13.250
to say -- to stop saying,
"Well, that's not my problem,"

01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:16.280
and to say, "Oh, I
wonder what that woman" --

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:17.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The mother.

01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:18.880
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith:
-- "feels like."

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:20.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:21.480
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Or
this kid who's kind

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:22.780
of watching all of this.

01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:24.490
This is one of the poems that --
this was the last poem, I think,

01:13:24.490 --> 01:13:27.530
that we read in the
men's rehab center.

01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:30.030
I don't want lead with it
because obvious reasons,

01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:32.100
but I didn't want to not
read it, because I wanted

01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:34.420
to know what they
might make of it.

01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:38.450
And they saw a lot, you know,
of this struggle, this --

01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:40.870
you know, this awful
monster that's kind

01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:42.170
of riding the brother.

01:13:42.170 --> 01:13:43.500
That made sense to them.

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:48.220
His inability to really be able
to translate his experience

01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:50.930
to the family members, which
I think the poem manages,

01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:56.090
interestingly, by making that
creature real to the brother

01:13:56.090 --> 01:13:58.090
and invisible to everybody else.

01:13:58.090 --> 01:14:02.940
But they also -- I think I'm
not wrong in connecting this

01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:06.630
to that afternoon --
someone there said,

01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:08.450
"It's interesting
-- where's the dad?

01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:09.750
This is the mom.

01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:11.050
She's bearing all the weight."

01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:12.350
And so suddenly,
it was an even --

01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:14.870
even an opportunity for someone
who maybe had been in a version

01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:18.520
of this story to empathize with
another figure, you know --

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:19.820
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:21.120
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: -- which
seemed really insightful to me.

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:22.420
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right,
that opportunity

01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:25.590
that a great poem gives us
to empathize with people

01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:29.100
that we don't run
into is a great gift.

01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:31.560
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Yeah,
I think it's a great gift,

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:34.140
and I just don't think it's
one to be taken lightly.

01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:37.450
I don't think that it's
enough to say, "Oh,

01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:40.040
yeah, empathy, kumbaya."

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:44.890
I think that's one of the things
that creates a sense of toxicity

01:14:44.890 --> 01:14:48.390
that we are all kind of,
you know, reeling from.

01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:51.550
We're producing it by
writing off these simple,

01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:54.240
but potentially meaningful acts.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.540
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:56.840
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: And so
I think, you know, okay,

01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:01.360
read a poem and try and believe
in what it causes you to feel.

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:02.660
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:03.960
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: I
think that's actual work.

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:05.260
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I do, too.

01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:07.290
You told the New York Times --

01:15:07.290 --> 01:15:10.780
that's another newspaper on
the East Coast [laughter] --

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.520
"There's a deep and
interesting kind

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:15.510
of troubling that poems do."

01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:16.810
I love that.

01:15:16.810 --> 01:15:18.260
Tell us what that troubling is.

01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:21.300
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Well, you
know I like that word, right?

01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:24.810
That -- it's kind of like the
anchor for that title poem.

01:15:24.810 --> 01:15:28.200
But it -- you know,
which comes from the song

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:32.820
and the biblical story of
an angel troubling the water

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:35.330
so that it would protect the
Israelites as they were passing

01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:37.460
to safety, but so that
it would also heal them

01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:39.800
of any kind of affliction.

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:43.150
And so troubling
is a stirring up.

01:15:43.150 --> 01:15:47.940
But, of course, stirring
up is also trouble.

01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:49.240
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:50.540
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: And
I think art is something

01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:52.470
that asks us to do both.

01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:53.770
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Would
you read a poem called

01:15:53.770 --> 01:15:55.740
"The United States
Welcomes You"?

01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:57.040
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Yeah.

01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.340
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Forty-one.

01:15:58.340 --> 01:15:59.640
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: Okay.

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:00.940
I want to tell you that
this poem is another one

01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:02.560
of those poems that
got a different title

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:03.860
after it was written.

01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:05.160
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh.

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.860
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: I
was thinking about --

01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:11.800
it's placed pretty close on
the wake of the Civil War poem.

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:15.280
And I was thinking about what
it feels like to be taken

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:20.040
as a stranger in the
country you belong to.

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:22.820
And then this title was
the title that I figured

01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:25.940
out that I wanted to give
it to -- give to the poem.

01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:30.810
"The United States
Welcomes You," Why

01:16:30.810 --> 01:16:34.640
and by whose power
were you sent?

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:39.400
What do you see that
you may wish to steal?

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:41.390
Why this dancing?

01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:45.870
Why do your dark bodies
drink up the light?

01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:49.800
What are you demanding
that we feel?

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:51.960
Have you stolen something?

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:55.850
Then what is that
leaping in your chest?

01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:59.240
What is the nature
of your mission?

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:02.490
Do you seek to offer
a confession?

01:17:02.490 --> 01:17:08.040
Have you anything to do with
others brought by us to harm?

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:10.190
Then why are you afraid?

01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:15.420
And why do you invade
our night, hands raised,

01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:20.320
eyes wide, mute as ghosts?

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:23.390
Is there something
you wish to confess?

01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:28.070
Is this some enigmatic
type of test?

01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:30.080
What if we fail?

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:35.700
How and to whom do we
address our appeal?

01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:40.000
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: For
an immigrant nation,

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.950
this is a really troubling poem.

01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:48.250
You once said you, "Wish
that more poets were brave

01:17:48.250 --> 01:17:50.460
or generous enough
to risk failing

01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:53.240
at something that matters."

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:55.390
What matters most
to you as a poet?

01:17:55.390 --> 01:18:00.450
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: I
asked a student that once

01:18:00.450 --> 01:18:02.610
when she was in my office.

01:18:02.610 --> 01:18:04.680
And we were talking
about her poems,

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:05.980
and I was giving her feedback.

01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:08.490
And she bristled at
every suggestion I made.

01:18:08.490 --> 01:18:10.370
And I said, "What's
going on here?

01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:13.530
What's at stake for you?

01:18:13.530 --> 01:18:15.950
What's in this room with us
right now that's causing this?"

01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:19.320
And she said, "I just
want to write truth."

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:21.280
And she burst into tears.

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:22.720
And I love her, you know.

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:25.460
And I feel that way, too.

01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:31.490
I want something that's not just
a testament to me and feeling,

01:18:31.490 --> 01:18:36.230
you know, proud of this
momentary thing I might be,

01:18:36.230 --> 01:18:38.400
or something I feel
like I might know.

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:41.990
I want to write poems that
are going to push me to kind

01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:43.760
of touch that big
thing, you know.

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:46.230
And you mostly won't, right.

01:18:46.230 --> 01:18:49.340
That's the failure that I'm
kind of setting myself up for.

01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:51.700
But the wish is like, "I
want something that's going

01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:55.720
to make this life
kind of bearable,"

01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:58.360
you know, or something.

01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:03.560
So I mean, the less kind of like
lofty answer is I'm interested

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:08.050
in what we do to each
other in all the contexts

01:19:08.050 --> 01:19:10.230
that we operate in,
you know, in families,

01:19:10.230 --> 01:19:13.240
in relationships, in society.

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:15.350
And what -- why?

01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:16.730
What's the follow-up from that

01:19:16.730 --> 01:19:20.340
and what could we
take from that?

01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:21.940
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's such an
honor to talk to you tonight

01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:23.240
and to hear you talk
about poetry.

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:24.540
Thank you so much.

01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:25.840
&gt;&gt; Tracy K. Smith: On, my honor.

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:27.640
Thank you.

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:48.640
[ Applause ]

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:51.600
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Thank you, Tracy
and Ron for a remarkable event.

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:53.340
I'm Rob Casper, the
head of the Poetry

01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:55.340
and Literature Center
here at the Library,

01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:57.230
and I have just a few
announcements before I let

01:19:57.230 --> 01:19:58.670
you go.

01:19:58.670 --> 01:20:00.370
First of all, a week from today,

01:20:00.370 --> 01:20:04.100
the center will kick off its
first ever podcast series

01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:07.640
featuring our 21st poet
laureate consultant in poetry.

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:11.350
I know it's technology, but
it's still worth listening to.

01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:16.700
This is the website,
www.loc.gov/poetry.

01:20:17.970 --> 01:20:21.810
Give in to your inner techy
self and go there, please.

01:20:21.810 --> 01:20:24.470
Second, if you haven't already,

01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:28.160
please fill out the survey forms
you received when coming in.

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:30.970
You can drop them off at
the table up in the foyer.

01:20:30.970 --> 01:20:34.800
Your input helps us improve
events such as these.

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:37.060
And we'll have a book signing
in the Whittall Pavilion,

01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:38.530
which is right next door.

01:20:38.530 --> 01:20:40.810
The book sales are
outside that room,

01:20:40.810 --> 01:20:42.260
and we hope you'll
get a signed copy

01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:44.640
and congratulate
Tracy in person.

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:49.620
Finally, this event concludes
the Library's literary season,

01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:51.970
but I would be remiss if I
didn't tell you that just

01:20:51.970 --> 01:20:53.680
down the street there's
a big, big,

01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:55.940
big poetry festival
taking place.

01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:59.530
Split This Rock is celebrating
its 10th anniversary,

01:20:59.530 --> 01:21:03.030
and it's blockbuster evening
readings, like this one,

01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:05.220
are free and open to the public.

01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:07.320
You can go to their website.

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:10.810
You can just look around,
keep your ears open,

01:21:10.810 --> 01:21:14.470
and you'll hear some
poetry, and it will be great.

01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:16.070
Enjoy the rest of
National Poetry Month,

01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:17.850
and hope to see you
back here soon.

01:21:17.850 --> 01:21:19.650
Thank you.
