Any presidential appointment has the
power to change the course and

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.449
trajectory of the University. But I would
venture to say that in Carnegie Mellon's

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.920
lively history, no presidency has been
more important than the one we are about

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.140
to enter, and really for the best reasons.
And now let me take one step into the

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.810
future and introduce you the 10th
president of Carnegie Mellon University,

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:39.249
Farnam Jahanian. 
Farnam Jahanian possesses a rare set of qualities and

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:43.929
experiences that make him exactly the
right leader for this university at

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:49.929
this extraordinary moment. And to the
extent that you know Farnam,

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:54.299
you know that his heart is in the work.

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:58.899
We dedicated our work to finding a
president who would value our unique

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.699
culture of innovation and collaboration,
leading us to build on the potential of

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.839
this moment in our history.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.570
To accept this appointment as the next
president of this great institution in

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:26.259
this fantastically vibrant city of Pittsburgh. 
So today, I stand here as a true believer in the

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:36.560
power of higher education. 
I am in awe of all that you have to offer and your

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.770
dedication to making the world smarter,
safer, more equitable, and more inspiring.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.500
I am looking forward to hearing your
dreams for shaping the world, and the

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.819
future of this great institution. 
Now let's get to work.

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:55.720
Thank you very much.
