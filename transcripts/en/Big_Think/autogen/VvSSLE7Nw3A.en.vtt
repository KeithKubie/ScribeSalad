00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:15.460
Look, I’m not an advocate of a political
violence even in virtuous causes, so I’m

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:25.279
not particularly a fan of the Anti-Fa or Black
Bloc or those things, but there is no moral

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:36.510
equivalence between neo-Nazis and people gathering
to oppose them.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.750
There simply isn’t.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:46.680
You can’t say that people standing up against
Nazism, white supremacy and racism are the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.390
same as the people who are in fact white supremacist,
neo-Nazis and racists.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.820
The moral equivalence doesn’t exist and
I think everyone, except the occupant of the

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.930
Oval Office, can see that.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.111
And I’ve always thought that the great thing,
and I think this is exactly where [Richard]

00:01:04.111 --> 00:01:11.000
Dawkins comes out, is that you have to make
a distinction between ideas and people, and

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.360
that it’s perfectly legitimate to express
even vehement dislike of ideas and of belief

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:26.940
systems, but it’s not acceptable to turn
that into bigotry against people who are part

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.490
of those belief systems.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.470
So you have to protect the person but not
protect the ideology.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:39.000
I think the nature of intellectual activity
is that ideas are up for discussion, and if

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.480
I don’t like your ideas it’s entirely
proper that I should say so.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.520
But for me to treat you in a bigoted fashion
because I don’t agree with you is not acceptable.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.990
So if you think the world is flat, and I think
you’re an idiot, it’s okay for me to say

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.020
that.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:07.010
So I think we have to retain that ability
to be able to have open discourse about ideas

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:14.900
and not to become afraid that we’re offending
somebody, because actually the open, intellectual

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.060
discourse... it often offends people.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:27.270
I remember once being invited to a lunch at
MIT, a rather humbling lunch because of the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:34.490
kind of two dozen or so people around the
table maybe 20 of them had won the Nobel Prize.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.319
And I was very interested the way in which
they talked to each other about each other’s

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.350
ideas—it was pretty much brutal.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:50.450
They would call each other idiots and fools
for having certain scientific theories, I

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.910
mean the most frank language was being used.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.160
I thought this is extraordinary; what are
these people going to say about each other

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.550
after lunch is over?

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.310
But actually the moment the lunch was over
it was obvious that they were on perfectly

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.900
good terms with each other and they had no
hard feelings, and they were perfectly willing

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:16.140
to have that kind of very abrasive interchange
without taking it personally, and I thought

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.050
that was really quite impressive.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.390
To me that’s the kind of model of the intellectual
life: that you could be as abrasive as you

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.520
like at the level of ideas, but you don’t
make it personal.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.629
I also do a bit of adverse writing [advertising?],
I do a bit of lecturing around the country

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:39.510
and I was not so long ago lecturing in Florida
in a town called Vero Beach, which is near

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:46.940
Cape Canaveral, and the audience was older,
it was very white, it was very conservative,

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:53.600
and I would’ve said a very large majority
of them had probably voted for Trump.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:02.680
I have to say they were very civil, very courteous,
they heard me out, nobody booed or threw things

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.830
or walked out—it was a civilized encounter,
but there were very strong disagreements.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:18.880
So in the Q&amp;A, for example, I had said something
in my remarks about climate change and a gentleman

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.680
at the microphone said how I was completely
wrong because when I said that all these scientists

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.930
basically supported my views on climate change
that wasn’t right, and then we got into

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.449
a kind of “yes it is, no it isn’t” thing.

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:40.510
And I tried to say to him that if you think
the world is flat it doesn’t make the world

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:48.850
flat, the world doesn’t need you to believe
that it’s round to be round because there’s

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:56.060
what we call evidence that shows us what shape
the world is.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.790
And I said it seems to be the same is true
of climate change.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.530
So we had this kind of—I mean there was
another gentleman who basically said, “How

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:10.230
can you believe that the New York Times isn’t
just lying to you everyday?”

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:16.700
So in a way I was actually quite encouraged
by the conversation because it was extremely

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:23.440
frank, but it was also within the bounds of
civilized conversation, so it was opposite

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.580
sides actually talking to each other.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.750
And I thought, “Well, maybe it’s a good
idea to do more of that.”
