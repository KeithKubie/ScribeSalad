00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.740
- [Instructor] What we have depicted here

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.620
is an economy in long-run equilibrium.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.950
Notice, the point at which
the aggregate demand curve

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.350
and the short-run aggregate
supply curve intersect.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.910
That specifies an equilibrium
price level, PL sub one,

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.840
and an equilibrium level of output,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.600
this equilibrium level
of output, Y sub one.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.450
But notice, that point of intersection,

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.470
it also intersects the long-run
aggregate supply curve.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.160
And so that is also our
full employment output.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.030
And just a reminder,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.880
full employment output
does not mean that everyone

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.690
in the economy is employed.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.030
It means that this is
the level of employment

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.270
that is sustainable,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.860
the level of full employment.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.950
If for some reason the unemployment rate

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.090
were to get lower than that,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.720
that that would be an
unsustainable situation

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.670
for this economy.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.630
But what we really care
about in this video

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.450
is what happens if our
aggregate demand curve shifts

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.910
in the short-run and in the long-run?

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.180
So let's just imagine there's
all sorts of positive news

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.360
and aggregate demand shifts up.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.100
So let's imagine,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.910
so let me just shift our
aggregate demand curve.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.330
So it shifts like that.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.470
So all of a sudden everyone
has become more optimistic,

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.400
and at a given price level,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.230
they just want to demand more output.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.200
Well what's going to
happen in this universe?

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.500
Well in this universe,

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.540
we have a new short-run equilibrium.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.870
So we are now right over there.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.610
Let's call this,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.610
let's call this price level two,

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.660
and then this is output level two.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.150
So Y sub two here.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.890
And so what happened?

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.730
Well in the short-run,

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.900
we see that prices are going to go up.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.440
The suppliers of the output
are gonna say hey, hey,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.710
all these people want my output,

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.250
now I'm gonna charge more for it.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.990
And I'm also going to increase output.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.610
I was like hey there's a bonanza going on.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.920
People are not only, not
only are they demanding more,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.420
but they're willing to pay for it more.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.490
And so our output actually goes beyond

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.310
our full employment output.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.510
And so you can imagine maybe unemployment

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.640
goes below the sustainable rate.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.240
All sorts of people
instead of going to school

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.280
they're getting a job or whatever else.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.760
They're coming out of retirement to work

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.610
because there's just a bonanza going on.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.460
But what's gonna happen in the long-run?

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.760
Well in the long-run
people who are working

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.150
and say gee you know,

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.930
my firm is having this bonanza.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.880
When my employment contract comes due,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.050
I'm gonna ask for a raise.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.120
And so as labor prices go up,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.953
what's going to happen

00:02:38.953 --> 00:02:41.690
to the short-run aggregate supply curve?

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.300
Yes, it is going to shift up as well.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.780
And so let's make it
shift well up as well.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.410
People are gonna demand more
and more and more and more

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.100
and more and more money

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.210
all the way to the point that we get to

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.830
our sustainable level of output again.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.990
And so what really happened is,

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.590
at first, we had this price inflation

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.440
and output increased
beyond a sustainable level.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.250
And then people say hey no no no,

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.388
I want, you know I want more for my time,

00:03:11.388 --> 00:03:14.720
and so as wages went up,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.670
then prices went up even further.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.960
And so we get back to,

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.256
and if prices are going up even further,

00:03:21.256 --> 00:03:24.080
then even with this shifted
aggregate demand curve,

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.650
people say well I might not
want that much of it anymore,

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.940
and then we shift back to
this point right over here.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.780
And so now if this was
aggregate demand two

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.810
after everyone got all optimistic,

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.550
we will call this short-run
aggregate supply two.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.270
And our equilibrium price now

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.960
is a good bit higher, price level three,

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.140
but we are back to our
full employment output.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.540
So we could call this Y sub three,

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.645
which is the same thing as Y sub one,

00:03:55.645 --> 00:03:58.580
which is equal to our
full employment output.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.610
And what you have just seen,

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.430
this is known as the long-run
self-adjustment mechanism.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.830
It's an argument that
economists will sometimes make

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.260
using this simplified model to say hey,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.510
if you're in a situation
that's either above

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.310
your full employment output or below

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.950
your full employment output,

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.670
it's okay, it will in
the long-run self-adjust.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.230
Government might not have to intervene.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.550
In future videos or in other videos,

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.854
we'll talk about how a
government might wanna intervene

00:04:25.854 --> 00:04:27.290
in either direction.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.020
But this is an argument
that's saying well look,

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.020
that in the short-run things might deviate

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.670
from your full employment output,

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.430
but in the long-run they're going to,

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.110
there's natural mechanisms that will allow

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.240
output to get back to
your natural potential,

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.110
your full employment output.
