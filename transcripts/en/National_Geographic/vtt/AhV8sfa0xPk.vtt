00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
what exactly can the government do to

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.730
him to any of us whether we're on the

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.230
watch list or not as a journalist my

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.320
first hunch is to go straight to the

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.320
source

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.810
Michael German is a former FBI agent who

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.430
has experience with the terrorism watch

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.180
list

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.460
what is the internal designation given

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.890
to people who are on that watch list

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.840
Notre suspected terrorists do you need

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.130
to be a known or suspected terrorists to

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.010
be given that designation

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.960
no you do not there's plenty of evidence

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.879
that people were put on these lists were

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.850
investigated for no reasons so you're

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.730
building this expanding pool of suspects

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.470
based on little or no real evidence

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.930
what are the most extreme things that

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.989
can happen to you if you end up in that

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.360
system there's so little transparency

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.640
that we don't know all the ways the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.440
watchlist maybe you so from a

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.750
deprivation of Rights standpoint there's

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.790
a lot you can lose let's say I'm you

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.979
know I'm an American citizen i get taken

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.280
into secondary screening surely I have

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.409
Fourth Amendment protections right not

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.900
at the border anything coming across the

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.400
border could be contraband and therefore

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.010
the government has a right searched it

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.619
without work the agents that take me to

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.820
secondary screening have the authority

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:25.250
to read the contents of my emails or my

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.770
text messages and not just read them but

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.750
put them in a database for other agents

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.729
across the intelligence community to

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.090
read them all of that information and

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.729
collectively cross-border so i think a

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.990
lot of people are not aware of this what

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.549
you're saying that is that at least some

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.950
of our Constitution protections don't

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.450
exist when we're in a border crossing or

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.700
an error

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.229
we're coming back from abroad right you

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.939
might try going to the airport tomorrow

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.939
and see how you do
