00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.130
Let's say that you're
curious about people's TV

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.140
watching habits.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.430
And in particular, how much TV
do people in the country watch?

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.510
So what you are concerned
with, if we imagine

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.110
the entire country-- and
we've already talked about--

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.960
especially if we're talking
about a country like the United

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.460
States, but pretty
much any country,

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.940
is a very large population.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.450
In the United
States, we're talking

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.030
about on the order of
300 million people.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.770
So ideally, if you could
somehow magically do it,

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.400
you would survey or somehow
observe all 300 million people

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.150
and take the mean of
how many hours of TV

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.850
they watch on a given day.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.830
And then that will give you the
parameter, the population mean.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.850
But we've already
talked about, in a case

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.570
like this, that's
a very impractical.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.757
Even if you tried to do
it, by the time you did it,

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:51.340
your data might be stale because
some people might have passed

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.690
away, other people
might have been born.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.580
Who knows what
might have happened.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.210
And so this is a truth
that is out there.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.720
There is a theoretical
population mean

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.050
for the amount of the
average or the mean hours

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.650
of TV watched per
day by Americans.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.580
There is a truth here at
any given point in time.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.740
It's just pretty much
impossible to come up

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.830
with the exact answer, to
come up with this exact truth.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.560
But you don't give up.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.580
You say, well, maybe I don't
have to survey all 300 million

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.220
or observe all 300 million.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.780
Instead, I'm just going
to observe a sample,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.020
right over here.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.440
And let's say, to make
the computation simple,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.610
you do a sample of six.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.820
And we'll talk about
later why six might not

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.070
be as large of a sample
as you would like.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.560
But you survey how much
TV these folks watch.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.170
And you find one person who
watched 1 and 1/2 hours.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.950
Another person watched
2 and 1/2 hours.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.010
Another person watched 4 hours.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.540
And then you get one
person who watched 2 hours.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.880
And you get two people
who watched 1 hour each.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.630
So given this data
from your sample,

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.520
what do you get as
your sample mean?

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.110
Well, the sample mean, which
we would denote by lowercase

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.730
x with a bar over
it, is just the sum

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.110
of all of these divided by the
number of data points we have.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.770
So let's see we have 1.5
plus 2.5 plus 4 plus 2

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.010
plus 1 plus 1.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.120
And all of that
divided by 6, which

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.670
gives-- let's see, the numerator
1.5 plus 2.5 is 4, plus 4 is 8,

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.490
plus 2 is 10, plus 2 more is 12.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.570
So it's going to
be 12 over 6, which

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.839
is equal to 2 hours
of television.

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:47.380
So at least for your
sample, you say,

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.092
my sample mean is two
hours of television.

00:02:50.092 --> 00:02:50.800
It's an estimate.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.020
It's a statistic that
is trying to estimate

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.530
this parameter, this thing
that's very hard to know.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.920
But it's our best shot.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.750
Maybe we get a better answer
if we get more data points.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.722
But this is we have so far.

00:03:02.722 --> 00:03:04.950
Now the next question
you ask yourself is,

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.430
well, I don't want to just
estimate my population mean.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.740
I also want to estimate
another parameter.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.620
I also am interested in
estimating my population

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.930
variance.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.170
So once again, since
we can't survey

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.680
every one in the
population, this

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.546
is pretty much
impossible to know.

00:03:24.546 --> 00:03:26.920
But we're going to attempt to
estimate of this parameter.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.810
We attempted to
estimate the mean.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.670
Now we will also
attempt to estimate

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.030
this parameter, this
variance parameter.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.720
So how would you do it?

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.870
Well, reasonable logic would
say, well, we maybe we'll

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.770
do the same thing
with a sample as we

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.270
would have done
with the population.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.260
When you're doing the
population variance,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.360
you would take each data
point in the population,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.400
find the distance between that
and the normal population mean,

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.212
take the square of
that difference,

00:03:53.212 --> 00:03:55.420
and then add up all the
squares of those differences,

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.250
and then divide by the number
of data points you have.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.920
So let's try that over here.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.104
So let's try to find-- take
each of these data points,

00:04:05.104 --> 00:04:06.770
and find the difference--
let me do that

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.370
in a different color--
each of these data points,

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.630
and find the difference
between that data point

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.089
and our sample mean--
not the population mean,

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.779
we don't know what
the population mean--

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:19.440
the sample mean.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.080
So that's that first data
point plus the second data

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:32.280
point-- so it's 4 minus 2
squared plus 1 minus 2 squared.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.780
And this is what
you would have done

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.120
if you were taking a
population variance.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.578
If this was your
entire population,

00:04:36.578 --> 00:04:39.120
this is how you would you
find a population mean here,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.578
if this was your
entire population.

00:04:40.578 --> 00:04:42.110
And you find the
squared distances

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.312
from each of those data
points and then divide

00:04:44.312 --> 00:04:45.520
by the number of data points.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.353
So let's just think
about this a little bit.

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:49.000
1 minus 2 squared.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.030
Then you have 2.5
minus 2-- 2 being

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.740
the sample mean-- squared.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.200
Let me see, this green color.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.990
Plus 2 minus 2 squared.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.366
Plus 1 minus 2 squared.

00:05:09.366 --> 00:05:11.865
And then maybe you would divide
by the number of data points

00:05:11.865 --> 00:05:14.940
that you have, where you have
the number of data points.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.870
So in this case,
we're dividing by 6.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.020
And what would we get
in this circumstance?

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.480
Well, if we just do the
computation, 1.5 minus 2

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.840
is negative 0.5.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.050
We square that.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.820
This becomes a positive 0.25.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.740
4 minus 2 squared is going
to be 2 squared, which is 4.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.850
1 minus 2 squared--
well, that's negative 1

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.260
squared, which is just 1.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:47.420
2.5 minus 2 is 0.5
squared, is 0.25.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.300
2 minus 2 squared--
well, that's just 0.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:56.910
And then 1 minus 2 squared is
1, it's negative 1 squared.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.890
So we just get 1.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.730
And if we add all
of this up-- let

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.150
me add the whole numbers first.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:11.340
4 plus 1 is 5, plus 1 is 6,
and then we have two 0.25s.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.269
So this is going to
be equal to 6.5--

00:06:15.269 --> 00:06:16.810
let me write this
in a neutral color.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:24.245
So this is going to be 6.5
over this 6 right over here.

00:06:24.245 --> 00:06:26.370
Well, there's a couple of
ways we could write this,

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.870
but I'll just get
the calculator out

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.600
and we can just calculate it.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:36.080
So 6.5 divided by 6
gets us-- if we round,

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.750
it's approximately 1.08.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:47.450
So it's approximately
1.08 is this calculation.

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.080
Now what we have
to think about is

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.300
whether this is the best
calculation, whether this

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:58.144
is the best estimate for the
population variance, given

00:06:58.144 --> 00:06:59.060
the data that we have.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.143
You can always argue that
we could have more data.

00:07:01.143 --> 00:07:03.920
But given the data we have,
is this the best calculation

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.430
that we can make to estimate
the population variance?

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.920
And I'll have you think
about that for a second.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.450
Well, it turns out
that this is close,

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.370
this is close to the best
calculation, the best estimate

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.020
that we can make,
given the data we have.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.965
And sometimes this will be
called the sample variance.

00:07:22.965 --> 00:07:24.840
But it's a particular
type of sample variance

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.700
where we just divide by the
number of data points we have.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.920
And so people will write
just an n over here.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.630
So this is one way to define a
sample variance in an attempt

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.210
to estimate our
population variance.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.300
But it turns out--
and in the next video

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.420
I'll give you an
intuitive explanation

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.120
of why it turns out this way.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.580
And then I would also like to
write a computer simulation

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.200
that, at least
experimentally, makes

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.240
you feel a little bit better.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.000
But it turns out, you're going
to get a better estimate--

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.257
and it's a little bit weird
and voodooish at first

00:07:54.257 --> 00:07:55.840
when you first think
about it-- you're

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:01.040
going to get a better estimate
for your population variance

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.230
if you don't divide by
6, if you don't divide

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:04.800
by the number of
data points you have

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.980
but you divide by one less
than the number of data

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.090
points you have.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:10.090
So how would we do that?

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.440
And we can denote that
as sample variance.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.940
So when most people talk
about the sample variance,

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.190
they're talking about
the sample variance

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:20.220
where you do this calculation,
but instead of dividing by 6

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.590
you were to divide by 5.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:23.990
You would divide by 5.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.610
So they would say you
divide by n minus 1.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.870
So what would we get
in those circumstances?

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.230
Well, the top part is going
to be the exact same thing.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:35.799
We're going to get 6.5.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:38.230
But then our
denominator, our n is 6.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:39.520
We have 6 data points.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.039
But we're going to
divide by 1 less than 6.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.880
We're going to divide by 5.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.690
And 6.5 divided by
5 is equal to 1.3.

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.474
So when we calculate our sample
variance with this technique,

00:08:52.474 --> 00:08:54.140
which is the more
mainstream technique--

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:54.973
and it seems voodoo.

00:08:54.973 --> 00:08:56.600
Why are we dividing
by n minus 1,

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.860
wherein for a population
variance we divide by n?

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.220
But remember we're trying
to estimate the population

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:02.720
variance.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.910
And it turns out that
this is a better estimate.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:08.310
Because this calculation
is underestimating

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:12.334
what the population variance
is, this is a better estimate.

00:09:12.334 --> 00:09:13.750
We don't know for
sure what it is.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.000
These both could be way off.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.840
It could be just by chance
what we happen to sample.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.725
But over many samples--
and there's many ways

00:09:20.725 --> 00:09:22.100
to think about
it-- this is going

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.700
to be a better calculation.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.350
It's going to give
you a better estimate.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:27.920
And so how would
we write this down?

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.510
How would we write this down
with mathematical notation?

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:35.870
Well, remember,
we're taking the sum.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.590
And we're taking each
of the data points.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.100
So we'll start with
the first data point

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.480
all the way to the
nth data point.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.617
This lowercase n says that, hey,
we're looking at the sample.

00:09:45.617 --> 00:09:47.200
If I have an uppercase
N, that usually

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.658
denotes that we're
trying to sum up

00:09:48.658 --> 00:09:50.190
everything in the population.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:53.350
Here we're looking at a
sample of size, lower case n.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:57.600
And we're taking each data
point, so each x sub i,

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.960
and from it we're
subtracting the sample mean.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.810
And then we're squaring it.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.206
We're taking the sum of
the squared distances.

00:10:09.206 --> 00:10:11.580
And then we're dividing, not
by the number of data points

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:16.187
we have, but by 1 less than the
number of data points we have.

00:10:16.187 --> 00:10:18.520
So this calculation, where
we just summed up all of this

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.920
and then we divided
by 5, not by 6,

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:27.500
this is the standard
definition of sample variance.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.820
So I'll leave you there.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.380
In the next video,
I will attempt

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.650
to give you an intuition of
why we're dividing by n minus 1

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.930
instead of dividing by n.
