00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.589
Have you ever noticed cars look like they
have faces?

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:06.609
Is that intentional?

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:08.650
Spoiler: Yes… hehe… spoiler…

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.620
Get it, it’s a car joke.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.120
Ok just roll the intro.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.490
Hi petrol heads, Julian in for DNews.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.640
Humans have a tendency to see faces in everyday
objects.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.170
But Elvis doesn’t keep showing up on your
toast because the king is haunting your cuisinart,

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.150
it’s because of a phenomenon called pareidolia.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.230
This false pattern recognition, along with
our tendency to anthropomorphize things, means

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.649
we often see faces on cars, and actually assign
them emotions and expressions.

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.420
in 2008 a study asked 40 people to rate the
traits of 38 different passenger cars.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.429
Almost everybody agreed on which cars had
which traits.

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:49.530
When asked which cars they preferred, people
overwhelmingly liked cars that were low and

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.129
wide, with angled headlights and wide grills.

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.399
These were the cars that were ranked as aggressive
and powerful.

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.870
More recent studies have looked at what parts
of the brain were active when looking at the

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.510
fronts of cars.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.330
A 2011 study examined car expert’s brains
with an fMRI and discovered when they looked

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.820
at pictures of faces and cars, the part of
the brain they use for processing faces called

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.630
the Fusiform Face Area, lit up.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.159
That study’s use of experts raised the question
that maybe we start to use our FFA for everyday

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.970
objects only after we spend a lot of time
around them.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.850
So a study published December 17th took 20
random adults with no interest in cars and

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.850
put them in an fMRI while showing them pictures
of cars.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.479
The results showed the subjects used their
FFAs when looking at cars.

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.810
But the parts of the brain that are linked
to thinking about the mental states of others,

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.810
the temporoparietal junction and medial prefrontal
cortex, were not activated.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.969
So they saw faces in cars but they didn’t
think of the cars as having emotions.

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:47.620
Which must make me weird, because I definitely
have a love affair with my car.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.390
A few of you who watch Arrested Development
may be wondering if people with face blindness

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.109
have trouble distinguishing cars.

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:57.829
As it turns out, yes, a common symptom of
prosopagnosia, or face-blindness, is that

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.590
cars all just look like blocks on wheels.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.369
Car makers are completely aware of pareidolia
when they design a car, and they tend to give

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.060
their sportier models more aggressive faces.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.090
People also interpret faces and expressions
differently from culture to culture, and it’s

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.090
part of the reason some manufacturers alter
or don’t even offer certain models in different

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.090
places.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.610
So we may be great at spotting faces, but
for some reason we suck at drawing them.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.380
Trace explains that reason over here.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.750
I’m sure we’ve got some gear heads out
there.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.790
What’s the Prettiest car… in the world?

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.530
Tell us in the comments and I’ll see you
next time on DNews.
