00:00:01.335 --> 00:00:02.703
Yeah, well, that's why
they call it charity work.

00:00:02.803 --> 00:00:03.871
Because it's work.

00:00:03.971 --> 00:00:05.138
It's work.

00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:06.306
Good evening,
ladies.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.341
How are you
doing tonight?

00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:08.642
Really awesome.
So good.

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:10.143
My name is Devon,
I'll be taking care of you.

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:11.645
Start you off with anything
to drink?

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:13.046
Uh, water's fine.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.448
Water's perfect.

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:17.451
Great, so we have a few specials
in addition to the menu--

00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:19.019
Listen,
before the specials,

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:22.222
I have to tell you
I'm allergic to nuts.

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:25.158
My meal cannot have
any nuts in it.

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:27.227
She's insanely
allergic to nuts.

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:29.563
Got it, no nuts.
Not a problem.

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:31.098
We accommodate
allergies all the time.

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.266
I'll tell the chef.

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.901
No, I'm serious.

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:36.436
It can't have even
been around nuts.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.938
Cashews, pecans--

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:39.072
Pine nuts, peanuts.

00:00:39.173 --> 00:00:40.207
Yeah, doughnuts, cronuts.

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:42.709
Almonds.
Lalmonds.

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:43.877
Dalmonds.

00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:45.179
I understand.

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:47.414
So our specials are--

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:51.251
Oh, actually, some of the bread
might have some nuts in them.

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:53.187
Oh, my God!
Are you serious?

00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:54.254
I can't believe
this is happening!

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:55.622
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:57.124
What is this?

00:00:57.224 --> 00:00:58.292
Oh, my God, it's a nut!

00:00:58.392 --> 00:00:59.393
It's a little nut!

00:00:59.493 --> 00:01:00.594
What did we just say,
Devon?

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:02.729
Is this (bleep) "Memento"?

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.231
Are you an f-ing
goldfish, Devon?

00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:05.632
Are we in your fish bowl?

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.501
Oh, look, a little
plastic treasure chest.

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:09.403
(bleep) you, Devon!

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:11.238
Do you know what would
happen to me if I ate that?

00:01:11.338 --> 00:01:14.074
Her face will swell up,
she will turn purple.

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:15.108
She willose oxygen.

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:16.944
Have you seen "Gravity"?
I did.

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:18.145
Was that your favorite part,

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:19.580
when they lost
(bleep) oxygen, Devon?

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:20.681
Yes.

00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:22.082
When I die,
it'll be your fault.

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:23.383
You'll have to go to
my mother's door

00:01:23.517 --> 00:01:25.085
with a folded American flag

00:01:25.152 --> 00:01:26.753
and say, "Thank you
for her service.

00:01:26.854 --> 00:01:28.455
I'm Devon,
your daughter's killer."

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:32.292
Look, I'm really sorry
about the bread.

00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:37.297
I swear, I will make sure
that your meal is nut-free.

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:39.233
Thank you so much.

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.467
Okay.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:42.769
Uh, so our
specials tonight.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.004
I think
I know what I want.

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:45.939
Oh, yeah, me too.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:47.241
What do I want?

00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:48.775
What do <i>I</i> want?

00:01:48.876 --> 00:01:49.877
I'll have--

00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:52.679
I'll have the nut--
Oh, no.

00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:54.114
The arugula salad.

00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:55.649
I'll have
the arugula salad.

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:56.650
Are there nuts
in that?

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.651
No.

00:01:57.751 --> 00:01:58.752
(sighs)

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:01.922
But I will triple-check.

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:03.624
Nice job, Devon.
Thank you so much.

00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:05.959
Thank you.

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:07.794
Aw, he's sweet.

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:10.364
Two arugula salads.

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:12.499
Are there any nuts
in those?

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.901
Nope.

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:15.936
Great.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.072
â™ª

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:28.315
(girls screaming)

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:30.951
No!

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.452
(shrieking)

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:34.221
No!

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:39.293
No!

00:02:39.393 --> 00:02:41.862
What did we say?!

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:44.198
What did we say?!

00:02:44.298 --> 00:02:45.465
Everything all right here?

00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:47.134
No!
