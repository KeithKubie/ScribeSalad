00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.992
- [Voiceover] So we have
sum here of two plus six

00:00:01.992 --> 00:00:03.325
plus 18 plus 54.

00:00:04.335 --> 00:00:07.061
And we can obviously just
evaluate it, add up these numbers.

00:00:07.061 --> 00:00:10.099
But what I want to do is
I wanna use it as practice

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.255
for rewriting a series like
this using sigma notation.

00:00:14.255 --> 00:00:16.262
So let's just think about
what's happening here.

00:00:16.262 --> 00:00:17.623
Let's see if we can see any pattern

00:00:17.623 --> 00:00:19.391
from one term to the next.

00:00:19.391 --> 00:00:21.812
Let's see, to go from two to six,

00:00:21.812 --> 00:00:23.597
we could say we are adding four,

00:00:23.597 --> 00:00:25.261
but then when we go from six to 18,

00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:29.203
we're not adding four
now, we are now adding 12,

00:00:29.203 --> 00:00:31.453
so it's not an arithmetic series.

00:00:31.453 --> 00:00:33.669
Let's see, maybe it's a geometric.

00:00:33.669 --> 00:00:36.463
So to go from two to
six, what are we doing?

00:00:36.463 --> 00:00:39.213
Well, we're multiplying by three.

00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:43.661
So, let me write that,
we're multiplying by three.

00:00:43.661 --> 00:00:45.291
To go to six to 18, what are we doing?

00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:46.669
Well, we're multiplying by three.

00:00:46.669 --> 00:00:49.629
To go to 18 to 54, we're
multiplying by three.

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.912
So it looks like this is
indeed a geometric series,

00:00:52.912 --> 00:00:55.022
and we have a common ratio of three.

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:57.807
So let's rewrite this
using sigma notation.

00:00:57.807 --> 00:01:01.533
So this is going to be the
sum, and we could start,

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.992
well, there's a bunch of
ways that we could write it.

00:01:03.992 --> 00:01:08.159
We could write it as, let's
start with k equaling zero.

00:01:09.015 --> 00:01:12.808
And so we have our
first term which is two,

00:01:12.808 --> 00:01:17.071
so it's two times our common
ratio to the kth power.

00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:21.073
So times our common ratio
three to the k power.

00:01:21.073 --> 00:01:23.224
So before I even write how
many terms we have here

00:01:23.224 --> 00:01:26.529
or how high we go with our k,
let's see if this makes sense.

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:29.973
When k is equal to zero, this
is gonna be two times three

00:01:29.973 --> 00:01:31.686
to the zeroth power.

00:01:31.686 --> 00:01:34.458
So that's two times one,

00:01:34.458 --> 00:01:36.409
so that's this first term right there.

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.392
When k is equal to one,
that'll be two times three

00:01:38.392 --> 00:01:39.402
to the first power.

00:01:39.402 --> 00:01:40.638
Well, that's gonna be six.

00:01:40.638 --> 00:01:44.106
And then when k is, so
this is k equals zero.

00:01:44.106 --> 00:01:45.585
Let me do this in a different color.

00:01:45.585 --> 00:01:49.164
So this is k equals zero,
I say different color,

00:01:49.164 --> 00:01:51.014
and then I do the same color.

00:01:51.014 --> 00:01:55.181
All right, so this is k equals
zero, this is k equals one,

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.571
this is k equals two, and then
this would be k equals three,

00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:03.554
which would be two times
three to the third power.

00:02:03.554 --> 00:02:06.730
So two times 27 is indeed equal to 54.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.688
So we're gonna go up
to k is equal to three.

00:02:10.688 --> 00:02:13.349
So that's one way that
we could write this.

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.270
There's other ways that
you could write this.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.839
You could write it as,

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:21.130
so we're gonna still do,
we have our first term

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.176
right over here, but for
example, we could write it

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:27.965
as our common ratio, and I'll
use a different index now,

00:02:27.965 --> 00:02:30.756
let's say to the n minus one power.

00:02:30.756 --> 00:02:32.371
And instead of starting at zero,

00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:34.121
I could start at n equals one,

00:02:34.121 --> 00:02:35.234
but notice it has the same effect.

00:02:35.234 --> 00:02:36.934
When you say n equals
one, it's one minus one,

00:02:36.934 --> 00:02:38.891
you get the zeroth power.

00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:43.313
And so we're increasing
all of the indexes by one,

00:02:43.313 --> 00:02:44.608
so instead of going from zero to three,

00:02:44.608 --> 00:02:46.769
we're going from one to four.

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.079
And you could verify that this
is still going to work out,

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.224
'cause when n is equal to four,

00:02:52.224 --> 00:02:54.476
it's three to the four minus one power,

00:02:54.476 --> 00:02:55.972
so it's still three to the third power,

00:02:55.972 --> 00:02:58.946
which is 27 times two which still 54.

00:02:58.946 --> 00:03:02.779
So this is n equals one,
that is n equals two,

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:08.961
that is n equals three,
and that is n equals four.

00:03:08.961 --> 00:03:10.609
But either way, these are
ways that you could write it

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.359
using sigma notation.
