00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.670
You are listening to radio lab radio from W N y.

2
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.510
S. E. N. N. P. R. Hello. Hello. Hello. Um,

3
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.220
how do I wanna introduce this tape to you? Okay. I'm not sure that,

4
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.840
have you heard this tape coach? I have not.

5
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.500
This is actually the first one of my first radio pieces.

6
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.770
You're not going to hear or saying as the run freefall. And uh,

7
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.420
I had two friends who are in love

8
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.330
with their helmets and I have since fallen out of love and fallen in love with

9
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:34.140
other people.

10
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.870
But at the time they were very much in love and they had decided they were going

11
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:41.790
to go skydiving together together. Everything looks good. You're ready for this?

12
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:46.260
Yeah, I gotcha. So this is my friend Jordan. He is getting into a plane.

13
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.640
All right, so let's check your harness.

14
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.690
It's got a mini disc recorder scrap to his chest and I should just say that the

15
00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:53.430
piece and end up being really dumb,

16
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.440
but it contains the best moment of tape I think I've ever recorded and you're

17
00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:03.300
going to hear it coming up. Okay. So as Jordan gets up into the sky,

18
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.350
if I don't ask myself, they're like seven thousand eight thousand fee.

19
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:09.360
I don't remember the number, but they opened the door

20
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.210
steps just to the edge and you'll hear this going to be a moment.

21
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.883
Just listen.

22
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.010
<v 1>[inaudible] okay.</v>

23
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.140
<v 0>He is out of the plane now and he's hurling through space free</v>

24
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.073
<v 1>falling</v>

25
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.350
<v 0>within like few seconds. He's at a hundred miles an hour.</v>

26
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.980
<v 1>[inaudible] up to one 50</v>

27
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.300
[inaudible]

28
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.620
<v 0>175 miles an hour,</v>

29
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.180
<v 1>maybe 200 I don't know.</v>

30
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.143
[inaudible]

31
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.573
<v 0>there.</v>

32
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.510
That was incredible. Oh my God.

33
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.370
That's the moment where the parachute opens.

34
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.750
Any is floating.

35
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.093
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

36
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.360
<v 0>Oh, I haven't to the girl. I don't know. You don't know. Well,</v>

37
00:02:26.361 --> 00:02:28.400
her mini just recorded a malfunction in the way down,

38
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.980
but let's just rewind that back for a second.

39
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.590
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

40
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.590
<v 0>that transition right there from falling body to floating body.</v>

41
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.620
Yeah.

42
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.790
I love that because at first he sounds like this dinosaur falling through the

43
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:46.890
air, but then the sound changes and it's just like,

44
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.930
I dunno. It's like this moment of somebody falling out of control

45
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.960
and then falling back in. Yeah.

46
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.790
Seems like a good way to open this show because this is going to be a show where

47
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:05.530
we take this idea of falling and we walk it in all kinds of different

48
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:09.520
directions, like poor outcomes we use to snap. That's one.

49
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.720
I loved him so much. That one. It's very dark.

50
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:17.820
It's very hellish. And that's what I was knitting. 81 packing.

51
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.300
Apparently communities there are 14,932 ways to fall on the radio.

52
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.920
In this hour we will bring you, I'm Jana. Boom. Rod.

53
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.170
I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab and we are rolling.

54
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.090
<v 2>Oh</v>

55
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.163
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

56
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.010
<v 3>number one. This one.</v>

57
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.850
<v 4>This one is about, I don't what you call it, terror or just, no,</v>

58
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.710
it's about time. Really time. Okay, so this it,

59
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:59.790
we'll just call this one falling time. How do you,

60
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.990
this is David Eagleman. Is David here? He's a neuroscientist.

61
00:04:03.991 --> 00:04:07.710
But back when he was a kid, how old were you? Just to sort of, I was,

62
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.180
I was eight years old. He hadn't experienced, which he says changed his life.

63
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.610
Yeah. He was, uh,

64
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.580
playing in his subdivision in Houston and there was a house nearby that was

65
00:04:17.581 --> 00:04:20.770
under construction and my father told me not to go climbing around on the house

66
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.230
center construction, but I was a boy.

67
00:04:22.231 --> 00:04:26.670
So I did and I was looking at the edge of the roof and I stepped on it,

68
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.150
but in fact it was tar paper hanging over the edge and I, and I fell. Oh,

69
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.100
so you stepped onto the air. In fact, you just went away. Exactly.

70
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.463
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

71
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.500
<v 4>what happened was the events seemed to take a very long yeah,</v>

72
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.353
<v 6>time.</v>

73
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.030
I thought about whether I had time to grab for the edge of the roof and I

74
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:50.440
realized it was too late for that.

75
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.680
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

76
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.190
<v 6>so then I was looking down at the ground as the red brick floor was coming</v>

77
00:04:56.191 --> 00:05:00.720
towards me and I was thinking about Alice in wonderland,

78
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.560
how this must be, what it was like for her when she fell down the rabbit hole.

79
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.610
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

80
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.110
<v 6>how long, by the way, was it from the top of the roof to the ground below</v>

81
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.830
<v 4>0.8. Six seconds. That's how long it takes to fall 12 feet.</v>

82
00:05:16.831 --> 00:05:17.790
I calculated that later.

83
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.100
That'd be one 1000 and this whole experience left David Eagleman with a question

84
00:05:23.101 --> 00:05:24.660
that he could not get out of his mind.

85
00:05:24.661 --> 00:05:29.070
What happens to people when they're in a life or death situation and they have

86
00:05:29.071 --> 00:05:31.350
these thoughts that seem to take a long time.

87
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.880
So at some point I realized I needed to study this. How are you?

88
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.250
How would you even study that? Well, the first thing I did,

89
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.000
I took my entire laboratory to astroworld,

90
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.560
<v 0>which is the amusement park here in Houston,</v>

91
00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.260
and we went on all of the scariest roller coasters.

92
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.610
We brought all of our equipment and our stopwatches and had a great time.

93
00:05:52.611 --> 00:05:53.600
But it turns out, yeah, nothing

94
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.870
<v 4>there was scary enough to actually induce this fear for your,</v>

95
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.400
that appears to be required for the slow motion effect.

96
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.170
So I searched around and I finally found something called Scad diving.

97
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.090
Scad diving stands for suspended catch air device. Where do you do that?

98
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.840
It turns out it's illegal in Houston, but I found one in Dallas.

99
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.440
So we made a road trip up to Dallas.

100
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.290
<v 0>All right, jumping number one.</v>

101
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.880
And we actually found a reporter in Dallas who agreed to give us a try on,

102
00:06:24.881 --> 00:06:27.160
and then I'll put this on over the harm. No one's ever died on this thing,

103
00:06:27.161 --> 00:06:30.310
right? Nope. This is April. I feel like my heart's in my throat.

104
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:31.443
She's very brave.

105
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.230
You ride up to the top of this tower in this very rickety little elevator,

106
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.123
right?

107
00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:41.280
<v 7>Okay. We're rising up in the elevator right now. 150 foot tall tower.</v>

108
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.710
Not too fast. Climbing up and up and up.

109
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.640
It doesn't seem that far when you're down there. Up here, it seems really far.

110
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.550
It's like a 15 story building ever halfway. Okay.

111
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.371
This is just halfway.

112
00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:57.180
I'm already freaking out and my hands are starting to shake the very top.

113
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.030
<v 4>You're suspended</v>

114
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.120
<v 7>like this? Yep. Okay. You're hooked up to a carabiner. Oh God. Okay,</v>

115
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:07.930
so all the way back and back.

116
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.580
<v 0>Okay, so I want you to imagine this. You're up in the sky.</v>

117
00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.680
You are facing the clouds, not the ground.

118
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.140
You are attached to something which is about to be severed.

119
00:07:17.141 --> 00:07:19.990
And you will fall totally free into the void,

120
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.890
unable to see what's about to happen to you. Presuming a net.

121
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.100
<v 7>Oh God. Okay. Let me die.</v>

122
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:30.933
Three

123
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:36.160
to really nervous right now and [inaudible].

124
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:37.240
<v 8>Okay,</v>

125
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.210
<v 4>wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. One thing I forgot to mention,</v>

126
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.620
<v 0>uh, April actually wasn't part of David's study, but is she had been,</v>

127
00:07:43.621 --> 00:07:46.950
she would have been wearing around her wrist, this little device,

128
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.020
new device called the perceptual chronometer.

129
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:53.500
That's about the size of a watch and it flashes numbers super fast. Yeah,

130
00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.890
way too fast to see normally. But the thought is if April falls

131
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:05.910
and everything starts to sue down, well then these numbers should slow too,

132
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:09.530
so that if she looks at her wrist that she's falling, she should be able

133
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.310
<v 4>to now read the watch.</v>

134
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:16.960
That would be impossible under normal circumstances.

135
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:23.420
<v 7>Back to April. Really nervous right now. Three to and</v>

136
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:27.003
<v 8>[inaudible].</v>

137
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:32.020
<v 7>Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. This is scary.</v>

138
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:33.063
Smoking in my life.

139
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.490
<v 4>I should probably tell you guys the results of this study, but I just,</v>

140
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:41.270
some people report that time slowed down enough for them to read the number.

141
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.030
I'm alive. No, no.

142
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:49.310
Turns out when you're falling you don't actually see in slow motion.

143
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.510
Ah, yeah. It's not equivalent to the way a slow motion camera would work.

144
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.890
Even though people feel like it's in slow motion.

145
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:59.420
It's something more interesting than that because here's the thing,

146
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.100
right after people did the jump,

147
00:09:01.101 --> 00:09:05.570
he would ask them how long they thought their fall took the right answer.

148
00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.590
If they'd had a stopwatch just under three seconds. But what people would say,

149
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.540
<v 10>how long when you were calling, how long did it, 10 seconds. It felt,</v>

150
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.060
felt like a turn at time with stopped.

151
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.170
<v 4>So how do you explain that?</v>

152
00:09:18.171 --> 00:09:22.470
That like time's not slowing in the moment but seems to be slowing after the

153
00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:26.250
moment? Well, I came to understand that it's a trick of memory.

154
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.280
Normally our memories are like sieves were, we're,

155
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.220
we're not writing down most of what's passing through our system,

156
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.330
but he thinks that when you go

157
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:35.480
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

158
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.120
<v 4>no life or death moment in that instant,</v>

159
00:09:38.121 --> 00:09:42.290
our memories go wide open because that's what memory is for.

160
00:09:42.291 --> 00:09:43.910
It's for when everything hits the fan.

161
00:09:43.911 --> 00:09:45.440
You want to write it down and remember it.

162
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.950
<v 10>So all of it goes right to your hard drive. That clouds the feeling of the air.</v>

163
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.370
Oh look, there's a guy in a blue shirt. So when you read that back out,

164
00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:57.030
the experience feels like it must've taken a very long time.

165
00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.320
It must have. Normally the trivial stuff gets dumped,

166
00:10:01.321 --> 00:10:02.940
but in this situation it gets written

167
00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:07.220
<v 4>and then you realize how much trivial stuff is in there. So for example, I, uh,</v>

168
00:10:07.221 --> 00:10:10.550
I just recently interviewed a gentleman who had been in a motorcycle accident

169
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.270
and as his helmet was bouncing along off the asphalt,

170
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:18.880
he was composing a little song to the rhythm of his helmet. Balancing was,

171
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.850
was he in his helmet or had the helmet flown off? He was in his helmet.

172
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.570
That's, he was here before.

173
00:10:26.571 --> 00:10:30.920
I get far too loudly was he at okay as a result of this bouncy was okay. Wow,

174
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.560
that's amazing. So his head was going boom, boom, boom.

175
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.740
<v 1>And he's like, hey, it's kind of a good rhythm.</v>

176
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.270
Kill your paste head

177
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.230
<v 10>[inaudible] makes you smile</v>

178
00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:52.933
<v 1>through the center.</v>

179
00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:56.523
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

180
00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.860
<v 10>chasing rabbits</v>

181
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.013
<v 1>through the center.</v>

182
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:22.763
[inaudible] [inaudible]

183
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.540
<v 4>number two, falling in love from producer Lulu Miller. So set this up for us.</v>

184
00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:29.583
Well this is

185
00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:34.780
<v 11>a love story and in some ways it's a very typical love story and in other ways</v>

186
00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:40.270
it's just not yet. The girl is a really good friend of mine.

187
00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.220
We're going to call her Serita and the boy will call Simon [inaudible].

188
00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.870
When was the first time that you ever saw Simon?

189
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.970
<v 4>Um, I don't remember the exact moment,</v>

190
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.490
but I do remember sitting in the lunch room with the girls

191
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:58.960
<v 11>at the table and sort of scoping out the boys and he was definitely the</v>

192
00:11:58.961 --> 00:12:03.730
skinniest. He just looked like a really nice guy,

193
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.620
olive skinned, thick hair,

194
00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:09.790
and he made really good eye contact

195
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:15.760
to the point where it's a little flirty. There's no break

196
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.670
<v 13>in the eye contact. It's like constant</v>

197
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.020
<v 11>to the point where I think it could be uncomfortable</v>

198
00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.760
<v 13>for some people, but</v>

199
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.520
<v 11>I just really, I really liked it.</v>

200
00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:31.800
<v 10>When was the first time you talk? Well,</v>

201
00:12:31.801 --> 00:12:33.900
we had a class together our freshman year.

202
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:39.140
We talked a lot in class and after class on the paths around campus and that's

203
00:12:39.661 --> 00:12:42.600
how it went all freshman year, sophomore year, junior year.

204
00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:46.860
They're sort of like particles that just kept colliding in the lobby of the dorm

205
00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:51.570
on the sidewalk and each time it was new, new topic or a new idea. For instance,

206
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:55.050
one of them would walk by carrying a book Poisonwood Bible and the other one

207
00:12:55.051 --> 00:12:57.960
would say, Oh, I love that book. Yeah, they just

208
00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:02.230
<v 11>click and again eye contact.</v>

209
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:03.780
<v 12>No,</v>

210
00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.330
<v 11>we would talk and</v>

211
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:10.390
<v 13>be connected with the eyes</v>

212
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:12.850
<v 12>[inaudible]</v>

213
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:17.650
<v 11>that's what I really was falling for about him and there was like an</v>

214
00:13:17.651 --> 00:13:22.000
attentiveness beyond. I want to ask you one thing, which like you just said,

215
00:13:22.001 --> 00:13:25.210
I'm falling for him. Is that the way it felt?

216
00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.300
I mean people always say falling in love. Did it feel like falling?

217
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.670
Yeah, it does because it feels out of control.

218
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:39.180
And there's a moment where it feels like I let go and allow myself to feel it.

219
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.590
Totally. So there were some moments where she wondered,

220
00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:49.180
she should. Yeah, like sometimes she'd walk by Simon on the path,

221
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.780
look up and smile and keep snuck me.

222
00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.810
But then we run into each other and we talk.

223
00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.860
She let herself start falling again. This is really fun in this moment.

224
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.600
And I realized years later that every time we ran into each other,

225
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:09.340
he has no idea that those were me. Really?

226
00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:14.230
Yeah. Hi. Hello. Could you hear me? Vaguely. Yeah.

227
00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:20.440
Um, can we start out talking about your condition? Yeah. What's it called?

228
00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.130
Pros. OPEC. Nausea pros. Oh, peg nausea. Yes.

229
00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:28.510
Sounds like a delicious fruit salad. It could be a cocktail. And what is that?

230
00:14:28.511 --> 00:14:31.930
What is that word? Uh, let's see. Well,

231
00:14:31.931 --> 00:14:36.931
Agnosia is a lack or an inability in Provo is the Greek for face.

232
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.080
Oh, face blindness. This of course is Simon.

233
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:44.590
There's a little piece of my brain that's missing and that I have a really,

234
00:14:44.591 --> 00:14:49.120
really hard time recognizing faces, remembering faces. And how does that work?

235
00:14:49.121 --> 00:14:52.730
Is it just that you forget where know people from? No,

236
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.810
if I passed it in the street, I can't swear that I've ever seen you before.

237
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.880
So he didn't know.

238
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.390
He couldn't string those together as all the same person having the same

239
00:15:02.391 --> 00:15:05.660
conversation. Right. No Way. Even their first kiss,

240
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:10.100
he didn't realize he was kissing a girl. He'd actually known for years. Yes.

241
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:14.090
Yeah. So were you like totally shocked? I was totally blown away.

242
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:18.890
Who was that person to you? I knew it was the cheese plate girl.

243
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:24.830
Yeah. Not now. It was fieldhouse girl. So what did you say?

244
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:28.280
I think I just asked a lot of question. You know, she was interested in like,

245
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.410
oh, does this work? Yeah.

246
00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:35.520
So I'm probably said if you went to the park and started looking at trees or

247
00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:38.150
shapes are different, their sizes are different,

248
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:43.160
but to try to remember a thousand or 2000 of those, how do you pick it up?

249
00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:46.390
It's just hard. It's just computationally difficult. Yeah.

250
00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:50.240
What details did you know about her? I knew it was good to be with her.

251
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.040
The experience of being with her,

252
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:56.870
I think ran ahead of my sense of her biography.

253
00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:02.540
So it was a leap. It was a leap. Yeah.

254
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.053
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

255
00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.090
<v 11>let's try this.</v>

256
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:08.623
<v 14>Uh,</v>

257
00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:13.530
<v 11>so they embark on this relationship, which, you know, has its quirks. Right.</v>

258
00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.100
Like for instance, if they were meeting up somewhere public,

259
00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.110
I'm going to need to wave first. Hmm.

260
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.580
And backpacks is always gotta wear the same. One voice really helps.

261
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.930
But I would get a little bit anxious when we'd have to meet each other

262
00:16:26.931 --> 00:16:28.010
somewhere. Yeah.

263
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:32.240
Because I knew if another curly haired girl walked there before I did.

264
00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.530
I'm thinking, is that her like smiling way?

265
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.710
But it's just awkward. It's just kind of embarrassing. Yeah.

266
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:45.260
And somewhere along the line Serita found out that that eye contact that drew

267
00:16:45.261 --> 00:16:48.080
her in, it wasn't really about her.

268
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:53.710
It was something he did with everyone on the off chance that they're his friend.

269
00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:57.230
Wow. That's what I think the eye contact is. So did that,

270
00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.770
did that make you step back at all? No.

271
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.600
<v 10>By then I had already fell</v>

272
00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:11.290
and plus I think Serita at that time was getting really into Buddhism. Great.

273
00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:12.640
And not just a little bit.

274
00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.000
She went and lived with Buddhist nuns for a year in Sri Lanka.

275
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:20.440
And so the idea of impermanence and you know,

276
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:24.520
we think we have a self, but what really is a sell,

277
00:17:24.521 --> 00:17:28.780
what it means to know someone. All of that was part of my world.

278
00:17:28.781 --> 00:17:33.781
And so this idea that he didn't recognize me didn't seem so as important as the

279
00:17:36.581 --> 00:17:39.290
present moment. It just kept coming on

280
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:42.690
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

281
00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:46.650
<v 10>and then what happened? You graduate and then did you move in together? Yeah,</v>

282
00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:49.920
it was it in Philly. It was in Philly on street.

283
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.060
<v 11>A year and a half goes by and then one day</v>

284
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:59.220
I woke up and swear to God all the leaves fell off.

285
00:17:59.221 --> 00:18:04.221
The trees fall turned into winter and Simon told Saritta it was over something

286
00:18:06.241 --> 00:18:09.780
about a core that I'm lacking.

287
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:14.670
He said you were lacking a core. Yeah. What does that mean?

288
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:20.940
I don't know. I'm not sure what it means.

289
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:27.070
God, I knew the core would come up. The core of what I,

290
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.260
what I was trying to talk about was lingering doubt.

291
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.220
Whether,

292
00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.990
whether this was it wondering could I fall further,

293
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:42.110
he just wasn't sure that he loved me and then at that point kind of backtracked

294
00:18:43.231 --> 00:18:47.250
and denied having ever really loved me. Yeah.

295
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:52.230
Um, but that's how it was.

296
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:58.080
Did you feel like you at a certain point started to actually fall out of love

297
00:18:58.081 --> 00:19:00.900
with him? Like, no, there was no falling.

298
00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:06.620
It was just like I was at the bottom of a well sitting and stewing

299
00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:12.660
high loved him. Yeah. So much.

300
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.800
And would you see him in the neighborhood cause you're still neighbors, right?

301
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:17.703
Right. Yeah.

302
00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:23.370
We would see each other around at parties and he was working at a restaurant

303
00:19:24.701 --> 00:19:29.701
that had an outdoor patio and I walked by there a few times without him knowing

304
00:19:31.811 --> 00:19:35.860
it was me or I could see him and look at him.

305
00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:42.510
But you got to just be hidden. Yeah. I got to just walk by.

306
00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:44.243
Yeah.

307
00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:51.010
So there is comfort in that. Yeah.

308
00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:59.940
I didn't know. I didn't know that.

309
00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:06.740
Yeah. It's hard somehow. Yeah. Um,

310
00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.260
but I wouldn't that I would see her,

311
00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:17.260
she, it's like she faded back into the crowd. Yeah.

312
00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:20.383
Quickly.

313
00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.670
I don't become lost.

314
00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:30.720
It's actually haunting to me to hear that. Hmm.

315
00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:56.573
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

316

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.300
a think I'm fine

318
00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:21.210

<v 0>Hey, this is jad. We are celebrating a milestone over here at radio lab.</v>

329
00:22:00.551 --> 00:22:05.440
We have been invading your ears for 15 years.

330
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:10.570
Freaks me out just to say it. 15 years. We have been making radio stories,

331
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.520
high fi, crazy sound design, strange curiosity driven stories,

332
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:20.950
and a, we're celebrating. So check out our latest episode from the archives.

334
00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:31.590
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and today, uh,

335
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:35.310
today we're falling in many different flavors and we're at number three.

336
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:40.000
<v 6>Next we have a story of a different kind of fall. All right, or father? Yeah,</v>

337
00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:41.590
it comes from science writer, David Coleman.

338
00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:45.400
One article in particular that he wrote caught our attention. All right.

339
00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:48.550
I'm going to quote you to yourself. Okay. Nowadays, chew enough.

340
00:22:48.551 --> 00:22:52.960
We know quite a bit about cats. They'd been dissected in uncountable numbers,

341
00:22:52.961 --> 00:22:56.560
their anatomy, their physiology, their behavior had been my neatly studied,

342
00:22:56.950 --> 00:23:00.430
but there's so much we still don't know among all the other intractable issues.

343
00:23:00.431 --> 00:23:05.431
One in particular interest to me and that is what's the terminal velocity of a

344
00:23:05.561 --> 00:23:07.540
plummeting cat y.

345
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.280
Can you give me a little history of why? Why did that question interest you?

346
00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.950
I mean, when I used to write for outside magazine,

347
00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:18.520
I would browse through journalists and I would come across obscure papers.

348
00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:23.670
How I happened upon the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association

349
00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.190
familiarly known as J v a. M. A,

350
00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.160
I don't know. I don't remember,

351
00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:35.200
but I'm sure that that was the starting point because it was in that journal.

352
00:23:35.201 --> 00:23:38.950
The David ran across a research paper. Yeah, like two vets,

353
00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:40.930
Wayne Whitney and Cheryl.

354
00:23:40.931 --> 00:23:45.931
Mel Hoff who worked in the mid town veterinary hospital and they noticed

355
00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:46.983
<v 0>that, um,</v>

356
00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:52.310
that in Manhattan there were a lot of cats falling out of windows high windows,

357
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.620
falling off ledges falling off roofs and what, what is it, what is a lot?

358
00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.570
I mean, how many cats were coming into this place?

359
00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.850
<v 7>We saw 132 cats fall in a five month summer period.</v>

360
00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:09.220
And you're one 33 that's in her own house. She actually works in the, um,

361
00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:12.590
in the veterinary hospital here at the Animal Medical Center and she's been

362
00:24:12.591 --> 00:24:16.460
there since that research paper was written back in 1986 when I came to New York

363
00:24:16.461 --> 00:24:18.980
City. I said, what do you mean cats fall out of buildings?

364
00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.080
It doesn't make sense. I said, why would the cat fall out?

365
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:22.430
But we'll get back to her and just a little bit,

366
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.800
<v 0>130, two and five months. That's almost a reign of cats. Well, no,</v>

367
00:24:27.801 --> 00:24:30.520
don't say that because I think people should visit New York without,

368
00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:34.310
without receiving umbrellas. You too. What are you doing?

369
00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:38.270
I'm doing the math to see how many that is in a week of, uh,

370
00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:43.790
[inaudible] it's about, that's about a cat a day. It's a shame.

371
00:24:43.791 --> 00:24:45.920
We can only be about that. But according to David,

372
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:48.740
it's actually not as much of a shame as you would think.

373
00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:53.000
22 of the cats that they saw had fallen from eight stories or higher.

374
00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:55.040
And out of those 22 only one died.

375
00:24:55.940 --> 00:25:00.710
21 Katz survived from eight stories or higher. Wow. That's a long way.

376
00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:05.740
And there was one cat that fell 32 stories and the cat had a little bit of sort

377
00:25:06.051 --> 00:25:10.340
of thoracic bruising and a chip tooth and that was it. I mean,

378
00:25:10.341 --> 00:25:13.600
how in the world do cats? I mean, we all know Kathleen on their feet. Yeah,

379
00:25:13.601 --> 00:25:18.170
yeah, yeah. But how do they do that? Like these are not magical creatures. Wow.

380
00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.240
If you go back about a thousand years,

381
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:24.290
they thought that they consorted with witches, with the devil,

382
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.290
and their reputation got darker and darker.

383
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.860
The more people started to distrust and dislike cats,

384
00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:34.220
the more they started to do horrible things to them.

385
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:38.090
It would put cats in a barrel and then they went run the barrel through with

386
00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:43.680
sword. Oh, I'm also throwing them out of windows. The defenestration of cats.

387
00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.310
W what is a defenestration means throwing up the window.

388
00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:51.350
Really an Estrus d o Jad. Add that to your active vocabulary today.

389
00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:55.280
I plan to, so what would happen when they would defend a straight these cats,

390
00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.130
the cats would land on their feet and walk away.

391
00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:00.530
That made people even crazier.

392
00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:10.130
<v 7>No, of course we love our gas now we don't do that to our cats anymore.</v>

393
00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.520
But when we went to visit and back as a veterinary hospital,

394
00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:17.300
we were asking her about the falling cats research paper, which is good.

395
00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.820
The Feline High Road, the Feline, a High Rise Syndrome.

396
00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:25.380
Then the mystery of how cats can fall from these amazing heights and survive.

397
00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:28.620
Yeah. You've got a lot deeper. Yeah. Well, Pat's,

398
00:26:28.621 --> 00:26:31.560
it felt less than five stories.

399
00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:36.120
They did find she's not too bad cats or fell over nine stories.

400
00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:40.230
They did find too, she's not so bad, which is weird, but cats,

401
00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.090
it fell between five and nine,

402
00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:47.600
five and nine floors had really serious injuries and had more injuries per cat.

403
00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.940
Yeah, so cats, the fill a little ways. We're okay.

404
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:55.980
Castle fall a long ways where, okay, weirdly, but this five to nine thing,

405
00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:58.730
so yeah. Yeah. What does that,

406
00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:02.370
so we had to get a physicist to help us explain this.

407
00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:06.600
This is where we get back to a qualm and called the terminal velocity issue.

408
00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.440
Or here's how Ann put it to us. Well,

409
00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:11.760
say you're living on the 30th floor of a building and it's summertime.

410
00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:13.370
You get done at work at five, you go home,

411
00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:17.250
get there about six the apartment's hot and stuffy and you open up those windows

412
00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:23.400
and fluffy says, I'd like that pigeon out there.

413
00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:25.020
And the next thing you know the missteps

414
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.133
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

415
00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:33.940
<v 6>as the cat starts to fall, he's all disoriented and almost immediately,</v>

416
00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:37.450
probably within the first six feet, the cat's brain says, okay,

417
00:27:37.451 --> 00:27:40.270
turn your front half over. Now bring your back legs around.

418
00:27:40.271 --> 00:27:43.420
That's like instant cat can apparently do that move lickety split.

419
00:27:43.421 --> 00:27:47.350
But the cat is still speeding up, going faster and faster. Three floors,

420
00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.820
five floors, seven floors.

421
00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:54.030
After falling about nine floors and accelerating to speeds up to about 60 miles

422
00:27:54.101 --> 00:27:55.690
an hour, something happens.

423
00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:01.220
You hit an equilibrium between the pull of gravity and wind resistance.

424
00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:05.570
What it means is gravity is pulling down on you and the peak pole is between

425
00:28:05.571 --> 00:28:09.230
five and nine floors for a cat. But after nine floors,

426
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:13.010
the wind resistance, which all the oil has been pushing back up on you,

427
00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:14.560
starts to slow you down.

428
00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:17.360
<v 0>You don't speed up anymore. So that's your cruising speed.</v>

429
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:18.490
That's your cruising speed. Yeah.

430
00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:20.120
<v 7>No.</v>

431
00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:24.200
<v 6>After the cat's hit terminal velocity and the sensation of acceleration was</v>

432
00:28:24.201 --> 00:28:25.940
gone, they relaxed.

433
00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:31.630
Did they sort of stretch out like a flying squirrel

434
00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.750
and then they hit the ground belly flop.

435
00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:40.200
<v 0>And you're saying that because they hit the screws and speed and then relaxed</v>

436
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:43.800
into the flying squirrel, the impact is less. Yes.

437
00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:46.670
<v 7>Yeah. And, and our record here, it wasn't in this paper,</v>

438
00:28:46.671 --> 00:28:50.780
but our record is 42 floors in the cat walked away. Wow. 42.

439
00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.530
Is that a lucky cat or that just plain physics?

440
00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:57.350
Should cats everywhere go to the 42nd floor before jumping out of the window?

441
00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:02.360
No cat hands ever jumped out of a window. That's right. Stay indoors. No fluffy

442
00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:03.573
<v 6>back. [inaudible]</v>

443
00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:11.240
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

444
00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:15.680
<v 0>okay, so the next, uh, falling, what are we gonna call these falling, uh,</v>

445
00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:19.570
falling volume nodes. Nova. Is there an f word you could use? Features. Yes.

446
00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:23.610
Oh Great. Okay. Our next falling feature. Oh boy. Okay. No,

447
00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:24.940
I mean it's just you.

448
00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.920
We invited Columbia University physics Professor Brian Green into our studios.

449
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:31.210
I get to play with any buttons. Uh, yeah,

450
00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:34.210
we wanted to ask him [inaudible] really one of the most basic questions you

451
00:29:34.211 --> 00:29:38.260
could ask a physicist, why do we fall?

452
00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.950
You know, we all know that wrote down

453
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:46.540
<v 11>a law of gravity to calculate how gravity axa from one object to another.</v>

454
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:48.490
Yeah. Like if you dropped your pen, that's right.

455
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:52.060
But there's a difference between being able to predict what will happen and be

456
00:29:52.061 --> 00:29:56.620
able to explain why it happens. And Newton could not explain why it happens.

457
00:29:56.621 --> 00:29:58.600
He could only tell you what would happen. But I mean,

458
00:29:58.601 --> 00:30:01.120
how it works is it just pulls to the pen down. What does that mean though?

459
00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:04.660
Has it pull it. I don't see anything between the table and your pen.

460
00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:09.400
So what is the agent responsible for the pole? Um

461
00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:14.860
Hm. This is something, even Albert Einstein himself couldn't quite figure out.

462
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:19.090
He was struggling to understand how the force of gravity works and it was a big,

463
00:30:19.091 --> 00:30:19.900
big puzzle.

464
00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:23.590
And the legend goes that Albert Einstein was walking around one day and he found

465
00:30:23.591 --> 00:30:28.591
himself imagining a person riding in an elevator and all of a sudden the cable

466
00:30:29.171 --> 00:30:32.830
gets cut and the elevator starts a plunge right down towards the earth.

467
00:30:32.831 --> 00:30:35.800
Diversion I know is that he was actually sitting at his desk looking out the

468
00:30:35.801 --> 00:30:40.150
window and was imagining window washers falling sorta from their scaffolding.

469
00:30:40.151 --> 00:30:43.060
But it's the same, same exact idea. But anyway,

470
00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.370
we were gonna stick with the elevator version are now Einstein.

471
00:30:45.371 --> 00:30:50.080
Imagine this person standing actually on a bathroom scale in the elevator,

472
00:30:50.081 --> 00:30:52.480
in the elevator. This was before the cable gets cut.

473
00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:55.450
If the person is in the elevator standing on a scale,

474
00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:59.010
they see that they weigh 160 pounds and then snip

475
00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.510
<v 4>when the elevator cables cut,</v>

476
00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:06.710
they looked down at the scale and the scale will drop to zero because the scale

477
00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.890
will be falling away from their feet at exactly the same rate that their feet

478
00:31:09.891 --> 00:31:10.724
are falling.

479
00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:13.970
So their feet won't push on the scale any longer because this scale will be

480
00:31:13.971 --> 00:31:16.790
moving downward with them. My mind,

481
00:31:16.791 --> 00:31:20.390
I've imagined like the Hollywood movie where it's falling so fast,

482
00:31:20.391 --> 00:31:23.570
everybody kind of drift up. That's right. So Einstein said to himself,

483
00:31:23.571 --> 00:31:26.390
hang on a second, here's an environment

484
00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:31.310
<v 11>where in essence I can turn gravity off. Hmm.</v>

485
00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:34.890
Another way of saying it that flips it around and may make it more clear,

486
00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:38.400
just as you can turn gravity off by snapping the cable,

487
00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:42.090
you can actually simulate gravity by pulling on the cable.

488
00:31:42.091 --> 00:31:44.130
That pulls that elevator up really,

489
00:31:44.131 --> 00:31:47.310
really quickly because now the scale is running into your feet.

490
00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:51.450
If you're standing on that scale, they won't read 160 it might read 250 huh?

491
00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:55.590
It seems like gravity and being pulled up really fast.

492
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:59.160
They're the same thing. They are Jan, look what that look at you.

493
00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.890
You just have the insight on your own. That's right. He walked,

494
00:32:01.891 --> 00:32:05.160
he walked us 17 steps and I just made the last [inaudible] you did it.

495
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:09.270
You did it man. Wow. So whenever you're faced with a gravitational problem,

496
00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:14.130
this allowed you to ignore gravity and translate it into a problem about motion.

497
00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.850
Does that, does that solve the the what is gravity question? It just sorta, no,

498
00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.830
he then had to make one more leap and it's not obvious how we took the final

499
00:32:21.831 --> 00:32:24.620
step, but the final step was to realize that the,

500
00:32:24.621 --> 00:32:28.760
what is gravity is the curvature of space and time.

501
00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:35.630
That's illegal. I don't know what that means. This is a very difficult concept.

502
00:32:35.631 --> 00:32:40.430
Do you understand it? I understand what Einstein w tells when he explained it.

503
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:45.050
He said, if you imagine the universe as a vast rubber mat,

504
00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:50.380
a rubber mat held really, really taught, let's just take, oh,

505
00:32:50.381 --> 00:32:54.720
I don't know. Let's take the earth and just plop it on to the mat.

506
00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:58.370
So what just happened? Well then sunk into the rubber.

507
00:32:58.530 --> 00:32:59.960
It's stretched the rubber, didn't it? Yeah.

508
00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:02.740
I mean so the rubber is kind of curved around underneath it.

509
00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:07.300
In Einstein's mind he thought maybe this is how to explain gravity.

510
00:33:07.301 --> 00:33:09.160
This is what gravity is,

511
00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:14.340
that curved shape of space he said and the pen falls because it's following a

512
00:33:15.461 --> 00:33:18.670
contour in that curved space time environment.

513
00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:24.170
So like if we're living on the curve then we're constantly falling down that

514
00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:26.890
curve. Yeah. Yeah. We have no choice.

515
00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:30.550
And the reason why right now I feel the chair pushing up on me is again,

516
00:33:30.551 --> 00:33:33.710
my body also wants to slide down, but the chair's getting in the way.

517
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:37.340
So we're all sort of on some kind of slope sliding down unless we're that's

518
00:33:37.341 --> 00:33:42.180
right. That's right. I like that. Yeah. I'm now an adherent to that theory.

519
00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:45.810
Again, not knowing anything else. Now for number five,

520
00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:51.060
should we call it falling fortunes or falling fortunes is a good one for this I

521
00:33:51.061 --> 00:33:54.840
think. Yeah. Cause someone who's seeking fame and fortune and then

522
00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:59.820
<v 16>false. The idea of the a gravity hero, uh,</v>

523
00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.790
t to me, one of the things that it goes along with,

524
00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:07.750
those are terms that was used. Gravity heroes. No, that's my term.

525
00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:10.440
I like it though. It's a really catchy term. Well, thanks. Yeah,

526
00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:14.470
this is Garrett Soden. He's an author, author of, uh, defying gravity,

527
00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:18.230
original title falling, how our greatest fear became our greatest thrill, uh,

528
00:34:18.231 --> 00:34:21.640
history and speaking of history and fears and thrills.

529
00:34:21.641 --> 00:34:24.940
And I would add to that list tragedy he tells the following story.

530
00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:29.470
It really started with, uh, Niagara Falls because up to that point,

531
00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:33.570
people had done all kinds of things at night. Niagara Falls to back up.

532
00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:34.920
It is the 1850s.

533
00:34:34.921 --> 00:34:39.660
And at Niagara Falls you've got these two guys doing tight rope tricks over the

534
00:34:39.661 --> 00:34:40.494
falls. Yeah.

535
00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:45.330
A fellow named Charles Blondin name was French wire Walker and a Canadian guy

536
00:34:45.331 --> 00:34:48.450
who called himself great Freeney and they would Duke it out, right?

537
00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:52.380
London came out, strung a rope across Niagara Falls,

538
00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:56.190
put a chair down, bounced on two legs and stood on it. Well,

539
00:34:56.340 --> 00:35:00.570
one time he carried a guy over. He had to keep upping the ante. So,

540
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:01.950
so for his greatest trick,

541
00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:07.170
he carried a small cast iron stove on his back with some firewood.

542
00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.910
He got out there and he put the stove down, lit a fire,

543
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000
had a couple eggs in a frying pan and made an Omelette right over this churning.

544
00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:23.580
Like rapid. Yes. Wow. So the great Freeney came out with a washing machine.

545
00:35:23.581 --> 00:35:27.690
That was his answer. Wanda, wash some clothes out there. Yeah.

546
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:31.560
The thing to know about these guys is this is basically just a show,

547
00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.560
cause for example, the wire that they walked on,

548
00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:37.860
it was pretty wide about the diameter of a coffee and really

549
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.540
<v 11>they were just avoiding the big trick, the most anticipated trick,</v>

550
00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:43.280
the one that everybody was waiting for.

551
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:45.300
Well somebody going over the falls in the

552
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:50.390
<v 0>barrel. The guy who did that would be the real gravity.</v>

553
00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:52.480
<v 12>Whew.</v>

554
00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:57.010
<v 0>You were walking whizzes. Niagara Falls is with be great forces of nature.</v>

555
00:35:57.310 --> 00:35:58.143
Every second,

556
00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:03.180
600,000 gallons fall over the edge pound rocks below was such a fury that you

557
00:36:04.391 --> 00:36:07.120
can hear it five miles away,

558
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:12.290
<v 11>which is why in 1850 when PT Barnum saw the fall,</v>

559
00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:16.160
he said that if someone could figure out a way to go over that, that would,

560
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:20.630
that would be a huge stunt that would give them fame and fortune.

561
00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:24.050
That's Joan Marie Shipman poet. She's a poet.

562
00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:28.910
She's written a whole book for us about the first person to conquer the falls in

563
00:36:28.911 --> 00:36:33.560
a barrel and it's called Queen of the myths clean in the mist, Huh?

564
00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:35.750
Yup. So it wasn't a guy then? No,

565
00:36:35.751 --> 00:36:38.390
I just said it was a guy to set you up so that you had asked me that question

566
00:36:38.391 --> 00:36:42.230
because in fact it was a woman. Wow. Props to her. Thank you for acting.

567
00:36:42.231 --> 00:36:44.630
The phrase, let's her name. Chad. Danny Taylor.

568
00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:50.450
<v 10>When we first meet any Taylor, this was 1901.</v>

569
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:53.770
She was down on her luck because she, she'd been a, uh,

570
00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:56.240
she'd done a lot of different things. She'd run a dancing school.

571
00:36:56.241 --> 00:36:59.000
She had been a principal. She traveled all over the world.

572
00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:02.570
Her only child had died, her husband right after that

573
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.840
<v 12>and she was broke,</v>

574
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:12.180
<v 10>but then it hit her. She was sitting at home,</v>

575
00:37:12.181 --> 00:37:15.690
sitting your newer apartment in Bay city, Michigan. And uh,

576
00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:20.520
for some odd reason she read an article about the goings on at Niagara Falls and

577
00:37:20.521 --> 00:37:25.480
she decided she would go over Niagara Falls in a bear minimum. Why? I mean,

578
00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:30.300
do we know she's looking to save herself from the poor house?

579
00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:33.330
She was after money and when she read about these guys at Niagara Falls,

580
00:37:33.331 --> 00:37:37.830
she thought this is it. Right? So she called a Cooper to build a barrel.

581
00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:40.680
At first he refused to build it when he heard what her plan was.

582
00:37:40.681 --> 00:37:44.580
But finally he did. And not long after Annie was on a train with her barrel

583
00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.093
headed

584
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:48.980
<v 11>to the falls, by the way. Yeah.</v>

585
00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:50.200
<v 0>What Day are we talking about? Sure.</v>

586
00:37:50.201 --> 00:37:55.201
So we haven't danced in October 24th in 1901.

587
00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:59.620
Okay. Word had spread. This was going to be a spectacle.

588
00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:04.360
Everyone was there. Mobs of people, thousands up and down the river.

589
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:08.920
Tens of thousands and Annie shows up waving to the crowd wearing a very fancy

590
00:38:08.921 --> 00:38:13.540
Victorian dress and a hat with ostrich feathers. Wow. She's quite the lady,

591
00:38:13.541 --> 00:38:15.370
but then they go on an island. Yeah.

592
00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:19.490
<v 11>Where's she changes into some gym clothes and now she gets in the barrel.</v>

593
00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:22.490
They tow her out to the middle of the river and then they knock

594
00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:25.850
and cut the rope

595
00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:28.110
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

596
00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:30.200
<v 11>and off she goes to the brain.</v>

597
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:35.250
[inaudible]

598
00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:36.250
<v 1>the roar of the river</v>

599
00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:41.493
<v 10>enormous</v>

600
00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:49.200
and it's wet at my feet and I'm feeling while I'm in there that this is

601
00:38:49.361 --> 00:38:54.270
miserable. The interesting thing is in Jones poem, she actually becomes, and I,

602
00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:58.240
Kurt greened and spun, she's in the barrel getting hurled down.

603
00:38:58.241 --> 00:39:00.940
The river tossed and turned. My brain told me,

604
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.910
and as she gets closer to the edge, it's about a half mile journey.

605
00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:04.953
She begins to [inaudible]

606
00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:06.243
<v 11>hallucinate,</v>

607
00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.230
<v 10>glimpse through the turbulence.</v>

608
00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:13.590
There was my young husband and his arms or baby rambling and the wind,

609
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:17.223
and then

610
00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:21.020
<v 16>this moment of weightlessness,</v>

611
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:25.760
<v 11>she's going down</v>

612
00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:31.100
<v 10>into the pools below the great mass of foam and boiling water,</v>

613
00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:34.250
and then she shoots out again

614
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:39.250
<v 16>through the buoyancy of the barrel, about 15 feet in the air.</v>

615
00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:41.490
<v 11>Wow. The barrel crashes back</v>

616
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:44.860
<v 0>back down on the water, and then it floats</v>

617
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:50.520
over to some rocks and rescue team paddle out to the barrel right away.

618
00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:54.360
They get the barrel and they have to Assad open the crowd,

619
00:39:54.361 --> 00:39:56.130
no doubt his thinking. That woman is dead.

620
00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.650
There is nothing but a dead woman in that barrel,

621
00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:00.143
<v 1>but</v>

622
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.070
<v 11>when they pull her out out, she's alive.</v>

623
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:07.190
<v 17>[inaudible]</v>

624
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:08.480
<v 10>hi, I'm alive.</v>

625
00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:13.720
She took on this thing that the world was waiting for

626
00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:15.360
<v 17>[inaudible]</v>

627
00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.290
<v 11>and she did it.</v>

628
00:40:16.291 --> 00:40:20.880
She was the first to ever try and Joan when she was pulled out of that barrel,

629
00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:25.350
and presumably she's going to take the next step into fame and fortune.

630
00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:26.813
What happened?

631
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:29.290
<v 10>More or less, nothing.</v>

632
00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:35.620
<v 11>She stepped out of the barrel and she didn't look right.</v>

633
00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:40.600
She didn't look like a hero. What does that mean?

634
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:44.860
Well, I've kept something from you coalition. What to think,

635
00:40:44.861 --> 00:40:49.260
I haven't told you is that not only was she wet and soggy and according to

636
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:51.850
newspaper accounts, hysterical. And who wouldn't be?

637
00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:56.950
She was 63. She was your grandmother.

638
00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:01.630
She was an older lady. Like Joan said, you know, for the hero consuming public.

639
00:41:01.631 --> 00:41:03.370
She just didn't look right

640
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:06.060
<v 16>after that exhibition. Um,</v>

641
00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:11.120
her manager ran off with the barrel and he took the barrel and he started,

642
00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:14.670
uh, going on the circuit with a lovely young woman.

643
00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:18.760
Did he claimed was Annie Taylor? No. Much better showpiece. Oh, Yay.

644
00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:20.230
<v 11>What happened to Annie though?</v>

645
00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:25.380
She would drag herself to Niagara each spring and summer.

646
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.750
Sure.

647
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:28.740
<v 16>Just sit on a street with a barrel. It wasn't the original barrel,</v>

648
00:41:28.741 --> 00:41:30.810
but it was a barrel and do what?

649
00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:33.620
She probably had photographs of herself that signed.

650
00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:38.010
<v 11>And did she ever make any money off this nanny? No.</v>

651
00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:41.880
She died in a poor house, which is where she didn't want to wind up.

652
00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:45.800
But that is where she wound up. And just 10 years later,

653
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:50.750
somebody repeats Annie's feet a man and he tours the world.

654
00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:55.510
Bastard. Yeah. Bastard. But

655
00:41:56.910 --> 00:42:00.960
<v 10>because the heavens are Marissa fault during this guy's victory lap,</v>

656
00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:02.550
is he traveling around the world? He's,

657
00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:07.610
he slipped his lift on an orange shrine in Australia or New Zealand.

658
00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:12.050
Got a compound fracture of his leg. Huh?

659
00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:17.130
She says that leg got gangrene and he died. Yeah,

660
00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:20.550
there is. There is cosmic justice.

661
00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:29.610
<v 2>[inaudible] eh.</v>

662
00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:42.893
[inaudible]

663

<v 2>hey,</v>

665
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:12.390
we'll be right back.

666

669

What information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

670
00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:35.900
<v 11>I'm Jan. I boom. Ron, are you asleep?</v>

671
00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:39.290
Hey. Hi. Do you even know where you are right now?

672
00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:42.620
Did you see like my name with my leg while I kick myself awake?

673
00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:46.820
Did you see that? I heard it. I'm Jad Abumrad Oh,

674
00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:51.440
I'm Robert Krulwich and our next falling feature is falling asleep but with a

675
00:43:51.441 --> 00:43:54.170
little kick. This is radio lab. Let's do it. Well,

676
00:43:54.171 --> 00:43:57.110
tell me your name first and just tell me how you would like to be identified on

677
00:43:57.111 --> 00:43:59.710
here. You can call me Fred. I like it the best. Okay.

678
00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.990
My full title is Professor Frederick l Coolidge,

679
00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:06.050
University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.

680
00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:10.220
So just so we get our definitions right, what is a hypnic jerk?

681
00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:14.360
It appears to be this, what seems to be a reflex. Everybody's experienced it.

682
00:44:14.361 --> 00:44:18.950
It's, it's, you're still semi-conscious. Then you start to feel kind of dreamy.

683
00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:22.580
You start to feel this loosening of your thoughts,

684
00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:25.430
loosening of, of your reality.

685
00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.550
But just as you're about to go under,

686
00:44:28.551 --> 00:44:31.640
he says just that the first onset of sleep, Bam,

687
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:36.780
<v 0>one big jerk, man, you're awake. Usually you wake up with this feeling of like,</v>

688
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:41.700
oh my God, Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh, all right. And you know, wait,

689
00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:45.540
how did you start studying this? I was working at Kentucky Fried Chicken.

690
00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:50.730
Can I save it on the air for a dollar for a dollar an hour? And I just thought,

691
00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:55.830
man, I still can't eat coleslaw to this day cause I would do a hundred pounds of

692
00:44:55.831 --> 00:44:58.140
Coleslaw a day. So, um,

693
00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:01.860
I saw this ad on campus and it said somebody to work in a sleep lab.

694
00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:05.850
So I went and applied and I ended up in the beginning cleaning toilets.

695
00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:08.310
But I just got into all asleep.

696
00:45:08.311 --> 00:45:12.720
I thought it was fascinating and I got fascinated by these giant jerks at the

697
00:45:12.721 --> 00:45:15.630
beginning of sleep. And I said, what is that? You know? And they say, oh,

698
00:45:15.631 --> 00:45:19.140
that's a hypnic jerk. And I said, what is that? And they said,

699
00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:21.450
that's a hip nature. In other words,

700
00:45:21.451 --> 00:45:24.540
no one could really explain to him why these things happen. That's right.

701
00:45:24.541 --> 00:45:27.000
So we started poking around and there were some theories, you know,

702
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:30.330
having to do with like physiological changes in your body, you know,

703
00:45:30.331 --> 00:45:33.030
a lowering of oxygen content or something like this and your,

704
00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:36.420
but that kind of explanation didn't really satisfy. It really doesn't say,

705
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:39.770
well why, what was its function? And, um,

706
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:41.370
as I started to look at the literature,

707
00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:46.050
I saw that we had a very long history sleeping in trees.

708
00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:51.000
If we go back to Australopithecus Afarensis, this is Lucy.

709
00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:56.220
3 million years ago, Lucy was by Peatal, I mean walking on two legs.

710
00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:58.950
Lucy lived in the trees. But unlike the other primates,

711
00:45:58.951 --> 00:46:01.350
she would sometimes go down to the ground,

712
00:46:01.351 --> 00:46:06.300
but on the ground you've got big birds, you've got snakes, tigers,

713
00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:07.283
and rough times.

714
00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:12.060
That ground life was stressful,

715
00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.380
but at night she crawled up the tree for safety.

716
00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:20.850
She climbs up in that tree, drops food there for her baby,

717
00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:23.790
and she's going to drop off to sleep.

718
00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:29.830
<v 6>Her muscles loosen her hands on curl. She starts to have that relaxation.</v>

719
00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:34.860
Pretty soon she can't feel the tree under her back or cue the noises down below.

720
00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:39.730
Stay with me, crawl with you. She feels like she's floating

721
00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:43.300
or falling,

722
00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:46.910
<v 0>Lucy falling, falling. That means</v>

723
00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:51.020
it'd be a real good idea to wake up from that.

724
00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:55.220
Sleep was such a dangerous proposition for so many millions of years that

725
00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:59.870
something like to hip, knee jerk. If some of those primates had that behavior,

726
00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:05.060
they may have been just slightly more likely over millions of years to to adapt

727
00:47:05.061 --> 00:47:07.730
and survive. And we haven't gotten rid of it yet is what he's saying.

728
00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:11.480
So that's my jerk is just basically so I don't get eaten by a lion all these

729
00:47:11.481 --> 00:47:14.430
many years. Yeah, that's what he's saying. Sort of like a Lucy Echo.

730
00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:17.880
Do we know this or we just the imagine? No. How are we going to know this?

731
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:19.320
This is just a story,

732
00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:23.690
but there is at least one a tantalizing,

733
00:47:23.691 --> 00:47:27.260
a bit of evidence to support this idea. You ask college students,

734
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:29.890
what are the most common that you have

735
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:33.640
<v 4>and falling is number one or number two most common thing.</v>

736
00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:37.600
And if you go on a college campus, you know thanks to OSHA, right?

737
00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.840
You have no chance of falling off anything.

738
00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:43.750
They'll make sure that your fullest drop is like a foot or six inches.

739
00:47:43.751 --> 00:47:47.890
Even then at big yellow and red signs all over it. But they dream of falling.

740
00:47:47.891 --> 00:47:48.580
What?

741
00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:49.241
<v 0>And by the way,</v>

742
00:47:49.241 --> 00:47:54.241
the next most common dream after falling to being chased by an alien

743
00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:57.740
<v 4>in a blue dress, nobody is</v>

<v 0>you're walking and you don't always realize it.</v>

755
00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:20.210
<v 18>[inaudible]</v>

756
00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:23.030
<v 0>but you're always falling. Well actually I've got,</v>

757
00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:25.670
I have a random one for you guys about falling. As I was driving over here,

758
00:49:25.671 --> 00:49:29.390
I was thinking about it with each step neuroscientists, David Eagleman again,

759
00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:33.890
you fall forward slightly and then catch yourself.

760
00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:36.080
I started wondering what happened falling.

761
00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:39.170
Why is it that elderly people fall down a lot?

762
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:40.950
<v 4>If you go into any hospital ward,</v>

763
00:49:40.951 --> 00:49:44.640
you'll see lots and lots of elderly people who are in there with broken hips and

764
00:49:44.641 --> 00:49:46.890
things like that because they've, they've fallen.

765
00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:50.550
So I started asking my clinician friends and they say, well,

766
00:49:50.551 --> 00:49:52.800
they have a poor sense of balance, muscle weakness, and I said,

767
00:49:52.801 --> 00:49:56.070
could it have anything to do with timing? What do you mean? Well,

768
00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:59.970
one of the things I study is how the brain sends out signals to the whole body

769
00:49:59.971 --> 00:50:03.270
and how these signals come back because the strange part is the brain is

770
00:50:03.271 --> 00:50:08.010
situated all the way at one end of the body all the way at the top end and it's

771
00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:10.620
controlling this huge amount of machinery.

772
00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:14.220
You have to send signals all the way out to the toes and all the way back and

773
00:50:14.221 --> 00:50:15.900
they're surprisingly slow in the brain.

774
00:50:15.901 --> 00:50:19.800
It's about 300,000 times slower than signals move around in a computer.

775
00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:23.910
So it would be like if you were a NASA operator controlling the Mars rover,

776
00:50:23.911 --> 00:50:25.610
there's a delay between when you send the signal

777
00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:31.190
<v 19>27 signals when you get the feedback and when you get feedback.</v>

778
00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:34.350
<v 4>And so what happens is the brain is very,</v>

779
00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:37.980
puts a lot of effort into making sure that it knows exactly the timing of

780
00:50:37.981 --> 00:50:42.120
sending signals out and when it's getting signals back and that's how you walk.

781
00:50:42.121 --> 00:50:42.954
For example,

782
00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:45.920
<v 0>do you want the camera can take it the camera.</v>

783
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:48.500
So this is like what toddlers learn in reverse,

784
00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:53.030
aren't they learning the timings to get the left foot out in front of the right.

785
00:50:53.031 --> 00:50:54.110
That's exactly what they're doing.

786
00:50:54.111 --> 00:50:56.660
They're calibrating the timing of their whole nervous system.

787
00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:59.720
That's interesting because my kids 10 months old and I think he's in this

788
00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:03.710
calibrating stand. So what's happening with him now is he's standing,

789
00:51:03.711 --> 00:51:06.480
but then it looks like he's about to take a step. But then right, it's about,

790
00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:11.380
oh, sorry, that was a little spill. Yes, it's good.

791
00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:15.950
So basically you're saying his little brain is trying to figure out the timing.

792
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:20.030
Let me see it. Oh, electricity racing from brain to foot and foot back to brain.

793
00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:24.440
Yes. Mission control is going okay. Sending that message to the feet.

794
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:26.420
We expect it back in 300

795
00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:33.530
[inaudible] fall. Take three. Okay, we're going to try now to 80 milliseconds.

796
00:51:33.531 --> 00:51:33.980
Okay.

797
00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:38.630
Two 80 girls ran down to ou tumble fall.

798
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:41.990
That's exactly right. A lot of trial and error until you get the timing right,

799
00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:44.660
but get it right now you're a walker right

800
00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:49.231
<v 4>now.</v>

801
00:51:49.231 --> 00:51:54.231
Something that happens in let's say multiple sclerosis and maybe also when you

802
00:51:55.111 --> 00:51:55.950
get old since David,

803
00:51:55.980 --> 00:52:00.360
is that the timing starts to change because there's damage to the she thing

804
00:52:00.361 --> 00:52:04.140
around the nerves and that slows down certain signals.

805
00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:07.950
Then the brain says, oh, I thought my foot should've hit the ground by now,

806
00:52:08.130 --> 00:52:08.941
but it hasn't,

807
00:52:08.941 --> 00:52:12.720
so I'm going to send out a corrective motor command and then finally the signal

808
00:52:12.721 --> 00:52:15.330
does come back and you've sat out this corrective Motor Command and you'll

809
00:52:15.331 --> 00:52:17.490
stumble with each step.

810
00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:23.880
You fall forward slightly and then catch yourself

811
00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:26.283
<v 18>some falling.</v>

812
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:32.240
<v 0>Now we are going to fall far from home.</v>

813
00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:35.840
We're going to have to travel a good many late years off the planet to fall in

814
00:52:35.841 --> 00:52:40.130
this particularly special and gruesome way. Our father is Neil degrasse Tyson.

815
00:52:40.131 --> 00:52:42.770
He's a astronomical physicist. Is that what he is?

816
00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:45.230
Here he is at the Herbst theater.

817
00:52:45.231 --> 00:52:47.740
I like saying that Harper Theater in San Francisco,

818
00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:51.410
Sysco in front of an audience talking about a falling apart.

819
00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:52.531
<v 20>Um, my name,</v>

820
00:52:52.531 --> 00:52:55.380
my own business on the airplane and someone looks and sees what I'm doing.

821
00:52:55.381 --> 00:53:00.180
They find out I do astrophysics, the outcome, the questions. When will life end?

822
00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:04.320
Will the asteroid come? Will the Aztec calender destroy the earth? There's all,

823
00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:07.480
there's, it goes on and on. It's,

824
00:53:07.481 --> 00:53:10.200
I figured people like death in mayhem,

825
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:14.940
so I might as well title the book with that because there's a whole chapter on

826
00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:17.310
how to die as you fall into a black hole,

827
00:53:17.311 --> 00:53:19.950
which I personally think it's a kind of kind of cool way to die

828
00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:26.520
because what happens is the gravity of the black hole it extreme.

829
00:53:26.521 --> 00:53:28.710
As you can imagine, light doesn't even escape.

830
00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:33.750
It's gravity is so extreme light traveling at the speed of light.

831
00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:38.310
All right? So if light doesn't come out, nothing's coming out. It's black.

832
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:42.150
You fall in, you're not coming out. It's a one way trip. Okay,

833
00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:45.110
so you don't just die cause you disappear. You,

834
00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:48.480
you die long before you disappear. As you fall in,

835
00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:54.270
the gravity at your feet becomes rapidly greater than the gravity of your head.

836
00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:58.680
So your feet start falling faster than your head does.

837
00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:01.530
That's a bad situation to be in.

838
00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:06.300
You don't really know initially you kind of feel good, you know,

839
00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:09.750
cause it's every you, we all stretch. When you wake up in the morning.

840
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:12.090
Initially it feels like a stretch.

841
00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:17.480
But what happens is that stretch continues beyond comfort levels and you reach a

842
00:54:19.561 --> 00:54:23.790
point where, and they're called the tidal forces, tides on your body. Basically.

843
00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:28.970
The title force comes so great that they exceed the intermolecular forces that

844
00:54:30.271 --> 00:54:31.860
bind your flesh.

845
00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:38.330
And so the point comes where you snap into two pieces likely to happen at the

846
00:54:39.211 --> 00:54:42.840
base of your spine. Now you are to pieces. Now. Now,

847
00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:44.550
I know you didn't ask about this, but

848
00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:51.710
it turns out you will survive that snap because below your waist,

849
00:54:51.721 --> 00:54:56.010
while there are important organs, there are no vital organs below your waist.

850
00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:01.160
So your torso will stay alive for a little while,

851
00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.120
okay? Until you bleed to death.

852
00:55:03.121 --> 00:55:05.910
But this all happens much faster than it would take to bleed to death.

853
00:55:06.090 --> 00:55:11.090
So these two pieces then feel tidal forces and then they snap into two pieces

854
00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:17.180
and then they snap again into eight and then 16 and then you're bifurcating your

855
00:55:17.491 --> 00:55:21.630
way down. And so eventually it's your head and multiple other parts.

856
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:26.870
And so that will continue until you are a stream of Adam's descending toward the

857
00:55:27.181 --> 00:55:30.900
abyss. And it turns out that's not the worst of it.

858
00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:33.570
Okay? The worst,

859
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:38.990
it turns out the fabric of space and time funnels down towards a black hole.

860
00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:45.560
So the space that you occupy up here is larger than a space you occupied down

861
00:55:47.251 --> 00:55:50.580
here. So in fact, you're getting,

862
00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:54.710
while you're getting stretched, you're getting squeezed,

863
00:55:56.310 --> 00:56:01.310
extruded through the fabric of space like toothpaste too.

864
00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:13.423
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

865
00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:19.680
<v 5>well, we're, we're about to fall away. I think we can. Yeah. Okay. Nice.</v>

866
00:56:19.681 --> 00:56:24.490
One Nice one. Crow. It's falling apart before we do though. Uh, no,

867
00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:28.890
that we have podcasts or radio lab.org Amgen, boom, rod.

868
00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:29.990
I remember Kelly Pie.
