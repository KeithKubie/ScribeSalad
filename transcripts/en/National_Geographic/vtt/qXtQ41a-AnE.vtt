00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.093
We have a little quiz,
a little game show.

00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:07.066
I want to know with this
mechanical problem is

00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:11.166
a science fiction problem or
a real-life, real mechanical

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.000
problem?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Bona fide mechanical problem.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Real or not, is that right?

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.734
Do we go bing or meh?

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:16.667
Yes.

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:19.367
So is it a real
thing in real life

00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:23.633
if you have a cracked
harmonic balancer?

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:24.967
Yeah, you can be
cracked harmonic--

00:00:24.967 --> 00:00:27.200
No, I would say
it's science fiction.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.467
You harmonically balance
a crankshaft and things.

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:31.567
You're exactly right,
it is a real car thing.

00:00:31.567 --> 00:00:33.300
The harmonic
balancer is a device

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.834
connected to the
crankshaft of an engine

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:38.266
to reduce torsional
vibration and serves

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.767
as a pulley for drive belts.

00:00:39.767 --> 00:00:43.266
And now I have more questions
than that actually answered.

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:46.533
So what that means is-- because
I pay attention to when I have

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:47.900
to pay to get my car fixed.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.333
I've never broken my
harmonic balancer.

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.333
No.

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.000
They're usually
geared-- they're very

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.266
high rel, high reliability.

00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.433
They're in an oil bath.

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:56.967
But, Neal, you'll like this.

00:00:56.967 --> 00:00:59.767
The rate of change
of position is--

00:00:59.767 --> 00:01:00.767
That's velocity.

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:01.867
Rate of change of velocity is--

00:01:01.867 --> 00:01:03.033
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON:
--accerlation.

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:04.533
So the rate of change
of acceleration--

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:05.567
--is a jerk.

00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:07.233
And that's what will
make that go away.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:08.233
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: OK, cool.

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:09.367
Yeah.

00:01:09.367 --> 00:01:11.467
A little bit of physics
stuff going on there.

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:12.300
Yes.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.934
All right, would it be a real--

00:01:13.934 --> 00:01:16.767
Wait, just to be clear, so
rate of change in position

00:01:16.767 --> 00:01:18.600
is speed, or velocity.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.100
And we've all familiar with
being at a constant velocity.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.900
When you're at a constant
velocity, you don't feel it.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.200
So now, if you're accelerating
and you've positioned yourself

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.033
and all your muscles
are resisting

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:30.000
the constant acceleration,
then you have

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.700
a change in the acceleration.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.033
That's a jerk.

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:36.767
So you feel it, and then you
punch the brakes some more.

00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:38.233
Then you'll feel a jerk forward.

00:01:38.233 --> 00:01:40.033
That's why it's
appropriately called a jerk.

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:41.200
So what else do you have?

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.233
All right, what about
defective planetary gears?

00:01:44.233 --> 00:01:45.100
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Sure.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.333
Defective planetary gears.

00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:47.900
Yeah, you have planetary
gears, where you have

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.533
a sun gear and planet gears.

00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:50.633
I didn't know
anything about it.

00:01:50.633 --> 00:01:51.967
You have a three-speed
bicycle, you

00:01:51.967 --> 00:01:53.333
have a planetary gear train.
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Really?

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:54.667
That is exactly it.

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:56.433
They're the primary gears within
an automatic transmission.

00:01:56.433 --> 00:01:57.633
OK, very good.

00:01:57.633 --> 00:02:00.166
All right.

00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:04.433
What if you had an
unmotivated binary motivator?

00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:06.400
That sounds like
science fiction to me.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.200
So what is it?

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.166
You are straight-up correct.

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:08.967
That is in "Star Wars."

00:02:08.967 --> 00:02:10.166
It's a device in droids.

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:11.433
"Star Wars," OK.

00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:15.867
One more-- what if you
had a damp flux capacitor?

00:02:15.867 --> 00:02:18.133
That is of course, real.

00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:20.166
So that was a documentary
called "Back to the Future."

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:21.166
I highly recommended it.

00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:22.166
I think it's on Netflix.
