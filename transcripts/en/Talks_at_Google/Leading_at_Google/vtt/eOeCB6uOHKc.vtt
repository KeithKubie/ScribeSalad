ELYSE GUILFOYLE:
Today, I'm really

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.685
excited to be introducing a
podcast and a resource that

00:00:10.685 --> 00:00:12.560
has done amazing work
in the criminal justice

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.470
space, "The Returning Citizen."

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.320
We're really lucky to have
the co-creators here--

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.680
Jacob Smith, Imani
Mixon, and Erik Burgess.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.410
And they've put together
a really amazing group

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.630
of people that are going
to be discussing today

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.266
how we can empower
ex-offenders through education.

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.640
We have some
questions that we've

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.940
taken from Googlers in
advance, so we'll circle back

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.120
to those at the end.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.330
But for now, I'm going to
kick it off over to Jacob.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.486
Thank you.

00:00:39.486 --> 00:00:40.816
JACOB SMITH: Thank you so much.

00:00:40.816 --> 00:00:43.774
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:43.774 --> 00:00:45.190
Thank you everybody
for being here

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.690
and for everybody tuning in.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.000
Welcome to a very
special edition

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.920
of "The Returning Citizen."

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.680
We are recording live here from
the brand-new Google Detroit

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.860
headquarters in the
Little Caesar's Arena.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.770
Before we kick off, I just
want to give a huge shout-out

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.040
to Elyse Guilfoyle of
the Talks at Google team,

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.117
everybody at Google for all
of their incredible work

00:01:10.117 --> 00:01:11.200
in bringing this to light.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.080
This started as just
an idea, and here we

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.810
are actually doing it.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.410
So that's pretty cool.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.910
So without further ado,
let's dive right in.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.020
So I'm Jacob Smith, a
Detroit-based entrepreneur

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.940
and social justice organizer.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.530
IMANI MIXON: And
I'm Imani Mixon,

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.180
a Detroit-based
and embraced writer

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.950
who reports on
neighborhood change

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.390
and creative independence.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.350
And we started "The Returning
Citizen" back in 2017 just

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.889
as an idea that you kick
around with a co-worker

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:39.430
after work and with
a friend that you

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.694
meet through that co-worker.

00:01:40.694 --> 00:01:42.110
We're not at that
company anymore,

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.800
but we are getting
our ideas out anyway.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.580
So "The Returning Citizen" is a
resource for returning citizens

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.260
and their families,
and we hope to just

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.110
bring a bit of positivity
to the enormous challenges

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.460
that they face.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.080
And just for a quick
context, the US

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.930
has the most prisoners,
which is over 2 million,

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.970
and the highest per
capita incarceration

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.100
rate of any country on earth.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.730
So that means that about 1 in
100 Americans are incarcerated.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.440
And most of these folks will
return home as our neighbors.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.950
We believe everybody wins
when we hope these returning

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.721
citizens become successful.

00:02:13.721 --> 00:02:15.220
And if you like
what you hear today,

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.120
feel free to visit
www.thereturningcitizen.org.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.190
We're also on SoundCloud
and other podcast platforms.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.190
JACOB SMITH: Absolutely.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.850
Thank you, Imani.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.370
So just to explain what we're
talking about here today--

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.170
so when men and women
come out of prison,

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.350
it's safe to say that they face
a lot of different challenges.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.640
And there's no
instruction manual.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.820
You're not provided with
an instruction manual

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.460
when you come out that tells
you where to go, what to do,

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.450
how to thrive.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.270
So what we're talking
about here today

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.030
is how arming yourself
with knowledge and skills

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.934
can really be the difference
maker in being successful when

00:02:52.934 --> 00:02:54.100
transitioning out of prison.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.620
So specifically,
how we can empower

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.790
ex-offenders or returning
citizens through education.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.340
So yeah, let's go
ahead and dive right in

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.640
and meet our incredible
group of panelists here.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.397
Aaron, you want to go
ahead and kick it off?

00:03:12.397 --> 00:03:13.730
AARON KINZEL: Thank you, Google.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:14.940
Thank you, Jacob.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:15.940
My name is Aaron Kinzel.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.160
I'm a professor of criminology
and criminal justice

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.260
at the University of
Michigan-Dearborn.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.710
My areas of teaching expertise
following corrections

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.180
and public policy
and my research

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.610
is focused predominately
on prisoner education.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.790
And the reason I'm very
passionate about prisoner

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.652
education is because it has been
the life-saving factor for me

00:03:33.652 --> 00:03:35.860
because, as a young man, I
was incarcerated for about

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.750
a decade in the carceral state.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.380
So I spent the ages of
18 to 28 incarcerated.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.680
I took a college class just
towards the end of my sentence.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.440
And when I came home, I started
an associate, bachelors,

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.050
masters, and I'm now finishing
up my doctorate and also

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.508
a faculty member
at the university.

00:03:51.508 --> 00:03:54.920
So education can make people
thrive in the carceral state,

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.100
and I was also a very
serious and violent offender

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.266
who was transformed through
education in the system.

00:03:59.266 --> 00:04:01.570
So I encourage all of
you to look at ways

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.790
that we can restore
post-secondary education

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.700
for people in the
carceral state.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.360
MICHELLE SMART:
Hi, good afternoon.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.490
I am Michelle Smart.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.220
I am founder of
Bags to Butterflies.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.089
We are a social enterprise
located in Detroit.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:20.350
Our mission is to empower
formerly incarcerated women

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.760
with transitional employment,
resources, and a caring network

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.680
on their journey to success.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.340
Our journey began in
2015 with a focus group

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.940
that consisted of 10 women
who served between five and 30

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.157
years in prison.

00:04:36.157 --> 00:04:37.990
The barriers that they
shared that they face

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.300
was employment and housing.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.230
Our organization is tackling
the employment barrier.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.450
Thank you.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.240
KARLOS L. HARRIS: And
I am Carlos Harris.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.960
I served about 11 and 1/2 years.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.280
My return to
Detroit, as we would

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.510
begin to surge with
the skilled trades

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.150
for the second chance
or the opportunities

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.220
for returning citizens
here in the city.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.160
So I decided that I would move
here about three years ago

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.420
from Ann Arbor.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.690
And so now, we own a
school in Southwest Detroit

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.170
called DSDT, Detroit School
for Digital Technology.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.810
I own a digital
marketing agency.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.000
The name of it is Koded Icons.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.770
And we work with a number
of initiatives around town,

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.820
whether they be the
Michigan Works, DESC,

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.080
Department of Corrections,
and our main key, say,

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.260
is to try to change individuals
that are coming home

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.349
by training them with
technology skills

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:38.640
to get them gainfully employed.

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.080
ERIK BURGESS: Good
evening, everyone.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.970
First of all, I'd like to
thank Google for this platform

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.070
for us sharing some valuable
information and the experiences

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.110
that we have endured.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.310
I'd like to thank all the
attendees for taking time out

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.410
of their schedule for
attending this platform also.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.700
My name is Erik Burgess.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.540
I am co-creator of "The
Returning Citizen Podcast."

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.760
I did 18 years in prison
for a drug-lifer Law,

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.790
which, when I first
was sentenced in 1991,

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.977
I had mandatory life
without no parole.

00:06:12.977 --> 00:06:14.310
So I'm taking this opportunity--

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.330
I feel obligated to make an
impact on the quality of life

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.300
for anyone who's
been incarcerated,

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.940
but my main focus and passion
is to be proactive and not

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.190
allow anyone to become
a returning citizen.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.696
Thank you.

00:06:29.696 --> 00:06:30.570
IMANI MIXON: Perfect.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.153
Thank you all for
those introductions.

00:06:32.153 --> 00:06:34.854
I think it's important to let
people tell you who they are.

00:06:34.854 --> 00:06:35.770
So that was beautiful.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.060
It's great to share
this space with you.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.250
And yeah, just to get
the questions rolling,

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.800
I know my personal experience
with returning citizens,

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.329
like, in family,
when people get out,

00:06:47.329 --> 00:06:49.120
they're trying to figure
out how to provide

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.440
basic needs for themselves.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.290
And it seems like things
like education or employment

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.180
are sort of out of their grasp.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.880
So in your experience,
what role does education

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.924
play for returning citizens
upon transitioning back

00:07:00.924 --> 00:07:01.465
into society?

00:07:05.245 --> 00:07:08.200
AARON KINZEL: So
employment and education

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.130
are pivotal to allow people
to return to their communities

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.860
safely and to become
productive citizens.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.912
However, there are
a lot of barriers.

00:07:16.912 --> 00:07:19.120
There is something called
the collateral consequences

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.250
of criminal conviction,
which basically

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.320
are legal sanctions
throughout the United States,

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.240
there's 40,000 of
them, that allow

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.820
you to legally discriminate
against someone like myself

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.782
or some of these other panelists
who have been convicted

00:07:30.782 --> 00:07:31.990
of various types of felonies.

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.960
So checking the
box is one thing,

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.690
where you have to disclose on
a felony background for a job

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:38.410
applications.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.650
Myself, coming home six years,
my first six years home,

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.180
I couldn't find
employment because I

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.180
kept checking that box.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.092
Hundreds of applications,
no one would ever

00:07:46.092 --> 00:07:47.050
give me an opportunity.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.139
My first job was
actually a lecturer

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:50.680
at Western Michigan
University, where

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.450
I was offered a job,
which, to me, is just

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:56.800
kind of insane, where it took
me six years to find employment.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.120
It's just really sad.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.710
And education has been
shown to dramatically reduce

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:03.650
recidivism rates.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.895
So, like, nationally, we
have recidivism rates now,

00:08:05.895 --> 00:08:07.270
which are just
horrendous, if you

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.090
look at the Bureau of
Justice Statistics.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.160
After a nine-year period
of people like ourselves

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.490
coming home, 83% of
us get rearrested

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.350
within that nine-year period.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.980
So for those of us that have
been home nine years or more,

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.065
we're among the 17% that
have somehow beat those odds.

00:08:24.065 --> 00:08:25.690
And it's not that a
lot of these people

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.069
are bad people or doing
really bad things.

00:08:28.069 --> 00:08:29.360
They're just trying to survive.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.169
And if you don't have education
and you don't have skills,

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:35.179
it's even harder for you to find
employment with those barriers.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:38.260
So what are some
things that we can do?

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.159
Education, when put
in a carceral space,

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:46.160
dramatically reduces recidivism
rates by 43% on average.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.900
So if we reinstated Pell Grants
to prisoners across the nation,

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.839
invested in more
programs where there were

00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:53.380
post-secondary
programs, particularly

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.470
vocational skills, then
these people who are inside

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.200
are more prepared
when they come home

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.146
to become productive in whatever
community they end up going to.

00:09:03.146 --> 00:09:04.520
And that's good
for the community

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.876
because people are not
committing more crimes.

00:09:07.876 --> 00:09:09.910
MICHELLE SMART: So
at our organization,

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.970
we hire women immediately upon
returning to the community.

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.130
And we are taking
what we believe

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:17.410
is an innovative
approach to create jobs.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:21.970
Our organization creates
handbags using repurposed wood.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:26.200
And the women that we've
hired just recently

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.510
served 34 years in prison.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.280
They're coming back
to a community--

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.470
it's like a whole new world.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:34.660
Our environment is
a little different

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.910
in that the ladies
are encouraged to be

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.100
as creative as they like to be.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.690
When they come in
for the interview,

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.130
they do have to be interviewed.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.000
They are referred.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.760
We have two women who
were referred by MDOC.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.890
The other two were referred
through another organization.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:52.030
They do go through
a formal interview.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:55.750
But through the interview
process, they also sit down.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.690
We sit down with them and
find out what they want to do.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:00.430
From that day
forward, we're going

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:02.560
to encourage them to let
go of the past, live life

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.330
today, and focus
on their dreams.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.090
So for us, educating them is--

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:09.760
one of the young ladies wanted
to go to driver's training.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.980
She had been in prison 41 years.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.870
We helped her go through
driver's training.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:18.490
Another young lady wanted to
go to school to learn to sing.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:19.600
That's her passion.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.410
We wanted to help her
follow her dreams.

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:24.460
So we're taking kind of
a nontraditional approach

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:28.559
to educating the women
and also employing them.

00:10:28.559 --> 00:10:30.100
KARLOS L. HARRIS:
And I love the fact

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.910
that she says "a
nontraditional approach."

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:37.690
So I, myself, in
serving 11 years,

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.300
I did it on what we call
"the installment plan"

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.850
I'm a C-prefix.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:45.040
So that means I went to
prison three times, all right?

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.190
And it was mainly because
of the lack of education,

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:52.630
not that I'm an illiterate
person or I didn't know,

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.640
it's just that each
time that I got out I

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.320
didn't have those
mentors around me.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.480
I didn't have anyone
around me to encourage

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.580
me to do somewhat better.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.040
And it wasn't until I
came here to Detroit

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.620
and the opportunities that are
being afforded The Returning

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:09.370
Citizen population that I saw
that there was one for me.

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:11.920
And that was in technology.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.900
About three years ago,
I decided that I wanted

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.970
to get into digital marketing.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:20.590
And that wasn't something that
a returning citizen perhaps

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:22.540
could do.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:26.230
And so I decided that, you
know, I would teach myself.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:30.340
So thanks to Google
and YouTube, I

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:33.940
was able to literally sit
down and spend a lot of hours

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.900
to reprogram myself.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.560
And I'm so passionate
about that now.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.560
It's afforded me to be able
to go back into the Michigan

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.620
Department of Corrections
and share those opportunities

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.780
with guys who are
coming home and who

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:50.320
haven't the foggiest idea
of what the technology

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.100
landscape here is now.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.560
I brought a friend
with me today.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.770
His name is Mr.
Willie Lyles Bay.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.880
He served 45 years.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.040
45 years.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.880
And he's an example of
the type of individuals

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.830
that we're working with
in order to give them

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:09.370
the skill sets to be able to
meet some of the employment

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.030
barriers that we're
having in our community.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:15.550
ERIK BURGESS: Thank you.

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:17.960
I think education is very
pivotal, like he said,

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:24.780
for individuals who are
going through a transition

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:25.875
of coming home.

00:12:25.875 --> 00:12:28.020
It'll afford you
more opportunities,

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.180
more marketable skills.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:33.060
Like, when I was in prison, the
only thing we had was college.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.920
There wasn't no type of skill or
trades where we can learn from.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.190
So I say some of
that education was

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.802
based on antiquated
theories and something

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.510
that we couldn't apply
when we come home.

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:46.350
So basically, what component we
had to have was the attitude.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.710
So we had the attitude
to change and pursue

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:54.030
other avenues of being
successful out here.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.400
Like I said, I'm in
school now at Wayne State,

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.110
taking up psychology, and I'll
be graduating in the spring.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:03.570
So that's one way I'm trying
to make myself more marketable.

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.790
I'm in the process of becoming
a social entrepreneur,

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:09.060
where I can have an
impact on quality of life.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.140
JACOB SMITH: Great.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:14.220
And so, Aaron, you touched
on this just briefly,

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.530
and I've talked about it
with a number of people

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:17.940
on this panel in the past.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:21.060
But educational
opportunities in terms

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:24.990
of while you're in prison,
what types of options exist?

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:28.380
You mentioned bringing back
Pell Grants, for example.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.990
Erik, I know we've talked
a lot about your GIS

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:34.410
training and the self-education
that you were doing

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.780
with technology magazines.

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.780
Could you guys speak to
while you are incarcerated

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.030
what types of opportunities
are available if somebody

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.330
is proactive if they
want to be taking

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.610
that power into their
own hands as it currently

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:50.961
stands in Michigan but
more broadly speaking?

00:13:50.961 --> 00:13:55.470
ERIK BURGESS: Michigan, firstly,
the most basic education

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:59.250
to have, unfortunately, is
a GED, a General Education

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:03.390
Diploma, which, at least, I
think 40% of prison population

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.140
do not have a GED,
unfortunately--

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.560
a lack of education as
Carlos had reiterated.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.750
That's one reason
why the incarceration

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:13.070
rates are going up.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:14.220
I changed my attitude.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.130
Like Carlos said, I
wasn't illiterate.

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:17.606
I wasn't dumb.

00:14:17.606 --> 00:14:19.980
I changed my attitude because
I wanted to prepare myself,

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.080
and I had a plan for
when I come home.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.460
So I became a GED tutor--

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.470
and once the opportunity
came up to learn GIS

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:30.660
because I know that's
the way the landscape

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.575
and the format of the
world was going to.

00:14:32.575 --> 00:14:34.200
I wanted to have some
type of knowledge

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.680
where I can be more marketable,
have some type of skills

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:38.790
to advance myself.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.427
And [INAUDIBLE] doesn't
make my family proud.

00:14:41.427 --> 00:14:43.510
That's what I wanted to
do-- make my family proud.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.290
Because they're also going
through an incarceration period

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:47.310
too, also.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.680
And some individuals
do not understand

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.050
how it's a very burden
on your family as well.

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:55.800
So if you have family
in your corner,

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.840
I think we're obligated,
not only to ourselves,

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.230
to our family, we're also
obligated to our community.

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:04.170
And I think we're the epitome
and the apex of what attitude

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:07.590
can do as far as
changing your life

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:09.150
and changing your thoughts.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:10.020
That's all it is.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.999
JACOB SMITH: When does
the teacher appear?

00:15:11.999 --> 00:15:13.790
ERIK BURGESS: When does
the teacher appear?

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:15.706
The teacher appears when
the student is ready.

00:15:15.706 --> 00:15:16.540
And I stay ready.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.807
AARON KINZEL: So I think the
predominant form of education

00:15:22.807 --> 00:15:24.390
in all carceral
spaces, whether that's

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:27.450
Michigan, or anywhere in the
US, or the federal systems

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:29.350
is informal education.

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:31.170
And that was extremely
powerful for me

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:33.630
because when I went
into the system,

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.330
I was a high school
dropout, 18-year-old kid.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.207
I ended up taking my
GED in the county jail

00:15:38.207 --> 00:15:39.290
when I was awaiting trial.

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:41.340
So that was like my
first little piece.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.380
So a lot of institutions
do have GED,

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.900
which I think is a great
step in the right direction

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:50.250
to help with those basic skills
with literacy, math, et cetera,

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.510
but there's very few
college programs anymore.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:54.720
So in 1994, the
Omnibus Crime Bill

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.520
passed under the
Clinton administration,

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.770
which destroyed Pell Grant
eligibility for prisoners

00:15:58.770 --> 00:15:59.760
nationwide.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.720
And in my personal and
professional opinion,

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.240
this was the most
devastating piece

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:08.250
of public policy that has ever
crossed a congressional space.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:11.250
It destroyed college
education nationwide.

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.920
And fast forward
now, we're in 2018.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.930
There's very few educational
opportunities that

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:17.710
are post-secondary in nature.

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.700
However, in Michigan, we
do have a Pell Grant pilot,

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.920
which was sponsored by the
US Department of Education

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.600
under the Obama administration.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.060
And Michigan does have several
sites in which prisoners

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.460
are gaining Pell Grants
and actually earning

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.590
associate's and bachelor's
degrees right now, which

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.630
I think is extremely powerful.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.060
And again, there's
research to back it up,

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:39.270
where recidivism rates go down,
but also just anecdotally,

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:41.400
anyone that I know that's
had some type education

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.790
in the system is employed.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.920
They have a better grasp on
their family connections.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.720
They're civically
engaged citizens.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.650
There's so many things
that they're improving upon

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:55.800
because they become educated
and become civically engaged.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.080
And that makes them more
likely to stay out in society

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.264
and be productive and
taxpayers citizens.

00:17:00.264 --> 00:17:01.680
There's such a tax
base that we're

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.900
losing by really
disenfranchising

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.030
people that have been
locked up in the system.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:09.150
And we're losing economic
growth as a nation.

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:11.190
And there's so much of
this technology stuff.

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:14.430
And with Google here, I
think that's the future.

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.099
If we can think about ways
to integrate more technology

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:19.599
in the prison space and for
people coming home, too,

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:21.739
who may lack the skills--

00:17:21.739 --> 00:17:23.369
like, when I came
home, the new hotness

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:26.604
was those Motorola razor
flip phones in 2007.

00:17:26.604 --> 00:17:28.770
I don't know if any of you
remember those, but like,

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:30.270
this texting was
like, holy shit.

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:31.080
Like, oh my god.

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.430
Like, we can text.

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:36.030
And now, we all got
our smartphones that

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:37.800
can do just about anything.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.480
And for someone that's been
down 10, 20, or 30 years,

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.120
that's just like being like
dropped into Shangri-La

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.000
and you have no idea what to do.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.960
So I really congratulate you,
Carlos, for helping people out

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.400
on that because that's
a much-needed piece

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.567
of re-education in
those populations.

00:17:53.567 --> 00:17:55.275
KARLOS L. HARRIS: So
part of my process--

00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.910
so I have some college.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.020
I'm a college dropout.

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.654
I was going to school for
business computer science.

00:18:03.654 --> 00:18:05.820
And I can remember one of
the last professors I had.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:08.070
He told me I didn't know the
difference between there,

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.480
their, and they're;
to, too, and two.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.630
So one of the first
things that I accomplished

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:17.720
while incarcerated was
I began to read as much

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.180
as I could get my hands on.

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.630
Because I wanted to know.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:25.970
And it was through
that reading--

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:29.030
you know, everybody in prison
says I'm writing my book,

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:29.810
right?

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.420
So I was able to write for
novels that when I came home

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.220
I self-published.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.940
And it was through
that trajectory

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.380
that I landed myself
at a point to saying

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.870
that I can do something
other than the crime that

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:44.210
was taking me to prison.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.630
You know, so many
of the guys that I

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.835
come into contact with now--

00:18:49.835 --> 00:18:50.750
I say it like this.

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.130
I'm really blessed.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.230
Because after having
served the time,

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:56.570
I'm able now to go
back into the prisons

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.840
to meet these
gentlemen and women.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:05.240
And prison wasn't like
that when I came through.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.850
We didn't have the
opportunities, right?

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:13.010
So Aaron speaks about
the Pell Grant initiative

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:15.600
that MDOC had a few years ago.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.870
Well, because of the
Second Chance grant,

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:21.440
we actually have a contract
with MDOC in which we go in

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.420
and we train--

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:28.520
I think it's 119 individuals
that's allocated to a program

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.390
that we have in technology--

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:32.010
information technology.

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:35.390
And so the research is that
we would train them inside.

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:38.540
And once they return back
here to Wayne County,

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.030
we actually are getting
them a place in employment

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:44.630
opportunities that otherwise
they wouldn't have access to,

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:45.130
you know?

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:48.230
And that's through
the Labor Department.

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:53.670
That wasn't there when I
came through the department.

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:57.410
And I think that the more we
have conversations like this

00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:02.030
and we have those innovators
like a Mr. Burgess

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:05.850
that are futured or forward
thinking in their approach,

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.720
the more we can begin to
help more of our community

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.540
that are returning home.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:15.350
You have guys that spent 40
years that literally do not

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:19.040
have the skill sets to
send a simple email.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.900
That's something we
take for granted.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.200
And I promise you, it's
painful to see a person

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:28.330
stand at a computer and tell
you they can't turn it on.

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:32.790
So that's one of the
biggest things I and my team

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:37.110
are trying to dismantle
across the department.

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.750
We're mainly in Michigan
now because that's

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.480
kind of like a foothold for us.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.220
And it's to make sure that
those that are returning back

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.310
to our communities at
least have some technology

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:50.370
savvy about themselves to
where they can simply fill out

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:53.430
these online applications and
have access to the employment

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:55.500
opportunities that we all
just take for granted.

00:21:00.012 --> 00:21:00.970
IMANI MIXON: Thank you.

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:03.730
And it sounds like you all
sort of found your own ways

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:05.470
to educate yourself
and go on a journey

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:07.180
after transitioning out.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.640
But we know hindsight is 20/20.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.220
So what do you wish
you knew upon re-entry?

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:20.970
Anybody?

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:24.660
KARLOS L. HARRIS: I
wish someone had really

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:29.345
told me about your network
determines your net worth.

00:21:29.345 --> 00:21:31.220
You know, my grandmother
used to always say--

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:31.969
I'm from Arkansas.

00:21:31.969 --> 00:21:33.090
I'm sorry.

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.730
So my grandmother used to always
say, birds of a feather flock

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.180
together.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:38.250
And that's so true.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:39.270
Now that I'm older--

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:40.950
I'll be 46 next month.

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:45.330
And I've learned in my older
age now that the people that I

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:49.170
really associate
with, they kind of

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:52.740
have an influence
on my future, right?

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:57.305
One of the first clients
that I got when I became--

00:21:57.305 --> 00:22:00.540
I opened my digital marketing
agency was a judge that

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.610
sits over at 36 district now.

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:04.710
He called me to his
office because he

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:08.700
heard about this returning
citizen that does websites.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:12.240
And so he called me over,
and here I am in his chamber.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.570
And I'm thinking,
wow, I'm literally

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.470
in the back room with a judge.

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:21.240
If not for technology,
if not for me

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.330
seeing an opportunity
for me in this space,

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:28.320
I would've never had that
opportunity, you know?

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.100
Because the crimes
that I committed--

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.690
I did burglary.

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:39.300
And whenever I sat
and, I did the résumés,

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.700
I would always be told
that I couldn't get the job

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.850
because they were
crimes of dishonesty.

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:48.960
So technically, I wasn't
about to get a job pretty much

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.930
anywhere.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:52.990
So I had to be creative
in my approach.

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:56.050
And I just wish someone
had sat and told me many,

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:59.670
many years ago to really
start to position myself

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:05.010
with a network of individuals
that could actually

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:08.220
shift my mindset into
a better direction

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.350
to where I wanted to go.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:14.350
Because I like to think I
never was really a bad person.

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:16.030
I think we all probably
would say that.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:19.950
But at the same time, had I been
with more like-minded people,

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.650
the travel wouldn't have been
as long as it has been for me.

00:23:25.716 --> 00:23:30.060
ERIK BURGESS: The one thing I
wish I knew is how to listen--

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:33.550
is how to listen.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.360
We learn that when
we're younger--

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.300
just how to listen.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.250
You have to know how
to listen to learn,

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:39.960
and so that's one thing I wish--

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.280
I didn't listen.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.730
And signs and symbols around
me, especially my grandpa,

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:45.840
why did you do that, boy?

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.002
You don't have to do that.

00:23:47.002 --> 00:23:48.960
That's the only thing
that resonated in my mind

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:49.959
when I was incarcerated.

00:23:49.959 --> 00:23:50.896
Why did you do that?

00:23:50.896 --> 00:23:52.020
You didn't have to do that.

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:52.800
You wasn't illiterate.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.550
You wasn't stupid.

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:54.920
You had everything you had.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.930
But I made the
choice to be foolish

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:02.820
and made a very
[INAUDIBLE] decision that

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:05.079
cost me almost my entire life.

00:24:05.079 --> 00:24:07.620
So when I got incarcerated, I
was sentenced to mandatory life

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.900
without no parole,
which means they

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.790
wanted me to die in prison.

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:14.700
And I said, I'll
never die in prison.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:16.530
I'm not going to die in prison.

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:18.940
Just like I walked
in, I'mma walk out.

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:22.770
So thank God I'm here
to share my story,

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:24.780
and I'll never go back--

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:25.440
period.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.850
I'm never going back.

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:29.190
And I want to congratulate
all of these individuals

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:32.910
up here who have to
come to the forefront

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:35.940
and be a prime example of what
attitude and what education

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:36.940
can do for your life.

00:24:42.887 --> 00:24:44.720
AARON KINZEL: So I'll
just say really brief,

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.730
I'll piggyback off
what Carlos said.

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:48.500
Networking is key.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.450
Again, I put out
hundreds of applications.

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:51.640
I never got a call back.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:55.400
But when I started making deep
connections and relationships--

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.410
like, my boss now,
ironically, is

00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:59.102
a judge from Washtenaw County.

00:24:59.102 --> 00:25:01.310
He's the director of
criminology and criminal justice

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:02.240
where I work now.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.030
So isn't that the kind
of ironic relationship--

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:07.780
the felon and the judge.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:10.490
But I have great and deep
respect for this man,

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:12.650
and he's been a
mentor to me, and I've

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:14.000
learned a lot from him.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.380
And he sees in me opportunity
and spark of light.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.130
If there's one thing
I would want to know,

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:21.920
besides the networking,
I would say,

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.680
reentry services should start
day one when you get locked up,

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.420
not when you come home.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.190
You should be getting
prepared day one.

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:31.010
If you've got a 10-year bid on
your first day in the system,

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:32.990
you should start
to build what you

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:35.630
need to do for reentry
services upon your release,

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:38.750
and I know a lot of people
rarely ever do that.

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:42.530
Secondary to that,
understanding trauma.

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.540
Many people who go
into the carceral state

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.420
are already traumatized, and
that trauma is never addressed.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.150
A lot of people who are
convicted of felonies

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:52.100
are survivors of crime.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.180
Myself, I was one.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:55.970
My stepfather tried to murder
me at the age of eight--

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:57.837
and lots of other
abuse and violence

00:25:57.837 --> 00:25:59.420
that I was subjected
to, which I'm not

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.170
saying that to not be
accountable for my crime,

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:03.920
but it was certainly
a stepping stone that

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.880
led me into that direction.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.690
And if we don't address
trauma in the carceral spaces,

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:11.310
like solitary confinement,
being separated from families,

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:13.531
all these different things,
when people come home,

00:26:13.531 --> 00:26:15.030
they don't know how
to deal with it.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:17.180
And I was certainly not
an exception to that rule.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.490
When I first came home, 10
years out of the system,

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:21.404
that Motorola flip
phone was weird.

00:26:21.404 --> 00:26:22.070
That's a trauma.

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:23.690
Technology, I get anxious.

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:24.695
I'm nervous.

00:26:24.695 --> 00:26:26.570
I feel like I'm stupid
because I don't really

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:28.850
know how to work
technology and others do,

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:31.640
and I just don't know how to
really socially acclimate back

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.510
into society.

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:33.920
No one teaches us those skills.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.642
So understanding trauma and
having trauma-informed care

00:26:37.642 --> 00:26:39.100
right when you come
into the system

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.060
so you can start to address that
trauma so that when you come

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.970
home, you're much more safer
and less likely to recidivate

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:45.614
upon release.

00:26:45.614 --> 00:26:47.030
JACOB SMITH:
Michelle, do you have

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:48.863
any incite you want to
share about the women

00:26:48.863 --> 00:26:50.756
in the program that might--

00:26:50.756 --> 00:26:53.210
MICHELLE SMART: So the
women that we service,

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:55.310
our organization is fairly new.

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:58.310
We just launched our
employment initiative

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:02.270
in June of this year, where
we have hired four women.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:05.570
On average, they serve
over 40 years in prison.

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:09.780
And some of the things that
they have expressed-- actually,

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:11.690
Michelle, I don't
think she minds

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:14.240
me sharing-- that
Michelle Pearson joined

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:18.320
our organization in
September after serving

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.800
34 years in prison.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.180
This is her very first
job since coming home.

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:26.240
The ladies have
shared that being

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.360
reintegrated in the community
is very important to them.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.720
They want to give back.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.910
They want to be looked
at who they are today.

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:35.400
They're trying to,
again, forget their past.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.740
They want to be accepted.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:39.030
They want to work.

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:42.920
They want to be recognized as
individuals who have already

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:43.820
paid their dues.

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:45.620
Personally, I've
never been to prison.

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:49.220
I have a family member, a
close friend, whose daughter

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.710
is currently incarcerated.

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:54.440
So that's my passion for
helping women upon coming home.

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:57.170
But they have shared
that getting out

00:27:57.170 --> 00:28:00.500
and engaged in the community and
getting the support that they

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:05.420
need as far as cell phones,
technology, education--

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:08.160
even simple things as
going to the grocery store.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.440
You've been away 34 years, 40
years, that's overwhelming.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.300
So our organization--
as I said, we

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.900
are doing things a
little different.

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.870
Our ladies have a health
and wellness coach

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:22.520
who comes in every Wednesday.

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.580
They do everything
from yoga to--

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:26.810
they have fitness classes.

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:28.910
We have a conference room
that we call the gym.

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:31.820
So we move things around
to accommodate the ladies.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:35.510
They have a life coach that
they meet with twice per month,

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:36.740
someone that they can go to.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.420
They don't all
have family members

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.060
that they can go to
if they're struggling

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.570
or anyone that they can
share their struggles with.

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:47.690
We also work with
a local bank who

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:50.649
has helped them with things like
opening up a savings account.

00:28:50.649 --> 00:28:52.190
We want them to know
about budgeting.

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:54.549
So they're coming back
to a whole new world,

00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:56.090
and they definitely
need the support.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.820
JACOB SMITH: And just to
hammer the point home--

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.570
because this is something
that we touch on

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:03.590
in almost every episode.

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:06.420
The power of networking, I
really can't stress enough.

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:09.000
This is something that almost
every guest on the podcast

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.230
touches on in some capacity.

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:13.980
Folks that are successful are
folks that build a network.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.761
People hire people
that they know,

00:29:15.761 --> 00:29:17.010
that they're comfortable with.

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:21.030
And one way to do that is by
meeting people and forming

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:23.190
that personal relationship,
so I appreciate that.

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:24.900
And thank you guys
for all that insight.

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:26.775
I also just want to
point out before I forget

00:29:26.775 --> 00:29:29.010
to mention that each of
these wonderful panelists

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:32.040
has been featured individually
on the podcast previously

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.250
in different capacities
on separate episodes,

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:38.740
deep-diving into their
individual areas of expertise.

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:42.030
So if you're interested
in learning more

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.555
about these different stories--

00:29:43.555 --> 00:29:45.096
IMANI MIXON:
Thereturningcitizen.org.

00:29:45.096 --> 00:29:46.665
JACOB SMITH: --then I strongly
encourage everyone to do that.

00:29:46.665 --> 00:29:47.230
What's that?

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:47.850
IMANI MIXON:
Thereturningcitizen.org.

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:49.830
JACOB SMITH: Yeah,
thereturningcitizen.org,

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:51.480
absolutely.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.810
Great, well, moving
right along, so I'd

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:58.360
love to hear from
you guys specific.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:01.590
We're here at the Google
Detroit headquarters.

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:06.050
What specific opportunities
do you see through technology

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:06.710
specifically?

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:09.190
I know a few of you have
touched on this a little bit.

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:12.750
I do want to point out that
this podcast wouldn't exist

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:16.550
if Erik hadn't been reading
technology magazines in prison

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:18.990
and heard about
podcasting, and this idea

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:22.311
that a radio show could touch
people all over the world.

00:30:22.311 --> 00:30:24.060
That was how this
entire thing came about.

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.550
Eric was like, I heard
about this really cool thing

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:27.810
called a podcast.

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:29.610
Like, literally, that's
how that started.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:31.110
So I'm curious to
know, like, what--

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:34.410
this is an example of how
technology can empower folks.

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:36.870
What opportunities do you
see through technology?

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:39.030
And then on the flip side,
what types of challenges

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:41.436
do you see through technology?

00:30:47.268 --> 00:30:50.510
AARON KINZEL: So I think
there's a lot of opportunity

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:51.219
for technology.

00:30:51.219 --> 00:30:53.510
Something that has been done
as a pilot in the Michigan

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:55.975
Department of Corrections and
other correctional systems

00:30:55.975 --> 00:30:58.100
nationwide is they're
starting to integrate tablets

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:00.080
into those carceral
spaces, which I think

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.592
is extremely powerful.

00:31:01.592 --> 00:31:03.050
And some people
will some kick-back

00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:05.466
on that saying that they're
kind of pimping the prisoners,

00:31:05.466 --> 00:31:07.674
but I really have
a pushback on that

00:31:07.674 --> 00:31:10.340
because they're making money off
these tablets-- which you know,

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:11.540
Google's a corporation, too.

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.010
No, I'm not hating on Google.

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:14.642
You guys gotta make money.

00:31:14.642 --> 00:31:15.350
It is what it is.

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:16.190
There's a bottom dollar.

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:17.023
You gotta do things.

00:31:17.023 --> 00:31:19.430
But what I think is
extremely important

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:21.890
is getting that technology
in those prison spaces

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:23.990
where people are
able to start getting

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:27.470
those technological skill sets.

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:29.150
And something I'm
working on now is

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:31.691
I'm trying to develop a pilot
with the University of Michigan

00:31:31.691 --> 00:31:34.177
Dearborn in which we can
create hybrid courses that

00:31:34.177 --> 00:31:36.260
will be offered, and we're
looking for foundations

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:38.390
to fund those where
some of the courses

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:40.070
could be held
online in a tablet.

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:41.980
So they could be
getting academic credit

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:43.922
doing a course on a
tablet in their cell,

00:31:43.922 --> 00:31:46.130
but also having face-to-face
classes, kind of like we

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:47.540
have here out on the streets.

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:49.010
Because there's a lot
of hybrid functionality.

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:50.990
I don't think we should
have a fully online

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:53.120
or fully in person, but I
think a blend of the two

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.812
integrating technology is great.

00:31:55.812 --> 00:31:56.895
I'm sorry, the other part?

00:31:56.895 --> 00:31:58.030
JACOB SMITH: Challenges.

00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:00.200
AARON KINZEL: Challenges--
getting those tablets

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.300
into the prison system.

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:05.720
The Department of Corrections
is kind of strange at times.

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.600
It's a very strange bird.

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.420
So when they feel that
it is to their advantage,

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:13.010
they're more open to it.

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:16.730
And I think what places like
Google and other foundations

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:19.580
that are connected to these
corporate entities can do is

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.624
try to develop relationships
with Department

00:32:21.624 --> 00:32:23.540
of Corrections-- maybe
the Michigan Department

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:26.840
of Corrections as a start,
other Department of Corrections

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.400
at the federal level state--

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.670
and find ways to
really give them

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:35.000
opportunities to allow
prisoners to have programming

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.895
with these
technological products.

00:32:40.904 --> 00:32:46.340
KARLOS L. HARRIS: So in April,
I did a commencement speech

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:49.310
at Lapeer Correctional
Institution

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:55.460
for about 53 individuals
who had gained their GED.

00:32:55.460 --> 00:33:00.500
And while there, I was
approached and asked

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.140
if there was a way that we
could actually offer training

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.880
at this individual prison.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.130
The prison is the
only one in the state

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:10.850
that houses youthful offenders.

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:13.790
And so I actually
proposed to MDOC

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:17.120
that we would be able to
come in and train them

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.510
in digital marketing.

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:19.010
Why?

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:20.870
Because it saved my life.

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:21.770
Right?

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:25.340
And so speaking directly about
the technology, the platform

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:29.030
that they use is called
Lantern, and it's with JPay.

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:32.960
The JPay system is the one
that's used statewide in order

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.290
that they would receive--

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:41.870
whether it be funding, or
media, videos, trainings.

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:45.200
And the unique thing
about the JPay system

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.320
is that if you are a
educational institution,

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.560
you can set the
platform up at no cost

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.610
to the inmates themselves.

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:55.430
And so that's
something that we've

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:57.200
been working on at the school.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.150
And I would love to
partner with you guys

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:01.970
in order to make
that accessible.

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:06.410
Because one of the
first things that we

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.389
were given the
problem of was, how

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:11.719
do we get more of the
guys the trainings

00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:13.550
that we have developed?

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:16.570
And it seemed like the
easiest way was through JPay.

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:19.070
And the wheel doesn't
have to be reinvented.

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:21.860
It's just a matter of
putting the content together,

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:23.530
getting it on a system.

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:25.820
And it's amazing
that I've already

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:27.920
developed these
relationships that I'm

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.120
able to make that happen.

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:33.440
So what are the
unique challenges

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:37.010
that I see as far
as the technology?

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:39.530
The individuals that
are coming home.

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:44.150
The ones that I sit and I try
to work with on a daily basis,

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:48.110
they just have no
idea whatsoever

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:51.500
of how far this
technology can take them.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.060
Literally.

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.250
I have guys that
come home and think

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:57.884
that it's OK to just
post anything on Facebook

00:34:57.884 --> 00:34:59.300
until they go out
to an interview,

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:02.050
and they don't get the job
because of what they posted,

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:03.560
right?

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.260
I have individuals that
have been returned back

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:10.280
to prison because of
postings that they made.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.430
So they haven't really
got a fine sense

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:17.040
of the technology and the
day and age that we live in.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.310
So I think that that's
one of the haphazards

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:21.770
to the technology piece for
those that are coming on.

00:35:25.847 --> 00:35:27.730
ERIK BURGESS: Piggyback
on what Carlos

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:31.670
said, Technology is what
I think is going to keep

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:35.930
most individuals out of prison.

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:38.230
Fortunately, this is
the way of the world.

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:41.170
And we must be prepared
and equipped to be

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:43.470
a part of the world if
we want to be productive.

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:45.690
Network and technology
got me to this point.

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:47.342
When I approached Jacob--

00:35:47.342 --> 00:35:48.800
somebody told me
about the podcast.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:51.270
I was like, how can
I implement this

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:54.420
in my life to make an impact
all around the world--

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.970
not only just in Wayne
County or Detroit?

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:58.470
I wanted to make
an impact and share

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:00.940
my story around the world.

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:01.930
So I approached Jacob.

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:03.596
I was like, man, you
heard of a podcast?

00:36:03.596 --> 00:36:06.490
I met Jacob at an
event, just talking.

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:08.115
I'm always talking
and asking question,

00:36:08.115 --> 00:36:09.250
so it didn't make a difference.

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:10.697
He could have been
four feet tall.

00:36:10.697 --> 00:36:11.863
It didn't make a difference.

00:36:11.863 --> 00:36:12.749
[LAUGHS]

00:36:12.749 --> 00:36:15.040
I was like, Jacob have you
heard of-- introduce myself,

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.720
as everybody did, as such and
such, this amount of time.

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:18.510
He was like, I want
to hear your story.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:19.780
I said, have you of
heard of a podcast?

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:20.330
He said, yes.

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:23.430
So I told him I had an idea,
and we collaborated, and this

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:25.150
is where we are right now.

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:28.440
And I think the biggest
challenge, the biggest obstacle

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.357
for improvement is self.

00:36:30.357 --> 00:36:31.440
That's what it's based on.

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.750
It's based on self.

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:35.730
So the advancement
is based on yourself

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:36.910
if you want to advance.

00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:39.520
Where your biggest
challenges is is self.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.512
You've got to want to change.

00:36:41.512 --> 00:36:42.720
That's why I want to become--

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.010
we've got to want to change.

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:47.590
So self is the biggest
challenge, or self,

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:49.740
is the improvement.

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:53.040
MICHELLE SMART: I'm going
to have to agree with Eric.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.210
It is self.

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:56.790
And I have to be
honest because I'm

00:36:56.790 --> 00:37:00.990
kind of technology challenged
myself in certain areas.

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:02.370
We have the ladies coming home.

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:04.050
They're getting
these cell phones.

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:06.420
They have no idea
how to use them.

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.500
I mean, I pick mine up.

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:13.290
As long as I can say hello
and send a text, I'm good.

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:16.586
Are the apps and all of that
stuff, I don't personally use,

00:37:16.586 --> 00:37:18.210
so we've been trying
to get someone out

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:21.280
to train the ladies on
using the cell phones.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:24.090
I mean, you don't have to speak
with someone with your cell

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:26.820
phone on speaker,
that type of thing.

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:28.260
And it's been challenging.

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:31.110
They have a certain
carrier that they use,

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:34.050
and just trying to get someone
from that particular carrier

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:37.290
to come out or you know to
help the ladies with that,

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:41.790
it's been quite difficult.
So I'm kind of guilty myself.

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:43.870
I don't know a lot
about the technology,

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:45.600
but I'm learning and
willing to learn.

00:37:47.529 --> 00:37:49.820
JACOB SMITH: But you did
launch an e-commerce business,

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:51.836
which is pretty cool.

00:37:51.836 --> 00:37:53.210
She doesn't know
about technology

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:55.418
and still launched an
e-commerce business-- testament

00:37:55.418 --> 00:37:56.720
to how far technology's come.

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.880
So now, what we're going
to do is we're actually--

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:01.380
so as many of the folks tuning
in and the folks in this room

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:06.200
know, Google is a leader in
the training and education

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.200
space around the world.

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.820
I mean, all types of incredible
programs come out of Google.

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:14.450
So I'm going to invite Elyse
Guilfoyle to come rejoin us up

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:16.700
here and tell us a
bit more in detail

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:19.550
about the types of
relevant efforts

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:20.882
that Google is working on.

00:38:20.882 --> 00:38:22.340
And then, we're
going to kick off--

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.800
we took some Q and A
in advance, so we're

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.822
going to kick off the Q and A
and turn it back to the panel.

00:38:27.822 --> 00:38:29.280
ELYSE GUILFOYLE:
Thank you so much.

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.010
And thanks everybody
for your perspective

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:32.218
and sharing your experiences.

00:38:32.218 --> 00:38:35.780
This has been really incredible.

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.340
So some of the
things that Google

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:39.381
has done I think on a
national level-- and Aaron,

00:38:39.381 --> 00:38:41.630
you mentioned this earlier.

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:43.640
There's the Ban
the Box initiative.

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:48.830
And in 2016, Google, along with
a lot of other tech companies,

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:54.230
pledged to end up having
a box that says, like,

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:55.940
"have I ever been
convicted of a felony"

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:59.150
very early on in the process
that removes a lot of people

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:01.190
from being considered.

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:04.550
And it doesn't give context
for what they've been through,

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:07.080
and their experience,
and all of their--

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.060
and even qualifications.

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:13.190
So I think our question to
you is, in addition to that--

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:15.714
and we have a lot of other
smaller local initiatives

00:39:15.714 --> 00:39:18.130
to that are trying to make a
difference for the people who

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:22.220
have been formerly incarcerated,
but I guess what role do you

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:26.000
see companies like Google
and other businesses playing

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.280
in ex-offenders'
reentry into society

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.590
and, especially, the workforce?

00:39:33.092 --> 00:39:34.550
ERIK BURGESS: First
of all, I think

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:38.150
Google can develop
a platform where

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:41.570
it can-- a proactive
process, where it can include

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:43.820
diversity and inclusion.

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:47.510
Myself, I'm working on a
social entrepreneur business

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:48.470
as far as--

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:50.320
it's called Digit 650.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.860
And the reason I
call Digit 650 is

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:55.610
because the way we communicate
in the world is digital.

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:57.600
And 650, I was convicted.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:58.250
That's my past.

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:01.430
I was convicted under
the 650 drug-lifer law.

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:03.640
So that's why I
call it Digit 650,

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:06.700
where I can make my past
make an imprint on the future

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:12.330
and where my goal is to go
into the juvenile court system

00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:14.760
and try to eliminate
FTAs, which FTAs stand

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:17.960
for "failure to appear"
due to the lack of probably

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:21.650
transportation or any
external or internal factors

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:22.580
the parents may have.

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:30.750
75% of Wayne County families
have smartphones, and 60% or so

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:32.930
of families do not
have transportation.

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:37.400
So any low-income defendants
who may have trouble or somehow

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.590
impeding transportation
or any other inconvenience

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:46.560
to get to court, my goal is to
have a virtual hearing court

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:50.270
session for nonviolent offenders
or whatever through mobile.

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:52.370
It can be mobile,
iPad, or computer.

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:57.960
Google shouldn't have to put
any money into this system.

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:00.530
If they just have the
willingness to be involved--

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:02.990
companies like that, just the
willingness to be involved.

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:04.882
It's not all about
financial gain.

00:41:04.882 --> 00:41:06.590
So it's about willingness
to be involved,

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:10.280
having compassion,
and having a purpose.

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.820
So that's why I feel Google
and any other organization that

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:18.440
can help be proactive-- and I'm
looking for reactionary aspect.

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:20.390
Because we have a
lot of reactionary

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:21.870
organizations out here.

00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:23.420
But like I say,
my goal is really

00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:26.750
to change this title of "The
Returning Citizen Podcast"

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:33.670
and change it to "Not to Become
a Returning Citizen" soon.

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:36.750
KARLOS L. HARRIS: So
if I had a wish list--

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:38.520
I have this thing
where I say we have

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.990
to hold their feet to the fire.

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:45.120
Although there's a
lot of propaganda

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.250
about returning
citizens and having

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:50.970
second chances, in truth,
that's all that it is at times

00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:52.920
is propaganda.

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:56.310
Last year, we graduated
about 185 individuals

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:58.080
through our programs.

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.720
And a huge portion of them
were returning citizens.

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.970
And at the end of the day,
it's still difficult for us

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:05.520
to find employment
opportunities for them.

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:08.354
I don't care if the Ban the
Box initiative doesn't pass.

00:42:08.354 --> 00:42:10.020
Whatever the situation
is, it's the fact

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:12.030
that their background
still follow them.

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:14.070
So if companies like
Google, who have

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:18.510
come into perhaps
one of the cities

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:21.540
within the state where the most
returning citizens are coming

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:24.270
back to, would actually
take up the initiative

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:26.880
to offer some sort
of -level positions

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.470
to some of these
offenders, that would

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:32.340
be huge within our community.

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:34.260
As well as if
there was some sort

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:38.700
of incentives behind your
entrepreneur endeavors.

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:41.180
A lot of us are
entrepreneurial-minded.

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:43.890
And if we had an
opportunity to actually find

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:47.430
some sort of funding for
the ideas that we had,

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:49.630
that would be huge
for us as well.

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:55.080
So I think that those pairings
would offer a great opportunity

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:58.980
for those within the community
to accelerate their return

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:02.114
and be more successful.

00:43:02.114 --> 00:43:04.550
AARON KINZEL: So I take
it even to a higher level.

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:07.040
I mean, there's a lot of
formerly incarcerated people

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:09.830
that could go well beyond
entry-level position.

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:11.360
So I really
encourage you to look

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:15.830
at people who could be at
the administrative level,

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:18.664
perhaps on a foundation
board, or maybe even create

00:43:18.664 --> 00:43:20.330
a panel of formerly
incarcerated people.

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:23.330
If you want to work on
reforming the system

00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:26.180
and give back through
corporate donations,

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.640
you need a panel of people
that have been justice-involved

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.560
and also survivors of crime.

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.490
People always leave them
out of the equation.

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:35.660
You need survivors of crime who
are people on the streets that

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:38.360
have been subjected to criminal
activity and also people

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:40.070
that have been in
the carceral state,

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:42.320
and then mix it up with
random other community members

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.346
to kind of really find a way--

00:43:44.346 --> 00:43:46.220
what are the programs
that are worth funding?

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:48.320
What do you want to
throw your dollars at?

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.600
And find some really
bright individuals

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.180
who have gained
academic credentials,

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:56.960
professional credentials,
technological credentials that

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:00.480
can really help expand Google
in completely different ways.

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:02.540
And I really challenge Google.

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:05.750
Think about ways how you
can really invest technology

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:07.455
into prisons and jails.

00:44:07.455 --> 00:44:09.830
And also, youth facility--
that's another thing we rarely

00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:10.670
talk about--

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:13.020
these juvenile detention
facilities nationwide,

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.570
where youth are often forgotten.

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:16.550
If anybody deserves
a second chance,

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:19.070
it's someone under the age 18.

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:21.980
Kids should definitely never be
just the snapshot of one thing

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:25.170
that they've done in their life.

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:27.050
MICHELLE SMART: Wow.

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:30.050
Through our
organization, our program

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:33.110
is a nine-month transitional
employment initiative.

00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:36.470
We're actually testing
this concept out.

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:38.390
When the ladies
transition out, it

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:41.390
is our thought that they
would either transition out--

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:42.710
Michelle's shaking her head no.

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:44.085
She's already told
me she's going

00:44:44.085 --> 00:44:46.539
to be protesting outside
when her nine months is up.

00:44:46.539 --> 00:44:48.080
But we don't know
what we don't know.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:49.871
So we don't know if
nine months is actually

00:44:49.871 --> 00:44:52.250
enough time for the ladies
when they come home.

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:54.320
But we do know
that, at some point,

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.660
they are going to transition
out of our program,

00:44:56.660 --> 00:45:00.720
and we are looking for partners,
someone to partner with us so

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.970
ladies will have trained,
they'll have the job skills,

00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:04.710
they'll have the life skills.

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:06.680
And at some point, they
will transition out.

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:09.320
We love to partner
with organizations

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:11.690
so that they know that when
they leave our organization,

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:15.470
they have some place to go
as far as being employed.

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:17.240
Or entrepreneurship--
we're working

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:21.140
with Build Institute, who will
be taking some of our ladies

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:23.324
who have
entrepreneurship desires.

00:45:23.324 --> 00:45:24.990
They want to start
their own businesses.

00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:28.160
So collaborations like that
for us would definitely

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.328
be very important.

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.990
ELYSE GUILFOYLE:
Awesome, thank you.

00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:39.830
Yes, we can maybe do
two more questions.

00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:42.170
So last year, we hosted
a Talks at Google event

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:45.080
that featured
RecoveryPark Farms, which

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.460
is based here in Detroit.

00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:48.296
And I think our
question was around,

00:45:48.296 --> 00:45:49.670
have you seen
other organizations

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:51.950
that have had similar
success in building

00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:54.230
a bridge for returning
citizens from incarceration

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:55.874
to the workforce?

00:45:55.874 --> 00:45:58.290
JACOB SMITH: I'm going to hand
this one over to the panel,

00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:00.260
but I just want to
point out that Anna

00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:02.960
Kohn from RecoveryPark Farms
was featured on, I believe,

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:05.870
episode 2 of "The
Returning Citizen Podcast."

00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:07.490
They are an incredible
organization,

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:10.760
so I'm so excited to hear that.

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.560
A major function
of the podcast is

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:15.590
to be highlighting, in
detail, other entities that

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:18.050
are deep diving and
doing this type of work.

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:20.150
But I'd love to not go
into too much detail

00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:23.410
and let the panel
answer that one.

00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:25.840
AARON KINZEL: I guess I'll
bring it back not necessarily

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:28.210
specifically to the city of
Detroit but just statewide,

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:30.610
where this post-secondary
access to education, I think,

00:46:30.610 --> 00:46:31.200
is profound.

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.790
I think if any issue is
pivotal to helping people

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:38.680
inside finding private donation
monies to help fund prison

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:41.200
education, I think
it's an investment that

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:44.110
will have an incredible
ROI, return on investment,

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:46.589
where you're going to have
people coming out like myself

00:46:46.589 --> 00:46:48.130
and the other
gentlemen on this panel

00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:49.880
will spend some
significant amount of time

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:53.080
in the system, where education,
I think, for all of us

00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:56.560
has been really key in turning
our life around and becoming

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:59.870
productive-- and not just for
ourselves and our families,

00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:01.639
but for those around us.

00:47:01.639 --> 00:47:03.430
I mentor youth that
come out of the system.

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:06.990
I mentor men who are older than
me, women who are older than me

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:08.500
that did 20, 30
years and help them

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:11.870
get on that technological
kick or access to education.

00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:14.710
So if anything, I would just
say, look at our programs

00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:16.720
for bringing education
back in the system.

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:19.606
JACOB SMITH: Any specific
example of organizations?

00:47:19.606 --> 00:47:22.000
AARON KINZEL: I know the
Vera Institute of Justice,

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.250
which is a huge powerhouse
think tank of criminal justice.

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:27.580
They threw a lot
of private dollars

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:28.637
towards prison education.

00:47:28.637 --> 00:47:30.970
And they were one of the ones
that helped push that Pell

00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:32.620
Grant pilot that we
currently have here

00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:36.166
in the state of Michigan
and others across the US.

00:47:36.166 --> 00:47:38.700
MICHELLE SMART: So
our organization

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:41.760
is actually what we believe
is the first organization

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:44.940
to empower formerly incarcerated
women with employment

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:48.070
immediately upon their
return to the community.

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:51.480
And just in speaking
with the ladies,

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:54.910
just knowing that they're coming
home and that they have a job,

00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:57.450
they want to be able
to be self-sufficient.

00:47:57.450 --> 00:48:01.140
We are doing a lot of
collaborative things

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:03.242
in the community
with organizations.

00:48:03.242 --> 00:48:04.950
There's another
organization, Rebel Nell,

00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:08.760
that does the graffiti
jewelry with women

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:11.020
with barriers to employment.

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:13.784
But as far as when
they come home

00:48:13.784 --> 00:48:16.200
and they know when they leave
those prison gates that they

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:20.250
can come to our organization,
get an interview, and be hired,

00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:21.470
it's very-- it's crucial.

00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:32.570
KARLOS L. HARRIS: So DSDT,
we're kind of different.

00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:34.390
And so a lot of
the men and women

00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:37.690
that we train,
because of the lack

00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:41.080
of being able to bridge
them with employment,

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.720
we've been creative
in hiring them.

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:48.550
So at one time, I think we
were up near 30 individuals

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:52.120
that we had employed
with us around March.

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:54.230
And so that comes
through a lot of funding,

00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:59.080
whether it be through
the Department of Labor

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.900
and some citywide
initiatives as well.

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:07.270
So I think for us, when we're
showing up at these job fairs--

00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:11.680
and at times, we're truly
the only one employer

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:17.020
of the returning citizens,
that says something to me.

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:20.890
I've never heard of Bags to
Butterflies until literally I

00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:22.270
saw the flyer.

00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:23.770
And I don't know
if it's necessarily

00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:25.730
that we work in silos.

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:29.320
It's just that the
information isn't out there.

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:34.750
The only other organization
that I'm akin to is LUCK, Inc.

00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:36.250
And LUCK, Inc.
does a lot of work

00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:40.340
with returning citizens who've
been away for quite some time.

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:45.850
And so I think that if
we are allowed somehow

00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:49.150
to come together and work more
as a team to kind of tackle

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:51.760
what's facing our
community, it'll

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.740
be more successful for
all of us in the long run.

00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:57.630
JACOB SMITH: And quick shout
out to Carlos and DSDT.

00:49:57.630 --> 00:50:01.620
We had a gentleman come to us
this past year who had spent

00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:04.760
a long stint in prison,
middle-aged guy,

00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:06.720
probably around 60 years old--

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.630
he was a former school
superintendent or administrator

00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:10.240
of some sort.

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:13.040
So to Aaron's point, not
always entry-level talent.

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:16.830
He had committed a crime later
in life, very smart, very

00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:18.400
well-educated guy.

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.190
And Carlos gave him
an opportunity to--

00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:21.731
I don't know exactly
what he's doing,

00:50:21.731 --> 00:50:24.300
but some sort of
administrative work at DSDT

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:26.610
as a form of
transitional employment.

00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:29.404
So huge shout out.

00:50:29.404 --> 00:50:31.820
Any other organizations that
are jumping out to you, Erik,

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:34.615
offhand that you
to mention quickly?

00:50:34.615 --> 00:50:36.770
ERIK BURGESS: LUCK,
Inc. and another one

00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:41.120
ran by Keith Bennett
called "Flip the Script."

00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:45.530
And also, our family
is an organization.

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:47.785
So all you have to do is ask.

00:50:47.785 --> 00:50:49.450
Our family and friends--

00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:51.120
a huge organization.

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:54.086
So that's where it starts.

00:50:54.086 --> 00:50:55.460
ELYSE GUILFOYLE: Thank you.

00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:57.690
Our last question is
a little off topic,

00:50:57.690 --> 00:51:01.517
but it's very timely as we
approach the midterm elections.

00:51:01.517 --> 00:51:04.100
The question is, what are your
thoughts on states like Florida

00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:06.800
putting the removal of
felony disenfranchisement

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:09.380
on the ballot, and how can we
support initiatives like this

00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:12.230
to enable ex-felons beyond
education, even if we

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:14.400
don't live in those states?

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.790
KARLOS L. HARRIS: Please
let me tackle this one.

00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:18.290
Please.

00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:23.240
All right, so we're part
of a accreditation process

00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:28.130
organization called Council
on Occupational Education.

00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:33.620
And so we are slated to
be in Florida the 5th

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:36.500
through the 9th of November.

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:40.760
And I am watching this
election so heavily right now.

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.950
Because I'm really
at odds with going

00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:45.950
to a state where my
community doesn't even

00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:48.120
have the right to vote.

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:54.910
So for me, my trip is
literally in the hangar,

00:51:54.910 --> 00:52:00.910
as it's decided whether or not
the right to vote by ex-felons

00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:03.160
will be granted once again.

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:06.340
I think that the process that
they've been implementing

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:09.910
over the years is archaic.

00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:12.870
I cherish my right to vote.

00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:14.390
Now think about this.

00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:16.790
I'm the guy whose
driver's license

00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:19.940
was suspended for 18 years.

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:22.640
And I had more suspended
license tickets,

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:24.740
and I've been in
jails and prisons,

00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:30.490
but yet, at every opportunity
I had to vote, I was there.

00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:33.790
And my children,
they're 18 and 20 now.

00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:38.020
They vote because their
father was there taking them.

00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:42.400
So I don't take lightly the fact
of people being disenfranchised

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.680
within my community
because they're not

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:46.130
afforded the right to vote.

00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:48.640
I think that it's a right
that we're all entitled to,

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:50.800
regardless of our backgrounds.

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:55.620
And we should be afforded the
opportunity to exercise it.

00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:57.620
JACOB SMITH: Anyone else
want to weigh in there?

00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:02.384
And I just want to point
out-- so in Michigan, formerly

00:53:02.384 --> 00:53:03.800
incarcerated
individuals can vote.

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:06.830
Can you vote while
you're in prison?

00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:09.260
Will you explain the climate
in Michigan currently?

00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:14.180
AARON KINZEL: So as a pretrial
detainee in a county jail,

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:16.880
you're allowed to vote
if you're not convicted.

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:19.590
Once you are sentenced in
the county jail or you go off

00:53:19.590 --> 00:53:21.650
to prison, you cannot
vote in Michigan.

00:53:21.650 --> 00:53:24.380
There are two states--

00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:25.985
one was Maine, and
I believe the other

00:53:25.985 --> 00:53:29.420
is Vermont where you can
actually vote absentee ballot

00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:30.590
in a prison setting.

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:36.410
So we've got a 2.3 million
people inside right now.

00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:38.000
That's a huge voting block.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.740
And now if you take that
and you look at nationally--

00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:43.610
there's different
stats that say this--

00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:46.250
but roughly 70 million
Americans have some type

00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:48.740
of criminal justice history--
whether that's an arrest,

00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:51.050
a conviction, a
juvie bit, whatever.

00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:51.990
They have something.

00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:53.780
So think about that
as a voting block.

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:56.240
So to piggyback off
what Carlos said,

00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:58.100
I'm actually
working on something

00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:01.220
with the Soros Justice
Fellowship Project,

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:04.370
where I'm trying to create this
carceral state public policy

00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:06.710
training academy which
would empower formerly

00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:09.200
incarcerated people,
survivors of crime,

00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:13.340
not only to register to vote
and vote, but to educate them.

00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:15.590
Because a lot of people
who go out and vote

00:54:15.590 --> 00:54:17.480
are uneducated
voters, unfortunately.

00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:18.990
That's just the reality.

00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:23.210
So create a platform that
is criminal justice minded.

00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:24.470
What are the important issues?

00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:26.810
Like, for instance,
mandatory minimum,

00:54:26.810 --> 00:54:29.390
solitary confinement,
abolishing the death penalty,

00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:31.280
et cetera, et cetera.

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:34.160
Create a voting block that
is focused on these issues.

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:36.080
Secondary to that,
we need to have

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:38.000
people mobilize in
their communities

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.790
and have formerly incarcerated
people and survivors of crime

00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:42.740
run for elected offices.

00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:45.440
It seems real simple, but a lot
of people are scared to do it.

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:47.420
Local, state, and
federal level, if you

00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:50.840
add those 70 million people in
this country, and their family,

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:52.749
and friends, that's half
of this country now.

00:54:52.749 --> 00:54:54.290
Think about the
changes that we could

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:57.800
have if we got all those people,
or even just 10% or 20% of them

00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:00.590
that could really dramatically
change not just this midterm

00:55:00.590 --> 00:55:03.590
election, but come 2020,
I know a certain person

00:55:03.590 --> 00:55:07.615
I want to vote the hell out
of office very, very much.

00:55:07.615 --> 00:55:09.740
And there's a lot of other
congressional reps, too,

00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:11.492
and state level,
and local level.

00:55:11.492 --> 00:55:12.950
Because they are
not representative

00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:14.390
of a lot of our interests.

00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:16.610
I find that, now, we
have corporate policy.

00:55:16.610 --> 00:55:18.110
And no offense to
Google right here,

00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:21.890
but I feel that we need
to find more ways that

00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:25.850
are more beneficial to citizens
as opposed to corporations,

00:55:25.850 --> 00:55:27.330
so that's my platform on that.

00:55:30.550 --> 00:55:33.630
JACOB SMITH: And just to clarify
for anyone who is formerly

00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:35.940
incarcerated or the families
of folks that are formerly

00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:38.710
incarcerated, you
can vote in Michigan

00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:40.680
if you're formerly
incarcerated-- so just to be

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:42.670
super clear on that topic.

00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:45.420
I think a lot of folks are
intimidated, or confused,

00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:47.510
and don't realize that
they are able to vote.

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:49.290
AARON KINZEL: They think
it doesn't matter as well.

00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:50.690
They think they're
vote doesn't matter.

00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:52.773
JACOB SMITH: They think
their vote doesn't matter.

00:55:52.773 --> 00:55:54.962
So, yeah, please,
everybody vote.

00:55:54.962 --> 00:55:55.920
ELYSE GUILFOYLE: Great.

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:58.270
Thank you everybody so
much for being here.

00:55:58.270 --> 00:55:59.880
A round of applause
for our panel.

00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:03.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:04.470
Awesome.

00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:05.890
Thank you so much for your time.

00:56:05.890 --> 00:56:09.050
We're really glad that you came
here today to share with us.
