1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,283
I'm Jad Abumrad,

2
00:00:01,381 --> 00:00:05,490
this is Radiolab and this is the third
and final part of our series in the know

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,780
about sex and consent.

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,770
We started a couple of weeks ago with
some excerpts from a podcast called the

5
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:15,540
heart, uh, produced by Caitlin pressed.
Uh, and then last week had a long, uh,

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,000
at times difficult conversation
with education consultant.

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,640
Hanta Startland heard a bit from uh,
some college age men in that episode. Uh,

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,230
today?

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,310
Yes, I do have my shoes. Yes. Have
you? Anyone was looking for shoes.

10
00:00:27,311 --> 00:00:30,370
Get comfortable. We're going to
start with some college age women.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,460
If you need to stretch, you can like
be like, hey, it's been too long.

12
00:00:33,461 --> 00:00:36,160
Like we can do yoga. No,

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,250
because what we ended up doing a sort
of mid way through the process was

14
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:44,010
gathering together a whole bunch of
different groups of men and women,

15
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:45,120
college age men and women,

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,410
three different cities and just asking
them general questions about how they're

17
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:50,250
thinking about this stuff.

18
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:55,260
Are you excited? No. I ended
up interviewing the Manson.

19
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,950
I'll turn this part over to Becca Bressler
and she [inaudible] who were with the

20
00:00:58,951 --> 00:00:59,784
women,

21
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,080
the average group that we talked
to was maybe a dozen women.

22
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,210
We tried to make it as diverse as possible

23
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,120
and then the first thing
that really struck us,

24
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:16,410
I think she might tell me if you agree,
is there was sort of a disconnect.

25
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,190
Like on the one hand it seemed like
affirmative consent for almost everyone we

26
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:22,600
talked to seemed like second nature. Yeah.

27
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,780
So a actually teach like a workshop
on consent for high schoolers.

28
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:29,140
Some of them have you even teaching
classes on it? Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

29
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:33,430
So you know like ca to, yeah.
So like a clear and concise yes.

30
00:01:33,431 --> 00:01:35,350
At every step of sexual activity.

31
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,580
I think that's like amazing that we're
teaching kids that now and like I do feel

32
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:44,310
like it's my generation's problem to
change it and change the narrative about

33
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,140
it. So a lot of them were really committed
to actually changing the way consent

34
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,460
looks, the way that these sexual
experiences go and how they're navigated.

35
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,330
But then when we would, you know,

36
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,550
focus in on what they were actually
experiencing in their lives,

37
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,650
what we saw was much different.

38
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,650
It's my friend and I
ended up at a bar. Um,

39
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,000
and like the bartender was really cute
and we were like flirting and he like,

40
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,660
I don't want to give any identifying
information, but we were just like vibing.

41
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:12,640
And I like hooked up with him.

42
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:15,190
And then like immediately after I started
hooking up with him, I was like, oh,

43
00:02:15,191 --> 00:02:18,520
this is not what I want. But like at
that point it's kind of like saying no,

44
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,310
it would be like much
more of an uncomfortable
situation than just like going

45
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:24,710
through with this and like understanding
that I already regretted kind,

46
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,490
I don't know,

47
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:29,150
didn't leave, but eventually I was
just like, okay, fine, like whatever.

48
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,240
Cause they would just be like, please,
like, come on please. Like, you know,

49
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,820
you're turned on a little bit like,
and I'd be like, fine, whatever.

50
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,000
Like let's find, let's fuck.

51
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:38,780
And he was going down on me and like
had asked me if I to have sex and I said

52
00:02:38,781 --> 00:02:39,440
no.

53
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,350
And eventually like I just like kind of
wanted it to be like over with like the

54
00:02:42,351 --> 00:02:45,800
entire interaction and I was just
uncomfortable and then I was like, okay,

55
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:49,070
like let's have sex just because I thought
that like that was the easier way to

56
00:02:49,071 --> 00:02:53,510
like make him happy, make like get
done with it and then like it be over.

57
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,020
We just heard a lot of stories of people
having sex that they didn't want to

58
00:02:57,021 --> 00:03:00,430
have. You know where maybe
affirmative was in effect.

59
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:05,140
They did say yes but it was either because
the guy wore them down or they were

60
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:07,210
way too concerned with how he was feeling

61
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,560
like it would make him
feel really, really bad.

62
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,460
I know that like if he would have known
that I felt that way he would have gone

63
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:17,090
through with it and like I just didn't
want to like hurt his feelings and be

64
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:20,090
like and make him feel like he like
took advantage of me or whatever.

65
00:03:20,091 --> 00:03:23,330
When I knew that there would be no
possible way that he would know that I was

66
00:03:23,331 --> 00:03:23,870
feeling that way.

67
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,160
Some women told us that they say yes
sometimes when they don't want to because

68
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,773
they're scared.

69
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:34,900
Part of the fear and saying a hard no is
that that hard no can then be violated

70
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:38,060
and that's like, that's
like a terrifying thought.

71
00:03:38,061 --> 00:03:41,120
Like to say like a hard no,

72
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,960
like that's more traumatizing to me like
in my head almost than having like a

73
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:45,800
soft, no,

74
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:50,720
just sort of like slid past
having fear of future trauma.

75
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,030
Like say it again. It's like
having a fear of future trauma. Um,

76
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:00,100
I take that to mean if your aim is to
stay in control and you feel like you

77
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:01,520
might be out of control,

78
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,840
then the best way to still be in control
is to convince yourself that you are

79
00:04:05,841 --> 00:04:07,820
cool with what's going on. Wow.

80
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:13,060
I walked away feeling like many of the
young women felt frustrated both with

81
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,530
their world but also
with themselves. Yeah.

82
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,150
Afterwards I would feel
like very disappointed in
myself because I would feel

83
00:04:23,151 --> 00:04:27,680
like add compromise my own needs for other
people that they would walk away from

84
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:31,220
a situation and they would
have regretted how it went.

85
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:34,910
They maybe didn't actually want to do
it but didn't stick up for themselves.

86
00:04:34,911 --> 00:04:37,730
And then I, and then you fight like a
battle with yourself cause it's like,

87
00:04:37,731 --> 00:04:39,140
wait a minute. Like I'm like strong.

88
00:04:39,141 --> 00:04:42,200
Like I know I can like
just stop it or like why?

89
00:04:42,201 --> 00:04:46,100
But it's so hard at like in
that moment to find like,

90
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,070
I don't know like the, the words just
to say it, you know, cause then it,

91
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:50,961
it sometimes you're just like,

92
00:04:50,961 --> 00:04:55,250
yeah it is just easier just to be like
let it like just like let them finish.

93
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:55,670
That's it.

94
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:00,380
Like it was clear for most of these women
that in the moment of these encounters

95
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,460
there were some conversation that
needed to happen that was not happening.

96
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,110
But then there actually was this one
young woman that we spoke to. Some people,

97
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,770
I think a lot of people talk about consent
as if it's like awkward and weird and

98
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,240
like, like she just said,

99
00:05:14,241 --> 00:05:19,241
con consent has really become popularized
and is really well advocated for by

100
00:05:19,671 --> 00:05:21,110
the BDSM community.

101
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:24,170
[inaudible]

102
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:27,950
BDSM is an abbreviation, so
it, it breathes gates, bondage,

103
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,780
discipline or domination,

104
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,090
sadism and masochism because
you constantly have to
make sure that somebody is

105
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:36,520
okay and be like this, this
rope to tight. She told us,

106
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,830
I mean the BDSM community has this
figured out and then she started talking

107
00:05:39,831 --> 00:05:44,690
about her own experience. So we've started
like, hmm, uh, what does that mean?

108
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:46,910
That the BDSM community
has figured that out?

109
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:52,090
Whoa. Hello? You got
a buzz there? Oh yeah.

110
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,160
It's like the B 52 bomber buzz.

111
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:57,980
Oh, that

112
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,660
sounds better. All right. Okay. Hi.
Hey. Good it we did it. We did it.

113
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,220
Did you feel like,

114
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,610
I always feel like after these technical
snafoos there's like a bonding that

115
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:09,530
happens. I feel bonded to you guys.

116
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,510
Well actually it's statistically true
thing that people suffering together feel

117
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:16,820
bonded to one another. Well, there you go.

118
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,070
[inaudible]

119
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,410
who are you by the way? What
do you do? My name is Julie.

120
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:27,470
I am an associate professor of sociology
at Gallaudet University and I've been

121
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:32,471
studying the BDSM
community since about 2012

122
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,110
we called up Julie
because she is one of the,

123
00:06:35,111 --> 00:06:37,780
I think it's safe to say
leading academics, uh,

124
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,290
when it comes to the BDSM community
and all of its subculture.

125
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,550
She has written papers,

126
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,540
she has done surveys and she
has done it from the inside.

127
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,310
A lot of kickstarters like me pretty
much felt like we were sort of born this

128
00:06:50,311 --> 00:06:54,570
way and it's really common to talk to
a lot of Kinky people who will tell you

129
00:06:54,571 --> 00:06:55,470
the same thing.

130
00:06:55,471 --> 00:07:00,471
Like I was five and fantasizing
about tying up people's Genitalia and

131
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,830
it's deep stuff, right? I
didn't know what genitals were.

132
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,560
Anyhow, one of the things
that we heard from Julie,

133
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,680
and we subsequently heard this also from
a lot of academics that we talked to

134
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:11,514
after her,

135
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,380
is it the whole consent conversation
in many ways grew out of BDSM a lot.

136
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,920
A lot of people will trace
like the history of BDSM
in the United States to the

137
00:07:19,921 --> 00:07:24,620
leatherman community. [inaudible]
haven't you heard? Oh,

138
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,460
this is a World War II era. By the way.

139
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,540
These gay men would hang
out in biker clubs at bars.

140
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,850
They would socialize.

141
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:36,210
They were a really tight knit
brotherhood over the decades.

142
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:41,070
The brother who grew into this much bigger
community and then it really exploded

143
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:46,130
in the 80s but there's a problem at the
time no one had ever really formally

144
00:07:46,711 --> 00:07:49,620
distinguished between BDSM,

145
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,560
a practice between willing
participants and violence.

146
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,610
Video Sam I think had to make the case
to the vanilla community to the non

147
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,020
[inaudible] community that they were not
insane but people were not getting off

148
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:04,070
on hurting people. That it was about
roles and role playing and power.

149
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,310
This is Joe for Shell.

150
00:08:05,311 --> 00:08:09,120
He's an associate professor of women's
gender and sexuality studies at Yale

151
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,270
Central.

152
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,770
The slogan to convince non people that
what they were doing was not violence or

153
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,380
crime.

154
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,350
The full slogan they came up with
and this is in the 80s was safe,

155
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:21,160
sane and consensual and it
really stuck to this day.

156
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:24,840
You can find it on
t-shirts. You can at any of,

157
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,610
at any BDSM community event or play party,

158
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:32,810
ah, parties that are organized
at, uh, formal spaces,

159
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,370
they're called dungeons. Right?

160
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,020
So getting back to Julia,
we asked her, uh, okay,

161
00:08:37,021 --> 00:08:40,620
if it is true as that one woman
said that the BDSM community,

162
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,850
if it is true that they have figured
something out about how to do it better,

163
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:49,830
well what is it? And uh, she told us
a couple of things. First drinking

164
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,130
my way of thinking
that's incredibly risky,

165
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,400
very frowned upon in the BDSM world
and the video sem scene. In my mind,

166
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:57,710
that's what we'd call edge play,

167
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,630
which is like kind of the things
that people do where you're like, ah,

168
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,500
that seems like a bad idea. Negotiating
sex when both people are really,

169
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:07,680
really drunk with somebody that you've
never met before qualifies as really,

170
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:08,514
really risky.

171
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,350
And speaking of that negotiation.

172
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,430
Another thing that was an interesting
contrast between the quote vanilla world

173
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:17,610
and BDSM is that when two
people are negotiating,

174
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:19,890
they're trying to figure out
if are going to get down. Uh,

175
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:24,000
in BDSM that conversation is
formalized and it's often public

176
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,290
because generally speaking, most of
what's happening is out in the open

177
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,390
these days you have people who've called
consent monitors that sometimes run

178
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:31,260
around these parties.

179
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,610
It's also not uncommon to be standing
there negotiating with someone where your

180
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,260
friend or their friend
is right next to them.

181
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,850
The idea is that that kind of social
monitoring makes things safer. Anyhow,

182
00:09:40,851 --> 00:09:43,910
I asked her to zoom in on a
specific consent conversation.

183
00:09:43,911 --> 00:09:44,780
How does it usually go?

184
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,150
Uh, people with different experiences,
levels are better and worse at this.

185
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:52,660
Typically like let's say I was
going to play with you, right?

186
00:09:52,661 --> 00:09:56,740
Like you're telling me you've never done
anything like this before, right? Zero,

187
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,070
zero. So, uh, I like to knife top,

188
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,100
which is a way of describing the fact
that I like to do things with knives on

189
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:10,570
two people. Actual cutting
of people or, or no, no,

190
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,830
this is just dragging knives along
people and sort of threatening with them,

191
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,780
like playing with knives and in truth,

192
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,330
the thing that I do to make it more
interesting as I like to cut people's

193
00:10:19,331 --> 00:10:20,970
clothes off of them big,

194
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:24,530
I teach a whole class on
how to cut people's clothes
off of them with knives or

195
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,910
they are they like cerated uh, it can be,

196
00:10:27,911 --> 00:10:30,400
so some of them have rough
edges and some of them don't.

197
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,370
And that's actually one of the
questions I would ask you. So, um,

198
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,920
I would ask you if you, you may be,

199
00:10:35,921 --> 00:10:39,580
would be more interested in sort of
a poking type sensation or more of a

200
00:10:39,581 --> 00:10:44,020
scraping tight sensation based on just
hearing that I'm gonna go with dragging.

201
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,290
I would select my knives accordingly at
that point cause I have separate knives

202
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:51,910
for these purposes. Um, and then I would,

203
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,680
if I was gonna cut your clothes
off, for example, I would ask you,

204
00:10:56,681 --> 00:11:00,910
I would let you know that there's,
I, I'm, I'm pretty good at what I do,

205
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,530
but there's no way that
I can guarantee that, uh,

206
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,580
I won't cut something that you
don't want me to. So if possible,

207
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:10,030
it'd be great if you could take off the
thing that you wouldn't want me to cut,

208
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,640
right. Like a necklace or
your socks or whatever.

209
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,300
And I also like warn people going into
them like I'm pretty experienced with

210
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:20,440
this, but I definitely have
accidentally cut people before. So, um,

211
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,710
you know, I just need to let you know
that this is not a 100% guarantee.

212
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:29,560
If or if that's something that you
absolutely cannot tolerate, then uh,

213
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,310
then we probably can't go forward with
this. Or if you say, well, I mean,

214
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:36,160
I'm fine with it as long as it isn't on
my arms cause I don't want to show up

215
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:38,110
for work. That's like great. Like,

216
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,930
well I'll just restrict
what I do to not your arms.

217
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,800
She said sometimes she'll even get a
pen and make a tiny little dot on all of

218
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:48,920
the places the person says are off limits.

219
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,700
Just so she can be super duper
sure. She's respecting their wishes,

220
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:56,310
their classes. I, hello everyone. Uh,

221
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,530
most well organized BDSM
scenes in the country.

222
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,140
Okay. You guys are allowed
to talk here. Believe me,

223
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,340
I know we have mikes around.

224
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:08,110
Have weekly or at least monthly
classes. We actually went to one.

225
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,590
How many people here have taken any
of my events before? Raise of hands.

226
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,540
There we go. Everyone else is new.

227
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:19,370
It was in Manhattan, a small studio
space. About 15 people were there. And uh,

228
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,001
the instructor,

229
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:25,001
a guy named dominous arrows was sort of
at the front of the room in a leather

230
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,320
kilt with these two leather
straps across. Yeah.

231
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,520
Now is everyone here familiar with
consent, please? All right, good.

232
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,090
Is there anyone know what a difference
between consent and enthusiastic consent?

233
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,980
One guy in the back raised his hand.

234
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,710
That's sort of a new thing that's
sort of coming up in a lot of clubs.

235
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,920
If there's a moment of hesitation
in that person's brain,

236
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,410
you should automatically be
picking that up and be like,

237
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,960
do you actually want to
do this thing with me?

238
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,090
And generally within the first 10 seconds,

239
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:52,980
someone can tell if they
want to have sex with you.

240
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,560
You're not going to convince someone
otherwise you're not gonna be like, man,

241
00:12:55,561 --> 00:12:59,040
I'm going to wear them down wearing not
technique. It pisses me off at a party.

242
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,620
Nobody owes you anything.
Everyone on board so far,

243
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,850
a lot of nods. Good. So, and then, uh,

244
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,130
he sort of demonstrated
how all of this works.

245
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,120
Inaction at first look at the table.
He took everyone over to this table,

246
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:13,430
showed them the toys,
different kinds of whips.

247
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,620
Floggers little stick
with a feather. Yeah.

248
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,280
Let me grab what this going to be.
My little tool to play around with.

249
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,320
Grabbed one of the floggers

250
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,430
and then he and a woman named
Bella who is in black lingerie,

251
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:29,350
they a walk over to this giant cross
looking thing in the corner of the room.

252
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,790
She then leads against it.

253
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,693
Good.

254
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,510
So I currently have Bella with the arms
spread on the Saint Andrew's cross.

255
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,220
Her legs going to be a little bit wider.

256
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:42,200
Fella is not that tall now we've
already had our top. Hey, what's cool,

257
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:46,580
I just met you. Am I allowed to put
my hand in your ass? The shoulders,

258
00:13:46,581 --> 00:13:47,414
your skin.

259
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,820
Do you want to keep you close as is
late or do you want to sort of slowly on

260
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:55,760
dressed as we play? Get all your things
because you don't know where they're at.

261
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,860
They could tell you just
want to be like this.

262
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,260
Bella has told me she just don't want
to take any more clothes off. Correct.

263
00:14:00,261 --> 00:14:03,290
Bella? Bella also doesn't
like a huge amount of pain,

264
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,080
so then we go with that feeling. All
right. That's like your shoulders,

265
00:14:06,081 --> 00:14:08,120
a little funky. You want to warm them up.

266
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,880
You don't go to the gym and do your
heavier set right away. Correct.

267
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,690
You going to sort of warm up the muscles?
I do light touching. Like hitting.

268
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,580
You start slowly whipping
your shoulders. Yeah.

269
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
Some nights you get that. Here.

270
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,790
I'm sort of just observing, waiting for
their body, sort of tell me some notes.

271
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,640
When I do impact, their body's
going to tell me something.

272
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,660
If I go a little heavy.

273
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,370
Okay,

274
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,180
there's a little bit of a turtling
in see you. The hips crawl in.

275
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,960
If the ass comes right back out right
away, that's saying, daddy hit me again.

276
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,730
Right? If this stays turtle,
then I've went a little heart.

277
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,330
I can come in and stay and again,
you're talking can be sexy.

278
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:49,170
It's not so much for you. Baby
is daddy needs to go lighter,

279
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,330
keep sexy. You don't have to
say, hey, was that too hard?

280
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:56,390
You can totally keep it in
very sexy and see how it goes.

281
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,380
Staying engaged is very important.
If you're in a space that's loud,

282
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:01,490
you can't fucking hear anything.

283
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,270
So I can hear if she's moaning
or if she's like, oh, you know,

284
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,070
so I want to be able to get my
ears in clothes, see how they do.

285
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,930
Then I create this sort of cadence,

286
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,200
play around a little bit more and from
there I'm combining between using impact

287
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:15,350
play and sense play.

288
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:17,750
We'll go a little more in depth once you
guys start playing around a little bit.

289
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,700
And I'll go around the room
because I want to get into the

290
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:23,920
workshop aspect where dominance spent
the next hour sort of moving around the

291
00:15:23,921 --> 00:15:24,754
room,

292
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,720
helping people as they paired off with
their whips and their floggers learn how

293
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:33,280
to better read each other.
And for a moment it felt like,

294
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,620
oh, we should all be doing this.

295
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,450
I mean maybe not using whips and having
sex in public unless that's your thing,

296
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,660
but finding ways to help each other be
explicit and communicative and to have a

297
00:15:46,661 --> 00:15:50,530
code for what words mean.

298
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,810
When we talked to college age men,
women, a lot of them were like,

299
00:15:52,811 --> 00:15:57,170
we need a script. We need
something written down. Because a,

300
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:01,240
one of the things that's been found
in surveys is that there's very little

301
00:16:01,241 --> 00:16:05,920
agreed upon language. For example, the
phrase like slow down when surveyed,

302
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:10,840
many college aged women will tell you
that means stop. Many men will say, no,

303
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:14,680
it just means goes slower.
Well, in the BDSM world,

304
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,750
they seem to have sorted some of this out.

305
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:20,320
So like I was at a play party
and it said on the thing, oh,

306
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:24,550
house rules say yellow means, uh, I,

307
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,700
you should check in or
pause. Red Means Stop.

308
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,820
And if somebody says safe
word, that means that, uh,

309
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,870
you're calling for help from
one of the people that's around.

310
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:39,660
It all seemed so clear and sensible.

311
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,790
And Dare I say uncomplicated, but
Julia was like, ah, yeah, no, no.

312
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,653
Really.

313
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:52,200
When we come back, Julie Rains on
the parade that we were throwing her.

Hey, I'm Jad, we're back.

326
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:51,660
Third installment of in the know
and Julie was about to tell us,

327
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,670
Julie [inaudible] that uh, even in the
BDSM world with its very clear, uh,

328
00:17:56,671 --> 00:18:00,930
rules and safe words like red
and yellow things go wrong.

329
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,920
The actual real problem with that yellow,

330
00:18:02,921 --> 00:18:06,880
red situation is that in public
people almost never end up using red.

331
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:11,260
Like there's one of the huge problems
that the BDSM subculture basically has is

332
00:18:11,261 --> 00:18:13,240
that there's massive,

333
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,880
massive social repercussions to calling
red in a public place basically.

334
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,990
And as we talked about this more a,

335
00:18:20,991 --> 00:18:25,991
it's started to sound a lot like what
we heard from the college aged women,

336
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,810
uh, that saying no even, you know,

337
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:33,620
when it's buttress by all of these rules
and norms can still be really hard.

338
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:34,783
There's a cost.

339
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:39,760
What are the worst situations that I
ever personally found myself in, um,

340
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,950
was I was tied up in suspended and uh,

341
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,780
so all my feet are off the ground
and I'm having a great time.

342
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:52,290
I had negotiated ahead of time that there
was to be nothing genital happening.

343
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,840
It was very clear about that. And
I was like, nope, this is not,

344
00:18:55,841 --> 00:18:56,674
this is not a thing.

345
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:00,900
Then she says the person
who she was playing with who
tied her up decided to try

346
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:01,734
some genital stuff.

347
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,740
And I was really caught in that moment
because we're in a very public place.

348
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,240
Uh, I could yell red,

349
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:13,500
but in that place yelling red
means the whole scene has to stop.

350
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,000
And I didn't want the scene to stop.

351
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:18,480
I liked being tied up and I'm also
cognizant of the fact that this guy is my

352
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:18,961
friend.

353
00:19:18,961 --> 00:19:23,961
I really like him and I don't want
him to get in a ton of trouble.

354
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,720
But if I yelled red really
loudly in this public place,

355
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,870
there's a pretty decent chance he's
going to get banned from the event.

356
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,710
There's pretty decent chance he's going
to get banned from a lot of events.

357
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,220
And even if I kicked him
in the face and he stopped

358
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,840
cause I was gonna say you're
tied up though. That's very,

359
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,920
the whole point is you're
in a compromised situation.

360
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:45,540
I am in a compromised situation,

361
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,000
but it turns out it puts my
feet a lot closer to his face

362
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,130
even though she a navigated that one
fine in the end she says generally

363
00:19:53,131 --> 00:19:57,660
speaking, the BDSM community is in
terms of the consent negotiation,

364
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,600
not a utopia. In fact,

365
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:05,130
what she experienced in that moment
was for a long time, not uncommon.

366
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,310
So I should explain that the [inaudible]
actually got its own Mitsu movement

367
00:20:08,311 --> 00:20:11,070
about three months before the me too
movement hit like I didn't have that

368
00:20:11,071 --> 00:20:14,850
Hashtag but exactly the
same thing happened where a
bunch of high status people

369
00:20:14,851 --> 00:20:18,640
got out at his consent violators in the
scene. These are a bunch of dudes are,

370
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,250
yeah, they're all men.

371
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,190
There's definitely a lot of consent
violations that happened with women,

372
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:25,920
but people don't pay attention to it.
And I have a whole other rant about that,

373
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,610
but people who got a lot of attention on
them were men and pretty much everyone

374
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:30,690
that they had hurt was women.

375
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:34,410
And that's part of the reason
that Julie is, uh, in the end,

376
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:39,411
a little suspicious of all of the
rules that we were just enamored of,

377
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,380
or I should say she's a little suspicious
of placing too much faith in those

378
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:44,220
rules. It's

379
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,640
not, it's not foolproof, rightly
so. I mean, I know people who

380
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,800
they don't want to tell you anymore
that they're not having fun.

381
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:58,360
So there's a real sense of like, I don't
want to disappoint this other person.

382
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:03,700
So one of the things that I also will
ask in these types of negotiating my

383
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:05,410
version of negotiation is like,

384
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:10,830
do you feel reasonably certain that you
will be able to tell me if you don't

385
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:12,010
like what's happening?

386
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,320
The more I thought about that question,

387
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,820
like after we'd done the
interview in morning,

388
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,150
I was sort of noodling on that
I the crew to me like what?

389
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:27,440
That's a key question. Can
you say no when you need to?

390
00:21:27,441 --> 00:21:30,500
Some of us just are people
pleasers. I am one of those people,

391
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:34,370
it hurts to say no if you know
it's good bumps someone out,

392
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,280
others have no problem
with that. So she asks,

393
00:21:37,281 --> 00:21:40,070
which kind of person are you
right now? It is situational.

394
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,410
Who are you at this moment?
If they say, yeah, right now,

395
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,150
I'm not good with the no, then she goes
one direction. If they say, no, no,

396
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,720
I could tell you

397
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,060
then I'm like, all right,
can we both agree that we are

398
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,210
adults,

399
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,420
that we don't have to get into all this
stuff about what we don't want to have

400
00:21:53,421 --> 00:21:53,760
happen

401
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,020
and that we will take responsibility
for actually communicating how we're

402
00:21:58,021 --> 00:22:01,290
feeling in a situation. And if
we fail to communicate that,

403
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:04,170
that we will also take
responsibility for that.

404
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,320
So are you okay with kind of whatever and
you're going to tell me if you're not,

405
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:13,890
and the other person goes, yes. That's
how I want that to go. At that point,

406
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,280
our conversation changes from what am
I not allowed to do to what do you find

407
00:22:17,281 --> 00:22:18,114
hot?

408
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:23,770
One of the things that we kept
running into again and again was, um,

409
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,260
this sentiment that, uh, was maybe
best captured by a guy that Becca,

410
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,213
and she misspoke too.

411
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,250
I'm Michael [inaudible].

412
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:34,300
I'm the director of empowering victims
and I'm one of the people who came up

413
00:22:34,301 --> 00:22:36,040
with the concept for the we consent app.

414
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:40,100
That app was actually the one,
uh, that a guy last episode, uh,

415
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:44,850
sort of jokingly referred
to. Hello. Would you be like,

416
00:22:44,851 --> 00:22:48,450
can I record you on my cell phone of
you saying you're down to make out right

417
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:51,360
now? Turns out it's actually
a real app that this guy made.

418
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,391
There's no really good,

419
00:22:52,391 --> 00:22:55,600
the problem is that we've got to meme in
the meeting is already well established

420
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:56,710
and the meme is consent.

421
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:01,830
Unfortunately that mean frames
the entire question the wrong way.

422
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:07,000
Consent means that you're giving someone
permission to do something to you.

423
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,810
We don't do sex to someone else.

424
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,570
We have sex with someone else.

425
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,720
Are you saying that that's the like
dictionary definition of consent?

426
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,780
It's interesting cause I'm curious
if this is just like a semantic

427
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:27,420
for this of consent is giving someone
permission to do something to you or on

428
00:23:27,871 --> 00:23:28,704
your behalf.

429
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,960
Yeah, I just looked it up. And you're so

430
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,420
compliance and or approval of what
is done or proposed by another

431
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,900
wrong word.

432
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,230
And, uh, Joe for Shell, the academic
that we heard from earlier. Yeah. If

433
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:45,110
it doesn't capture what I think
is probably the biggest problem,

434
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,990
young people and for sex on college
campuses, which is all of the sex,

435
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,520
it's consensual but unhappy and
unpleasant and unwanted and people,

436
00:23:52,521 --> 00:23:57,521
typically women endure the core issue
may not be non-consent and it may not be

437
00:23:57,681 --> 00:23:58,514
sex discrimination.

438
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:02,900
It might be the fact that
men are leveraging their
positions of power to extract

439
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:05,720
sex from women that don't
want to be there. And I,

440
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,650
and I think it's hard to target that
problem if you call it non-consent.

441
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,280
[inaudible]

442
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,950
it was the second day I went home with
him and I wasn't really sure if I wanted

443
00:24:26,951 --> 00:24:29,840
to sleep with him and I was kind
of going through the motions. Um,

444
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,580
and at one point he pulled away cause
you could tell that I was like not

445
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:36,420
entirely there. And he's like, do
you want to have sex? Um, and I,

446
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,410
I kind of said like, ah,

447
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,830
like I didn't even say yes or no and he
just stopped entirely. And we just like,

448
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,560
and that was it. And
I remember being like,

449
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:48,410
like relieved first and
like really surprised, um,

450
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,820
because he read my body like the second
date, like read my body language,

451
00:24:51,821 --> 00:24:53,980
respected me and like didn't push.

452
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,400
I was at a bar a couple
of weeks ago and, um,

453
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:00,820
I was with this girl and you know,
she was, we were both, you know,

454
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,130
we're both pretty drunk and
she was like, yeah, hey,

455
00:25:03,131 --> 00:25:06,910
you want to go out to my place?
And I was like, I can't do that.

456
00:25:06,911 --> 00:25:11,260
Like I'm drunk. You're drunk.
Like, she's like, you're right.

457
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,960
And just kind of like we've
out, we continue to like
dance. I was fine. It was,

458
00:25:13,961 --> 00:25:16,780
we had a fine night and then like I
woke up the next morning and she, uh,

459
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:18,370
texted me and was like, Hey,

460
00:25:18,371 --> 00:25:23,371
thank you so much for like
not taking advantage of me.

461
00:25:23,441 --> 00:25:27,100
Like that means a lot. I was
like, that was really easy.

462
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,900
I've been lucky in that regard that like
if I'm uncomfortable having sex with

463
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,790
like my partner, like, like right
when I'm about to be like, I can't,

464
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:39,770
like I don't want to do this right now.
He always catches like my eye is like,

465
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:43,100
like he'll stop immediately
in, in like, you know,

466
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:46,250
I've had like my own sex trauma
stuff and he like, I'm going to cry,

467
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,320
but like he will stop.

468
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,310
It's so nice to have a partner that
can like read your body language and be

469
00:25:52,311 --> 00:25:56,180
like, this doesn't feel like
feel right. Are you okay?

470
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:10,980
