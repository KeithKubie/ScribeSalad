00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320
well basically I was trying to find out
 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.540

focus is google to get this into black

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200
focus is google to get this into black

production phase or where we can

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230
production phase or where we can
 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.040
production phase or where we can
actually use it in production yeah I

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050
actually use it in production yeah I
 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.410
actually use it in production yeah I
think it's classified as experimental at

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420
think it's classified as experimental at
 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.180
think it's classified as experimental at
the moment I think that's how they refer

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190
the moment I think that's how they refer
 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.210
the moment I think that's how they refer
to it in most of their posts so I don't

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220
to it in most of their posts so I don't
 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.950
to it in most of their posts so I don't
know is the answer like oh you probably

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960
know is the answer like oh you probably
 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.330
know is the answer like oh you probably
focus a lot closer than I actually have

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340
focus a lot closer than I actually have
 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.390
focus a lot closer than I actually have
is it is the aim to kind of like trying

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400
is it is the aim to kind of like trying
 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.400
is it is the aim to kind of like trying
to get it to production quality or is it

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410
to get it to production quality or is it
 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.660
to get it to production quality or is it
more of an experiment to find out what

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670
more of an experiment to find out what
 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.410
more of an experiment to find out what
we need or AIDS it's currently on the

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420
we need or AIDS it's currently on the
 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.240
we need or AIDS it's currently on the
experimental side but the idea is to

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250
experimental side but the idea is to
 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.220
experimental side but the idea is to
replacing current build system with

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230
replacing current build system with
 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.960
replacing current build system with
something that Jake wardens happy with

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970
something that Jake wardens happy with
 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.230
something that Jake wardens happy with
or rather something that has four more

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240
or rather something that has four more
 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.640
or rather something that has four more
features and can deal with more

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650
features and can deal with more
 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.320
features and can deal with more
situations so eventually it will become

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330
situations so eventually it will become
 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.700
situations so eventually it will become
a replacement for the current build

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710
a replacement for the current build
 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.290
a replacement for the current build
system and there'll be an overlap time

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300
system and there'll be an overlap time
 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.620
system and there'll be an overlap time
but it's very early days yet so best

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630
but it's very early days yet so best
 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.560
but it's very early days yet so best
thing is to jump on to ADT dev the

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570
thing is to jump on to ADT dev the
 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.780
thing is to jump on to ADT dev the

the exit one doesn't because never it
 

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:46.099
the exit one doesn't because never it
doesn't show the animation then doesn't

00:41:46.099 --> 00:41:46.109
doesn't show the animation then doesn't
 

00:41:46.109 --> 00:41:47.390

take the fragment out from the back

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.400
take the fragment out from the back
 

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:52.370
take the fragment out from the back
stack don't know i'm i'm guessing that

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:52.380
stack don't know i'm i'm guessing that
 

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:56.300
stack don't know i'm i'm guessing that
if the if the exit animation is not

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:56.310
if the if the exit animation is not
 

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:57.589
if the if the exit animation is not
being shown maybe it's just that the

00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599
being shown maybe it's just that the
 

00:41:57.599 --> 00:41:59.000
being shown maybe it's just that the
fragment doesn't being remove

00:41:59.000 --> 00:41:59.010
fragment doesn't being remove
 

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:00.590

across with those is when you are adding

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:23.910
across with those is when you are adding
 

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:26.930
across with those is when you are adding
it see when you add the fragment and

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:26.940
it see when you add the fragment and
 

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:29.030

used to specify your own custom
 

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.310
used to specify your own custom
animations it just accepts an idea

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:31.320
animations it just accepts an idea
 

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.230
animations it just accepts an idea
doesn't it which is the animation type

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:33.240
doesn't it which is the animation type
 

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.820

I've had people have problems when

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:34.830
I've had people have problems when
 

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:36.050
I've had people have problems when
they're specifying the old type

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:36.060
they're specifying the old type
 

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:38.570
they're specifying the old type
animations not the new type animation so

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:38.580
animations not the new type animation so
 

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:39.920
animations not the new type animation so
rather than the Android that view the

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:39.930
rather than the Android that view the
 

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:43.010
rather than the Android that view the
animation type animation the unity is

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:43.020
animation type animation the unity is
 

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:45.260
animation type animation the unity is
and Android the animation type animation

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:45.270
and Android the animation type animation
 

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:47.000
and Android the animation type animation
so I've come across issues over that way

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:47.010
so I've come across issues over that way
 

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:48.080
so I've come across issues over that way
if you supply the wrong type of

if you supply the wrong type of

if you supply the wrong type of

animation because it's just an in right
it's not type-safe it's just an end

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:50.850
it's not type-safe it's just an end
 

00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:52.610
it's not type-safe it's just an end

00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:52.620
pointing towards of res ID if you're
 

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:54.650
pointing towards of res ID if you're

supplying the wrong kind of animation
 

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:57.170
supplying the wrong kind of animation
resource then it obviously went play and

00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:57.180
resource then it obviously went play and
 

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:59.030
resource then it obviously went play and
that yeah I've had issues of that but

00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040
that yeah I've had issues of that but
 

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.920
that yeah I've had issues of that but
beyond that and without having good a

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:00.930
beyond that and without having good a
 

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:03.110
beyond that and without having good a
coach on the bit stumped right so you

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:03.120
coach on the bit stumped right so you
 

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:06.470
coach on the bit stumped right so you
don't ok so you nothing really jumps out

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480
don't ok so you nothing really jumps out
 

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:09.860
don't ok so you nothing really jumps out
at you with regards to how to get the

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:09.870
at you with regards to how to get the
 

00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:11.540
at you with regards to how to get the
animation and the back stock removal

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:11.550
animation and the back stock removal
 

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:13.010
animation and the back stock removal
specifically when you're when you're

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:13.020
specifically when you're when you're
 

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:15.230
specifically when you're when you're
getting rid of the fragment no you

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:15.240
getting rid of the fragment no you
 

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.520
getting rid of the fragment no you
should just happen right like if you

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:16.530
should just happen right like if you
 

00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:18.710
should just happen right like if you
just do add to back stack no and then

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720
just do add to back stack no and then
 

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.240
just do add to back stack no and then
when you hit back whatever it should

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:20.250
when you hit back whatever it should
 

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:21.650
when you hit back whatever it should
remove it probably from the back stack

00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:21.660
remove it probably from the back stack
 

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:24.620
remove it probably from the back stack
and also and play the animation but yeah

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:24.630
and also and play the animation but yeah
 

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:26.360
and also and play the animation but yeah
it sounds so that's not happening so

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:26.370
it sounds so that's not happening so
 

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:27.740
it sounds so that's not happening so
without seeing the code it's kind of

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:27.750
without seeing the code it's kind of
 

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:30.950
without seeing the code it's kind of
hard to debug ok so maybe a good piece

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960
hard to debug ok so maybe a good piece
 

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.810
hard to debug ok so maybe a good piece

yeah again using I've been through the
 

00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:44.690
yeah again using I've been through the
subscription documentation I can't find

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:44.700
subscription documentation I can't find
 

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.300
subscription documentation I can't find
anything in the documentation which

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:47.310
anything in the documentation which
 

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:49.220
anything in the documentation which
suggests you need a merchant ID to use

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:49.230
suggests you need a merchant ID to use
 

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:52.580
suggests you need a merchant ID to use
the subscriptions server interface so

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:52.590
the subscriptions server interface so
 

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:54.110
the subscriptions server interface so
you get all the IDS you need from the

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:54.120
you get all the IDS you need from the
 

00:43:54.120 --> 00:44:00.590

that here at some point it will give us
a verification um no problem i'll give

00:45:21.809 --> 00:45:21.819
a verification um no problem i'll give
 

00:45:21.819 --> 00:45:23.370
a verification um no problem i'll give
you your registered zombie fest if you

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:23.380

can use that but the problem is to move
 

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:35.089
can use that but the problem is to move
the application from the older older

00:45:35.089 --> 00:45:35.099
the application from the older older
 

00:45:35.099 --> 00:45:38.730

00:45:44.349 --> 00:45:48.240
change the account and leaving the name
and the comm Datuk voice prada like the

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:48.250
and the comm Datuk voice prada like the
 

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:49.529

same yes yeah you can leave an

00:45:49.529 --> 00:45:49.539
same yes yeah you can leave an
 

00:45:49.539 --> 00:45:51.000
same yes yeah you can leave an
application between developer can so

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:51.010
application between developer can so
 

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:51.960
application between developer can so
it's not a problem the only

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:51.970
it's not a problem the only
 

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:54.240
it's not a problem the only
complications there are they oh you'll

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:54.250
complications there are they oh you'll
 

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:56.130
complications there are they oh you'll
obviously have a new public key could

00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:56.140
obviously have a new public key could
 

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:58.289
obviously have a new public key could
it'll be a different developer account

00:45:58.289 --> 00:45:58.299
it'll be a different developer account
 

00:45:58.299 --> 00:45:59.700
it'll be a different developer account
so anything which is using the public

00:45:59.700 --> 00:45:59.710
so anything which is using the public
 

00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:01.829
so anything which is using the public
key will have to have the code updated

00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839
key will have to have the code updated
 

00:46:01.839 --> 00:46:07.140
key will have to have the code updated
so it purchases oh yes yes yes all the

00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:07.150
so it purchases oh yes yes yes all the
 

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:09.750
so it purchases oh yes yes yes all the
things that use a public key i have to

00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.760

that's a pretty broad question i would

00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:08.430
that's a pretty broad question i would
 

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:10.460
that's a pretty broad question i would
say it depends on exactly what animation

00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:10.470
say it depends on exactly what animation
 

00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:13.519

basically look at your essentially your

00:51:22.339 --> 00:51:22.349
basically look at your essentially your
 

00:51:22.349 --> 00:51:24.259
basically look at your essentially your
animation package that you're working in

00:51:24.259 --> 00:51:24.269

you have just heard that exactly so yeah

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680
you have just heard that exactly so yeah
 

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.920
you have just heard that exactly so yeah
I think you just need to just google for

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:39.930

think the WebGL probably wouldn't but

00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:55.230
think the WebGL probably wouldn't but
 

00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:59.410
think the WebGL probably wouldn't but
