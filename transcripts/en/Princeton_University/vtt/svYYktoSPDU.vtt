00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.900
MOLLY GREENE: Even in a
group of remarkable students,

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.185
he's very remarkable.

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:11.810
HENRY SHAPIRO: My
name's Henry Shapiro,

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.880
I'm a sixth-year graduate
student in the history

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.000
department, and I'm an
Ottoman historian finishing

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.970
a dissertation on the
Ottoman-Armenian history

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.350
in the 17th century.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.160
So the title of my dissertation
is "The Great Armenian Flight,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.430
The Celali Revolts, and The Rise
of Western Armenian Society."

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.260
MOLLY GREENE: It's a
feat of imagination,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.490
and creativity, and insight.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.660
People might think that
historians simply put together

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.920
facts, but what Henry realized
for his dissertation was

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.590
that these events, the Celali
revolts, that we thought

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.260
were about one
thing, are actually

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.130
about many other things.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.840
And there's another story
of the Celali revolt

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.420
that people hadn't understood
was there because they saw it

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.211
in a certain way.

00:00:58.211 --> 00:00:59.960
HENRY SHAPIRO: I come
from the Bible Belt,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.760
and I'm an Appalachian.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.650
I grew up on the
Virginia-Kentucky border.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.640
And when I was in
high school I was

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.440
interested in early
Christian history,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.660
and I suppose that
that was what motivated

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.330
me to study Greek literature
as an undergraduate.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.160
And I read the classics
as an undergraduate

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.040
and was very interested in
Homer, and Hesiod, and the New

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.390
Testament, and diverse genres
of ancient Greek literature.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.820
And I suppose that
that's slowly what

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.490
led me to an interest
in Ottoman history,

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.940
as I move forward in the
study of Greek history

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.410
and of Christian history.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.826
MOLLY GREENE: I
mean, Henry walked

00:01:31.826 --> 00:01:34.040
all over Eastern Anatolia.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.140
He used the 17th-century
chronicle as we might use a,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.440
you know, Fodor's
Guide to Turkey,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.310
and walked all around and up
into the mountains hiking,

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.890
sometimes for six
hours, to uncover

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.450
the physical remains of this
world that he writes about.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.219
It's extraordinary
what he's done.

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:52.760
In addition to
sitting in Yerevan

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.926
and reading every manuscript
for two years, and then

00:01:54.926 --> 00:01:56.300
he put it all together.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.590
HENRY SHAPIRO: These
six years of Princeton

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.423
have been some of the
best years of my life,

00:01:59.423 --> 00:02:02.210
and I'm just extremely
grateful to my professors.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.210
When I've needed guidance,
there's been guidance.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.610
When I've needed freedom,
there's been freedom.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.039
When I've needed help
getting access to an archive

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.560
or traveling to Eastern Anatolia
or to Armenia, they've helped.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.210
Princeton is very supportive
to its graduate students,

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.550
and I'll really genuinely
be grateful my whole life

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.640
for these six years.
