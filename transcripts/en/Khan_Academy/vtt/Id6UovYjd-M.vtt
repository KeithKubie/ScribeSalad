00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.190
The function f of
x is defined as f

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.690
of x is equal to
49 minus x squared.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.179
Find the value of f of 5.

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.970
So whenever you're
dealing with a function,

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:11.870
you take your input.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.620
In this case, our input
is going to be our 5.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.340
We input it into our
little function box,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.360
and we need to get our output.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.670
And they defined the
function box here

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.900
as whatever your input is,
take that, square it, and then

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.230
subtract it from 49.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.470
So f of 5, every time I
see an x here, since f of x

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.720
is equal to this,
every time I see an x,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.320
I would replace
it with the input.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.880
So f of 5 is going
to be equal to 49

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.030
minus-- instead of
writing x squared,

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.210
I would write 5 squared.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.800
So this is equal to 49 minus 25.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.740
And 49 minus 25 is equal to 24.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.090
And we are done.
