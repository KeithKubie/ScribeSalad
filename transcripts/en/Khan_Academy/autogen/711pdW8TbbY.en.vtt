00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.710
 In this presentation, we will start to have some experience 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.400
 In solving the root equations or equations containing 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.610
 Square root or higher roots 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.680
 Also we will try to understand 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.170
 An important phenomenon that will crystallize during the solution of equations 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.840
 Let me clarify what I'm talking about 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.790
 Suppose I have the following equation: square root of x = 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.900
 2 (x-6) 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.710
 Now, one of the things you will see when you solve 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.890
 Such radical equations are that we will have to isolate at least one 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:33.570
 From the roots 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.610
 In this equation we have one root 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.810
 When we isolate one of the roots in one end of the 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.700
 The equation, it looks like this, I have here 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.520
 The square root of the x is isolated at the left end, then we do 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.480
 Quadrature the two ends of the equation 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.750
 Let's if we cross the two sides of the equation 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.930
 I will write it again 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.270
 I will solve them leisurely 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.480
 I will quadruple this and will equal (2x 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.840
 - 6) ^ 2 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.930
 The squaring process is good 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.239
 If this is equal to this, then this phrase is equal 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.400
 That box 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.560
 So continue 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.550
 When we take the square root of x we ​​square it 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.210
 The output will be x 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.280
 We get x = - the square of this statement = 2x) ^ 2) 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.340
 Ie 4x ^ 2 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.560
 This phrase is originally 2x 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.030
 4x ^ 2, and multiply these two values, so the output 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.890
 -12x 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.920
 When we quadrature it becomes -24x 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.150
 Then-^ 2 = 36 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.240
 If you find that moving from these to these is difficult, maybe 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.750
 You have to check out Multiprogram statements, or 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.020
 Multiply equations, or special cases 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.070
 In which we multiply the binomial equations 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.580
 But in general, this phrase square, are the same ones 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.740
 Then we have -2x these two products 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.380
 The output of these two amounts is -12x 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.800
 If 2 × 24x and all this amount square 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.340
 If this is the equation 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.930
 As simple as possible, and see what happens if we targe x 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.710
 From both ends of the equation 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.850
 If we subtract x from both ends of the equation 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.710
 The left side will be 0 and the right side 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:21.990
 It will be 4x ^ 2 - 25x + 36 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.800
 If the root equation has been simplified to become just 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.670
 Normal quadratic equation 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.080
 We will not analyze it to its causes 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.620
 Or we are gathering and not all that, let 's just deal with 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.230
 Quadratic formula 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.475
 The quadratic formula states that these solutions are 

00:02:37.475 --> 00:02:39.900
 x can equal -b 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.990
 -25 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.540
 The minus-25 equals a positive 25 + or - 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.960
 Square root of 25 ^ 2 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:59.200
 25 ^ 2 = 625, -4 × a = 4 × c 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:07.150
 = 26, and all this divided by 2 x 4, which is divided by 8 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.870
 Let us use the calculator until we find 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.435
 The output of this 

00:03:10.435 --> 00:03:14.940
 I'll pull out the calculator 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.490
 We say that 625 - - to see, these 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.470
 Become 16 × 36 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.280
 16 x 36 = 49 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.880
 this is good 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.920
 It's a full box 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.830
 We know that the square root of 49 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:32.826
 Is 7 

00:03:32.826 --> 00:03:34.780
 So let me get back to the issue 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.060
 If this simplifies to 49 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.910
 If x = 25 + or - the square root of 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.000
 It is 7, all divided by 8 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.960
 These are the two solutions. If we add 7, we get x = 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.870
 25 + 7 = 32, 32/8 = 4 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.940
 The other solution, let me do it 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.590
 In a different color 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.340
 x = 25 - 7, and is equal to 18/8 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.680
 18 8 8 = 2, and the rest 2, if the output of this is 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:20.540
 2 2/8 or 2 1/4 or 2.25 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.850
 Now I will show you 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.220
 Interesting phenomenon 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.480
 And perhaps will stop when I explain to whom 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.080
 Puzzle, I will tell you the reason 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.090
 The appearance of this puzzle 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.030
 Let's examine the success of solutions 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.560
 Let's try if x = 4 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.680
 If x = 4 succeeds we get the square root of 4 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.560
 And is equal to 2, 4 × 6 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.790
 The square root for 4 is 2 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.700
 Positive 2 = 2 × 4, equal to 8, - 6 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.420
 Equal 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.670
 That's true 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.290
 If successful 4 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.420
 Now, let's try 2.25 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.380
 According to this, we take the square root 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.593
 L 2.2 - I will 

00:05:05.593 --> 00:05:06.470
 Maximize the root signal slightly 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.840
 The square root of 2.25 equals 2 × 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.620
 2.25-6 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.420
 Now, maybe you can do this mentally 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.520
 You may know that the square root of 225 is 15 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.180
 Hence, you can be able to find 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.180
 The square root of 2.25 is 1.5 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.970
 Let me use the calculator to prove this to you 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.410
 We take the square root for 2.25 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.600
 It's 1.5 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.170
 The square root is 1.5 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.770
 The other square root is -1.5 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.020
 If 1.5 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.160
 . 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.980
 Hence, accordingly, this will be equal to 2 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.990
 Ø 2.25 = 4.5, - 6 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.970
 Now, is that true? 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.350
 This tells us that 1.5 = -1.5 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.200
 this is not true 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.790
 2.5 did not succeed to solve this root equation 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.580
 This is what we call the extraordinary solution 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:13.730
 If 2.25 is considered an exceptional solution 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.070
 Now, the puzzle is: Why did we get the answer 2.25? 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.310
 We seem to have done the right things 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.830
 We got a quadratic equation in addition to 2.25 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.260
 We have a tip here 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.010
 When we make up 2.25 we get 1.5 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.550
 = -1.5 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.120
 If there is something here, something we did and gave us this 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.430
 The solution does not succeed when you use it 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.720
 I will give you another hint 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.090
 Let's try it at this point 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.320
 If we look carefully at this step, we will see that both 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.300
 Both solutions are already valid 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.990
 You can try it if you want 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.740
 In fact, try it on your own 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.865
 Replace 2.25 instead of x here 

00:06:49.865 --> 00:06:51.520
 And you'll see that will work 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.060
 And replace with 4 instead of x and you will see that both are fit 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.360
 If both are considered valid solutions to this equation 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.400
 Both are good solutions to this equation 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.330
 If something happens while we are squaring the equation, make it 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.070
 slightly different 

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.000
 There is something in this equation a little different 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.550
 For that equation 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.710
 The answer is that we have two ways to think about them 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.430
 To return from this equation to that, and take 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:21.440
 Sqrt 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.260
 But to be more precise, I am taking 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.020
 Square root for both parties 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.410
 Now, the negative square root can also be taken 

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.710
 Note, this is just the extraction of the square root 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.430
 Let's move from here - let me be clearer 

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.930
 This phrase, I have already proved that both 

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.610
 Equations, and both the right and extraordinary solution 

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.350
 To this root equation 

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.060
 Saleh for the equation 

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.970
 Only the good solution achieves the equation 

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.390
 So let me write the equation and both of them will achieve the equation 

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.550
 Because it is already an interesting puzzle 

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.370
 I think this will give you a little difference 

00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.860
 It will tell you what will happen when we take 

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.320
 The root of these values 

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.230
 And why when we cross both sides 

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:06.660
 We can think of it, to a certain extent, as a loss or a compilation 

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.960
 Some information 

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.720
 Now, these can be written as follows: x = 

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.450
 (2x-6) ^ 2 

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:19.090
 This is one of the valid solutions for this 

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.470
 The equation 

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:24.290
 But here we have a logical explanation 

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.220
 For this equation 

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.300
 It can be x = -1 

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.400
 × (2x - 6) ^ 2 

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.870
 Why are these interpretations considered equal? 

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.010
 Because when we square -1, it will disappear 

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.610
 1 

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.420
 They are equal terms 

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.500
 To write this in another way, 

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.630
 Is x = - 

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.450
 We hit -1 × that 

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:58.080
 We get -2x + 6 or (6-2x) ^ 2 

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:04.560
 These are two ways to write the equation 

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.760
 Now, when you look at the square root or when - think 

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.700
 There are two ways to think about it 

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.170
 When we squirt it, assume that this is 

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.800
 The only explanation, but we got another explanation 

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:21.460
 If we find two answers to these, but the 4 achieved 

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.060
 The equation 

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.800
 I hope you have absorbed what I say because all I do 

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.710
 Is that I take - you can imagine the square root positive 

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.300
 It will not be taken as negative square root 

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.080
 Because when we take the square root of both sides even 

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.010
 We get here, we've just taken root 

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.880
 To put it another way - let me rewrite 

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.130
 The original equation 

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.560
 Let me rewrite the original equation 

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:48.630
 We have a square root of x = 2x - 6 

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.620
 We found 4 to be a solution to the equation 

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.790
 And 2.25 is not a solution 

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:56.690
 2.25 is not considered a solution if we say that both 

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.800
 The square roots of x = 2x - 6 

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.220
 Try it now and it will be for 2.25 

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.330
 correct answer 

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:10.050
 If we take the negative square root for 2.25, it is 

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:15.590
 2 x 2.25, and equal to 4.5 - 6 

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.230
 Ie -1.5 

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:18.430
 That's true 

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.200
 The positive image is x = 4 

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.250
 That's why we got two answers 

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.900
 And if we want to squat this - maybe this method is even simpler 

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:26.300
 Remember this 

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:31.780
 If you quadruple this, you will get this equation 

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.150
 So both solutions are valid 

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:35.900
 Now, maybe you have found this 

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.070
 A little annoying 

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.990
 But it is not my intention to bother you 

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.490
 The simplest thing you can think of when you are solving 

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:45.060
 Radical equations is, to isolate the roots, and to lay down the phrases, then 

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:45.740
 Please find the solution 

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.460
 You will probably get more than one answer 

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.180
 It must fill the deficit of answers 

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.170
 The answers that did not work are called extraordinary solutions 

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:54.260
 But most of the explanation in this lesson was about why 

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.290
 The advent of these extraordinary solutions 

00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:00.900
 I hope that I gave you the intuition that the equation 

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.610
 Equals the square root of x 

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:05.140
 The exceptional solution would be valid if we took + 

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:09.010
 Or - square root of x, not the root only
