00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.303
 We talked a lot about the cells as a whole, 

00:00:02.303 --> 00:00:03.766
 but in this video 

00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:06.947
 we will focus on plant cells, 

00:00:06.947 --> 00:00:11.521
 the focus is on plant cells. 

00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:13.113
 This is it 

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:15.192
 drawing of a plant cell. 

00:00:15.192 --> 00:00:16.818
 The first thing that can make you impression is, 

00:00:16.818 --> 00:00:18.176
 that instead 

00:00:18.176 --> 00:00:21.113
 rounded shape, 

00:00:21.113 --> 00:00:22.576
 like that of many other cells I've painted, 

00:00:22.576 --> 00:00:24.758
 this has a form 

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:26.732
 cube or prism. 

00:00:26.732 --> 00:00:28.364
 This is because we have a plant cell and 

00:00:28.364 --> 00:00:30.686
 it may have such a structure. 

00:00:30.686 --> 00:00:31.731
 The next question is - 

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:33.531
 what gives this form of plant cells. 

00:00:33.531 --> 00:00:35.853
 What allows them to have 

00:00:35.853 --> 00:00:38.047
 this form of cube or prism? 

00:00:38.047 --> 00:00:41.587
 The answer is the cell wall. 

00:00:41.587 --> 00:00:45.035
 This is the cell wall. 

00:00:45.035 --> 00:00:46.428
 Let us orient ourselves correctly 

00:00:46.428 --> 00:00:48.472
 in this drawing. 

00:00:48.472 --> 00:00:51.385
 Of course, if that part had not been cut off, 

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:52.953
 we would only see the outer part of the cage. 

00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:54.810
 We would only see the cell wall. 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.331
 But we cut that piece down and we can see 

00:00:56.331 --> 00:00:57.190
 different layers of the interior of the cell. 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.908
 We have the cell wall outside. 

00:00:58.908 --> 00:01:01.729
 Just below it we have 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.807
 cell membrane 

00:01:03.807 --> 00:01:05.514
 or plasma membrane. 

00:01:05.514 --> 00:01:10.424
 This is the cell membrane. 

00:01:10.424 --> 00:01:14.292
 The cell membrane is below the cell wall. 

00:01:14.292 --> 00:01:15.870
 Under the cell membrane 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.656
 is the cytoplasm. 

00:01:18.656 --> 00:01:20.058
 And in the cytoplasm 

00:01:20.058 --> 00:01:21.240
 there are many different things. 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.540
 That's the big thing he's taking 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.550
 a very large volume of the interior of the plant cell 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.186
 is the vacuum for which we have spoken 

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:30.400
 in other videos. 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.166
 Vacuola. 

00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:32.687
 The combinations of 

00:01:32.687 --> 00:01:34.567
 internal pressure, organelles such as vacuole 

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:35.833
 and the pressure 

00:01:35.833 --> 00:01:37.934
 of all the fluids in the cage 

00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:40.476
 exerts pressure on the outside, and the cell wall 

00:01:40.476 --> 00:01:41.811
 keeps everything inside the cage. 

00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:43.854
 This gives the structure of the plants. 

00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:46.408
 Therefore, the plants can grow 

00:01:46.408 --> 00:01:48.133
 and face it. 

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:49.763
 Plants can grow upright. 

00:01:49.763 --> 00:01:52.154
 I paint a plant. 

00:01:52.154 --> 00:01:53.279
 Actually I have a plant in my room, 

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:54.662
 what I am looking at right now, 

00:01:54.662 --> 00:01:56.878
 it can grow upright. 

00:01:56.878 --> 00:01:59.177
 So, we have a cell wall, 

00:01:59.177 --> 00:02:00.361
 cell membrane, 

00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:02.160
 as well as other organelles. 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.472
 Here we have chloroplasts, 

00:02:03.472 --> 00:02:06.340
 they are very important for photosynthesis. These are our good friends 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.037
 mitochondria. 

00:02:07.037 --> 00:02:08.663
 We have a nuclear shell 

00:02:08.663 --> 00:02:09.614
 or more precisely, the yellow thing 

00:02:09.614 --> 00:02:11.076
 is the internal nuclear membrane. 

00:02:11.076 --> 00:02:12.272
 This shell is DNA. 

00:02:12.272 --> 00:02:14.409
 We have an endoplasmic network. 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:15.604
 - 

00:02:15.604 --> 00:02:18.125
 The grainy endoplasmic grid 

00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:19.795
 there are ribosomes on the membrane. 

00:02:19.795 --> 00:02:22.379
 The smooth endoplasmic grid has no ribosomes. 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.517
 The Goldie Apparatus. It was small 

00:02:23.517 --> 00:02:24.260
 negotiation. 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.744
 We will now concentrate on the cell wall. 

00:02:26.744 --> 00:02:28.021
 Let's get back to her. 

00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:30.645
 If we want to look at the cell wall closely, 

00:02:30.645 --> 00:02:32.003
 we can look at it 

00:02:32.003 --> 00:02:35.412
 this diagram. 

00:02:35.412 --> 00:02:37.165
 Here, it may surprise you 

00:02:37.165 --> 00:02:38.129
 less. 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.893
 Before, when I thought about 

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:43.190
 the cell wall I imagined 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.850
 something like a brick wall. 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.545
 Something impenetrable. 

00:02:46.545 --> 00:02:47.903
 But this painting gives us 

00:02:47.903 --> 00:02:48.534
 different idea. 

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:51.273
 To make it clearer, 

00:02:51.273 --> 00:02:54.524
 this is our cell membrane 

00:02:54.524 --> 00:02:55.662
 - 

00:02:55.662 --> 00:02:57.542
 therefore here we have 

00:02:57.542 --> 00:02:59.167
 double lipid layer. 

00:02:59.167 --> 00:03:00.920
 It is located on it 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.464
 the cell wall. 

00:03:02.464 --> 00:03:04.020
 As you can see, she is not fat 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.564
 like a brick wall, like something 

00:03:05.564 --> 00:03:06.342
 impenetrable. 

00:03:06.342 --> 00:03:08.722
 You see that it consists of all these polysaccharides 

00:03:08.722 --> 00:03:10.823
 fibers that pass through it. 

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:12.483
 We have things like pulp, 

00:03:12.483 --> 00:03:15.687
 which, as we have seen, is a polymer of glucose, 

00:03:15.687 --> 00:03:16.767
 arranged in a specific way. 

00:03:16.767 --> 00:03:19.460
 Hemi-cellulose, which has different species 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.747
 monomers. 

00:03:21.747 --> 00:03:22.943
 We have pectin, which is another 

00:03:22.943 --> 00:03:23.779
 polysaccharide. 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:25.508
 You probably ate 

00:03:25.508 --> 00:03:27.726
 all these things, if not today, at least 

00:03:27.726 --> 00:03:28.979
 last week. When we talk about a diet rich in 

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:32.125
 fiber, talk about things 

00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:33.785
 such as cellulose and pectin. 

00:03:33.785 --> 00:03:35.167
 Things your digestive system can not bend. 

00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:36.665
 When you eat a plant, you get fiber, 

00:03:36.665 --> 00:03:38.487
 because you eat the cell walls of the plant. 

00:03:38.487 --> 00:03:40.797
 They do good things like 

00:03:40.797 --> 00:03:42.283
 delayed glucose absorption 

00:03:42.283 --> 00:03:43.026
 in the gut. 

00:03:43.026 --> 00:03:44.965
 Water is absorbed, so we can say that 

00:03:44.965 --> 00:03:47.844
 things go through the digestive system a little faster. 

00:03:47.844 --> 00:03:50.479
 But the basic thing is that this is not the case here 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:51.060
 wall. 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.604
 She says - 

00:03:52.604 --> 00:03:53.161
 It's actually a wall. 

00:03:53.161 --> 00:03:53.881
 Officially, a cell wall, 

00:03:53.881 --> 00:03:56.481
 but it is not a thick impermeable wall, 

00:03:56.481 --> 00:03:57.236
 properties that you can associate 

00:03:57.236 --> 00:03:59.279
 with the walls of the room you are in. 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:00.684
 You see there are bumps through which you can 

00:04:00.684 --> 00:04:02.657
 pass small molecules. 

00:04:02.657 --> 00:04:04.445
 More like a network or 

00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:05.559
 on fabric. 

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:07.254
 In fact, the cell membrane 

00:04:07.254 --> 00:04:10.876
 has access to the liquid 

00:04:10.876 --> 00:04:12.757
 and to the molecules that are present 

00:04:12.757 --> 00:04:14.417
 between cells. 

00:04:14.417 --> 00:04:15.601
 To make it clear 

00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:16.182
 we see: 

00:04:16.182 --> 00:04:18.120
 this layer here is the cell membrane, 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.618
 this is the double lipid layer. 

00:04:19.618 --> 00:04:22.218
 This is it 

00:04:22.218 --> 00:04:24.459
 the cell wall. 

00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:25.573
 I need another color. 

00:04:25.573 --> 00:04:29.114
 This is the cell wall. 

00:04:29.114 --> 00:04:30.554
 And just above the cell wall 

00:04:30.554 --> 00:04:32.353
 is the space between the cells, 

00:04:32.353 --> 00:04:35.297
 which is called the middle lamella. 

00:04:35.297 --> 00:04:36.814
 The space between the cells 

00:04:36.814 --> 00:04:39.960
 we call the middle lamella. 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.456
 It's here too 

00:04:42.456 --> 00:04:45.753
 middle lamella. 

00:04:45.753 --> 00:04:47.576
 All this is interesting, but you can ask yourself, 

00:04:47.576 --> 00:04:49.073
 "How solid is the cage?" 

00:04:49.073 --> 00:04:51.395
 "I understand that the wall is like a net, but the cells, 

00:04:51.395 --> 00:04:54.216
 plants can stand upright. " 

00:04:54.216 --> 00:04:55.934
 "Does the cell wall give them 

00:04:55.934 --> 00:04:57.316
 all the hardness? " 

00:04:57.316 --> 00:04:59.417
 The answer is - somewhat. 

00:04:59.417 --> 00:05:00.879
 The cell is like this network, 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:02.598
 it keeps the shape of the cells. 

00:05:02.598 --> 00:05:04.455
 But if you stop watering a plant, 

00:05:04.455 --> 00:05:07.938
 you will see that it 

00:05:07.938 --> 00:05:08.862
 slamming. 

00:05:08.862 --> 00:05:11.339
 This happens as part of his ability 

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:13.313
 Standing upright comes from internal pressure 

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:14.137
 in the cells. 

00:05:14.137 --> 00:05:16.470
 Another part of the form of the plant comes from itself 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.875
 cell wall. 

00:05:17.875 --> 00:05:18.839
 Now you might say, 

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:20.011
 "Well, I've seen plants, 

00:05:20.011 --> 00:05:21.079
 which are much harder than the plant, 

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:22.170
 which you drew. " 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.610
 "What about things like trees?" 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:24.829
 "The wood?" 

00:05:24.829 --> 00:05:26.345
 "The wood looks very hard." 

00:05:26.345 --> 00:05:27.750
 "It's so hard that 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.304
 we can build real wood walls. " 

00:05:30.304 --> 00:05:32.463
 The answer is that with these 

00:05:32.463 --> 00:05:34.669
 more mature plants once the cell stops 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.142
 to grow and have ours 

00:05:37.142 --> 00:05:40.021
 cell wall may accumulate further 

00:05:40.021 --> 00:05:41.867
 layers of cellulose and other molecules, 

00:05:41.867 --> 00:05:43.945
 forming a so-called secondary cell wall. 

00:05:43.945 --> 00:05:45.303
 We can see this as primary 

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:45.860
 cell wall. 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.381
 And over it can be built thicker 

00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:48.890
 a secondary cell wall that gives the plant 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.666
 much more hardness. 

00:05:50.666 --> 00:05:52.117
 It gives it 

00:05:52.117 --> 00:05:53.151
 the structure of the wood 

00:05:53.151 --> 00:05:54.277
 even if we take away all the water, 

00:05:54.277 --> 00:05:55.728
 even if we dehydrate it, 

00:05:55.728 --> 00:05:57.736
 the wood will still have 

00:05:57.736 --> 00:05:59.710
 hardness due to the layers of cellulose 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:00.836
 and other molecules that are 

00:06:00.836 --> 00:06:02.252
 so thick that 

00:06:02.252 --> 00:06:04.446
 they allow her to keep her temper. 

00:06:04.446 --> 00:06:05.596
 I'm going to the last thing I'm talking about. 

00:06:05.596 --> 00:06:06.873
 We have already seen that 

00:06:06.873 --> 00:06:08.486
 cell membrane has access to 

00:06:08.486 --> 00:06:11.655
 the molecules that swim 

00:06:11.655 --> 00:06:14.349
 between the cells, but there is also 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:18.493
 direct tunnels between adjacent plant cells. 

00:06:18.493 --> 00:06:21.105
 I've drawn these direct tunnels here, 

00:06:21.105 --> 00:06:22.313
 on the outside of the cell walls, 

00:06:22.313 --> 00:06:24.460
 these yellow circles are 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.236
 plasmodesms. 

00:06:26.236 --> 00:06:29.371
 These are plasmodeisms. 

00:06:29.371 --> 00:06:30.613
 To better understand what 

00:06:30.613 --> 00:06:32.737
 represent, imagine that this is a cage. 

00:06:32.737 --> 00:06:35.059
 Here I write cell 1. 

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:37.021
 Let's say this is cell 2. 

00:06:37.021 --> 00:06:38.019
 Box 2 is here. 

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:39.041
 The cells are cut across. 

00:06:39.041 --> 00:06:43.116
 You can see that plasmodes are 

00:06:43.116 --> 00:06:46.030
 these tunnels that are formed 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.201
 - 

00:06:48.201 --> 00:06:49.536
 - 

00:06:49.536 --> 00:06:51.254
 between the two cells. 

00:06:51.254 --> 00:06:52.391
 As a result, cytosol or 

00:06:52.391 --> 00:06:54.771
 small molecules can be exchanged directly 

00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:58.892
 between these two cells. 

00:06:58.892 --> 00:07:00.030
 We will explain the structure of these tunnels in some detail, 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.412
 we have 

00:07:01.412 --> 00:07:04.871
 this tube from the endoplasmic mesh, 

00:07:04.871 --> 00:07:05.498
 which goes through Plasmodeism. 

00:07:05.498 --> 00:07:06.775
 But I want to be very clear. 

00:07:06.775 --> 00:07:08.574
 Very often when you study biology 

00:07:08.574 --> 00:07:10.234
 everything is explained in the textbook 

00:07:10.234 --> 00:07:11.593
 and it looks clear and clear. 

00:07:11.593 --> 00:07:13.369
 But people are still studying the question of why 

00:07:13.369 --> 00:07:15.470
 there are plasmodeisms. 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.687
 What do you need? 

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:19.870
 What is transported through them? 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.553
 and how, 

00:07:21.553 --> 00:07:22.853
 under what conditions? 

00:07:22.853 --> 00:07:24.467
 If you get deeper 

00:07:24.467 --> 00:07:25.907
 very little in some of these questions, 

00:07:25.907 --> 00:07:27.590
 which I have listed, 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.389
 you will get to the zone of active 

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:30.655
 Research. 

00:07:30.655 --> 00:07:32.315
 I hope that in this video 

00:07:32.315 --> 00:07:34.091
 learn a little more 

00:07:34.091 --> 00:07:35.589
 for the trees around you, 

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:36.773
 for plants, domestic plants 

00:07:36.773 --> 00:07:39.547
 and even for the salad you can 

00:07:39.547 --> 00:07:41.547
 was eaten at noon.
