1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,730
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:02,731 --> 00:00:07,731
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,110
July 4th, 2016 how's it going?

4
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:18,111
Happy Birthday to the
United States of America.

5
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:24,081
Happy Birthday to the
United States of America.

6
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:27,030
Happy Birthday.

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,940
United States of America and
the North American continent.

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,983
Yeah.

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,800
Happy Birthday to you. What's going on?

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,600
And I thank you for the well wishes
of happy birthday from all the other

11
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:43,680
countries around the world that
realized we are the best. Huh?

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,850
You think you've got fat people?
Huh? Take a look at that.

13
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:49,500
Beat that mother fuckers.

14
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,800
What else you think he can
Peterson? Huh? What do you want?

15
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:57,110
What do you want to have it? What do you,
what kind of fucking battle you want?

16
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,790
Oh, you can see around the
world you stole our jeans,

17
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,890
all those cool American chains.

18
00:01:03,891 --> 00:01:06,800
You guys would defect from your country
just to get over here to get a pair of

19
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,760
button. Fly fucking five oh
one blues. Remember that Shit.

20
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,740
All of a sudden, you know,

21
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,330
couple of fucking wars and everybody
forgets how much you loved your jeans.

22
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,650
That's, you know, that's just
typical. That is just fucking typical,

23
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,540
you know, fucking England
coming over here, stealing it.

24
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,730
Re fucking cycling our fucking music,

25
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:30,320
walking around like
they're doing something,

26
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,940
redoing the fucking music from the
people that we didn't accept. Fuck.

27
00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:41,780
Are you guys doing? Um, anyways,

28
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,930
um, I'm having a great three day
fucking weekend. I'm not doing shit.

29
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,430
I am, uh,

30
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,730
I'm back in the workout mode so the
needle is pointed in the right direction.

31
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,850
Oh, freckles is going, Dad, Dad,

32
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,610
dad fucking looked in
the mirror last night.

33
00:02:01,611 --> 00:02:03,680
I could tell I was starting to
lose weight. Made me feel good.

34
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:06,620
You know what I mean? That's a fucking
tough thing. Being a red head, you know,

35
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:10,380
use a really small window that you
have to exist in or else the beating.

36
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:14,900
Start again. And it's really
something you can understand. Um,

37
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,130
all right, I'm all over the fucking
place. I got a bunch of Shit I have to do.

38
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:22,220
I'm having some family over
today for a fucking cookout.

39
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,720
I'm going easy this year, rather than
trying to smoke something and blah, blah,

40
00:02:26,721 --> 00:02:29,870
Blah and do all that shit. I'm
fucking go on Burgers and dogs.

41
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:35,150
Perkinson talks the way it used to be
before the fucking food network showed up

42
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,810
and everybody's gotta be
like a top chef. You know?

43
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,850
Remember when you were growing
up? That's what it was.

44
00:02:40,851 --> 00:02:45,620
It was burgers and dogs and everybody
was fucking happy right till the boost

45
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:48,570
started coming around then yeah, then
I got a little sideways, but hey man,

46
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:51,900
it happens. So, uh, yesterday, um,

47
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,110
had some friends over and we
had some cigars, right? And uh,

48
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,710
you know the deal, it's like,
all right, your buddies are over.

49
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,450
Your wife's going to be like,
how are they going to bear? Um,

50
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,220
even if they're cool, like my wife's cool,

51
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:09,400
but there's always going to be an
element of how are you going to bed?

52
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,550
They're going to be loud. They're
going to be upstairs and as, hey,

53
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,520
it's like, yeah, I'm having
people over. Do I do that?

54
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:21,970
When you have a little twice, do I?

55
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,280
You have them over for the fucking wines
and you're all sitting there laughing

56
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,200
with your high pitch fucking voices.

57
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,570
You don't think that that's putting
cracks in the walls? I don't,

58
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,010
I don't fucking bitch about it. I go
down to the old fucking hardware store.

59
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:38,440
I get out to spackle right

60
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,870
then with every little cackle. Right.
Another fucking line in the wall.

61
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,210
You don't hear me complaining
and got my putty knife out. Oh,

62
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:50,020
you have a good time, ladies. Right. Um,

63
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,960
anyways, uh, so we have,

64
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:57,250
we were a hanging out with
actually fucking hilarious
because I'd gone out and I

65
00:03:57,251 --> 00:04:00,430
bought, you know, got some
Cuban cigars. I want to fuck it.

66
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,710
I cleaned everything up. Right. The
thing that, what you want to do,

67
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,010
this is what I've realized when
you're living with a woman,

68
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,270
which you want to do, is you
just go all out. Right? You fuck,

69
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,550
I cleaned the fucking place
up. Okay. I even like,

70
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,840
like the deck on the back,

71
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,190
like I fucking host it off so they
wouldn't be traipse and dirt in and out of

72
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,040
the house or whatever. Right. And
she's sitting there going like, wow,

73
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:31,090
you're really going all out. Yeah.
There's a reason Sam Kittleson.

74
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,480
There's a fucking reason.
There's a fucking reason why.

75
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,590
Because what you want to do is what you're
doing is you just put yourself into a

76
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:44,440
position where you did
absolutely nothing wrong.

77
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,980
So when they complain, cause
they're still gonna complain,

78
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,050
you got all of this fucking Ammo, right?
I cleaned this whole fucking place up,

79
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,820
right? Cleaned out the back porch down
the backyard, the whole fucking thing,

80
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,220
cleaned it up. And we're
having family over here today,

81
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,490
which was another great one to be like,
well I'm also doing it for your family,

82
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,430
right? So, um,

83
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,690
I'm doing all of this shit. I got,

84
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,160
I got the booze, I got
the fucking thought,

85
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:19,000
the outdoor patio furniture,
get everything all cleaned up.

86
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,210
I got an ashtray upstairs.
I got one downstairs,

87
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,010
I got the backyard lights on, I got the
whole fucking thing, I got the music,

88
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:27,970
I got the whole thing.

89
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,350
And then at like six o'clock at
night I realized I didn't get cigars.

90
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,660
I bought cigars, but I
don't have a humidor.

91
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:35,950
And I said I was going to pick them up.

92
00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:40,390
And I had this fucking panic
attack because it was Sunday
before the fourth that

93
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:41,260
they were going to close.

94
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,260
And it was six excruciating
rings before they picked up.

95
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,580
And I was able to run down there
and get them right. And um,

96
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,600
they showed up, I ordered some
pizzas and all that fucking shit.

97
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,650
And here's the best part,
right here is the best part.

98
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,890
I, my wife went to sleep, right?

99
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,400
We smoking with tell him
fucking stories. You know,

100
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,980
I got all these orange
sodas for myself, right?

101
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:11,360
And I turns out everybody there wanted
one because it had the real sugar and it

102
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:12,950
went great with the
cigar. I'm telling you,

103
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:16,850
Cuban Cigar and the Phanta
orange soda is the Shit, right?

104
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,260
They drank all my orange soda.

105
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:23,240
So I had to drink grape soda like a
fucking six fucking year old, right? So,

106
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,780
um, anyways, the end
of the night, it only,

107
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,970
I fucking cleaned up everything. You
wouldn't, you wouldn't even fucking know.

108
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,300
You wouldn't know a god
thing. You wouldn't know
that a fucking soul was here.

109
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,440
And that's what you do. All these fucking
married guys who sit there, you know,

110
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,020
is that back and worth it. It
is fucking worth it. You just,

111
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:45,920
you just have to do it
perfectly, right? You go all out,

112
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:49,040
you clean up the fucking
place, they come over,

113
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,530
you have a great fucking
time. When you leave,

114
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:54,320
you fucking cleaned the whole
place up again. What can she say?

115
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:59,060
What is she going to say to you?
You're not allowed to have friends.

116
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,900
Um, little things like that,

117
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:05,330
cause I've had buddies in my coming
over here like on dude, you fucking,

118
00:07:05,331 --> 00:07:09,740
what are you doing? You did all that
and you fucking wash the dishes. It's,

119
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:13,970
there's a, there's a genius behind
what I do. I'm talking shit here.

120
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,790
I'm drinking throat coat
tea and I'm talking shit.

121
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:23,300
What can they fucking say then go to
this is if you do everything perfectly,

122
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,280
then they're leaving
themselves totally exposed.

123
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,770
If they start complaining
that they're all there,

124
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:34,520
basically can complain about at that
point is that you have friends and you

125
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:37,310
invited them over to the house. All right?

126
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,310
And they know they don't have
a fucking leg to stand on.

127
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,820
So the bitch and goes
down by like 90%. Now,

128
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:47,630
if you have your fucking friends over and
you leave the fucking ash tray out and

129
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:49,610
there's footprints all
over the fucking place,

130
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:53,690
they can make it about that
when the real thing is,

131
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,990
is they don't want you
to have fronts, right?

132
00:07:56,991 --> 00:07:58,400
But they can hide behind the other shit.

133
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,510
But then the real thing is they don't
want you to have friends and they want to

134
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:06,740
slowly kill you so that they can, you
know, have the house to themselves.

135
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,590
And if you, you know,
go to the obituaries,

136
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,060
there's a bunch of guys dropping
around 58, 59 60. And that,

137
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:14,900
that's what happened.

138
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,740
What really happened was they had
friends over and they didn't clean up,

139
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,440
you know, which gave their wives the
window to bitch them into an early grave.

140
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,890
And now they're sitting there in the
fucking house having a hell of a time,

141
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,420
right? Getting to play the victim,

142
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:32,600
getting all the sympathy cards
and eating all the poundcake.

143
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,700
And that's a fact, you know, come in with
the truth here in 4th of July. Hannah,

144
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:42,200
if the fuck I'm talking about,
um, anyways, so afterwards, right?

145
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:47,120
So we're drinking sodas.
I'm stone sober, right. And,

146
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,680
uh, everybody leaves except for
one of my other buddies. And, um,

147
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,800
he wasn't an AA. Right? The older you
get, the more your friends just fucking,

148
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,440
they quit. You know what I
mean? They just fucking quit.

149
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,340
It's like being a lifer in the military.
Everybody doesn't sign back up.

150
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,680
All of a sudden you're
the old guy, you know,

151
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,990
fucking walking around. Where'd I
fucked all my friends go. Right.

152
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,240
Walking around, all sad
with the fucking smoking

153
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,270
bear hat. I didn't hear you. Uh,

154
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:21,360
so he still drinks so they leave. So
I get out the giant fucking ice cubes,

155
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:22,920
a poor couple of Johnny blue.

156
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,720
I would fuck it. Boom. Right.

157
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,930
And uh, you know, he has to drive. So
He's, he's doing a little sippy cup shit.

158
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:35,340
And I live here, so I'm doing the
home port, right. Thousand 1000,

159
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:39,120
2000, three, six, right.
One of those pores.

160
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:44,520
So I have a couple, two or three of
those. I'm feeling good and uh, you know,

161
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:47,310
but I'm not, I cleaned the whole fuck
up too. When I say I cleaned the whole,

162
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,630
the all the leftover pizza, I wrapped
each slice individually in foil.

163
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,200
And then I put a letter
on it, p for Pepperoni,

164
00:09:55,201 --> 00:10:00,201
s facade passage m for fucking
Margaret took the pizza boxes out,

165
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:05,430
put them in the recycle Bin,
took out the fucking chemicals,

166
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,240
fucking spray down the counters.
You wouldn't fucking do that.

167
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:14,430
God Damn forensic team of forensic cops
with their fucking dusters would come in

168
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,710
, would have no fucking idea
anything happened. Right?

169
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,170
So now I'm feeling all proud of myself.

170
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:22,860
I've got my little fucking sippy drink
there and I put it on the TV cause I'm

171
00:10:22,861 --> 00:10:27,420
not ready to go to bed yet. And what
do I see? Time, life books or whatever.

172
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,740
Time life records presents. Easy
listening. Love songs. Right?

173
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:35,250
And I'm sitting there watching
it, right? I'm not in love.

174
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,270
Don't fuck it as big a pitch.

175
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,100
Put Your picture on the wall cause
it's the stay there. Right. I'm like,

176
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:47,280
I remember that fucking song and okay,

177
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,720
forget this one angle bird hopper dig

178
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,180
please big go

179
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,280
GTA. But listen to the lyrics of
that song. It's like for Fuck Sake,

180
00:10:58,281 --> 00:11:03,020
just break up with her. He literally
says something like, I've talking about,

181
00:11:03,021 --> 00:11:07,580
I found a new love. Her lips
are warm and yours is so cold.

182
00:11:07,581 --> 00:11:11,090
It's like angle park. Just
enough with the fucking details.

183
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,980
Just break up what you're just say,
look, I'm not in love with you anymore.

184
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,950
You know, going to bring up the
other fucking broad down the street.

185
00:11:18,951 --> 00:11:23,870
Just got your heart racing. You
fucking cunt. It's such a country song.

186
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,720
But you know, I heard
it when I was younger,

187
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,600
so I'm listening to all
of these fucking songs.

188
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,800
God doesn't make little green apples
and fucking something something bad.

189
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,291
And next thing you know,

190
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:41,291
I'm on the phone calling one
800 gimme those fucking cds.

191
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:47,330
So the guy picks up the phone, he goes,
Hey, this is rob from time live records.

192
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:50,900
Who Am I speaking to? The cds? I'm
like, you're speaking of Bell, rob.

193
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,690
Are you doing buddy up? Do
a great, uh, walk. What? Uh,

194
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,570
what can I do? You've four.
I'm like, well, you know,

195
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:02,020
I'm watching ankle per cup predict
given this broad too much information.

196
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:06,400
But uh, you know, I like the sound
of it. I want to order the CDS.

197
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,060
And he goes, great. Yeah, great. Can
I get a phone number? I'm like, no,

198
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:12,940
you can't not giving you
my phone number. He goes,

199
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:16,270
well then I can't complete
this order. Just like that.

200
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,700
Like I was the 90th
person in a row that said,

201
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,790
I'm not giving you my phone number. Right.

202
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,960
And he was tired of hearing it just when
he gave me the old right there for it.

203
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,060
Well though I can't do the order. Is
there anything else I can help you with?

204
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,110
And I'm like, Whoa, wait
rob. Well let's go on.

205
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,780
And we just went from zero to 200 here.

206
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,680
Why do I have to give you my phone
number? And he's like, oh, um,

207
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,840
you have to get phone numbers so we
can complete the order. It's like,

208
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,890
I understand you're saying that, but
I'm asking you why. And he goes, oh,

209
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,660
it's just cause it's company policy.
And I'm like, why is it company policy?

210
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,140
If he goes, because I need the phone
number in order to complete the order,

211
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:56,620
I go, okay, see what we just did
there? We just drove in a circle. Okay,

212
00:12:56,621 --> 00:13:00,400
I'm trying to get out of this centrifical
fucking force here and get over to the

213
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:03,460
reason the fucking racing. Right.

214
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,140
Okay.

215
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,450
And he finally just goes, well, you know,

216
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,890
the reason is that if there's a problem
with your order, we need to call you.

217
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,820
And it's just like, well, if
there's a problem with the order,

218
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,990
meaning you're charging my card in the
cds, don't ever come. You don't think,

219
00:13:19,991 --> 00:13:24,720
I'm not going to call you. You get
literally had, when I called up,

220
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,330
if there's a problem with
your order, press two.

221
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,800
So I just, we just keep
going round around. I go,

222
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:35,200
you just want the phone number
and I go, not you personally,

223
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,010
but time-life does so they can sell it
to other people. Next thing you know,

224
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,360
I'm walking my dog at some Qantas
calling me up going, congratulations,

225
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:45,910
you're the lucky business
winner of whatever, right?

226
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:51,130
So it fucking escalates to a really
hostile, you have a good night, sir.

227
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:54,520
I'm like, you, I have a good
night to rob. Right. Hang Up.

228
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,890
And I'm sitting there for a second. Right?

229
00:13:56,891 --> 00:14:00,280
During the whisper yelling
fucking cocksuckers they
can fucking stupid enough to

230
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:04,270
give you my phone number. Right. All by
myself. Like, like a complete lunatic,

231
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,003
you know?

232
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,350
Okay.

233
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,950
And then the background, the fucking
commercial still on Muskrat. The,

234
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,280
that fucking cock sucking
motherfuckers. Right.

235
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,880
Just fucking send me the fucking
shit. I bought this before.

236
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:19,900
I never had to give you my phone.

237
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:24,220
Number three is he played with
the 29 a lot of five. Right?

238
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,600
You're getting my fucking money.

239
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,303
Okay.

240
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,940
You gonna call me up pages.
This is rob from time life.

241
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:33,880
Just call them the check to
see if he got those cds. Right.

242
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:40,110
So anyways, um, I really
want these fucking cds.

243
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:43,960
So I called back again and for some reason
I decided to just go into a southern

244
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:48,670
accent and I was like, when they
asked me for their phone number,

245
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:51,410
I'm just for my phone number, I'm just
going to give them their phone number,

246
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:55,580
see if they, they notice like, can
I get your phone numbers? Sure.

247
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,220
What 800. Right. And I was
going to do that shit. But uh,

248
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,940
what happened was by the time
the lady picked up there,

249
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,720
it was the end of the infomercial, it
went on to something else. You know,

250
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,331
something that me,

251
00:15:05,331 --> 00:15:08,930
them makes you skinny or fucking
helps clean up FDA goddamn kids.

252
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,980
I forget what it was. Right? So she,
she answers the phone. She's like, Hey,

253
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:15,590
this is sound, blah blah blah blah
blah from fucking time. And I'm like,

254
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,070
I ain't doing, I like to
order them a hazy listening,

255
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:24,350
a Sadie's five easy payments,
29, 905. She's like, okay,

256
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,270
can I get a name? Who Am I speaking
to? Unlock bill, Bill [inaudible],

257
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,120
right. Just totally does not sound
like a southern name. Whatever.

258
00:15:32,121 --> 00:15:36,770
Southern Billy Joe, Bill
Burr. Um, and uh, she goes,

259
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:37,820
can I get a phone number?

260
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,870
I just decided I was just going to
give her area coats. I was like,

261
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:46,130
my phone number is eight one eight
three two three two, one, two,

262
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,580
five. And she goes, okay,

263
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:54,260
that number is eight one eight three
two, three, two, one, two, five.

264
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:59,120
I'm like, yes it is. Yes ma'am.
Just like I got my tapes,

265
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,740
they're going to fucking show up,
right. My cds, no fucking problem.

266
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,060
I gave him a fake email, like I said,

267
00:16:10,061 --> 00:16:14,260
too damn tall@aol.com and
you know what that means?

268
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,520
Can I get an email arts? It's a two.

269
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:23,110
The number two number
two and d a m n tall.

270
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,360
Like I didn't say damn like
I was trying to be polite.

271
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,460
So then she had to read it back.

272
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So that email is number two d a m
n tall@aol.com like that's right.

273
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,093
Yes it is.

274
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,970
And I got him calming five fucking CDs,

275
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,710
five CDs for 30 bucks. Three payments.
I Dunno what the fuck it was.

276
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:50,050
That's gonna be a lot of
cds. You know what's funny?

277
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:53,890
My Prius still has a CD holder.
When my new car gets here, it won't.

278
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,140
And then what the fuck do I
do? Well, I know when I do,

279
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:59,890
I sell them for one easy payment
of nine 95 on Ebay, you know,

280
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,540
and no phone numbers required.

281
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,550
Just give me a fucking address
and I'll send it to you.

282
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:09,260
What do you think about that?
Um, all right, come on up.

283
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,660
He'll type in your fucking
password out. Jesus Christ.

284
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,670
So rumor has it that Kevin Durant is
going to go to the fucking Golden State

285
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,503
Warriors.

286
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,080
Yeah.

287
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,130
And as a sports fan, I cannot think
of a more boring fucking move,

288
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:23,983
you know what I mean?

289
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,820
And I fucking hate how ESPN
and all these sports places,

290
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,590
they just don't call them out on it.

291
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,760
Like how bad that is for sports fans.

292
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,730
I wanted to see if Oklahoma City, now,
he hasn't done it yet, but you know,

293
00:17:39,731 --> 00:17:44,200
sources say rumors and all that shit. I
wanted to see if you know, what the fuck

294
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,140
can Oklahoma City get by
golden state next year?

295
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,340
Could golden state redeem themselves and
win a fucking championship? You know,

296
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,760
it was such a great
series, exciting series.

297
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,710
Oklahoma had them beat,

298
00:18:00,711 --> 00:18:03,350
they had their foot on their neck and
then the fucking golden state comes

299
00:18:03,351 --> 00:18:07,970
roaring back. This is like, this is
great. I want to see this again next year.

300
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,150
Like when the 76 is tried
to get past the Celtics.

301
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,180
Dr J didn't just sign with the Celtics.

302
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,340
Okay.

303
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,340
Granted they got Moses Malone. I
guess it's been going on for awhile.

304
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:24,200
I just don't fucking get it. Still fucking
get it. It's like, all right, these,

305
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:27,740
this is a great rivalry.
They're evenly matched.

306
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:29,780
It went seven games. Hey,

307
00:18:29,781 --> 00:18:34,040
let's take the best player or one of the
best players depending on if you like

308
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:37,670
Westbrook prayer and we'll just stick
them on the other fucking team and now

309
00:18:37,671 --> 00:18:40,220
that rivalry is null and void.

310
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,800
Now it goes from wow seven game,
great series to fucking, you know,

311
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:48,380
four or five game
series. Who gives a shit?

312
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:55,300
I don't fucking get it. It's fucking
Jerry West going, you know, if he,

313
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:59,720
if you sign here, you're, you're
rebounding is going to be modus more.

314
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,660
Your blurb of bloods can be a
charity. You don't give a fuck.

315
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,200
You don't give a fucking for if all the
best players in the league or all on one

316
00:19:06,201 --> 00:19:09,770
fucking team. And it's the worst
fucking thing ever. You know,

317
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,280
this is coming from a Celtic fan and
I watched us do that with that. Kevin,

318
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:18,440
Kevin de renting, Kevin Durant, Kevin
Garnett team. You know, like they,

319
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,230
we just bought that.

320
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,440
We went from literally last place to
winning the championship in one fucking

321
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:24,180
year. And I realized that
there's a skill to it,

322
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,770
but as a crabby old
fucking curmudgeon, um,

323
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:32,080
I just don't, I just, what is
exciting about that if he goes,

324
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,890
if he signs with the Golden State
Warriors, well that's great.

325
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:39,060
Why don't you have Lebron jump on that
one to remember those great Miami Heat

326
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:44,010
teams. Remember how exciting
that was? If you lived in Miami,

327
00:19:44,011 --> 00:19:46,380
everybody else, it was
a fucking snooze fest.

328
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,890
They'll sit on a fucking yacht. Hey,
y'all want to be on the same team?

329
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,420
We'll win three in a row and we'll,
we'll be like, we'll be a dynasty.

330
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,070
Like the fucking, the bulls will be like
them. Yeah. Except they didn't pile on.

331
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,180
Oh, I'm in a mode. I hope that
moves doesn't happen. You know,

332
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:09,810
it's going to happen. I just, Ah, you
know, whatever, it's his fucking career.

333
00:20:09,811 --> 00:20:11,490
But just saying as a sports fan,

334
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,460
as a guy who fucking watch his sports but
doesn't really pick up on anything and

335
00:20:17,461 --> 00:20:19,410
then runs his fucking mouth on a podcast,

336
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,640
I am not in favor of that
fucking move. That would suck.

337
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:29,370
You know? Yeah. I just wonder,
well, what are you gonna do?

338
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,640
Well, that's what they, that's what
these kids do nowadays. Oh Man.

339
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,220
Actually it's been going on for
30 fucking years. Biggest, um,

340
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:41,450
I guess free agent signing or trade or
whatever of my life of my life was a

341
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,470
Wayne Gretzky. Go into the kinks.

342
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,530
If ever there wasn't an unmovable guy,

343
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,480
like there's no fucking way this franchise
is ever getting rid of this player

344
00:20:55,481 --> 00:20:57,730
unless we just completely, I don't know,

345
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,650
went out of business folded
and had to move or if our, uh,

346
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:04,863
I don't know.

347
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:10,020
Our owners son fucking financed
the Michael Jackson victory tour,

348
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,640
you know, so now daddy has to sign,

349
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:16,510
sell the fucking team because
Michael Jackson stage was so big at,

350
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:20,710
ate up all these fucking seats that they
were losing money every night and then

351
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,740
racist Massachusetts said that they
couldn't do the show out in Foxborough,

352
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,453
you know,

353
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,110
cause they didn't want a bunch of black
people coming out to Foxborough Masco

354
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:35,110
and for fucking three hours, evidently
that was going to be a problem.

355
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,060
I could see them making
the fucking move. Right.

356
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,990
Do you know that that
promoted told me that.

357
00:21:40,991 --> 00:21:45,370
That's how I always used to
think that when Billy Sullivan,

358
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,740
the original owner of the
Patriots, his son Patrick,

359
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:52,000
somehow was the promoter for the Michael
Jackson victory tour. And I remember,

360
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:56,830
um, at the last second, you know, it
was supposed to be at Sullivan Stadium,

361
00:21:56,831 --> 00:22:00,130
which is what's a Patriot's
old stadium. And um,

362
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,910
at the last second FoxPro
was just like, yeah, no,

363
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:05,350
you're not having that concert out here.

364
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,780
And it was just because it was going to
be a bunch of black people out there.

365
00:22:07,781 --> 00:22:11,470
Right. And, uh, but Michael Jackson
had in his contract that, you know,

366
00:22:11,471 --> 00:22:14,440
once you sign it, whether the show
happens or not, you gotta pay me.

367
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,250
And I used to think that that
one show fucked him over.

368
00:22:18,251 --> 00:22:20,770
But this promoter in Boston told me, no,

369
00:22:20,771 --> 00:22:25,771
he had this giant ass fucking stage and
the Sullivan's didn't take into account.

370
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,570
This is all alleged legend here of the
amount of seats that that was gonna take

371
00:22:31,571 --> 00:22:35,350
up in the arena, you know? And uh,

372
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,670
and they didn't realize that
when they were making the deal,

373
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,740
they were calculating a certain number
of seats versus what they would play in

374
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:43,810
the Jacksons and it all worked out.

375
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:47,340
And then when they saw the behemoth
of a fucking stage, they will let go,

376
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:51,440
my God. So they go to Michael, they're
like, Michael, he was like, yes.

377
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,970
They were like, can you make
your stage a little smaller?

378
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:59,050
We're going to lose our shirts here.
And Michael Jackson was like, no, I,

379
00:22:59,051 --> 00:23:02,680
if I have it, smaller prints is going to
outdo me. Like he had, like, you know,

380
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,380
that rivalry with him going on. I
don't know if that's fucking true.

381
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,850
Somebody told me this story and then I
just repeated it as fact. I mean this,

382
00:23:09,851 --> 00:23:14,260
this is what I do on the podcast. Um,

383
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,890
I'm just running my yap
here. Uh, did anybody watch,

384
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,600
did you watch the Austrian Grand Prix?

385
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:24,760
If that didn't make you a
fucking formula one racing fan?

386
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,870
Holy Shit. That was like
fucking days of fun.

387
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:35,230
I actually tweeted that
yesterday, dude. It's like, okay,

388
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,500
this is the deal. The German
team, the Mercedes Benz, right?

389
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:41,920
They got Nico Rosberg and
Louis Hamilton. All right.

390
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:46,070
Nico Rosberg is a German, right?

391
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,740
Lewis Hamilton is a, he's
from England, right. And uh,

392
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,910
evidently from the isle of Man,

393
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,140
from what people were texting
tweeting me the other day. So

394
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:03,050
Nico is ahead. He's, he's beaten
everybody in the points in the standings.

395
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:07,490
And Louis is like the fucking upstart
guy, I guess. I don't know. Right.

396
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,600
He wears the big fucking diamond chain,
you know what I mean? He's from east,

397
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:15,050
from England. I don't know what his is,
his racist. I don't know if he's mixed.

398
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:16,190
I don't know what his deal is.

399
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,220
And he's got the bling
going on and all this shit.

400
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,220
So all the old fucking um,

401
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:27,260
traditional fans of the
sport, traditional wink, wink.

402
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:31,220
I like the Old School Formula
One, wink, wink. Right. You know,

403
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:34,610
at that fucking means they don't like
this guy ever tell me they don't like his

404
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:39,570
bling. They don't like his,
uh, you know, his whole basic,

405
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,320
I dunno, I don't want to fucking
throw the ugliness in there,

406
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:46,100
but it seems like there's a little
issue there, right? So anyways,

407
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:48,980
earlier this year, I guess in the Spanish
Grand Prix, I didn't see that one.

408
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:53,930
They both fucking, they banged into each
other and was coming around the corner.

409
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,600
He's pushing buttons on that
playstation steering wheel,

410
00:24:56,601 --> 00:25:01,120
whatever the fuck that thing is. You
just, you just have a fucking stairwell.

411
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,630
Then it was a steering
wheel with the paddles.

412
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,430
Now it looks like a little game boy,

413
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,910
and they're pushing shit
to fucking conserve energy.

414
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:09,680
And I don't know what the fuck it is,

415
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,480
but they some out do this going like 180
miles an hour, which is amazing to me.

416
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,520
120 miles an hour and a fucking turn,

417
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,780
as if did dealing with the g forces
of slowing down and taking a turn.

418
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,980
Well over a hundred miles an hour,

419
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,160
they're sitting there on fucking
pushing buttons, you know,

420
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,620
like texting while driving
fucking doing this shit.

421
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,720
So earlier in the year
they had one, uh, you know,

422
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:36,920
Hamilton tried to pass him on the
inside and then Nico was defending his

423
00:25:36,921 --> 00:25:39,110
position or whatever the
fuck he said. He came over,

424
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:44,540
he put Lewis on the fucking,
uh, grass. He spun out,

425
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:48,850
he clipped it back in Nico's car,
they slammed into each other and uh,

426
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,830
they both got the old deal right
there for at the DNC, right.

427
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:55,850
Did not complete the race, which caused
Mercedes a bunch of fucking points.

428
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,150
So evidently they probably sat him
down and was like, Hey, fuck heads,

429
00:25:59,151 --> 00:26:00,740
you're on the same team here. What?

430
00:26:00,741 --> 00:26:04,040
Say you don't knock each other
out of the race. So whatever.

431
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:09,041
They got this whole rivalry going and it
seems like Nico thinks he's the fucking

432
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:12,250
guy and Louis is just like,
well I don't, I, you know,

433
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,370
I respect that you're the guy,

434
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,650
but I'm trying to be the
guy to so go fuck yourself.

435
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:20,480
So yesterday they're
fucking racing and uh,

436
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,450
I, you know, I don't know
much about this sport,

437
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:27,950
but evidently there's soft tires and
if the soft tires aren't soft enough,

438
00:26:27,951 --> 00:26:29,570
they got super soft tires.

439
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,590
And I guess the softer your tires are
depending on the weather condition,

440
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,060
the faster your car goes.

441
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:39,560
So whatever fucking reason they give
Nico the super soft ones and they give

442
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:44,550
Lewis just to soft once, so
they're fucking them over
with each lap. All right.

443
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,420
So Nico's obviously the golden child that
the corporate guys like and Louis just

444
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:53,160
the fucking upstart, right?
He's the Tom Cruise. Okay.

445
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:56,910
The other guys to fucking
establish con who's winning. Right.

446
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:01,550
I'm just guessing all of
this shit. So, um, I dunno,

447
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,650
there's something about the pitstop
Louis' was slower than Nico's.

448
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:08,850
They gave all the fucking advantage to
Nico Cause Nikos went in in the points.

449
00:27:08,851 --> 00:27:11,490
I think that they want him to win the
fucking race cause they want to win the

450
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:13,920
championship and Louis
wasn't fucking having it.

451
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:18,240
So he's driving like a fucking maniac
on soft tires when Nico's got the super

452
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:21,450
soft and next thing you know
he's right on his fucking ass.

453
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,330
It's the last lap of the fucking race

454
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:29,680
and Louis goes to pass him on the
outside of the turn taking the long way

455
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:33,310
around. He's on his fucking
ties around the white line.

456
00:27:33,311 --> 00:27:36,040
He can't get over any farther
if he's going to pass.

457
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,590
If you see he's going to
overtake them on the final lap,

458
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:43,510
the fucking announces are going nuts and
fucking Nico just drove right into him.

459
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,210
You said he had a breaking
problem. It's like, Oh yeah,

460
00:27:46,211 --> 00:27:48,010
did you have a stair in problem two?

461
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:51,550
You fucking drove right into
him and it's like, oh my God,

462
00:27:51,551 --> 00:27:55,720
they're going to knock each other out of
the race again. And they get out of it.

463
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:57,850
And then they came back
together in the end. Fucking,

464
00:27:57,851 --> 00:28:02,480
I think the back of Hamilton's car clipped
the front of a Rosberg's and took his

465
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:06,160
little finfin things off the
front. So now we can't drive fast.

466
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:09,940
And when your car's damaged like that and
you blow in debris all over the track,

467
00:28:09,941 --> 00:28:12,550
I didn't realize this. Evidently
you're supposed to pull over,

468
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,280
supposed to hit the old rest
area. Just be like, well,

469
00:28:15,281 --> 00:28:18,580
I guess we're going to call it a day
because all that shit that you're putting

470
00:28:18,581 --> 00:28:21,340
in the track and blow out somebody's
tire caused them to crash.

471
00:28:21,341 --> 00:28:23,890
They could get injured and they're
not going to fucking finish.

472
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:27,040
And it's not their fault that you
fucking drove into your teammate.

473
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,890
But this car keeps driving his car,

474
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,490
shrapnel all over the
track. And he finished,

475
00:28:33,491 --> 00:28:37,540
he got panelized long story short was
Lewis Hamilton and end up winning the

476
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:41,500
fucking race. And uh, they
were cutting to the, uh,

477
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:46,570
whatever the owners of the Mercedes
team and they're all fucking pissed.

478
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,700
And, uh, one of the guys on the Mercedes
teams is the guy that, you know,

479
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,530
went for that movie rush. I should
really have the guy's name here.

480
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,990
I'm new to this sport, so forgive
me for not knowing his name.

481
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,890
The Guy who had that horrific crash on
the Ferrari team in 1976 and he had the

482
00:28:59,891 --> 00:29:04,180
fire, they showed it in a, that movie.
Russia was absolutely terrifying. I mean,

483
00:29:04,181 --> 00:29:08,170
what's more terrifying? They'd
being alive on fire, you know

484
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,490
me. See,

485
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:15,490
what would you rather be alive on fire
or in the ocean watching a great white

486
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:18,910
shark approaching, you know,

487
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:21,640
no one is gonna fucking
take your leg off. I mean,

488
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:25,240
I actually think you got
to go with the shark.

489
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:29,620
Just fucking bite my leg off.
There's a major artery right there.

490
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:32,010
I'm going to fucking be like, ha.

491
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:34,990
And then the dopamine is going to come
out and I'm gonna have that goofy smile

492
00:29:34,991 --> 00:29:38,740
on my face is the hammer head
comes in to finish me off. Right.

493
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,310
Okay.

494
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:43,450
So anyways, they would to him afterwards,
Nico said that he had a and problem.

495
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,490
I don't know. I don't fucking know.

496
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:48,760
So now there's all these conspiracy
theorists out there going like, well,

497
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:53,050
you know, it's the German team.
Nico's a German. All right,

498
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,320
fucking Hamilton's a,

499
00:29:59,440 --> 00:29:59,990
you know,

500
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:04,990
from England and he doesn't look like
your fucking English guy being made and

501
00:30:05,061 --> 00:30:08,480
he's not a white dude. Maybe there's
some racism going on there. I don't know.

502
00:30:08,481 --> 00:30:12,650
But I just became a Ha Lewis Hamilton
fan. I still like Rosberg, you know,

503
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,980
he's racing, he's out there, you
know, can't fucking handle it.

504
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:16,701
He's one of those,

505
00:30:16,701 --> 00:30:19,040
he seems like one of those guys you
have to go out and you play like pickup

506
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:20,150
hooper, pickup hockey,

507
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:24,140
and it's just some fucking nice guy and
all of a sudden the game starts and they

508
00:30:24,141 --> 00:30:25,670
get that fucking look in their face.

509
00:30:25,671 --> 00:30:28,550
Like they'll blow out a
knee just to score a goal.

510
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,110
You know those loaded lunatics.

511
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,190
Yeah.

512
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,330
You just sit in there
going like, all right,

513
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:37,620
I'm going to fucking steer clear slash
try to annoy the shit out of this person.

514
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,010
Okay.

515
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:46,740
I'm gonna try and make sure this guy
doesn't fall on my fucking leg. You know,

516
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,750
I had a buddy of mine, right fucking
nicest guy ever. He's a psychiatrist.

517
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:55,620
He works with troubled inner city youth
who just gone through all kinds of

518
00:30:55,621 --> 00:31:00,300
fucking horrific shit. He has the
patience to sit there, you know,

519
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,560
and work with these kids that are acting
out because of all this horrible stuff

520
00:31:04,561 --> 00:31:05,130
that that's,

521
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:09,180
that's happened to them in their home
life and he sits there and he handles it

522
00:31:09,181 --> 00:31:12,210
and he loves it. You fucking
get that guy out on the ice.

523
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:16,260
He's a fucking lunatic.
One time I took the,

524
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,400
we mean the other guy,

525
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:22,290
we fucking taking the puck away from him
and I heard his breathing change and he

526
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:24,900
just fucking brought his
stick up and I'm telling you,

527
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,900
this is why I the full
birdcage, right dude,

528
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:31,800
45 degree angle across my
whole face. It just Bam.

529
00:31:31,801 --> 00:31:36,340
It hit my fucking cage and I looked at
it, I was just like, dude, what the fuck?

530
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,330
For whatever dumb reason,
I was one of those people,

531
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:43,200
you know that comes out plays
pickup hockey only wearing a visor.

532
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,390
Those guys are lunatics,
especially when they,

533
00:31:45,391 --> 00:31:47,430
because there's always the person
out there that can't skate,

534
00:31:47,431 --> 00:31:50,010
which is usually me. And you
start doing that run in place.

535
00:31:50,011 --> 00:31:52,290
I'm going to fall forward, I'm going to
fall back, I'm going to fall forward.

536
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:55,410
And you got like this stick in your hand
that's coming up and taking somebody

537
00:31:55,411 --> 00:31:59,860
teeth out. So I'm, oh my God, what a Luna.

538
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:03,960
I literally would have needed like
fucking plastic surgery. I was kidding.

539
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,540
Who the fucking face like
mine. You just ride it out. Oh,

540
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:10,050
there's this name right there. I got
it right here. I'm sorry. Ah, Nikki.

541
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,580
I'm going to say it wrong. Lau,
D A, I don't want to say Lotta,

542
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,890
I swear to God. So he was,

543
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,180
they talked to him and I'm looking at
this guy looking like the old racing guy,

544
00:32:21,181 --> 00:32:24,060
like one of his ears. It's like, you
know, mostly burned off and shit.

545
00:32:24,061 --> 00:32:26,700
He's got the scars on the side of
his face. I gotta be honest with you.

546
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,120
He looked pretty fucking
Badass. You know what I mean?

547
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,170
And another guy named, I swear to God,

548
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,030
Toto Wolf Todo like the band
I want up that's on the cds.

549
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:43,970
A level I want to do, man awake
at be in the morning is the,

550
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,430
um, all right, let's do a
couple of reads here. Oh Jesus.

551
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:54,230
I was 32 fucking minutes of just
running my Yap or simple faith.

552
00:32:54,231 --> 00:32:56,840
We have somebody new here.
Everybody's simple faith.

553
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,760
Thousands of people seeking home security
get ripped off every day at the home

554
00:33:01,761 --> 00:33:03,530
security industry. And,

555
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:07,790
and the home security industry wants
you to believe it's your only option.

556
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:13,330
They got hoards of salesmen out there
trying to scare you into signing one of

557
00:33:13,941 --> 00:33:15,500
their longterm contracts.

558
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:20,870
You get stuck writing huge checks
month after month with capital letters.

559
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,280
No way out,

560
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:23,730
okay?

561
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:26,730
It's robbery by contract and
it can cost you thousands,

562
00:33:26,731 --> 00:33:29,700
but there's a better way to
protect your home. Simple faith,

563
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,130
home security. Wait, what the
fuck are they talking about?

564
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:37,210
These contracts at home security is you
didn't want you to believe it's your

565
00:33:37,211 --> 00:33:40,400
only option. What are they?

566
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:44,930
Do they sign you a contract to do
what? Simple. Safe has no contracts.

567
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:50,210
None. You'll get award winning 24, seven
protection named best in the industry.

568
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:51,381
Oh, I see.

569
00:33:51,381 --> 00:33:56,030
Security professionals watching ready
to instantly send the police and it's

570
00:33:56,031 --> 00:33:56,864
just,

571
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,000
they're not going to
go in and do something.

572
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:07,700
Jesus fucking Christ. I could do that.
There's gotta be another way. Oh,

573
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:12,040
and I know they sit in the van. All
right. My fault. Sorry. Simple faith. Um,

574
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:14,800
I just simple, safe. I thought they
were to tell you to have a home safe.

575
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,950
It's just 1499 per month.

576
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,030
That's less than half of what most
companies charge. Protect your home.

577
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,810
The smart way. Visit simple, safe. Uh,

578

584
00:34:52,161 --> 00:34:55,940
Blue Apron, everybody. Oh, blue apron.

Blue Apron. Knows that when you
cook with incredible ingredients,

586
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:00,770

587
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,490
So they set the highest quality
standards for their community of artists.

588
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:08,330
[inaudible] supplies, uh,
suppliers, family run farms,

589
00:35:08,331 --> 00:35:12,680
fisheries and ranches, whether
it's Japanese ramen noodles,

590
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:16,310
wild caught Alaskan salmon
or heirloom tomatoes.

591
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:20,450
Blue Apron is bringing you the best. None
of that shit existed when I was a kid.

592
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,430
It's all because of the food network.

593
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:26,000
Like the level of options you now have
as a person to eat. You know what I mean?

594
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:30,800
It was fucking chipped beef on toast,
chicken noodle soup, tuna casserole.

595
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:36,290
Alright, cube steaks, these fucking
kids today, this is what they can eat.

596
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:40,240
These are kids in their struggling. They
can actually have so great blue aprons.

597
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:44,340
You go from that horse shit
to Japanese ramen noodles.

598
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,880
Wild caught Alaskan
Salmon, heirloom tomatoes.

599
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:52,620
There was one fucking tomato when I was
a kid for less than 10 bucks per meal.

600
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,180
Blue Apron delivers seasonal recipes along

606

so you only get deliveries
when you want them.

607
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,720
So if you gotta lay in your life,
you can cook her some meals.

608
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:25,620
If she fucking leaves you, you can
go right back to fucking Eaton.

609
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,980
What the fuck did we use to have
steak ups? Oh, I'd love to stay calm.

610
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,150
I swear to God the last nine
periods of my school day,

611
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:35,910
I would be sitting there thinking about
the steak and I was going to make when I

612
00:36:35,911 --> 00:36:38,340
got home, right? Fry it up in the Pan,

613
00:36:38,341 --> 00:36:41,820
like one of those whores with the
high heels and the lipstick, right?

614
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,770
And then you'd put it on the white
bread and watch the grease turning gray,

615
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:51,120
little bit of ketchup and some cheese.
Fucking phenomenal. But anyways,

616
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:53,670
back to blue apron. Each
meal comes with step by step,

What do we got left here?

624
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,460
We got two more left. Let's
break it up. Okay, let's,

625
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:27,780
let's give you a break from my reading
out loud or my attempt at reading.

626
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:32,790
Uh, we'll go back to the fucking
podcast here. Uh, where did I go?

627
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:36,720
Where did I go? Where the
fuck is the other shit up?

628
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:41,910
Did dddd um, all right. So should we
get into the reeds here for this week?

629
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,770
Why don't we, all right.
Governor Gary Jackson.

630
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:52,410
Gary Johnson, sorry. Governor
Gary Johnson. Hey Billy Shatner.

631
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:57,870
Billy fucking shit. I'm not a libertarian.

632
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,220
I never said you were, I'd never
been affiliated with any party.

633
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,630
I voted both parties in
four elections. I voted in.

634
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,610
I've been eligible for six.

635
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,480
You sound like a blogger when you're
going to criticize a comedian going like,

636
00:38:12,481 --> 00:38:17,250
I have a great sense of humor.
You know I find this funny, I've,

637
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:21,480
I love this and Blah Blah Blah. But
what I saw last night in a comedy club,

638
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,400
all right, so this guy has established
himself that he's open minded. All right,

639
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,290
because he says,

640
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:32,880
so I'm not into the fringe candidates
and I don't buy into conspiracies.

641
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,750
I guess what I'm saying is I'm
not the typical Gary Johnson Fan.

642
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:43,120
Now what? Because you say so. I
guess what I'm saying is, well,

643
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:45,880
why don't you figure out what the fuck
you say and so you don't have to write

644
00:38:45,881 --> 00:38:49,870
extra words in a sentence. Giving me more
opportunity to trip myself up please.

645
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:51,071
All right. However,

646
00:38:51,071 --> 00:38:54,460
I am a fan of his and I think he
could actually win if he got on the,

647
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:58,840
on the debates. He's basically Bernie
who I supported for the most part.

648
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,340
They just don't, I'm not a libertarian.
Well he was a Democrat, right, man.

649
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,070
Well he was and then he became a
libertarian, then became a democrat.

650
00:39:06,071 --> 00:39:09,340
Does that not work? I don't
know. I love Bernie Sanders.

651
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,610
Whoa. Oh No.

652
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,350
Loved them. They align on 80%
of the issues. His running mate,

653
00:39:18,351 --> 00:39:21,050
his former Massachusetts
Governor, Bill Weld,

654
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:25,630
Bill weld still in the game like
fucking Gordie Howe rested piece.

655
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:30,020
A wondering what your thoughts on Gary
Johnson and also bill weld having lived

656
00:39:30,021 --> 00:39:32,420
in the state, uh,

657
00:39:32,421 --> 00:39:36,800
when he was in office below was a short
campaign video of the two of them.

658
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,130
Well, I, well, what the
fuck? I don't, I don't know.

659
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,960
I thought you were going
to tell me about him.

660
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,320
I guess I was supposed
to watch this before.

661
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,383
Okay.

662
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,530
You Dude, you just gave
me homework. All right,

663
00:39:50,531 --> 00:39:54,640
let's put this fucking thing in here
and we're going to try and watch it.

664
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:59,870
No Shit. I'm running for Paris in it.

665
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:03,710
I'm [inaudible] running for
president. I'm running wisdom.

666
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:09,320
Jazzy music. As the
governor of New Mexico,

667
00:40:09,321 --> 00:40:12,140
I vetoed wasteful spending 750 times,

668
00:40:12,141 --> 00:40:16,850
cut taxes 14 times and left the states.
Why is he so breathy? Richard's schools,

669
00:40:16,851 --> 00:40:20,540
hospitals and $1 billion
surplus without raising taxes.

670
00:40:20,541 --> 00:40:22,880
I panic as governor of Massachusetts.

671
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:25,860
How would I know that you just
said that you did it. Now how do I,

672
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:30,930
I can't fact check all of that.
I Dunno. I mean, it's exciting.

673
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,940
We're going to move the country
forward. Music. [inaudible] hi.

674
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:39,690
Hi. I'm Jerry Johnson. Um,

675
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,330
I'm sure he's a great guy.
I'll look into it. I mean,

676
00:40:42,331 --> 00:40:45,510
I like that you're giving me other options
because there's no fucking way I can

677
00:40:45,511 --> 00:40:50,120
vote for Trump or for
Hillary, you know? Uh,

678
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:52,050
we all know the old bag's going to win it.

679
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:56,580
She's going to show up with lipstick
on her teeth and that fucking maniacal.

680
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,280
Why'd I fucking smile? She does.

681
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:02,750
Okay.

682
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:07,610
Oh, she's going to carve this country
up even more. They are fucking evil.

683
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,020
I swear to God.

684
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:10,670
Okay.

685
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:13,820
If Trump wasn't such a fucking dope,

686
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:19,730
if he wasn't such a dope, I actually
think he would be the lesser of two evils.

687
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,740
But I, I have to be honest with you.

688
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:26,630
There's no way to listen to Donald Trump
and not think about Martin Sheen in the

689
00:41:26,631 --> 00:41:27,464
dead zone.

690
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,600
Okay? Can

691
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:36,140
Somebody please Photoshop Trump holding
up the baby? You know, when fucking,

692
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:39,650
what's his face? Um,

693
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:45,660
oh Jesus Christ one Watkins up in the
balcony there or the dead fucking the

694
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,810
parades are away, gentlemen.
Um, I have no idea, sir. I,

695
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,610
I commend you for, uh,

696
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:57,500
being smart enough to not vote for
Trump or for Hillary. It's a a,

697
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:02,630
it's a really low point and
I wasn't a big Obama Fan,

698
00:42:02,631 --> 00:42:06,230
but at least Obama, at least, you know,
the guy could speak intelligently,

699
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,580
you know,

700
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:12,530
after fucking eight years of George
Bush or Shasha when that guy was,

701
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,520
that guy was like the presidential
version of me reading out loud.

702
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,730
All right. I just, Oh God.

703
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,940
There has to be so many other fucking
women out there that would meet,

704
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:29,060
make such great, honest
precedents. We really have.

705
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,320
Why does it have to be the one
with 52 pending felony counts?

706
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:38,930
All those Clintons are
filthy. Oh, Hillary Clinton.

707
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,690
She's dirtier than her husband's
Dick. Ah, right. Here we go.

708
00:42:41,691 --> 00:42:44,140
Facial hair and low lady.

709
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,070

amazing in here. Right score bit.

713
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:05,700
You're paying too much for tickets
between all the mockups and last minute

714
00:43:05,701 --> 00:43:10,650
convenience charges, even print at home
seats. What are you fucking kidding me?

715
00:43:10,651 --> 00:43:14,060
Do you end up paying courtside
prices for nosebleeds?

00:45:02,571 --> 00:45:06,590

your underwear unless you're a fucking

746
00:45:06,591 --> 00:45:07,250
animal.

747
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:10,490
But instead of making a statement like
Superman's tight under his everyday

748
00:45:10,491 --> 00:45:13,100
clothes, your underwear
is probably boring.

749

describe the fit and feel of me on these,

753
00:45:25,611 --> 00:45:26,510

754
00:45:26,511 --> 00:45:30,230

world's most comfortable underwear.

a deer, big belly fat belly. Um,

766
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:11,810
I'm a 17 year old guy who will be
starting college in the fall in the great

767
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:15,680
state of Massachusetts. Um,
Jesus starting at seven,

768
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:19,820
you must be turning 18 later on in the
year. Um, I'm always jealous of that.

769
00:46:19,821 --> 00:46:22,220
I started, I started
college when I was 19.

770
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,870
I was already 19 then I fucked up my
first four years and I was like a 23 year

771
00:46:26,871 --> 00:46:28,260
old sophomore. Um,

772
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:33,300
my high school's a dress code allows
guys to grow facial hair in the last

773
00:46:34,961 --> 00:46:39,430
semester of senior year. What, what,

774
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,440
what fucking school are you going
to? So a few months ago I said,

775
00:46:44,441 --> 00:46:49,200
what the hell? I'll give it
a try. But you're only 17.

776
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:53,380
The last semester of your senior year,

777
00:46:53,381 --> 00:46:57,170
you're giving yourself a hell of a
lot of time to grow. This shit said,

778
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:01,810
I ended up growing up growing a nice dark
full beard that seems to suit me well.

779
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,140
I got a lot of compliments for
it. Mostly from other guys,

780
00:47:05,141 --> 00:47:07,150
but some from the ladies.

781
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,750
I remain single as I have
always been during this time.

782
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,100
I still have the beard now,

783
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:15,520
but I don't know whether I should keep
the beard or ditch it and arrive at

784
00:47:15,521 --> 00:47:16,690
college. Clean Shaven.

785
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:21,160
Do you think it's a good or bad idea to
make my first impression while sporting

786
00:47:21,161 --> 00:47:23,380
a beer? In terms of the ladies,

787
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:28,560
is the beard a sign of manliness
and strength or more of a turnoff?

788
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:33,490
I don't fucking, I got to ask Nia.
Hang on a second. Jesus Christ.

789
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,770
How the one out of fuck
would I know? Well, you know,

790
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:38,470
I always thought Dan
Fouts with sexy. Hang on.

791
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:40,213
Okay.

792
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:42,410
All right. You happy she
was sleeping? I just,

793
00:47:42,411 --> 00:47:44,890
I didn't know if she was sleeping. I
was fucking nightmare you have there.

794
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,800
All right, well there you go. So
you fucked the whole thing up.

795
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:53,030
The cleaned up and then I woke her up.
Um, anyway, dude, I don't fucking know.

796
00:47:53,031 --> 00:47:54,050
But you're saying that you're not,

797
00:47:54,051 --> 00:47:58,670
you're not allowed to have facial
hairs at this fucking school.

798
00:47:58,671 --> 00:48:01,130
You go was elegant type
Typo or something. My,

799
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:03,740
Oh my high school's not college.

800
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:09,700
My high school's dress code allows guys
to grow facial hair in the last semester

801
00:48:09,951 --> 00:48:14,900
of senior year. Ah, okay. I thought
it was like saying that college. Um,

802
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:18,080
well look to when I was a kid.

803
00:48:18,081 --> 00:48:21,770
The only reason to grow a beard was so
you could buy booze or get served when

804
00:48:21,771 --> 00:48:24,920
you were still under age. You know,
whether women liked it or not.

805
00:48:24,921 --> 00:48:27,620
I have no fucking idea. Um,

806
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:29,923
yeah,

807
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:34,430
I don't, I don't know. Go there
fucking clean shaven and then, uh,

808
00:48:34,431 --> 00:48:38,930
you know, get a little scruff going
or some shit. I don't know this,

809
00:48:38,931 --> 00:48:41,720
this is like a cosmo question.
I have no fucking, do they,

810
00:48:41,721 --> 00:48:46,010
is it a sign of manliness?
I have no idea. I mean,

811
00:48:46,011 --> 00:48:47,030
if you grow too quickly,

812
00:48:47,031 --> 00:48:50,210
it might be a sign of a hairy back and
that might take you out of the game.

813
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,370
Some women might be like, Oh,

814
00:48:52,371 --> 00:48:56,440
my dad had a beard in the subconsciously
that gets into them, you know? Oh yeah,

815
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:59,330
that reminds me of feeling safe with
my dad. And next thing you know,

816
00:48:59,331 --> 00:49:02,660
they're blowing you. Then they're like,
what the fuck did you, what happened?

817
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:05,270
Right. I Dunno.

818
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:11,230
Let's move onto the next question. That
was a hard one. I had no fucking idea.

819
00:49:11,231 --> 00:49:14,890
All right. Cheating Bitch,
girlfriend out. Geez there.

820
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,870
Hey you red face. Fuck.

821
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:22,303
Okay.

822
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:27,520
I don't know why I find that
shit so endearing. Um, so do you,

823
00:49:27,521 --> 00:49:28,354
what the Fuck's wrong with me?

824
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:31,870
Already about a month ago
I started dating this lady.

825
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:37,240
She seemed really quiet and pretty
innocent. After about a week, I realized,

826
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:42,040
I just pictured that woman in that Vince
Vaughn movie, the wedding crashes. Um,

827
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:45,490
whoever that actress was was fucking
hilarious in that movie. Anyways,

828
00:49:45,491 --> 00:49:49,870
after about a week, I realized that
her last boyfriend was a total freak,

829
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:56,170
like jeans, shorts and shit. Fuck,

830
00:49:56,171 --> 00:50:00,730
what do you mean freak like a
Weirdo or was fucking, you know,

831
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:06,490
having threesomes with this chick anyways,
like jeans, shorts and shit. Fuck.

832
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,210
So I did my best to just ignore
that and have fun together. I was,

833
00:50:10,211 --> 00:50:12,160
in my opinion, a great boyfriend to her.

834
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,000
I took her on a lot of dates and it
seemed like everything was perfect.

835
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:19,720
And this was my first girlfriend.
I'm only 16 and pretty introverted.

836
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:22,630
So having a girlfriend was a big
step for me. Yeah, that's huge.

837
00:50:22,631 --> 00:50:27,130
Good for you man. Anyways, after a
few weeks, she started acting weird.

838
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:31,700
One day at lunch she told me that our old
weird boyfriend and her had sex before

839
00:50:31,701 --> 00:50:36,290
school that day and they also had sex
a couple of other times while we were

840
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:40,220
going out. I didn't know what to
say and it really fucked me up.

841
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:44,540
She even said it wasn't her fault and
I shouldn't be mad. Oh, you know what?

842
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:49,541
I was actually going to give this girl
props for being mature enough to own up

843
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:50,900
to what the fuck she did.

844
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,360
And then she said that
don't be mad at me. Um,

845
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:59,150
after a fight I told her to fuck.

846
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:04,070
I told her to fuck and left. I
think fuck off is what you meant.

847
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:06,350
Cause she's already fucking
dude. You don't need to tell her.

848
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,720
You should have told him to less
fuck two x nay on the fuck a.

849
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:16,610
Um, she then started saying that it was
my fault. I don't know what I did wrong.

850
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,590
Oh, you poor Bastien you're only
16 years old. Right? So you didn't,

851
00:51:20,591 --> 00:51:24,920
you didn't have your deflector
shields up. Is that what it is?

852
00:51:24,921 --> 00:51:29,510
Did you say you was 16 right?
Fuck was that, I'm only 16. Okay.

853
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:33,650
So now everyone knows that school
because high school is bullshit.

854
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:38,120
Um, I know I, I'm now known by everyone,

855
00:51:38,121 --> 00:51:41,480
including my family as the guy
who got cheated on this bitch.

856
00:51:41,481 --> 00:51:43,010
Not only made me feel like shit,

857
00:51:43,011 --> 00:51:46,280
but also kind of ruined the whole
aspect of finding a nice girl.

858
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:50,660
I don't trust them and feel as
if I will never move on. Yeah.

859
00:51:50,661 --> 00:51:55,150
These are the catastrophic thoughts
you have when you're 16. Uh,

860
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:58,850
because your world is small. You still
live in an home with your parents.

861
00:51:58,851 --> 00:52:01,790
You go to school, you see the
same fucking cuts every day,

862
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,130
and you feel like the
walls are closing in.

863
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,970
All of these feelings are
100% normal. Um, how do you,

864
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:10,670
how do you move on after
being fucked over like that?

865
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:14,510
The only things I've done is got
a job and started lifting weights.

866
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:17,000
Maybe then when school starts again,

867
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:21,680
I can show up shredded and do better
next year. There you go. I like it.

868
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:26,510
Turn a negative into a positive. Um,
here's the thing. You're a nice guy,

869
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:30,110
right? You're a nice
guy. Uh, well, you know,

870
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:35,090
so that means there's the Nice woman
out there that balances you out,

871
00:52:35,091 --> 00:52:38,030
right? If you're a dick, there's
plenty of cops out there,

872
00:52:38,031 --> 00:52:41,780
but you're a nice guy. So
what I would do is, uh,

873
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:48,320
I would thank my lucky stars that that
fucking woman is out of your life.

874
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:52,790
You know, she's totally fucked up, right?

875
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,180
She's going to go back to the gene short
guy and they're going to fuck before

876
00:52:56,181 --> 00:53:00,290
school and they're going to do
all of this other shit. And, um,

877
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:04,070
who gives a fuck? I don't
understand how, like,

878
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:10,930
I don't know how, how there's no reason
for you just me listening to this,

879
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:16,420
why you should feel bad about yourself.
I, you know, I got cheated on,

880
00:53:16,421 --> 00:53:19,560
you know, it's happened
to everybody and uh,

881
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:23,800
it makes you just more feel stupid
is what it is. You know what I mean?

882
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:29,180
So I'm trying to count the amount
of times that's happening to me.

883
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:33,740
First girl I was with was like
fucking way older than me.

884
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:37,280
I went from like zero to 90
miles an hour in fucking,

885
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:41,360
Yup.

886
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:46,360
She ended up cheating on me and breaking
up a fucking marriage and a [inaudible]

887
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,393
.

888
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:48,773
Okay.

889
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:51,400
How did I, oh, I remember
how I, I didn't even know.

890
00:53:51,401 --> 00:53:56,401
I ended up running into the wife of the
guy that she cheated with and then they

891
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:02,100
will broken up and she told me, and

892
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:07,880
I just, my, just my, my thought,
which I just went like, Huh.

893
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:10,590
You know?

894
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:15,500
And there was a lot in that
because it just let me know that,

895
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:20,600
uh, you know, I just thought guys
did shit like that, you know,

896
00:54:20,601 --> 00:54:23,390
I thought we would just the fucking
animals. And it was just like, wow.

897
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:27,320
So she was doing that and they'd
come home and smile. Yeah.

898
00:54:27,321 --> 00:54:29,960
And that fucked me up for a long
fucking time. Yeah. You know what?

899
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,650
And I didn't trust women, you know?
And I started lifting weights.

900
00:54:33,651 --> 00:54:38,250
Did I write this thing 20 years ago?
What the fuck now? Um, yeah dude,

901
00:54:38,251 --> 00:54:40,640
this is the deal. You know, it's gonna
take time to get over it, but you know,

902
00:54:40,641 --> 00:54:42,710
you're gonna meet somebody
nice. And I think, yeah,

903
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,890
you're the prime of your life. You
throw the weights around a little bit,

904
00:54:45,891 --> 00:54:48,350
you show up fucking shredded. Right.

905
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:49,960
Okay.

906
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:50,531
And then you show,

907
00:54:50,531 --> 00:54:53,290
you show up in September and
just start chatting up the women.

908
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:58,540
And this is a thing too. Women love
a fucking, they love a project,

909
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:03,400
you know, so you can use the fact that
this woman cheated on you, that, oh,

910
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:07,410
you know, I have problems, trust in
fucking women and now they'll just help.

911
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:12,010
They'll be coming at you. You beat them
off with a fucking stick. All right?

912
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:14,020
Yeah Dude. Fuck that. This is the thing.

913
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:17,530
You don't have a letter anytime anything
bad happens in life, you don't have it.

914
00:55:17,531 --> 00:55:19,510
You don't let it. You don't,
there's two things you can do.

915
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:21,100
You can either just fucking,

916
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:22,893
yeah,

917
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:26,970
yeah, I dunno. I, I view liked those
types of thoughts. Like, you know,

918
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:30,330
when you watch like bugs bunny,
they would have like that, wait,

919
00:55:30,331 --> 00:55:33,180
that just said one ton
on it. I view like that.

920
00:55:33,181 --> 00:55:35,560
That's what that thought is all right.

921
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:40,270
And you're standing next to
a fucking pool. All right?

922
00:55:40,271 --> 00:55:43,780
And the thing's got a chain around it
and you either just fucking let it go to

923
00:55:43,781 --> 00:55:47,770
the bottom of the pool itself or you
stick your head in the chain and wrap it

924
00:55:47,771 --> 00:55:51,100
around your neck and you let it take it
down and then you just down there in the

925
00:55:51,101 --> 00:55:56,020
bottom of the pool. You know,
why would you do that? Fuck it.

926
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:02,390
Fuck fucker. Just let that whole thing,
I'm not saying don't deal with it,

927
00:56:02,391 --> 00:56:06,110
but you got to turn it into a positive,
which is what you seem to be doing.

928
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:11,330
Fucking work out and chat up a bunch of
women. This is thing maybe a, you know,

929
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:16,610
start your list of fucking
requirements. You test,

930
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,390
you lock the door test and maybe to
try to get a good one. Uh, you know,

931
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:24,400
women always say, find a good
finding a, a good man's hard to find.

932
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:25,600
So's a good woman.

933
00:56:25,601 --> 00:56:30,601
So what this woman did is a help
you start early on a checklist,

934
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:35,860
because I didn't start a checklist
for a long fucking time, you know,

935
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,430
I was well into my thirties and I was
still just like, hey, you want wanna fuck

936
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,220
every, all everything you do, everything
on my list is checked off. You know,

937
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:48,670
all, here we go. All time underrated
quarterbacks, you'll be fine.

938
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:52,840
You'll be fine. Shake it
off. It's fucking your fault.

939
00:56:52,841 --> 00:56:54,370
That's hilarious that that poor woman,

940
00:56:54,371 --> 00:56:57,940
she's got a lot of issues and I bet
she's has a terrible father, you know?

941
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:01,870
So in a way you can look at it like
that because you know she is young and

942
00:57:01,871 --> 00:57:04,720
immature, but if she continues to
live her life that way, that is,

943
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:08,560
that is a bad fucking
road to go on. You know,

944
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,730
that's fucking White Symphony
Dale's or the red wine,

945
00:57:12,731 --> 00:57:16,300
gray teeth with the fucking tramp
stamp. She's going to go down that one

946
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:19,900
girl and the piece of shit guys,

947
00:57:19,901 --> 00:57:23,290
she's going to meet Jean shorts
will be the least of her problems.

948
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:27,010
I hope that doesn't happen to her either.
But anyways, here we go. All time,

949
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:31,330
underrated. Qbs dear Billy White
shoes, Mary, nice reference.

950
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:37,170
Billy White shoes, Johns of the
Houston Oilers and the a [inaudible].

951
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:42,930
Alright by friends tear me apart for
being a huge Vinnie Testa Verde fan.

952
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:48,490
I truly loved the man and feel he
flies under the radar as an all time

953
00:57:48,491 --> 00:57:51,190
quarterback. Maybe not
hall of fame caliber,

954
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:55,120
but someone who could have won a super
bowl if he didn't have to face Elway.

955
00:57:55,121 --> 00:57:58,990
Tarell Davis in the 1998
Denver Bronco Machine.

956
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:01,760
Well, you realize what you're saying.

957
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:05,050
He could have been a championship if he
didn't have to play the best team in the

958
00:58:05,051 --> 00:58:08,680
league. Well, I mean, yeah, well shit.

959
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,830
San Diego Padres could be a fucking
dynasty if it wasn't for all the other of

960
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:18,910
the fucking 1998 Yankees, you know,
or the late nineties Yankees, right?

961
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,470
I don't know. Anyways,

962
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:25,990
he played 22 seasons and in his final
season with seasoned with the Carolina

963
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:26,530
Panthers,

964
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:30,910
he won his first game after only being
on the team for three fucking days at the

965
00:58:30,911 --> 00:58:33,520
age of 43 a he was definitely a bad ass.

966
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:38,350
Nobody could be in that backyard playing
horseshoes with their son and then out

967
00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:40,830
of football in two days
later be under arrest,

968
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,700
under center and fucking winning the game.

969
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:45,750
Like he did that like I think three
times in his career. He was sort of like,

970
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:47,650
maybe it just happened once, I don't know.

971
00:58:47,651 --> 00:58:51,250
But I just feel like he was officially
retired at least once, if not twice.

972
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:53,800
And he was in the backyard
eating a fucking Burger,

973
00:58:53,801 --> 00:58:56,980
having a chorus light and
all of a sudden, Hey Bernie,

974
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:01,090
this is the fucking whatever
Seattle Seahawks calling or Tampa.

975
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:04,960
But where did he play?
Tampa. The jets. Carolina.

976
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,240
That's a great one. Cleveland.

977
00:59:07,241 --> 00:59:10,960
And he played with Cleveland or was
that Bernie Coza I get, I get confused.

978
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:14,470
My older age. Let's look up
off any tests of verde vet a.

979
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:20,190
Then he had the fucking veal. All right,
you guys want to hear a great, uh,

980
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,930
you guys want to hear a
great fucking La Story.

981
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:26,720
I went out to an Italian
restaurant the other day, right?

982
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:29,240
And was sitting up front near
the bar and it was too loud.

983
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:32,600
And one of the guys I was eating with,
he goes, this is too fucking loud.

984
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:33,860
Let's try to get a table in the back.

985
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:38,540
So they end up hooking us up with a table
in the back and as I'm going to walk,

986
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:43,820
you know, to the back, one of the
guys there up to bar, he goes, yeah,

987
00:59:43,821 --> 00:59:44,571
go in the back. You know,

988
00:59:44,571 --> 00:59:47,570
you can barely hear yourself
thinking just the way he said it.

989
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:51,140
I can't remember what he said, but
he said something along those lines.

990
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,720
Super Italian guy. And the way he said it,

991
00:59:53,721 --> 00:59:56,120
and the fact that I was
moving as I went past him,

992
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:00,410
I felt like I was in that tracking scene
in Goodfellas when they was showing all

993
01:00:00,411 --> 01:00:03,560
those characters, you know, get
the papers, get the papers, a guy,

994
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:05,210
it guy took care of that thing, right?

995
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:09,080
Literally it gave me like
a shock the way he said it.

996
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,740
So I said to one of the guys that we
have, I was having dinner with. I said,

997
01:00:12,741 --> 01:00:13,760
Hey Mike, go Jesus Christ. Go.

998
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:18,710
That guy just made me feel like I
was in Goodfellas. Classic La Story.

999
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:23,270
And why it's so amazing to live out
here. He goes, do you know who that is?

1000
01:00:23,271 --> 01:00:26,150
And I said, no. He goes, that's the
guy who played Johnny roast beef,

1001
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:30,720
and then I fucking looked at him
again. I was like, oh my God,

1002
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:32,760
this Johnny Roast beef,

1003
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:37,020
one of the greatest pieces fucking acting
I've ever seen is when he's trying to

1004
01:00:37,021 --> 01:00:38,880
explain away that pink Cadillac,

1005
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:43,950
and he starts to stop and then then he
starts to talk and then he stops and

1006
01:00:43,951 --> 01:00:47,070
actually had, I talked to him about
it for a second and he just laughed.

1007
01:00:47,071 --> 01:00:50,100
He said, one basically said,

1008
01:00:50,101 --> 01:00:54,360
when a man is scary as Jimmy, the
gent is yelling at you. He goes,

1009
01:00:54,361 --> 01:00:57,150
you don't say a fucking word.
Remember that? No, it's,

1010
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:01,560
it's in my grandmother's name. What's
the matter with me? It's a matter of me.

1011
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:04,740
You're going to get us all fucking
pinch. That's why some matter with you,

1012
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:09,240
it's a matter with you. Take it back,
take it back at it. The fuck that.

1013
01:01:09,241 --> 01:01:14,200
Look on his fucking face. And he goes,
he just keeps going. I'm sorry. I

1014
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:15,733
okay.

1015
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:21,110
I'm sorry. What did I tell you?

1016
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:25,760
What did the fuck, what did I tell?
I fucking love that seat. So anyways,

1017
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:30,930
I'm Vinny Testaverde.
Here we go. Benny fork.

1018
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:35,930
Intense diversity over
Ovi. Um, here we go.

1019
01:01:35,931 --> 01:01:39,410
Vinny Testaverde. Let's see.
It was him with the panthers.

1020
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:43,130
He's 52 years old. I swear to
God. I bet he's still in shape.

1021
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:48,040
And if you fucking, if you, you
know, if you call them up right now,

1022
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:52,060
if you call him up right now, he give
you a decent outage. What the fuck?

1023
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:58,240
87 to 92 we played for
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

1024
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:03,130
93 to 95 he played for
the Cleveland browns.

1025
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:08,020
96 97, the Baltimore Ravens 98 to 2003,

1026
01:02:08,021 --> 01:02:12,040
the New York jets, which is
how I remember him as a jet.

1027
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:17,500
2004th, The Dallas Cowboys,
2005, he goes back to the jets.

1028
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,000
2006, he played for my patriots.
I don't even remember that.

1029
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:24,930
2007 he played for the panthers.

1030
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:32,470
20 year fucking career. 21
seasons. Wow. Two time pro bowler.

1031
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:35,770
96 98 Heisman trophy 86,

1032
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:39,650
uh, David O'Brian, but blah, blah.

1033
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:44,830
Sammy bar trophy sportsman
of the year 86 let's see,

1034
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:48,630
tds verse interceptions. This
is what fucked them over though.

1035
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,760
275 touchdowns,

1036
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:54,910
267 interceptions.

1037
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:59,590
Wasn't somebody rap like that in
incomplete like Testa Verde. Uh,

1038
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:04,620
but he didn't say intercepted but he
threw for 46,233 yards back in the day,

1039
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:05,771
you know,

1040
01:03:05,771 --> 01:03:09,640
for the most part when you actually
they could cover receivers before Jim or

1041
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,280
changed all the fucking rules cause
he couldn't beat the Patriots.

1042
01:03:12,281 --> 01:03:14,800
But that's okay. I know the
ball was under inflated.

1043
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,690
Let's kick them out of football.

1044
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:22,060
Passing rating pass passer rating
75.0 all right. Well yeah. Okay.

1045
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:25,000
Those are great. Fuck. You
know, you play 20 seasons,

1046
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:28,840
but he did throw a lot
of pics. So anyways, um,

1047
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:33,820
where he's the oldest quarterback to
ever start and when a pro football game,

1048
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:34,930
yeah,

1049
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:36,460
older than George Blanda.

1050
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,180
Okay.

1051
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:40,270
What? I thought George Blank, maybe
he was just kicking at that point.

1052
01:03:40,271 --> 01:03:44,620
Everybody always reverts back to the
days, his days in Tampa and Cleveland.

1053
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:49,420
But I'd argue that those Tampa years
where some of the worst pro squads ever to

1054
01:03:49,421 --> 01:03:52,090
trot on a football onto a
football field. Yeah, absolutely.

1055
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:55,360
You can't blame somebody for that.
You know, it's like Joey Harrington,

1056
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:00,800
he goes and he fucking plays
for, uh, the lions, you know,

1057
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:04,880
art right out of the gate. There is no
way as bad. He was as bad as he looked.

1058
01:04:04,881 --> 01:04:06,620
Those lion teams were fucking horrible.

1059
01:04:06,621 --> 01:04:09,050
I'm not saying that the guy would
have played in the league or whatever,

1060
01:04:09,051 --> 01:04:10,520
but you know,

1061
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:15,710
for the longest time if you got
drafted by the lions or the browns as,

1062
01:04:15,711 --> 01:04:18,440
as a quarterback, that was
a fucking death sentence,

1063
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,830
which is another brilliant
move that John Elway made.

1064
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:24,350
Cause when he got drafted by
the Baltimore Colts, he's like,

1065
01:04:24,351 --> 01:04:27,320
I'm not fucking going there and getting
the shit kicked out of me and I'll be

1066
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:31,010
out of football. I mean that
almost happened to Troy Aikman,

1067
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:35,960
Troy Aikman when he got
drafted by the fucking cowboys.

1068
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:39,890
So got the living shit kicked out of him
his first few years. If that continued,

1069
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:42,170
I mean that guy, he would
have been out of football.

1070
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:45,790
But fortunately the Herschel Walker trade
went down with Jimmy Johnson at deck

1071
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:50,060
cowboys. Right. They got that fucking, uh,

1072
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:56,170
all those 300 pounders in front
of them. I Dunno. Anyways,

1073
01:04:56,190 --> 01:05:00,770
let's plow ahead here. Uh,
he said as a patriots fan,

1074
01:05:00,771 --> 01:05:02,970
I'd like your thoughts on
him. Are My friends right?

1075
01:05:02,971 --> 01:05:06,860
Saying he was just an average
quarterback at best? No fucking way.

1076
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,250
No Way. No Way. He was, he was w a well,

1077
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,670
you don't play for 20
fucking years. Okay. He was,

1078
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:19,900
he was above way above average,
I think. I think he was a, a,

1079
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:24,750
he's not a, I wouldn't say he's one of
the greats, but he was definitely a, uh,

1080
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:29,500
he was a really good quarterback,
you know, he wasn't like, um,

1081
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:35,090
what does he, if he was, if
he was an average QB at best,

1082
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:36,590
you don't play for 20 years,

1083
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:40,850
be an average unless you're
Steve to Berg and just some out.

1084
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,580
You just look so great with
a headset and a clipboard.

1085
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:48,770
People just wanted you around. He was
like the David Hasselhoff, you know,

1086
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:51,020
a fucking quarterbacks. It just,

1087
01:05:51,021 --> 01:05:53,690
I think just sold more tickets
because he never had his helmet on.

1088
01:05:53,691 --> 01:05:57,320
The ladies could come down and look
at him. Look up Steve to Berg here.

1089
01:05:57,410 --> 01:06:01,400
Steve the Berg. All right.

1090
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:07,070
Oh yeah, the David Hasselhoff.
He looks like Eve's look like,

1091
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:11,330
you know, whenever they had those coming
of age movies and you got the Nerd,

1092
01:06:11,331 --> 01:06:13,310
who wants to date the fucking cheerleader,

1093
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:17,580
but she's dating the guy who's
just a complete fucking Dick. Uh,

1094
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:22,390
he had those, those
level good looks, dude.

1095
01:06:22,391 --> 01:06:25,570
I'm telling you right now. Look this
guy up. That's fucking hilarious.

1096
01:06:25,571 --> 01:06:30,330
He looks like he on Baywatch
played number 17 on.

1097
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:31,960
Now we got it out. This,
this, you know what?

1098
01:06:31,961 --> 01:06:35,740
This is actually morphed into the
greatest NFLs greatest journeymen.

1099
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:39,720
I'm going to look this up. Great is,

1100
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:45,760
Oh God, I love the Internet. I love that
somebody made a page about this shit.

1101
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,950
Best NFL journeymen,

1102
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,430
the seven most unkillable
journeyman quarterbacks.

1103
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:58,190
I love the Internet because of shit
like this and all the fucking free porn.

1104
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,740
All right, here we go. Um,

1105
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:04,030
there's a good chance that
at one time or another,

1106
01:07:04,031 --> 01:07:08,830
your team's hopes were riding on
Ryan Fitzpatrick, Brian Hoyer,

1107
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:12,160
or one of the NFLs other
well-traveled signal callers. Oh,

1108
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:16,330
don't be all just new guys. Come
on. All right. Ryan Fitzpatrick,

1109
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:23,290
Brian Fitzpatrick, a played for the
Texans, the titans, the rams, the Bengals,

1110
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:27,970
the jets, and the bills.
All right. Josh mccown.

1111
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:35,500
Uh, Brian Hoyer. Uh, Know
Matt Castle. Matt Castle,

1112
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:39,670
Matt Flynn, the perennial
backups. I'll come on, man.

1113
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:44,360
Tim Tebow. Now this, this
was done by some youngster.

1114
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:48,620
You've got to have Steve to Bergen there.
You've got to have any tests of Verde

1115
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:54,330
journeyman, NFL players
who just won't go away.

1116
01:07:57,170 --> 01:08:00,440
Do I have to type in all time?
Is that what I have to do?

1117
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:01,730
Okay.

1118
01:08:01,730 --> 01:08:04,630
I think I got to type in all time.
Come on, man. You've got to, if, if,

1119
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:06,920
if Steve burst not on your fucking list.

1120
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:13,440
B's not on your fucking list.
Journeyman quarterback. All right,

1121
01:08:13,441 --> 01:08:16,430
we'll just go Wikipedia.
Oh, this is depressing.

1122
01:08:16,431 --> 01:08:17,600
I thought it was going to be great.

1123
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:19,290
Okay.

1124
01:08:19,290 --> 01:08:24,290
J T O'Sullivan played for 12
professional teams during his career.

1125
01:08:26,650 --> 01:08:28,450
You know what? I bet in his
man cave, he should, they,

1126
01:08:28,451 --> 01:08:30,880
the NFL should give him
all 12 of those helmets.

1127
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:34,930
All 12 of those fucking helmets. Am
I all wrapped up in the fucking here?

1128
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:35,773
What's going on?

1129
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:37,103
Okay.

1130
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:39,600
All right. Here we go.

1131
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,260
This is what happens when you fucking
lay down on a couch and there's why is,

1132
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:46,770
um, JT O'Sullivan,

1133
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:52,920
he played on no less than 11 to NFL
teams. Oh, professionals. Okay. So,

1134
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,750
and then he also played for the
Saskatchewan rough riders in the Frankfurt

1135
01:08:57,750 --> 01:08:58,583
Galaxy.

1136
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:02,910
Chris Chandler holds the record for
starting a game for the highest number of

1137
01:09:02,911 --> 01:09:07,410
different NFL teams with
eight. Also, he started okay.

1138
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:12,150
There's no accepted definition
or threshold at which a
person is regarded as a

1139
01:09:12,151 --> 01:09:16,530
journeyman quarterback. Um, the term
is descriptive rather than definitive.

1140
01:09:16,531 --> 01:09:21,531
David Craig enjoyed 11 stable careers
with the Seahawks before leaving.

1141
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:27,060
Let's see, mark rip, Ian Notable
examples. Here we go. Here we go.

1142
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:32,190
Trent Dilfer, Brad Johnson, rich Gannon.

1143
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:37,280
What the fuck is Steve to Berg?
Notable journeyman quarterbacks.

1144
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:43,500
Tough. Come on, come on.

1145
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:45,720
Yeah.

1146
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,350
All right. You know, I'm just gonna
look up Steve Debark. I'm sorry guys.

1147
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:51,440
This whole podcast just you just listened
to me surf the fucking Internet now

1148
01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:51,690
too.

1149
01:09:51,690 --> 01:09:56,160
People still say surf the internet or is
that from the nineties I'm old already.

1150
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:57,470
He's 62 years old.

1151
01:09:58,790 --> 01:10:03,790
He played for the San Francisco 40 niners
from 1977 to 1980 the Broncos from 81

1152
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:10,301
to 83 the Buccaneers from 84 to 87
the chiefs from 88 to 91 back to the

1153
01:10:11,781 --> 01:10:15,080
Buccaneers. 92 93 the Miami Dolphins,

1154
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:20,500
1993 he was out of fucking football in
94 he was out of football in 95 out of

1155
01:10:23,181 --> 01:10:27,260
football, 96 out of football,
97 and then what the fuck?

1156
01:10:27,261 --> 01:10:31,640
1998 he's back with the dirty birds.

1157
01:10:31,641 --> 01:10:36,170
The Atlanta Falcons who upset
the 15 and one Minnesota Vikings.

1158
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:40,250
Right. And then went to
the fucking super bowl,

1159
01:10:40,251 --> 01:10:43,100
one of the most forgettable
Superbowls of all fucking time.

1160
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:44,653
Okay.

1161
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:50,040
When the Denver Broncos repeated who I
was the last fucking game of John Elway's

1162
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:54,300
career, all right. TDS to interceptions,

1163
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:58,590
he had 196 touchdowns
versus 204 interceptions.

1164
01:10:58,591 --> 01:10:59,970
He threw for 34,000,

1165
01:10:59,971 --> 01:11:04,971
241 yards and as a higher QB rating
than Vinny Testaverde it's 74.2.

1166
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:08,970
Right? Or was he 75? I
don't fucking remember.

1167
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:14,880
Steven Lee. Roy [inaudible].
There you, that's, that's my, um,

1168
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:18,640
that's my vote. You know,

1169
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:22,090
it's funny like I bet he doesn't have a
lot of problems walking or anything like

1170
01:11:22,091 --> 01:11:27,091
that cause he just got so he has a low
miles on that odometer as far as like

1171
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,310
actually playing in the fall. I'm
not trying to insult the guy here.

1172
01:11:30,311 --> 01:11:34,310
I'm just saying like if he was
a car, you know, it'd be like a,

1173
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:37,840
those are all original
miles. It'd be a, yeah. Yeah.

1174
01:11:37,841 --> 01:11:40,840
He sat in a garage with a fucking
clipboard for all those years. All right.

1175
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:44,290
That's the podcast for
this, uh, this 4th of July.

1176
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:48,100
I hope you guys all have a
happy and a safe one. All right.

1177
01:11:48,130 --> 01:11:49,450
You fucking drunks.

1178
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:53,170
I know it's a fireworks and
it's supposed to be fun,

1179
01:11:53,171 --> 01:11:56,920
but you know they are
explosives. Don't be that person

1180
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:03,420
in one of those youtube fucking videos
of like top 10 stupidest fucking moves

1181
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,370
done with fireworks. Did
you see that fucking guy?

1182
01:12:06,371 --> 01:12:10,150
He actually took like a mortar
or some shit, put it on his head.

1183
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:12,100
I don't know if he thought
it was going to take off.

1184
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:16,120
He literally blew himself up. His
friends go. You don't understand.

1185
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:20,560
There was nothing left of him.
There was nothing left to help.

1186
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:25,260
You know? They just showed
up and there was Jay.

1187
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:29,600
There was like a belt buckle and
like a shoelace. He was gone.

1188
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:34,280
So please don't do that to yourselves.
All right? All right, cleo.

1189
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:38,180
Um, all right, that's the podcast.
