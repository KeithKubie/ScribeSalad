I'm Jaye Watson.

This is a show where
we explore the mysteries

00:00:20.686 --> 00:00:23.756 align:start size:88% position:13% line:83%
and the science of
the amazing human brain.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.392 line:83%
Jamie Dupree has been a
radio news correspondent

00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:28.027 line:92%
for over 30 years.

00:00:28.127 --> 00:00:30.196
He's covered politics
in our nation's capital

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:31.831
most of that time.

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:35.268 align:start size:84% position:16%
And then two years ago,
he lost his voice.

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:37.870 align:start size:88% position:13%
The very tool that
helped him make a living.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.939 align:start size:88% position:13%
Since then,
he has been on a journey

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:43.243 align:start size:84% position:16%
to get his voice,
and his old life, back.

<i> (Jaye)

<i>(laughing)</i>

<i> of disorders known
 as the Dystonias.</i>

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:09.822 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
Somehow, the brain
gets the signal wrong,

00:03:09.922 --> 00:03:12.492 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
and it sort of
overdoes the movement.

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:14.893 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
So the muscles
contract too strong.

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:16.662 line:0%
They occasionally
go into spasm.

00:03:16.762 --> 00:03:18.598 align:start position:0%
He had-had...

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.466 align:start size:72% position:28%
<i> (Dr. Jinnah)
 Mr. Dupree,
 when he speaks,</i>

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:23.268 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> his tongue is doing
 way more than it should.</i>

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:24.603
It's contracting,
it's going up,

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:26.372
it's going out,
it's going down,

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:29.608 align:start size:88% position:13%
and it shouldn't
be doing all that stuff.

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.511 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> (Jaye)
 Dystonia is the third most
 common movement disorder</i>

00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:35.214
<i> behind tremor and
 Parkinson's disease,</i>

00:03:35.314 --> 00:03:39.485 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> but Jamie's dystonia is rare
 and difficult to treat.</i>

00:03:39.585 --> 00:03:41.420 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> Scientists know that
 dystonia begins</i>

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.688
<i> in the regions
 of the brain</i>

00:03:42.788 --> 00:03:44.857 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> involved
 movement control.</i>

00:03:44.957 --> 00:03:48.161 align:start size:91% position:9% line:76%
<i> This motor circuit
 includes the motor cortex,</i>

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:50.796 align:start size:78% position:22% line:76%
<i> cerebellum,
 and basal ganglia.</i>

00:03:50.896 --> 00:03:54.033 line:76%
<i> Exactly where dystonia
 begins is not known.</i>

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:57.303
<i> It can be genetic,</i>

00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:59.606 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> and sometimes triggered
 by an event.</i>

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:01.974
<i> In Jamie's case, he got
 sick on a family vacation</i>

00:04:02.074 --> 00:04:05.211 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> to England, and says
 it morphed into a heart event,</i>

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:08.013
<i> an a trip to the ER
 when he got back home.</i>

00:04:08.113 --> 00:04:11.184 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> After that,
 his voice faded away.</i>

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:14.620 align:start size:91% position:9%
We believe that it's
something you were born with,

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.324 align:start size:72% position:28%
a tendency
to be at risk for this.

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:19.926 align:start size:66% position:34%
But you weren't gonna
develop the problem

00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:21.928 align:start size:66% position:34%
until you got exposed
to something else,

00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:23.930 align:start size:66% position:34% line:83%
which could have been
that virus.

00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:23.930 align:start size:78% position:22%
Mm-hmm.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.131 align:start size:59% position:41%
And then those
two things together

00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:29.268 size:78% position:61%
are what triggered the
evolution of the problem,

00:04:29.368 --> 00:04:31.604 align:start size:66% position:34%
so it's not the virus
by itself.

00:04:31.704 --> 00:04:34.674 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> (Jaye)
 People like Dupree,
 who use their voice a lot,</i>

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:37.509 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> develop this type
 of dystonia more often.</i>

00:04:37.609 --> 00:04:39.311 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> Again, it's a bit
 of a mystery,</i>

00:04:39.411 --> 00:04:41.814 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> but it's something about
 repetitive use</i>

00:04:41.914 --> 00:04:45.184 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> that can predispose things
 to go awry.</i>

00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:47.319 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> An expert patient
 at this point,</i>

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.989 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> Dupree asked Dr. Jinnah
 for the bottom line.</i>

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:51.090 align:start size:16% position:84%
Yeah.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.992 align:start size:44% position:56%
Yeah, so the
bottom line...

00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:55.261 align:start size:72% position:28%
The bottom line is that
I would call this

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:56.629 align:start size:63% position:38%
a segmental dystonia

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.831 align:start size:59% position:41%
that involves your-
your voice box,

00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:00.333 align:start size:41% position:59%
your pharynx,
and probably

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:02.434 align:start size:53% position:47%
your tongue
and lips as well.

00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:05.605 align:start size:72% position:28%
Uh, and this problem is
challenging to treat

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:08.607 align:start size:56% position:44%
with any of the
available options.

00:05:08.707 --> 00:05:10.976 align:start size:59% position:41%
These options would
include medicines,

00:05:11.077 --> 00:05:13.445 align:start size:41% position:59%
and there are
a few others
we could try.

00:05:13.545 --> 00:05:16.649 align:start size:81% position:19%
Botulinum toxin injections
into the tongue,

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:19.986 align:start size:63% position:38%
uh, and deep brain
stimulation surgery.

00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:21.854 align:start size:84% position:16%
So those are the three
options that we would have.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.794 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> (Jaye)
 Dupree opts to have
 botulinum toxin injections.</i>

00:05:28.894 --> 00:05:32.165 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> The most common botulinum
 toxin is botox.</i>

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:34.166 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> The injections
 will be in his tongue</i>

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:36.869 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> to try to relax and
 help with the thrusting.</i>

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:38.404
Uh, it may help you...

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:40.006 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> (Jaye)
 Dr. Jinnah has told him,</i>

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:43.476 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> his chances of improvement
 are 50% or less.</i>

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:45.611 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> (Dr. Jinnah)
 But we certainly
 can't promise anything.</i>

00:05:45.711 --> 00:05:47.846 align:start size:88% position:13%
When it's in your tongue,
very hard to treat

00:05:47.946 --> 00:05:50.649 align:start size:91% position:9%
because the tongue is
such a complicated muscle.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.185
Uh, we don't think about
the tongue as a muscle,

00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:53.619
but it really is.

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:55.388
It's a complicated muscle,

00:05:55.488 --> 00:05:58.857 align:start size:97% position:3%
uh, and so to get the medicine
exactly in the right place

00:05:58.957 --> 00:06:00.326 align:start size:75% position:25%
at the right dose
is hard.

00:06:00.426 --> 00:06:02.294 align:start position:0%
<i>(Jaye)
That just putting something
in there helps you speak?</i>

00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:03.595 align:start size:41% position:59%
Toothpick.

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:05.097 align:start position:0%
<i>Toothpick.</i>

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:06.331 align:start size:41% position:59%
Just one.

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:09.268 align:start size:69% position:31%
You know, if I get in
there, it will sort of

00:06:09.368 --> 00:06:12.872 align:start size:72% position:28%
move stuff around,
and I can hold my mouth

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:15.541 align:start size:69% position:31%
maybe a different way,

00:06:15.641 --> 00:06:17.676 align:start size:56% position:44%
and, uh,
a little more out.

00:06:17.776 --> 00:06:19.711 align:start position:0%
<i>But something larger
works even better?</i>

00:13:59.738 --> 00:14:01.039
<i> Writer's cramp
 is most common</i>

00:14:01.139 --> 00:14:03.875
<i> because most people write.</i>

00:14:03.976 --> 00:14:05.643 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> In terms of
 musicians cramp,</i>

00:14:05.744 --> 00:14:08.480
<i> piano player's cramp

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.415 align:start size:84% position:16%

<i> Uh, it isn't painful.</i>

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.236 align:start size:78% position:22%
Writer's cramp,
or musician's cramp

00:14:31.336 --> 00:14:32.904
is a cramp
in the brain.

00:14:33.004 --> 00:14:34.539
It's not a cramp
in the muscle.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.609 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> Focal dystonia
 is a problem of the brain,</i>

00:14:37.709 --> 00:14:40.779 align:start size:78% position:22%

 the brain's control</i>

00:14:40.879 --> 00:14:42.680
<i> of the muscles.</i>

00:14:42.781 --> 00:14:45.183 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> Obviously,
 when people move,</i>

00:14:45.283 --> 00:14:47.886
<i> those, uh, commands
 to make movements</i>

00:14:47.986 --> 00:14:49.655
<i> come from the brain.</i>

00:14:49.755 --> 00:14:52.123 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> Uh, mediated through
 the spinal cord,</i>

00:14:52.223 --> 00:14:54.759
<i> so the brain sends signals
 down to the spinal cord,</i>

00:14:54.859 --> 00:14:57.629 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> the spinal cord
 sends signals to the muscle,</i>

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.799 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> uh, to cause
 the contraction.</i>

00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:02.801 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> In dystonia,
 if you look at the brain,</i>

00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:04.503
<i> at least superficially,</i>

00:15:04.603 --> 00:15:06.338 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> it looks normal,
 so, uh,</i>

00:15:06.438 --> 00:15:10.843 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> it's not easy to say,
 well, there is the problem.</i>

00:15:10.943 --> 00:15:12.945 align:start size:84% position:16%
We can see that
there are abnormalities

00:15:13.045 --> 00:15:14.579
in the basal ganglia.

00:15:14.679 --> 00:15:18.250 align:start size:88% position:13%
These are the deep,
deep nuclei in the brain,

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.787
and, uh, we have evidence,
for example, that there is

00:15:21.887 --> 00:15:25.356 align:start size:78% position:22%
an abnormality
of dopamine release

00:15:25.456 --> 00:15:27.759 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> in the basal ganglia
 with movement.</i>

00:15:27.859 --> 00:15:29.394
There are abnormalities also

00:15:29.495 --> 00:15:31.496 align:start size:88% position:13%
in other
neurotransmitter systems

00:15:31.596 --> 00:15:33.332
such as, uh, GABA,

00:15:33.432 --> 00:15:35.967 align:start size:84% position:16%
which is an inhibitory
neurotransmitter.

00:15:36.067 --> 00:15:39.805
So we are beginning
to identify problems.

00:15:39.905 --> 00:15:42.808
<i> The best treatment options
 that we have at the moment,</i>

00:15:42.908 --> 00:15:45.377
<i> uh, relate to
 focal injections</i>

00:15:45.477 --> 00:15:47.345
<i> of botulinum neurotoxin,</i>

00:15:47.445 --> 00:15:49.214 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> and so it's
 a symptomatic treatment.</i>

00:15:49.314 --> 00:15:52.884
It is not an ideological
treatment for the disorder,

00:15:52.984 --> 00:15:55.787
but it can help.

00:15:55.888 --> 00:15:57.156 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> There are some people
 that are probably</i>

00:15:57.256 --> 00:16:00.125
<i> predisposed to this.</i>

00:16:00.225 --> 00:16:02.594 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> Dystonia like almost
 anything else</i>

00:16:02.694 --> 00:16:04.496
<i> is not a single cause.</i>

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:06.465
<i> There are probably
 multiple causes.</i>

<i> the hippocampus and the

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.217
It builds on a theory

that the reason
our sense of smell evolved

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.288
is for navigation

00:17:03.388 --> 00:17:06.057
since animals rely on

The hypothesis behind it,

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:27.559 align:start position:0%

 The students then listen
 to the song "Strange Fruit,"</i>

00:20:51.582 --> 00:20:55.654 align:start position:0%
<i>made famous when
Billie Holiday sang it in 1939.</i>

00:20:55.754 --> 00:20:57.722 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> It's a song
 that waxes poetic</i>

00:20:57.822 --> 00:21:00.325
<i> about scenes of
 the gallant South,</i>

00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:02.694
<i> but the title,
 "Strange Fruit,"</i>

00:21:02.794 --> 00:21:06.931
<i> refers to what's hanging
 from the poplar trees.</i>

00:21:07.031 --> 00:21:12.471
<i> ♪ Black bodies swinging
 in the sullen breeze ♪</i>

00:21:14.806 --> 00:21:16.775 align:start position:0% line:83%
You're talking about a man
who's been murdered,

00:21:16.875 --> 00:21:22.247 align:start position:0% line:83%
and, you know,
he's just strange fruit?

<i> (Jaye)
 New York City school teacher
 Abel Meeropol</i>

00:21:24.749 --> 00:21:28.386 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> wrote the song about the
 1930 lynching of Thomas Shipp</i>

00:21:28.486 --> 00:21:31.823 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> and Abram Smith,
 the visceral contrast</i>

00:21:31.923 --> 00:21:34.792 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> between the beauty
 and cruelty of the South</i>

00:21:34.893 --> 00:21:38.496 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> speaks to the contrast
 within all of us.</i>

00:21:38.596 --> 00:21:40.831 align:start position:0%
The very ugly sides
of human nature.

00:21:40.932 --> 00:21:44.903 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> (Dr. Furman)
 And-and how absolutely
 intertwined they are.</i>

00:21:45.003 --> 00:21:48.473 align:start size:84% position:16%
Stories are enormously
complicated.

00:21:48.573 --> 00:21:50.442
<i> Enormously so.</i>

00:21:50.542 --> 00:21:54.146
And we need to wrestle with
all of those complications,

00:21:54.246 --> 00:21:57.715 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> and this song says
 look deeper,</i>

00:21:57.816 --> 00:21:59.150
<i> look deeper,
 look deeper.</i>

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:02.087
<i> Literally look at
 the roots of things.</i>

00:22:02.187 --> 00:22:04.689 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> We need to
 continually do that.</i>

<i> (Jaye)
 As the semester
 draws to a close,</i>

The humanities play
a role in your life.

I think that what this course
has allowed us to do

00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:19.771 align:start size:78% position:22% line:0%
is explore stories
in a way,

00:22:19.871 --> 00:22:22.473 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
and listen for stories
more than-

00:22:22.573 --> 00:22:24.175 line:0%
than, sort of through
our routine training

00:22:24.275 --> 00:22:25.944 line:0%
that we receive.

00:22:26.044 --> 00:22:28.046 align:start position:0%
I feel like we can
find a human story,

00:22:28.146 --> 00:22:30.181 align:start position:0%
um, everywhere.

00:22:30.281 --> 00:22:33.552 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> (Jaye)
 The arts don't just help
 make better physicians.</i>

00:22:33.652 --> 00:22:37.656 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> They can make for a better,
 deeper human experience</i>

00:22:37.756 --> 00:22:41.159 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> in a world
 where nothing is simple.</i>

00:22:41.259 --> 00:22:42.460 align:start position:0%
Going home
and reading a poem,

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.162 align:start position:0%
or going to an art museum
and seeing an art--

00:22:44.262 --> 00:22:45.363 align:start position:0%
or going-- seeing art.

00:22:45.463 --> 00:22:47.899 align:start position:0%
Or going to-to a play
and-and seeing that,

00:22:47.999 --> 00:22:49.834 align:start position:0%
or listening to music,

00:22:49.934 --> 00:22:52.604 size:81% position:41%
if you really sort of try
to involve yourself in it,

00:22:52.704 --> 00:22:54.705 align:start position:0%
it helps you look at
the world in different,

00:22:54.805 --> 00:22:57.942 align:start position:0%
more complex,
more nuanced sorts of ways,

00:22:58.043 --> 00:22:59.544 align:start position:0%
and I come from
a position where

00:22:59.644 --> 00:23:02.347 align:start position:0%
complexity and nuances
is really important.

00:23:02.447 --> 00:23:05.050 size:88% position:44%
I think making things simple
doesn't often help things.

00:23:06.151 --> 00:23:08.286
Life is moving
faster than ever.

00:23:08.386 --> 00:23:10.455 align:start size:78% position:22%
With technology
at our fingertips,

00:23:10.555 --> 00:23:12.690 align:start size:81% position:19%
and often in front of
our faces,

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:13.692 align:start size:75% position:25%
it can sometimes
feel like

00:23:13.792 --> 00:23:15.793 align:start size:88% position:13%
we're skimming over
the surface of our lives

00:23:15.893 --> 00:23:17.428
at warp speed.

00:23:17.528 --> 00:23:20.364
Investing time and
attention in a book,

00:23:20.465 --> 00:23:22.967 align:start size:78% position:22%
or a piece of art,
or music,

00:23:23.067 --> 00:23:25.770
is an investment
that gives a return

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:28.005
by helping us better
connect with others

00:23:28.105 --> 00:23:29.741
and ourselves.

00:23:29.841 --> 00:23:31.543
That's gonna do it
for us this week.

00:23:31.643 --> 00:23:34.813
We'll see you next time
on "Your Fantastic Mind."
