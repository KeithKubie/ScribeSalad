00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:10.840
The Soviet Superman Red Son

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.030
If you’ve ever sat around thinking, “What
if Superman was a communist?”

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.490
(Who hasn’t, right?)

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.770
Well, wonder no more.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.450
The answer was masterfully provided in Superman:
Red Son written by famed comic book writer

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.460
and member of the “Most Excellent Order
of the British Empire”, Mark Millar.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.700
The specific comic book in question was a
mini-series (3 issues) published by DC Comics

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.200
in 2003 and is a true gem of comic art.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.160
For this mini-series, Millar came up with
a unique and brilliant concept.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.829
In his own words,

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.430
Instead of landing in Kansas as a child, I’ve
decided to explore what could have happened

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.530
if his rocket would have landed on a collective
farm in the Soviet Union.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.690
Instead of working for the Daily Planet, he’ll
be a reporter for Pravda.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.289
There’s a reversal of the current situation,
this time it’s the U.S.A. that’s splitting

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:05.400
up with Georgia and Louisiana demanding independence
– tanks rolling through the streets of New

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.400
Orleans.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.390
I’ll be including a whole bunch of DC characters,
like Batman and Green Lantern – who you’ll

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.020
see in a new light.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.090
What inspired Millar to write such a version
of Superman’s history?

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.670
Red Son is based on a thought that flitted
through my head when I read Superman #300

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.399
as a six year old.

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.759
It was an imaginary story where Superman’s
rocket landed in neutral waters between the

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.560
USA and the USSR and both sides were rushing
to claim the baby.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.709
As a kid growing up in the shadow of the Cold
War, the notion of what might have happened

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:44.069
if the Soviets had reached him first just
seemed fascinating to me.

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:49.030
As I got older, I started putting everything
together and I first pitched something to

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.189
DC when I was thirteen, I think – although
it was in a much cruder form, of course, and

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.929
my drawings weren’t quite up to scratch.

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.789
With time and a lot of hard work, Millar gained
significant experience , which allowed him

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.160
to, after a decade in the business, finally
publish Superman: Red Son.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.750
Reading the comic book today, one can tell
that Millar never varied (significantly) from

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.969
his original idea for the story.

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:18.170
In the story, Superman indeed lands in the
Ukraine and not in Kansas.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.530
He was raised as a proud Soviet, who was taught
to love and serve the communist principals

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.120
of the Soviet Union, but he’s still the
same compassionate, fair, courageous and fearless

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.330
superhero who loves humanity more than anything.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.150
He still obeys his super hearing and responds
to every call for help.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.769
His favorite “habit” remains saving lives.

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.370
Despite the similarities, however, there are
significant differences that can’t go unnoticed.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.510
For example, he is not the geeky journalist
that we expect him to be.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.819
Instead, he becomes a high ranking officer
of the Communist Army.

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.209
His identity is not simply a private secret
he hides, but a state secret that the government

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.150
of his country helps him hide.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.379
His uniform doesn’t carry the popular Superman
shield and, instead, carries the symbol of

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.050
the communist Soviet Union: The hammer and
sickle.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.090
Superman is not fighting for “truth, justice,
and the American Way” and, instead, is “the

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.659
champion of the common worker who fights a
never-ending battle for Stalin, socialism

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.129
and the international expansion of the Warsaw
Pact.”

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:26.620
Indeed, at a certain point during the story,
Superman becomes the undisputed leader of

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.980
the Soviet Union and then the world.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.010
Another relevant difference is Lois Luthor
-yes Luthor- the first lady of the United

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.400
States, married to Lex Luthor, who is still
an amoral genius and remains Superman’s

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.660
#1 enemy.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.829
As for the end of the story?

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.739
I recommend you read it because it’s fantastic.

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.810
But if you just want the gist of it instead
of hours of entertainment, major spoiler alert

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:50.810
ahead.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.670
Briefly, eventually Superman realizes his
world conquest is wrong and tries to turn

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.779
back, but is attacked by one he thought was
his ally.

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:01.220
This supervillain is defeated by Luthor.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.209
In the meantime, Superman ends up saving the
world by taking said supervillain’s ship,

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.610
which is powered by singularities that are
about to collapse, out into space where the

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.099
singularities do, indeed, collapse.

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.709
At this point, it would seem Superman is dead.

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.310
Luthor takes back over creating a world-wide
United States and our planet is at peace.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.960
Thanks to medical advancements, Luthor is
able to live for many centuries.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.530
When he does die, Superman in the guise of
a more traditional Clark Kent attends Luthor’s

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.530
funeral.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.530
Here’s the twist.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.120
Fast-forward billions of years and the Earth
is being destroyed by the Sun in its Red Giant

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.120
phase.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.979
That’s when one of Lex Luthor’s descendents,
Jor-L, puts his son in a rocket.

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:58.620
After his journey, his son, Kal-L, ends up
landing in the Ukraine 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.949
in 1938.
