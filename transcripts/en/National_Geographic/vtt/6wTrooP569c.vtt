00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.059
the watch list also known as the

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.549
terrorist screening database is used by

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.190
US intelligence agencies to nominate

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.400
people as known or suspected terrorists

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.890
over the past 15 years the list has

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.949
grown from a few thousand to more than 1

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.320
million names but the most troubling

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.269
fact is that leaked documents revealed

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.910
that forty percent of the names on the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.090
list had no established ties to

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.740
recognize terrorist organizations so why

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.000
are these people on the list

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.730

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.700
mehar are is a syrian-born Canadian

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.200
citizen he was stopped at JFK Airport in

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.220
New York when returning from a family

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.530
vacation in Tunisia in 2002 I was

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.010
traveling back from Tunis to Montreal I

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.260
had to transfer the FK I was integrated

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.000
by the FBI for long hours I was

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.979
eventually taken to the Metropolitan

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.320
Detention Center and accused of being a

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.470
member of al-qaeda they refused to show

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.300
me any evidence of that and I kept

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.100
asking for a lawyer to make a phone call

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.960
they would never allow me to do that and

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.360
then all of a sudden in the middle of

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.700
the night they came in and took me to

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.170
private jet and they shipped me off to

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.600
Jordan like a parcel the US government

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.369
sent Ma her to Jordan where he was then

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.720
transported under duress to his

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.180
birthplace of Syria and imprisoned for

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.610
ten agonizing months separated from his

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.340
wife and children maha was tortured

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.590
beaten and kept in a 3 by 6 foot jail

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:49.290
cell I call it the coffin now if it's

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.840
that that white exactly that white and

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.049
about 60 feet deep and about seven feet

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.200
high it's an underground completely dark

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:02.250
there was just a little bit of opening

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:07.799
and the top I'll be honest with you that

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:13.019
cell was more mental torture than the

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:16.290
physical torture and I don't know how

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:18.750
survived that it was awful i had the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.459
breakdowns in that place i I think I

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.980
thought I was gonna die I thought I was

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.780
just that's it for me I always say when

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.019
I talk about your case my hair our was

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.180
kidnapped he has JFK Airport yes i was i

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.030
was literally kidnapped by state agents

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.739
I think they just used the the law to go

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.880
around the law that's what it is a

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:41.519
Canadian investigation determined ma her

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.050
was completely innocent and that the

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.760
mistake was based on faulty intelligence

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.860
in this country i think we think of

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.320
ourselves as this incredibly free

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.330
society but i think few americans are

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.670
aware of the fact that there's a secret

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.500
justice system where you're not allowed

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.240
to know the rules you're not even

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.560
allowed to know why you've been put on a

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.560
terror watch list
