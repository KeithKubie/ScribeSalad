00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.950 align:start position:0%
everyday classes and so so I think those
are<00:06:45.740><c> two</c><00:06:46.610><c> important</c><00:06:47.150><c> ways</c><00:06:47.270><c> then</c><00:06:47.660><c> the</c><00:06:47.810><c> third</c>

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
are two important ways then the third
 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.860 align:start position:0%
are two important ways then the third
one<00:06:48.020><c> would</c><00:06:48.440><c> just</c><00:06:48.680><c> be</c><00:06:48.890><c> what</c><00:06:49.610><c> we</c><00:06:49.790><c> do</c><00:06:50.000><c> in</c><00:06:50.270><c> terms</c><00:06:50.540><c> of</c>

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870 align:start position:0%
one would just be what we do in terms of
 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.180 align:start position:0%
one would just be what we do in terms of
bringing<00:06:51.140><c> in</c><00:06:53.200><c> outside</c><00:06:54.200><c> speakers</c><00:06:54.740><c> and</c><00:06:55.040><c> through</c>

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:55.190 align:start position:0%
bringing in outside speakers and through
 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
bringing in outside speakers and through
our<00:06:55.340><c> club</c><00:06:55.580><c> activities</c><00:06:56.210><c> like</c><00:06:56.419><c> we</c><00:06:56.570><c> have</c><00:06:56.690><c> the</c>

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810 align:start position:0%
our club activities like we have the

our club activities like we have the

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330 align:start position:0%
global corporate responsibility group so
 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
global corporate responsibility group so
i<00:06:59.360><c> think</c><00:06:59.690><c> it's</c><00:06:59.870><c> the</c><00:06:59.960><c> way</c><00:07:00.290><c> that</c><00:07:00.500><c> we</c><00:07:00.650><c> try</c><00:07:00.919><c> to</c><00:07:00.950><c> as</c><00:07:01.460><c> i</c>

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:01.610 align:start position:0%
i think it's the way that we try to as i
 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.460 align:start position:0%
i think it's the way that we try to as i

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 align:start position:0%
would be a good idea to to tie bonuses
 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.510 align:start position:0%

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
to to specific performance goals I think
 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.820 align:start position:0%
to to specific performance goals I think
and<00:07:22.060><c> that's</c><00:07:22.270><c> something</c><00:07:22.539><c> which</c><00:07:23.139><c> seemingly</c><00:07:23.530><c> has</c>

these kind of performance metrics so I

00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
think incentive pay in general is not a
