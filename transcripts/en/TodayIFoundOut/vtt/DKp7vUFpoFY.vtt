00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:46.090
As you may know, naturally created diamonds
are formed from carbon subjected to extreme

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:56.050
pressure (725,000 pounds per square inch or
so) and heat (1,650 to 2,370 °F) some 90-120

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.050
miles down.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:04.780
The world’s natural diamond supply (that
has come to the surface) was formed in this

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.780
way some 1-3 billion years ago.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.840
However, scientists only realized that diamonds
are the crystallized form of carbon in 1772

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.280
when Antoine Lavoisier made the discovery.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.030
Despite work by numerous scientists in the
intervening years, the first synthetic diamonds

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.660
weren’t created until 1954 by one Howard
Tracy Hall.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.829
Born in 1919 in Ogden, Utah, Hall grew up
in nearby Marriott.

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:34.500
His family were members of the Mormon Church
and lived on a farm far enough from town that

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.770
heading there for supplies meant the whole
family went along for the ride.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.100
Hall and his brothers waited at the Ogden
City Library for their parents to finish their

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.100
business.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.689
There Hall learned about Thomas Edison and
quickly became fascinated by the inventor.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:52.500
As a child, he reportedly vowed to one day
work for Edison’s company, General Electric

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.280
(GE).

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.790
Hall earned an associate’s degree in 1939
and a bachelor’s degree in 1942.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.369
World War II interrupted his course of education.

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.950
After enlisting in the U.S. Navy in 1944,
Hall trained in radar and electronics at Harvard

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.950
University.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.820
He served as an ensign until 1946 before stepping
back into university courses and completing

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.520
his PhD in Chemistry in 1948.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.970
Then he achieved his childhood dream: he moved
across the country to work at GE’s laboratory

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.270
located in Schenectady, New York.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.310
GE hired Hall to fill the role of chemist
in the team for their recently launched “Project

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.350
Superpressure,” a project designed to create
the first synthetic diamonds.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:42.470
GE spent $125,000 in 1951 (approximately $1.17
million today) on a twenty-five foot tall

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.850
press capable of generating 1.6 million pounds
per square inch of pressure.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.700
The planned press also required GE to build
a three story building specifically to house

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.700
it.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.560
Two years after construction on the press
began, it was finally finished and the physicists

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.170
involved in the team set about running failed
experiment after failed experiment with it.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.500
Hall thought GE and the team that designed
the machine were approaching the problem wrong

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.270
and believed there was a better, simpler way.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.250
In fact, he thought with a few modifications
and a custom designed apparatus, he could

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.230
use a leaky, 35 year old Watson-Stillman press
to do the job.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.350
But when he approached his bosses at GE for
the $1,000 he thought he needed to complete

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.880
the modifications, they turned him down.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.590
After all, a team of extremely well educated
physicists thought it could only be done with

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.400
their shiny new, very expensive, machine.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.950
An old Watson-Stillman press could never be
sufficient for the job, no matter how much

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:38.950
he modified it.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.040
Aside from denying him the money to make the
modifications, GE also gave priority in the

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.980
machining shop to the physicists on the Project
Superpressure team, making it so Hall could

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.710
not continue working on his idea that way
either.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.971
However, Hall refused to let his bosses’
disinterest and skepticism in the project

00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:55.971
stop him.

00:03:55.971 --> 00:04:00.150
He convinced a friendly machinist to help
him after hours in building his newly developed

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.380
“belt” apparatus.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.000
However, since the steel available in the
machinist’s shop was not strong enough to

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.860
handle the extreme pressure Hall needed his
“belt” apparatus to handle, he again approached

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:10.860
the GE execs.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.350
He asked them to purchase a substance called
carboloy, consisting of 6% cobalt and 94%

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.470
tungsten carbide.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.700
Thanks to the intervention of a sympathetic
supervisor, Herman Liebhafksy, who had been

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.230
integral to Hall getting the job in the first
place when he insisted they needed to add

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.560
a chemist to the Project Superpressure team,
GE purchased the expensive carboloy for Hall.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.140
With his machine finally built, Hall set about
experimenting with it.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.460
It took him several attempts at creating synthetic
diamonds before he discovered the correct

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.460
method.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.070
But on December 16, 1954, Hall worked alone
at the GE laboratory after the rest of the

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.150
staff had gone home for the Christmas holiday.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.750
He later described opening the pressure chamber
after one of his experiments and discovering

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.030
the diamonds: “My hands began to tremble;
my heart beat rapidly; my knees weakened and

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.030
no longer gave support.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.880
My eyes had caught the flashing light from
dozens of tiny… crystals.”

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.000
Hall performed the experiment several more
times just to be sure it wasn’t a fluke,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.040
each time with the same result.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.860
He then asked his colleague, Hugh H. Woodbury,
to conduct the test himself.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.390
Woodbury was a fellow GE chemist, and he successfully
used Hall’s relatively cheaply built “belt”

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:20.520
press apparatus on New Year’s Eve 1954 to
create synthetic diamonds just as Hall had.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.120
When Hall informed his bosses at GE about
the success he achieved with his makeshift

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.570
device, they were skeptical.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.401
After all, this was a device that could be
built at home in someone’s garage, with

00:05:29.401 --> 00:05:30.890
a little know-how.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.900
Their skepticism disappeared when they witnessed
the experiment themselves.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.210
Hall left the building before the test specifically
so that they could not claim he doctored the

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.430
results somehow.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.580
After being thoroughly convinced the method
was consistently repeatable, GE announced

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:50.620
on February 14, 1955 that the company had
created the world’s first synthetic diamonds.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.980
However, they initially claimed it was more
of a team effort by physicists and other researchers

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.950
as part of Project Superpressure, rather than
it being mostly just Hall working on the project

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.860
on the side and simply modifying an old press
to suit his purposes.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.350
They also stated the diamonds were created
on their extremely expensive press.

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:13.130
You see, GE invested a lot of money into the
press and the team they had put together to

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:18.350
design and use it, and weren’t keen on admitting
to the world that it had all been a waste

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.840
and that the diamonds in question were instead
created on Hall’s leaky old, readily available

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.060
to the public in its non-modified form, apparatus.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.000
That latter point was particularly of concern
for them, as they didn’t want people to

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.080
know that this thing could be built by just
about anyone who knew the design, without

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.080
too much expense.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.330
(Later, some would do just this once the details
of the design came out.)

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.950
Internally, GE knew the real story and were
happy to give credit where it was due.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.930
If they couldn’t reward him with name recognition
publicly, at least they could give Hall a

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:39.930
bonus.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.060
As such, for being the first in close to a
couple hundred years of scientists and engineers

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.050
to manage to create something that previously
took billions of years to form, GE officially

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:54.100
awarded Hall with a $25 (about $200 today)
U.S. Savings bond for his efforts…

00:06:54.100 --> 00:07:01.890
(Note: most sources claim it was $10, without
providing reference; the H. Tracy Hall Foundation

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:07.360
states it was a $25 bond, of which Hall stated,
“Big deal.”)

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.530
Whatever the case, this slap in the face of
a bonus was the last straw.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:15.090
Had he been given proper credit, rather than
it going to a team, with his role being highly

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.460
marginalized, it is generally thought that
Hall would have been inline for a Nobel Prize,

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.990
among other accolades.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.760
As it was, disheartened with the way GE treated
him, he wasted no time looking for other work.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.780
Being involved with the team that had managed
to make synthetic diamonds was certainly a

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.470
valuable thing, in and of itself, even if
most didn’t know the full truth at this

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:35.470
time.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.590
So Hall had no shortage of job offers.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.750
Rather than go work for another company, though,
he instead took an offer from Brigham Young

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:46.790
University in Utah to become a professor of
chemistry and director of research.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.970
While his original intent was to continue
his research on the belt apparatus, the United

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.440
States government decided the invention was
too important to allow that.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.800
They put a secrecy order on the apparatus
and effectively prohibited him from working

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.419
on it or talking about how it was made.

00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:05.940
Violation of this would mean a substantial
monetary fine and imprisonment.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.540
tetrahedral-pressHall got around this by,
within a year, simply inventing a completely

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:13.160
different machine, the tetrahedral press (full
details on the design can be found here in

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.600
the patent), which accomplished the same thing
as his original, but technically didn’t

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:21.300
violate the gag-order, nor would it infringe
on GE’s eventual patent on his original

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:25.610
machine once the gag-order was lifted and
he was able to file said patent and get proper

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.800
credit for its invention.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.820
(US Patent No 2,941,248)

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:37.220
However, getting off on a technicality didn’t
sit well with some in the government and he

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:44.021
was initially threatened with 2 years imprisonment
and a $10,000 fine (about $88,000 today) for

00:08:44.021 --> 00:08:45.021
inventing this machine.

00:08:45.021 --> 00:08:47.840
Further, his new machine was likewise slapped
with a gag-order.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.370
Fortunately for Dr. Hall, the government did
not follow through with arresting him and

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:55.291
ultimately lifted the secrecy order on his
machines, allowing him to continue improving

00:08:55.291 --> 00:09:00.250
his designs and, finally, publish and profit
from his groundbreaking work.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:05.650
Thanks to this, Hall went on to publish nearly
150 peer-reviewed papers and to win research

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:08.380
grants totaling over $1 million.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:13.490
He even co-founded a very successful synthetic
diamond company of his own called MegaDiamond,

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.110
which is still around today.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:19.130
Hall ultimately retired into the life of a
tree farmer, passing away in July of 2008

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.370
at the age of 88.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:24.660
In his later years, when asked about his most
important accomplishment in his life, Hall

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:39.490
simply stated, “Home and family.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:52.010
That’s the most important.”
