00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.530
Ever notice your body seems to do certain
things around the same time each day?

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.380
You wake up around the same time, feel peckish
around the same time, and are tired and ready

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.990
for sleep around the same time.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.340
You might think it’s habit, but it’s actually
thanks to biological processes that keep your

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.240
body in lock step as the day progresses.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.590
That daily clock is called a circadian rhythm,
and most living organisms have one.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.960
From fruit flies to daffodils to microscopic
organisms, if it lives under the sun chances

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.859
are there’s something that keeps it in tune
with the sun’s 24-hour pattern.

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.749
In humans, there are proteins in nearly every
tissue and organ that help maintain proper

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:37.390
timing, but they don’t function independently.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.059
Inside your brain is something like a master
clock that all other biological clocks sync

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.059
up to.

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.489
This master clock is called the suprachiasmatic
nucleus, and it’s made up of around just

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.170
20,000 neurons arranged in two tiny wing-like
structures nestled inside your hypothalamus.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.039
The hypothalamus plays a big role in releasing
hormones and controlling appetite, among other

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.989
things, so the suprachiasmatic nucleus’
place here makes sense if it’s going to

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.620
be in charge of keeping your body clock synchronized.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.540
But it’s not run by gears or bits in a computer,
it’s run by biological processes.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.890
In the suprachiasmatic nucleus there are proteins
produced on a negative feedback loop.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.570
The proteins (called PERIOD and cryptochrome)
switch off their own production when they

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.940
build up, and cells resume production once
the proteins degrade.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.900
These protein cycles peak about every 24 hours,
though it’s not exact.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.600
A 1974 study left 15 people without clocks
or daylight for up to 13 days.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.890
The researchers found the humans tended to
live on a day of between 25 and 27 hours.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.330
Since these proteins are so important to staying
in sync, genetic mutations that change their

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.720
structure can throw a person’s internal
clock out of whack.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.610
People with familial advanced sleep phase
syndrome produce and unstable PERIOD 2 protein,

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.710
which speeds up their circadian rhythm.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.470
As a result they’re up at 3am and in bed
by 7pm.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.870
No partying for them.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.979
You may have noticed though that when you
travel or set your clock forward for daylight

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.360
savings, your body eventually adjusts.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.519
That’s because light has a big influence
on your suprachiasmatic nucleus too.

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.819
The light your eyes take in turns certain
genes in the cells on or off, coding the proteins

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.019
that keep time.

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.439
This is why light is the biggest external
factor in keeping a steady rhythm, and why

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.019
you don’t seem to get tired when you stay
up late looking at a phone screen.

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.420
But light isn’t the ONLY factor, your body
clock is influenced by things like eating

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.340
cues and social cues as well.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.300
An unstable or abused circadian rhythm can
have medical implications.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.459
Lack of sleep and disrupted circadian rhythms
have been linked to obesity, depression, and

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:43.879
other chronic illnesses.

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.799
So if it’s late at night and you’re watching
this, do yourself a favor, put the phone down

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.800
and get some rest.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.530
Or turn on night mode and watch just one more
episode.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.730
Like staying up all night watching al science
videos?

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.269
You should definitely subscribe and check
out my video on how blue light from this very

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.310
screen is messing with your body clock RIGHT
NOW.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.540
Also Fun fact: The term circadian comes from
the latin words circa, meaning around, and

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.599
diem, meaning day.

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.029
It’s your rhythm around the day.

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:12.029
Neat right?

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:12.960
Thanks for watching.
