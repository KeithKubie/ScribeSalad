00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.910
So the probability of this would be, a big

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.939
old zero. Now why is that? Well, we know that

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.820
if the mother is homozygous and unaffected, it means that

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.850
she is homozygous, and she has the dominant normal alleles.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.210
The father is affected, so he must have a recessive

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.930
allele on the X, and nothing on the Y. Well,

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.905
of all the possible combinations that could happen, the father

00:00:21.905 --> 00:00:25.270
could pass on the Y, and you'd get a boy.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.100
But the mother's going to give an X in

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.310
both of those cases, and both of her X's are,

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.640
are dominant, non color-blind alleles, so the son is

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.980
going to be regular color vision. The father can pass

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.720
on the recessive allele from his X. But if

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.070
he does, the mother's just going to pass on the dominant

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.420
allele from one of her Xs. So you, at the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.740
very most, be a carrier but you wouldn't be affected.
