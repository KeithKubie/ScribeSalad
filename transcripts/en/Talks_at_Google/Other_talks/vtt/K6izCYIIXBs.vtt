00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.060
&gt;&gt; Hello my name's Katina Johnson, and it's
my pleasure to host and

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.289
introduce the Reverend Scotty McLennan on
behalf of Authors@Google and

00:00:07.289 --> 00:00:12.200
he's also brought his family.
So, um, the Reverend McLennan is a dean for

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.000
Religious Life at Stanford.
From 1984 to 2000, he was the University Chaplain

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.560
at Tufts.
And also a Senior Lecturer at the Harvard

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.650
Business School for ten of
those years.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.099
Reverend McLennan received his BA from Yale
in 1970 working in the

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.240
areas of computers and the mind and he received
his Masters of Divinity

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.020
and JD degrees from Harvard Divinity and Law
Schools in 1975.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.020
And that was the year that he also became
an ordained Unitarian

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.070
Universalist Minister and was admitted to
the Massachusetts bar as an

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.649
attorney.
He's the author of Finding Your Religion.

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.940
And the book that he's here today to discuss,
Jesus was a Liberal,

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.570
Reclaiming Christianity for All.
On his bio and the list of accomplishments

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.170
 -- this is an aside,
what caught my eye and really made me say

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.399
cool, is that he was one of
the inspirations for Doonebury's the Reverend

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.070
Scott Sloan, so I was
thought it was a nice little fun fact.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.050
But going back to his book today, Reclaiming
Christianity addresses

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.120
topics such as intelligent design, abortion,
same sex marriage, war and

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.930
torture which are all are really hotbed topics.
And in a time where religion and politics

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.820
are intertwined, and a
climate where the media views christian and

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.830
liberal as mutually
exclusive, it's refreshing to have Reverend

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.830
McLennan here to advocate
for, as he says in his book, a sense of religion

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.310
based not on doctrinal
readings of scripture but on the humanity

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.550
behind Christ's teaching.
So please join me in welcoming the Reverend

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.680
Scotty McLennan.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:49.030
SCOTTY McLENNAN: Thanks very much Katina and
thank you all for coming.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.170
It's a real pleasure to be here at Google.
And to have an opportunity to talk about this

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.210
book in this environment.
It's been interesting going around the country

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.470
talking about it in a
variety of different contexts.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.900
I must say some of them have been very receptive
and others not so

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.640
much.
When I was San Diego, I needed to go to four

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.690
different venues before I
was actually allowed to speak.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.920
And that was surprising, I think, you know,
that when you say, Jesus

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.160
was a liberal, it's a little provocative.
But that provocative that you -- only a public

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.270
library was finally
allow me to speak.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.440
In Texas, where it was a wonderful opportunity
at the largest

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.670
independent bookseller in America, where they
were very -- they had a

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.290
great crowd, very nice introduction.
But as I introduced, the person from the bookstore

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.450
said, this book
is -- the title is clearly toxic, but -- and

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.950
then went on to say he's
an interesting character.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.290
You should listen up.
And on the other hand, in Washington D.C.,

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.560
I found that a lot of the
people responding from Capitol Hill, from

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.540
the political environment of
Washington D.C., felt that I was going too

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:23.200
far in trying to promote
some role for religion in the public -- public

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.170
arena.
And I've had a number of critiques from atheists,

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.380
from the
neo-atheists, about why we should be talking

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.880
about religion at all in
the 21st century, especially given all the

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.970
damage that is done in the
name of religion throughout the world.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.910
I also appreciate you mentioning, Katina,
that there's Reverend Scott

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.560
Sloan character in Doonesbury, red-haired,
red-bearded as I was once,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.480
30 years ago, when my college roommate Garry
Trudeau created the strip

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.150
and put a loot of his roommates in the strip.
And they didn't say in those days when you

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.300
went to college, when you
were asked whether you wanted a roommate that

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.760
smoked or was going to be
up late at night or go to bed early, they

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.450
didn't say anything about
have the risks of having a cartoonist as a

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.320
roommate.
And having this caricature go on for the rest

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.320
of your life, so that you
become a lifelong joke.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.030
But I do stand here with some seriousness
as well today to talk about

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.840
this book.
And Garry, of course, pushed me the other

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.450
way as well.
And he has this very nice word -- these words

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.080
on the cover which say,
"It's a timely and powerfully reasoned argument,

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.050
that it's time for
liberals to reclaim ownership of Christ as

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.290
he was, a outlier, a
passionate but rationalist revolutionary who

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.860
spoke to the best in us."
So I number of people have come at me the

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.110
other way, saying, "Jesus was
a liberal?

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.520
Jesus was a radical.
Jesus was a revolutionary why are you making

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.710
this so pallid?"
So what I'd like to do is to spend a little

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.460
time reading to you from
the book, and giving you a sense of what I'm

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.850
saying in the book and how
I'm saying it.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.169
And then have plenty of time for Q&amp;A because
that's what I think is

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.990
most interesting and engaging.
So let me give you a little bit of the flavor

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.440
of the book first here.
I say early on that when I'm talking about

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.480
liberals, what I mean is a
dictionary definition of liberalism as including:

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:41.120
Belief in progress,
tolerance, individual freedom, and the essential

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.300
goodness of humanity.
So those four criteria.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.700
And I believe that Jesus was a religious liberal
because he came with a

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.750
fresh, new, progressive vision proclaiming
again and again -- you've

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.770
heard that it was said to those of ancient
times, something or other,

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:04.889
but I tell you, and then he had a new vision.
Instead an eye for an eye, he asked us to

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:07.980
turn the other cheek.
Instead of loving just our neighbors, we were

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.010
called upon to love our
enemies, too.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.380
He spoke of a New Testament distinct from
the Old Testament that came

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.520
before.
Jesus was not a fundamentalist in the sense

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.690
of being a Biblical
literalist, he would break one of the Ten

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.979
Commandments when he thought
it was the most humane thing to do as when

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:29.030
he worked healing people on
the Sabbath.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.500
He as clearly said the Sabbath was made for
humankind and not humankind

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.260
for the Sabbath.
Then I go on to say early in the book that

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:43.240
I am a liberal Christian and
so are a large number of American Christians

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.800
according to sociologists
of religion.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.490
We've been called progressive Christians,
we're generally found in main

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:55.430
line as distinct from evangelical churches.
Unfortunately, we're often either forgotten

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.979
or maligned in the current
culture wars and public debates between the

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:03.430
Religious Right and the
Secular Left.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.770
And by the way, as an aside, I really did
write this book because the

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.620
press continually talks about the Religious
Right versus the Secular

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.120
Left.
And there are a lot of us in between, a lot

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.990
of us who are religious.
And this book was written for Christians,

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.960
but I also -- when I say
Reclaiming Christianity for All as a subtitle

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.050
of the book, I'm hoping
to present Christianity in a way that will

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.740
be inclusive and open to
people of other traditions or no tradition

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:36.479
at all as well as to
Christians from conservatives to liberals.

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:40.740
But I go on to say that we are the Religious
Left, not the Religious

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.850
Right.
But what do we stand for?

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.960
Not all of us share exactly the same perspective,
of course, nor would

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.139
we all accept each description in the next
paragraph, but we tend to be

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:57.970
identifiable by many of the following principles:
First, the Bible is meant to be read largely

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:02.380
metaphorically and
allegorically rather than literally.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:08.300
Science and religion are compatible.
We are committed to the use of logic, reason,

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.669
and the Scientific
Method.

00:08:09.669 --> 00:08:18.720
Doubt is the handmaiden of faith.
Love is the primary Christian value, and it's

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.300
directly related to the
promotion of liberty and justice in society

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:27.639
at large.
All people are inherently equal and worthy

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:32.589
of dignity and respect.
Free religious expression should be governmentally

00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:36.289
protected but no
particular tradition should be established

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:40.189
as the State Religion.
There are many roads to the top of the spiritual

00:08:40.189 --> 00:08:44.159
mountain and
Christianity is only one of them.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:47.920
Interfaith understanding and tolerance are
critical.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.959
We see Jesus primarily as a spiritual and
ethic teacher and less as

00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:57.499
being identical with God.
Living a fulfilled and ethical life here and

00:08:57.499 --> 00:09:02.199
now is more important than
speculating on what happens to us after we

00:09:02.199 --> 00:09:06.360
die.
Nonviolence is strongly preferred in relationships

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.209
between human
beings, groups, and nations.

00:09:09.209 --> 00:09:13.910
Women and men must play an equal role in religious
leadership.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:18.790
And in terms of current American hot-button
issues, we tend to be

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:25.649
pro-choice on abortion and in favor of marriages
for same sex couples.

00:09:25.649 --> 00:09:27.899
And then I go on and talk a little bit about
various people

00:09:27.899 --> 00:09:33.369
historically who have been liberal Christians.
I actually relate this tradition back to the

00:09:33.369 --> 00:09:38.131
very beginning.
Arius, who was one of the original church

00:09:38.131 --> 00:09:43.779
fathers -- it wasn't until it
wasn't until 325 of the common era, 300 years

00:09:43.779 --> 00:09:51.379
after the birth and death
of Christ, that decided in the Christian church

00:09:51.379 --> 00:09:55.019
that Jesus was
identical with God.

00:09:55.019 --> 00:09:59.529
And a number of people have picked up on the
tradition, the early

00:09:59.529 --> 00:10:03.119
tradition in the church after the Protestant
Reformation.

00:10:03.119 --> 00:10:06.029
And I mention some of them here, some of whom
who were burned at the

00:10:06.029 --> 00:10:11.070
stake like Marcos -- Michael Servetus in the
16th century; some like

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:15.629
Galileo, that were forced to renounce their
scientific discoveries.

00:10:15.629 --> 00:10:19.300
But others like John lock who faired better
and had considerable

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:23.139
influence on the Christian founders, liberal
Christian founders of the

00:10:23.139 --> 00:10:26.649
United States in the 18th century like Thomas
Jefferson, Benjamin

00:10:26.649 --> 00:10:32.649
Franklin, and Abigail and John Adams.
And I mentioned that even the liberal Christians

00:10:32.649 --> 00:10:36.480
of the 19th century in
America like Ralph Waldo Emerson and Susan

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.490
B. Anthony met with strong
public outcries of disgust for their religious

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:45.959
belief with the rise
fundamentalism in the 20th century, liberals

00:10:45.959 --> 00:10:49.879
were often condemned as
enemies of the cross of Christ, and accused

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:53.879
of apostasy.
But then I go on to say that ironically, the

00:10:53.879 --> 00:10:58.439
strong denunciation of
liberal Christianity, a strong denunciation

00:10:58.439 --> 00:11:02.000
of liberal Christianity is
coming from another quarter in the early 21st

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.160
century, from public
atheists in Europe and America such as scientists

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.629
Richard Dawkins and
Sam Harris, philosopher Dan Dennett -- when

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:15.320
I was at Tufts University
for 16 years as the University Chaplain, Dan

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.610
Dennett was a professor
there, we used to have lunch together and

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:22.319
talk about these issues.
I actually thought he was a closet Buddhist

00:11:22.319 --> 00:11:26.699
but he never accepted that.
But, anyway, philosopher Dan Dennett, journalist

00:11:26.699 --> 00:11:30.139
Christopher Hitchens,
who published bestselling books with such

00:11:30.139 --> 00:11:35.959
titles as The God Delusion;
the End of Faith; Breaking the Spell; and

00:11:35.959 --> 00:11:42.069
God is not Great.
Today, the estimated 60 million liberal Christians

00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:46.360
in America are
caught in the crossfire between the Secular

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.739
Left and the Religious
Right.

00:11:48.739 --> 00:11:52.730
While outspoken atheists like Richard Dawkins
called God a delusion and

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:56.420
back up their claim with compelling arguments,
well-known conservatives

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:03.019
like Ann Coulter, the author of Godless, the
Church of Liberalism, take

00:12:03.019 --> 00:12:08.100
aim with damming charges.
Everything liberals believe is in elegant

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:13.989
opposition to basic Biblical
precepts, what's a liberal Christian to do?

00:12:13.989 --> 00:12:22.610
So, um, as Katina appoints out, I talk about
a lot of different parts

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:26.470
of Christianity in the book.
There's a chapter on the essence of Christianity

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.600
which as I mentioned,
I believe to be love but I try to spell you

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.040
that out in quite a bit of
detail.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:40.749
I have chapters on God, Jesus, the Bible,
the Church, and on faith --

00:12:40.749 --> 00:12:45.160
what is faith?
And then a chapter on talking to atheists

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:50.059
and Christian conservatives,
how to try to do that effectively.

00:12:50.059 --> 00:12:54.429
There's a whole section of the book on all
of the social issues that

00:12:54.429 --> 00:13:01.759
were mentioned from science and religion,
intelligent design, abortion,

00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:10.449
same sex marriage, war, poverty, bigotry,
torture, environmental

00:13:10.449 --> 00:13:13.569
issues, and so on.
Church and state as well.

00:13:13.569 --> 00:13:17.529
And then a section of the book on Christian
doctrine, issues like the

00:13:17.529 --> 00:13:21.480
trinity.
What does it mean to have a triune God of

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.509
a father, son, and Holy
Spirit?

00:13:24.509 --> 00:13:28.259
Communion, the central sacrament of the Christian
church.

00:13:28.259 --> 00:13:30.989
Being born-again, what does it mean to have
had a born-again

00:13:30.989 --> 00:13:36.410
experience?
The apocalypse, a lot being said, a lot of

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:41.009
bestselling books on -- that
we're at the end time here, and some of us

00:13:41.009 --> 00:13:45.029
will make it and most of us
won't.

00:13:45.029 --> 00:13:49.170
And the Sabbath.
What is the Sabbath?

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:52.420
And what has it been historically?
And why should we set a day apart in the week

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:56.779
where we actually rest?
Which I'm sure you all do a wonderful day

00:13:56.779 --> 00:14:03.660
a week here at Google.
And then the church year: I talk about Advent

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.209
and Christmas, Holy
Week, and Easter.

00:14:07.209 --> 00:14:11.069
And then I have a conclusion at the end of
the book.

00:14:11.069 --> 00:14:15.189
And I'd like to read you a little bit from
that.

00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:19.139
[Reading]
"In the fall before the 2008 election, the

00:14:19.139 --> 00:14:25.259
editor of the 125-year old
publication Christian Century wrote, 'in the

00:14:25.259 --> 00:14:31.790
theological arena, liberal
has become such a negative term that few want

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:35.889
to use it.'
And that's a discouraging conclusion from

00:14:35.889 --> 00:14:40.209
the journal that's probably
been the most effective voice for liberal

00:14:40.209 --> 00:14:42.819
Christianity for over a
century.

00:14:42.819 --> 00:14:46.109
Early in the 20th century, the magazine was
a primary target of the new

00:14:46.109 --> 00:14:50.649
fundamentalist movement. And by mid-century,
Billy Graham helped found

00:14:50.649 --> 00:14:55.569
a new magazine of evangelical conviction to
oppose it called

00:14:55.569 --> 00:15:01.139
Christianity Today.
But now the editor of the Christian Century

00:15:01.139 --> 00:15:06.199
tells us that liberal
Christianity it living in exile and that liberal

00:15:06.199 --> 00:15:09.220
Christians prefer to
use other words to describe themselves like

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.050
progressive.
And may be partly a result of the political

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:14.549
implications of the word
liberal.

00:15:14.549 --> 00:15:18.569
I happened to be listening to the radio in
September 2008, when a

00:15:18.569 --> 00:15:22.720
conservative Christian named Mitt Romney was
speaking to the Republican

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.059
Convention in support of John McCain and Sarah
Palin.

00:15:26.059 --> 00:15:31.379
I counted more than a dozen times that he
pejoratively used the word

00:15:31.379 --> 00:15:35.549
liberal or liberals.
He claimed that liberals are responsible for

00:15:35.549 --> 00:15:40.279
awarding Guantanamo
terrorists with Constitutional Rights, putting

00:15:40.279 --> 00:15:43.709
the interests of the
teachers' union ahead of the needs of our

00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:48.299
children, stopping nuclear
power plants and offshore drilling, making

00:15:48.299 --> 00:15:52.980
us more and more dependent
on Middle Eastern tyrants and replacing opportunity

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:56.100
with dependency on
government largesse.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.109
And there are a lot of other ways that he
insisted that liberals have

00:15:59.109 --> 00:16:04.499
allegedly harmed our country.
Hearing Mitt Romney reminded me of how Michael

00:16:04.499 --> 00:16:08.589
Dukakis, the liberal
governor of Massachusetts, was said to have

00:16:08.589 --> 00:16:14.679
lost the 1988 election to
George H.W. Bush because he was shackled by

00:16:14.679 --> 00:16:19.949
the L word by Republicans.
Worse perhaps, he refused to defend what was

00:16:19.949 --> 00:16:24.079
positive about liberalism,
even claiming in an interview with television

00:16:24.079 --> 00:16:28.730
commentator Ted Koppel,
two weeks before the election, "Ted, I'm not

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:33.399
a liberal."
In Washington -- I mean that was ridiculous.

00:16:33.399 --> 00:16:37.640
Michael Dukakis?
He was really high ADA rating and so on.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:42.470
It was a really low moment I thought.
But anyway.

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:47.369
A Washington Post article in this early 2008
explained that Barack

00:16:47.369 --> 00:16:50.980
Obama was independently ranked at the most
liberal United States

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:56.000
Senator in 2007.
Then the Post editor predicted that in the

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.549
lead-up to the election, he
would keep trying to claim that he's post-partisan,

00:17:00.549 --> 00:17:04.890
not liberal.
Even though John McCain, in his own way, was

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:09.199
post-partisan before the
term was invented often working across the

00:17:09.199 --> 00:17:14.280
aisle on important
legislation defying party orthodoxy far more

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.430
than Obama had.
The Washington Post article ended with these

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:23.870
words: The only democrats
who have won the White House in the last four

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:29.550
decades have done so by
running away from the liberal label, and Obama

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:33.000
is certainly a student
of history.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.560
By contrast, the Christian Century editor
claimed that liberalism is an

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:42.660
important thread in the political fabric of
our history.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:47.140
He pointed out that the founders of the Republic
were enlightenment

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:51.940
thinkers, in part, in large part philosophically
and theologically

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.610
liberal.
The liberal impulse in American politics is

00:17:54.610 --> 00:18:00.050
responsible for social
security, Medicare and Medicaid, head start,

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:04.640
and food stamps.
Liberals, often in the face of fierce conservative

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.300
opposition, have
been the ones to guarantee equal rights.

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:12.300
And they've made laws that help keep our food
and automobiles safe and

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:17.540
college education affordable.
Liberal Christianity can point to the Old

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:23.140
Testament prophets and to
Jesus as the original political liberals.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:27.260
As mainstream a resource at the Encyclopedia
Britannica describes

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:31.530
political liberalism as the culmination of
a development that goes back

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:36.250
to the Hebrew prophets, the teachings of the
Pre-Socratic philosophers

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:43.510
and the Sermon on the Mount of Jesus of Nazareth.
All right.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:49.070
I'm trying finish up here so we can get to
some discussion.

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:56.820
Let me give you just another page or so here.
Jesus often asserted that socially despised

00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:00.070
tax collectors and
prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:03.420
before esteemed religious
leaders.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.780
The sinful who make spiritual progress take
precedence over the

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:11.660
religiously pure who won't recognize any authority
but their own.

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.941
Jesus was known for his commitments to the
outcast and the marginalized

00:19:14.941 --> 00:19:20.290
in society, whom we must never forget have
human potential.

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:24.820
Jesus shows himself as tolerant to all sorts
and conditions of people,

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:34.480
as liberals should be, not dogmatic and doctrinal.
Freedom, reason, progress, tolerance -- values

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:39.240
to be proud of, not
ducked because they conjure up the L word.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.940
And let's not forget the dictionary definitions
of liberal as

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:46.430
synonymous with generous, bountiful, open-handed,
munificent, and

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:51.410
abundant.
So what is the future of liberal Christianity?

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:55.730
Of Christianity marked
by commitments to freedom from authority,

00:19:55.730 --> 00:20:00.060
the use of reason, human
progress, and tolerance towards others.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.820
There's no future if people aren't willing
to stand up for these values

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:11.310
and claim the label liberal as their own.
Jesus was a liberal in substantial and important

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:14.410
ways.
Christians need to stand up for him in that

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:18.550
respect.
Why has the liberal voice been so muted in

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:22.610
Christianity?
The editor of Christian Century reminds us

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:26.810
that people living in exile
don't get to define the terms of political

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:30.010
discourse.
And I'm quoting him now.

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:34.540
Conservatives have won the rhetorical battle.
He also observes that because tolerance is

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:38.470
one of the central values of
liberals, they don't like to fight.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:41.400
But instead are always trying to accommodate
people.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.610
To be inclusive even of those who are trying
to exclude them.

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:49.810
And I must admit that defines me to a "T."
The Christian Century editor concludes that

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.070
the first thing on the
minds of my conservative brothers and sisters

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:55.820
when they get out of bed
in the morning is fighting liberals, I think

00:20:55.820 --> 00:21:00.260
of Mitt Romney and Ann
Coulter as quintessential.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.480
Whereas liberals get out of bed trying to
figure out how to live with

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:07.610
conservatives.
And yes, that's what I do most of the time

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:12.040
especially in my role as
Dean for Religious Life at Stanford, pledge

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:17.990
to meeting the needs of all
faiths by encouraging a widespread spectrum

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:22.570
of religious traditions on
campus, many of them quite conservative.

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:28.950
But tolerance doesn't mean capitulation.
It doesn't mean shying away from expressing

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:33.390
liberal Christian values
that defend the freedom of all, promote the

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:38.020
use of reason, and affirm
the human potential to better ourselves and

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:42.730
help repair a broken world.
There are clear dangers demonstrated throughout

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:46.540
the Bible, and
specifically in the Christian Gospel, of ceding

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:51.100
authority to the
religious establishment, cherishing belief

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:56.180
over reason, accentuating
sin over the human potential for good, and

00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:00.870
prioritizing alleged truth
claims over tolerance.

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:05.100
Liberal Christians constitute at least 20
percent of the U.S.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:10.090
population according to recent studies.
Too many of them choose silence, afraid to

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:12.590
use the word liberal to
describe where they stand.

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:16.510
And that leaves them lying low, sitting quietly
in their pews at

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:20.870
church, or in private prayer at home, or choosing
simply to identify as

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:24.290
political liberals without mentioning their
faith commitments.

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:28.480
They must reclaim their religious heritage
as an independent source of

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:33.270
wisdom, encourage in their personal lives
and in their community

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:37.840
involvements.
To them, and to myself as one of them, I bellow,

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:43.400
stand up, stand tall
and proclaim the positive power of liberal

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.730
Christianity and do it now
before it's too late.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:53.560
That's enough of my reading and preaching.
Let's -- let's hear what you're thinking.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:23:02.760
[PAUSE]

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:08.310
&gt;&gt; So I completely agree with the -- the notion
that liberals, you

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:16.170
know, don't seek conflict.
And, um, I'm -- you know, what are we to do

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:17.860
about that?
Stand up and what?

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:24.330
Because I think one of the other things that
I think is common among

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:30.980
liberal Christians is that they -- they don't
seek to proselytize.

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:36.890
SCOTTY McLENNAN: So, I think liberals do have
a very real problem in

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:43.720
both of those respects.
We tend not to be very good at standing up

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.280
and proclaiming what we
believe and we don't like to proselytize our

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:54.490
beliefs indeed.
I do think though that we -- we have had a

00:23:54.490 --> 00:24:00.100
history, especially when
under fire from either the Religious Right

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:06.340
in risking the -- being
literally burned at the stake, which happened

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:11.600
historically or when we
are, as we are now being attacked often by

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:17.840
the Secular Left, in
particular the neo-atheists who say that liberals

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.570
are actually the
worst, because they feel they can deal with

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:26.070
conservative religionists
whose claims will fall of their own weight

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:31.510
eventually.
But liberals provide a kind of rational veneer

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:38.480
that's put over the
damage that religion has done, religious violence,

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:42.440
religious bigotry
and so on and the real enemy are religious

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.550
liberals.
So I think if nothing else when you're condemned

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:49.760
that way, it's time to
stand up and react.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.780
What are some of the things that we can do
quite specifically?

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:59.600
I think we have methodologies for engaging
people in dialogue that are

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:05.080
badly needed in a time where you have, basically,
talking heads on

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:09.300
television that are playing hard ball with
each other, and in a time

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:16.710
where our political process is at a level
of incivility that seems

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:20.600
unprecedented.
So if we can create methodologies for people

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.430
to actually listen to each
other before they speak and that's part of

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:28.010
the liberal tradition.
I think we can be quite effective.

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:37.710
So a few ideas.
Yeah, I think you need to go to the mike.

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:43.270
&gt;&gt; So I was kind up brought up to be a religious
liberal, but then --

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.730
Christian liberal, specifically -- but then
one day I sort of read the

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:49.320
Bible.
And I was kind of shocked cause, on the one

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.710
hand, there's some -- what
I see is really good stuff in there, like,

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:56.350
you know, do unto others as
you would have them do unto you, not to be

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:59.480
cliche or anything.
But then there's also stuff in there like

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.370
separating the chaff, and you
know, throwing the chaff into the fire, and

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:04.810
I'm not here to I'm not
here to make peace.

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:11.990
I'm here to divide father against son and
brother against whatever, and

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:16.600
a lot of that kind of disturbed me, actually.
And so, you know, I sort of have my own belief

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.581
system which is mine and
I'm okay with it.

00:26:18.581 --> 00:26:23.110
But I have -- like, I'm curious what your
perspective is on some of

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:27.920
these passages as a theologian number one,
with a liberal outlook, and

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:33.190
number two, how you would go about -- if you
had kids -- well see, you

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:37.350
know that stuff about sending stuff in the
flame, they didn't really

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:38.350
mean that.

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:45.520
SCOTTY McLENNAN: Nice question.
Indeed, there are all kinds of things that

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:51.530
you find in the Bible that
are really repugnant from the perspective

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:55.510
I've been describing.
So you point out that although Jesus says

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:59.240
blessed are the peacemakers
and he talks about turning the other cheek,

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:04.090
and he seems to have a very
loving perspective in so many ways, he does

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:08.390
say at another point, I
come not to bring peace but a sword, and divide

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:11.000
brother from sister and
parent from child and so on.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.610
So what do we do with those kinds of difficult
texts?

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:21.090
You look at his talking about peace and then
look at the whole story of

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:27.330
the Exodus that Christians build on.
You have Joshua going into Jericho to fight

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:33.150
the battle against the
Canaanites who were then in possession of

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:39.400
the land, and not only do the
walls of Jericho come tumbling down, and all

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:44.990
the soldiers are killed by
Joshua and his Israelite troops but also are

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:48.770
women and children and
elderly are killed and all of the cattle are

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:51.980
killed then everything is
burned to the ground.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:57.510
So what do we do with those realities?
Now the truth is, and you see this happening

00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:01.900
for Islam now, for the
Qur'an, and you see it happening actually

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.950
with the -- in the Hindu
tradition with the Bhagavad Gita and so on.

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:09.700
You could pick out these proof texts for virtually
anything you want in

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:14.770
religion.
And so, although Gandhi used the Bhagavad

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:19.901
Gita as the basis for his
whole movement of nonviolence, himsa, if you

00:28:19.901 --> 00:28:24.880
read that carefully,
you'll see that it's Argena, the warrior,

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.470
going to Krishna, God, and
saying, do I really have to go out on the

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:32.450
battlefield and kill my
relatives who are on the other side?

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:36.750
And Krishna says, yes, you do.
That's your dharma; that's your duty.

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:43.480
And you have to do it with no personal attachment.
You have to do it in a non-attached way.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:50.130
Now how Gandhi can then use that as a basis
for talking about

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:56.170
nonviolence is tricky.
But in fact, what he said is that's an internal

00:28:56.170 --> 00:29:01.100
battle that we all go
through between our own, in effect, demons

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:06.330
and angels.
The notion of Jihad in the Qur'an, also, it's

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:10.320
primary meaning is the
internal struggle that we each go through

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.960
between our bad and good
selves and so on and some of that imagery

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:17.790
is helpful because these are
real struggles that we go through.

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:23.920
There are evil in the world.
There are -- there is human sinfulness that

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.800
all of us are part of and
we do have genuine struggles.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:32.080
But I do actually work with some of the passages
that you mentioned in

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:37.100
the text of my book and try to help us understand
that it really -- I

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:42.300
don't think to pick out those few proof texts,
really helps us

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:47.090
understand the essence of who Jesus was.
Jesus really was somebody who came with this

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:51.800
new message of peace, of
love, and you need to look at the whole rather

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.710
than grabbing a proof
text here and a proof text there.

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:58.690
Although, I'm often criticized as a liberal,
for picking -- cherry

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:03.250
picking the liberal texts.
But when you look at the sweep of the New

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:06.559
Testament and the sweep of
what Jesus came to do, I think again and again

00:30:06.559 --> 00:30:10.070
you'll see he came for
the marginalized, for the poor, he stood up

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:12.950
for those who were
oppressed.

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:19.890
He had new visions of love and tolerance.
His great, um, you mentioned the sort of cliches

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:21.321
of the Golden Rule and
so on.

00:30:21.321 --> 00:30:26.650
But the Good Samaritan story is a really impressive
story because --

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:32.640
and Samaritans used to be hated non-Jews.
They weren't part of Jesus' tradition, so

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.730
when he asked, who is my
neighbor?

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:37.320
He reaches out and tells a story about people
from his own religious

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:41.050
tradition leaving this bloody guy on the side
of the road while the

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:45.090
person who came to help was a non-Jew, a hated
foreigner called a

00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:48.180
Samaritan.
So this kind of reaching out that Jesus did,

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:51.340
even beyond his own
religious tradition to valorize somebody of

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:56.400
another religious tradition
I think is pretty impressive.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.180
[PAUSE]

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:04.590
&gt;&gt; Hi.
So my question kind of relates to the last

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:07.650
one.
So I'm just curious what is your general view

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:11.500
of scripture, especially
the New Testament, it is, like how do you

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:17.640
know which parts to -- are
true and which aren't?

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:24.370
And, like, do you kind of view it all as having
been mistranslated or,

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:28.121
like, is it as an accurate representation
of what actually happened or

00:31:28.121 --> 00:31:33.510
not?
And if not, which, like, which parts are and

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:35.120
which aren't and how do
you know?

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:38.270
SCOTTY McLENNAN: No, I think we need to take
the entirety of the New

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:41.450
Testament seriously.
We need to work with it, study it, try to

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:45.870
figure out who wrote it, why,
under what circumstances.

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:50.050
The New Testament was written from about 50
of the Common Era to

00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:55.630
20 years after Jesus died until about 100
of the Common Era.

00:31:55.630 --> 00:32:00.400
And a lot of different historical contexts
before and after the

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:05.800
destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in
70 A.D. or of the Common Era,

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:10.070
by people of different parts the ancient Mid-East
who were having a

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:13.470
variety of different kinds of struggles both
within their communities

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:18.140
and with people around them.
We have Paul going out to the Gentile world,

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:23.940
because Christianity was
originally a Jewish sect, and Jesus -- I'm

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.940
crystal clear from
everything he wrote -- always considered himself

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:30.420
a Jew, assumed he was
a Jew, assumed he was going to reform Judaism.

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:35.930
He didn't think he was starting a new religion.
So you have all of these, and you do have

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:39.490
the Christian church
developing, and then reinterpreting the scriptures

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:42.310
in relation to their
new understanding, and then we go through

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:47.430
2000 years of
reinterpretation of who Jesus was based on

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:53.020
the scripture, et cetera.
So it's an active, vital text that people

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:56.110
continue to work with in a
variety of ways.

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:59.680
But we absolutely need to take every word
of the New Testament

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:04.380
seriously.
I use the Christian Lectionary to preach from

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:08.640
that is a three-year
cycle, where all Christian churches, ideally,

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:12.240
are using the same
lessons from the Gospels, from the letters

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.050
of Paul, from Psalms, and
from the Old Testament or the Hebrew bible,

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:19.210
every Sunday and that's a
really good discipline, because there's the

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:22.220
text.
The text for this week may be, I come not

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:25.620
to bring peace but a sword.
I need to go to my commentaries and need to

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.990
find out what's meant in
the original languages.

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:33.600
I need to see what the context was and then
bring that up to today and

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:38.179
say, what's the message for today?
So, absolutely, we need to take all of it

00:33:38.179 --> 00:33:42.550
seriously and we need to deal
with the reality of what may be hard texts.

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:45.480
I was actually quite surprised recently taking
with some evangelical

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:49.230
friends, who in Bible churches, where I assumed
they used the

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:54.890
Lectionary as the discipline that I do.
They said, oh, no. We don't use the Lectionary,

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:59.731
what do you do?
It's a Bible church, you're presumably teaching

00:33:59.731 --> 00:34:02.550
the Bible.
Well, there are certain passages that are

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:06.690
important to us and we spend
our time emphasizing, and we don't really

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:10.450
get on overview of the -- of
the New Testament or the Bible as a whole.

00:34:10.450 --> 00:34:14.129
That was quite surprising to me.
Why should a liberal be the one who's trying

00:34:14.129 --> 00:34:18.109
to look at the entire
tradition and take it all very seriously,

00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:22.089
while evangelical, Bible
churches are saying, well, we don't actually

00:34:22.089 --> 00:34:23.089
read the whole Bible.

00:34:23.089 --> 00:34:27.179
&gt;&gt; And then, so, just to clarify -- so what's
your kind of view on

00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:30.289
Jesus?
Do you think he was divine or not?

00:34:30.289 --> 00:34:34.940
And he was -- did he -- was he resurrected
from the dead or not?

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:38.970
SCOTTY McLENNAN: Okay, divinity of Jesus and
the resurrection, two

00:34:38.970 --> 00:34:40.039
small questions.
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:40.039 --> 00:34:47.069
So let me see if I can do that justice quickly.
No, I don't believe that Jesus was divine

00:34:47.069 --> 00:34:48.730
in the sense of being
identical with God.

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:53.480
I do think he was a person filled with the
spirit of God and was very

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:57.680
high, spiritually speaking.
He was one of the great prophets, one of the

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:01.349
great teachers.
We look at other people in world religions

00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:07.079
like the Buddha or Krishna,
if he was in fact a historical person, but

00:35:07.079 --> 00:35:08.880
others and other
incarnations.

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:12.359
In the Hindu traditions, like Ramakrishna
of the 19th century and so

00:35:12.359 --> 00:35:18.069
on.
Mohammed, other major prophets who spoke for

00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:21.489
God and were filled with
the spirit of God.

00:35:21.489 --> 00:35:24.681
I don't think Jesus, if you look at the text
of the New Testament

00:35:24.681 --> 00:35:28.960
carefully, thought he was God.
In fact, there are times where he said don't

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:33.789
call me teacher.
You have only one teacher or master and that

00:35:33.789 --> 00:35:37.529
is God.
Or in the garden of Gethsemane near the end

00:35:37.529 --> 00:35:41.390
of his life, when he
realized what he was facing in terms of possible

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:47.650
execution, he said,
God, please take this task from me.

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:51.430
And he prayed in the garden.
And then ultimately at the end of it he said,

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:55.799
well I understand, it's
not my will, but it's your will to be done.

00:35:55.799 --> 00:36:00.299
So again and again it seems to me, Jesus -- I
think he would have

00:36:00.299 --> 00:36:05.920
thought it was idolatrous, honestly, to imagine
himself as identical

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.859
with God.
He did come, he told us again and again with

00:36:08.859 --> 00:36:13.099
the very special message
from God about the eminent coming of the Kingdom

00:36:13.099 --> 00:36:16.670
of God, breaking into
the world, what that meant, what kind of ethics

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:19.940
we should have and live
in in relation to that.

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:26.630
Now we come to the resurrection.
Jesus, in his last week of life went into

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:31.650
the Temple in Jerusalem,
overturned the money changers tables.

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:36.940
This was part of the -- the ritual that was
used in the Temple where

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:41.329
animals were sacrificed and you needed to
have your money changed from

00:36:41.329 --> 00:36:47.859
Roman coinage into proper sacrificial coinage
in order to buy these

00:36:47.859 --> 00:36:51.230
sacrificial animals and so on.
But the Gospel of John tells us that Jesus

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:55.450
drove the money changers out
with whips, that he drove all the animals

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:59.020
out.
I mean this is a violent response from a generally

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:02.980
nonviolent guy.
And he was executed within a week of that

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:08.049
by the Roman Empire, which I
don't think could stand that kind of disruption

00:37:08.049 --> 00:37:17.190
at the central ritual
place in their colony during the Jewish Passover.

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:21.089
And certainly, the religious authorities were
very concerned about what

00:37:21.089 --> 00:37:26.859
this meant.
So he dies, I believe his disciples, as we

00:37:26.859 --> 00:37:30.009
have evidence of, they
betray him, they say we don't know this guy

00:37:30.009 --> 00:37:36.049
and go away.
And subsequently, this very discouraged movement

00:37:36.049 --> 00:37:39.849
starts to have
experiences of Jesus actually appearing to

00:37:39.849 --> 00:37:43.859
them.
The appearances to the disciples are quite

00:37:43.859 --> 00:37:46.470
powerful stories.
And then you have people who never knew Jesus

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:50.289
like Paul, who were
struck from horse, some say a epileptic fit,

00:37:50.289 --> 00:37:55.430
but he says I was -- had
this experience of Jesus talking to me directly

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:57.400
and telling me what to
do.

00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:01.759
And his -- as that happened with Paul, all
those people around him

00:38:01.759 --> 00:38:07.480
didn't hear Jesus but Paul did.
Similarly, there were people in the Biblical

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:11.259
accounts walking with
Jesus for a whole day who were his disciples

00:38:11.259 --> 00:38:14.869
who didn't recognize him
until the very end when he was breaking bread

00:38:14.869 --> 00:38:19.759
at the table and then
just as they recognized him, he disappears.

00:38:19.759 --> 00:38:23.180
He moved through walls apparently and would
appear and disappear, if we

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:28.049
read those accounts.
So for me, there are accounts of appearances

00:38:28.049 --> 00:38:32.489
but not of a physical,
resuscitated body.

00:38:32.489 --> 00:38:35.660
Although, there are some claims as well in
the Gospel accounts of that,

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:40.210
especially of Thomas of putting his fingers
through his hands to make

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:43.069
sure that this is really the physical resuscitated
body.

00:38:43.069 --> 00:38:46.829
But the main emphasis I think of those stories
are of appearances.

00:38:46.829 --> 00:38:50.940
Now the Christian church then took this very
seriously, this little

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:54.950
Jewish movement took off like wildfire and
not just in Jewish circles

00:38:54.950 --> 00:39:00.299
but across the Gentile world as well.
Because Jesus literally lived for people,

00:39:00.299 --> 00:39:04.970
and the power of who he was
and what he meant became a very powerful force.

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:12.490
And so in that sense, yes, Jesus was resurrected
for the centuries and

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:16.539
this religious movement has grown and gone
where it's gone.

00:39:16.539 --> 00:39:20.390
But I don't personally believe that it was
on the basis of a

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:24.950
resuscitated body.
But on the sense of the appearances of Jesus

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:30.220
and the power that he then
had for this new church as it grew.

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:32.189
Somebody behind you.

00:39:32.189 --> 00:39:34.109
&gt;&gt; Hi.
Comment, I think this Jesus may not have considered

00:39:34.109 --> 00:39:38.440
himself as God but
I think he -- at least there are a lot of

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:42.171
indications that he clearly
considered himself as the Messiah which is

00:39:42.171 --> 00:39:44.619
slightly different.
Anyway, my question is entirely about something

00:39:44.619 --> 00:39:47.069
else which is the
political traditions of religious people,

00:39:47.069 --> 00:39:49.009
of Christians in particular,
seem to depend on which denominations they

00:39:49.009 --> 00:39:50.009
belong to.
Like if you're Baptist or something, then

00:39:50.009 --> 00:39:51.009
you're conservative, or
evangelical, you're conservative, or if you're

00:39:51.009 --> 00:39:52.009
Episcopalian or
Unitarian, then you are liberal.

00:39:52.009 --> 00:39:58.160
And then there are churches like the Catholic
Church, for example, that

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:08.760
are traditionally conservative on reproductive
rights but on the other

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:14.010
hand, John Paul came out strongly against
the war in Iraq.

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:24.039
So are the Baptists recently coming out, well,
not coming out formally

00:40:24.039 --> 00:40:31.329
but there's way lot of talk against Proposition
8 here, for example.

00:40:31.329 --> 00:40:40.809
My question is really as a Christian, do you
really have to worry about

00:40:40.809 --> 00:40:42.839
whether Jesus was liberal or conservative?
I mean, is that really an issue?

00:40:42.839 --> 00:40:45.769
Shouldn't you worry more about what Jesus
really was?

00:40:45.769 --> 00:40:50.819
And then whether you are following, you know
 -- or Jesus, and you know,

00:40:50.819 --> 00:40:54.250
maybe conservatives have some of it, maybe
liberals have some of it.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:57.730
Does it really matter?
I mean, this is your spiritual side of things,

00:40:57.730 --> 00:41:00.700
right?
You should worry about Jesus and not really

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:04.089
try to interpret him in
modern political terms.

00:41:04.089 --> 00:41:05.359
It's my opinion.

00:41:05.359 --> 00:41:11.769
SCOTTY McLENNAN: I think that's a very well-stated
point.

00:41:11.769 --> 00:41:16.630
I agree, I think, with all that you say, yes,
we should be following

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:20.940
and trying to understand Jesus as he was and
as he lives for us now.

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:25.470
To use political terms liberal or conservative
is achronistic in many

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:30.009
ways, not -- and if you think you're just
using it as a political

00:41:30.009 --> 00:41:34.450
label, it's completely misleading because
Jesus, his work and his life

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:37.359
certainly has had political implications,
and you point out what some

00:41:37.359 --> 00:41:41.680
of them are in the modern world, but he is
a spiritual person, a

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:47.359
spiritual leader, somebody who did come as
the Messiah with a new

00:41:47.359 --> 00:41:51.329
vision for Israel.
And that's what we need to follow, that's

00:41:51.329 --> 00:41:56.029
what we need to understand.
However, the other side of this is that these

00:41:56.029 --> 00:42:01.430
terms do get used, and
misused whether we like it or not .

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:05.819
And I want to reclaim the world liberal not
necessarily politically,

00:42:05.819 --> 00:42:12.619
although that's important as well, as I mentioned.
But theologically, because there is a long,

00:42:12.619 --> 00:42:17.180
strong tradition of liberal
Christianity and that term has been used -- you

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:20.680
go to your Encyclopedia
Britannica and you Christianity, liberal,

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:26.099
and there's an entry.
So I want to reclaim that tradition and talk

00:42:26.099 --> 00:42:31.940
about what it stood for,
for tolerance, for the use of reason, for

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:35.569
a progressive vision of
moving towards the future and not just one

00:42:35.569 --> 00:42:41.710
of trying to conserve what
came before of an understanding of humans'

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:46.460
ability to rise above and
transcend themselves not just to be mired

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:48.529
forever in Original Sin and
so on and so forth.

00:42:48.529 --> 00:42:55.160
So these are theological concepts that are
really countered by a lot of

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:59.329
evangelical or conservative or particularly
fundamentalist Christianity

00:42:59.329 --> 00:43:04.749
which sees the world very differently, and
often emphasizes issues like

00:43:04.749 --> 00:43:09.760
doctrinal truth over love, which emphasizes
faith and taking a leap of

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:14.569
faith or blind faith over reason and using
reason as one of your

00:43:14.569 --> 00:43:18.849
methodologies and so on.
So I really want to emphasize those theological

00:43:18.849 --> 00:43:19.849
dimensions when I use
the word liberal.

00:43:19.849 --> 00:43:20.849
&gt;&gt; So that -- I had a similar question.
But just to clarify are you -- you started

00:43:20.849 --> 00:43:21.849
out saying that Jesus as a
liberal was the denotation of the word as

00:43:21.849 --> 00:43:22.849
open, as bucking the
tradition.

00:43:22.849 --> 00:43:23.849
So are you ascribing -- are you saying that
Jesus also politically is a

00:43:23.849 --> 00:43:24.849
liberal, like, were if -- in terms of what
he believed was -- he passes

00:43:24.849 --> 00:43:36.920
the liberal litmus tests?

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:49.039
SCOTTY McLENNAN: No.
I'm not saying that Jesus -- in terms of what

00:43:49.039 --> 00:43:53.229
we -- our modern
definition of political liberalism, no.

00:43:53.229 --> 00:43:57.140
Because, in fact, the modern definition of
political liberalism has

00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:00.170
changed dramatically itself over a couple
hundred years.

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:03.730
I mean, when we talk about the Liberal Arts
in universities or we talk

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:07.960
about the liberal philosophical tradition,
especially, if you go to

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:12.980
Europe now, and you ask to learn about somebody
who is labelled a

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:16.289
liberal, in America, those are what we call
conservatives.

00:44:16.289 --> 00:44:22.769
They stand for free markets, the preeminence
of private property, of

00:44:22.769 --> 00:44:26.900
limited government and so on.
So the liberal tradition when it started,

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:32.299
those were its values.
Liberals were very concerned about tyranny

00:44:32.299 --> 00:44:35.520
about the government being
too powerful, the importance of private property,

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:39.359
the importance of
individualism and so on.

00:44:39.359 --> 00:44:43.049
What happened was liberalism evolved politically
so that there's now a

00:44:43.049 --> 00:44:47.920
greater concern of what corporate power can
mean than what -- what

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:51.970
government power can mean.
So some of the shift was where is the authority

00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:53.200
that we're both worried
about?

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:56.260
So a lot of modern liberals are more worried
about corporate power and

00:44:56.260 --> 00:45:01.519
now global corporate power than they are about
governmental power.

00:45:01.519 --> 00:45:05.700
And they begin to use some of the governmental
structures to try to

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:11.999
counter what they see to be the frightening
use of authoritarianism.

00:45:11.999 --> 00:45:17.479
So, no, I really don't want to confuse Jesus
with that and with that

00:45:17.479 --> 00:45:21.740
debate and that ongoing dialogue and so on.
I just want to identify him with a few of

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.689
these values that I mentioned
earlier.

00:45:23.689 --> 00:45:26.420
&gt;&gt; So Christian liberalism and political conservatism
aren't

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:27.589
necessarily mutually exclusive.

00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:33.900
SCOTTY McLENNAN: Correct.
There are Christian liberals who take what

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:39.650
we would call politically
conservative stance on issues like the size

00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:43.259
of government, on
individualism, on the importance of private

00:45:43.259 --> 00:45:45.069
property, all of the rest
of that.

00:45:45.069 --> 00:45:47.650
And in my own denomination, the Unitarian
Universalist, which is

00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:51.410
considered a very theologically liberal denomination
and it has had

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:55.390
quite honestly a lot of liberal political
action that's been taken in

00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:59.390
our name as well, there are a number of us
who are you'd say a

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:03.109
libertarian and in that sense very conservative
about these basic

00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:04.109
values.

00:46:04.109 --> 00:46:05.109
[PAUSE]

00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:09.741
&gt;&gt; Well, it's too tall.
Can you describe the Biblical support you

00:46:09.741 --> 00:46:13.599
have for your position on
abortion?

00:46:13.599 --> 00:46:19.529
SCOTTY McLENNAN: Can I describe the Biblical
support for my position

00:46:19.529 --> 00:46:23.239
on abortion?
My position, can I do this quickly?

00:46:23.239 --> 00:46:31.339
My position on abortion is that if we look
scripturally at this issue,

00:46:31.339 --> 00:46:41.019
Jesus says nothing about abortion whatsoever.
And in Jesus' time, the notion was that a

00:46:41.019 --> 00:46:46.369
fetus was not a human being,
was not an a DOM, an Adam.

00:46:46.369 --> 00:46:52.239
It goes back to some Old Testament, Hebrew
Bible scripture about a

00:46:52.239 --> 00:46:57.369
woman being hit in the stomach and losing
her fetus.

00:46:57.369 --> 00:47:00.869
What is the response to that?
And the response is that person who does that

00:47:00.869 --> 00:47:04.760
must pay a fine.
There's nothing about that being murder or

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:08.210
that having been a human
being, et cetera.

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:13.720
And the rabbis in the Talmud use that as a
basis for explaining that we

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:18.519
don't become an a DOM, we don't become an
human being until we're born.

00:47:18.519 --> 00:47:23.390
It's the breath of life, the term "rua spirit"
47:27, that once we take

00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:29.749
that first breath in the world, then we become
a human being, an Adam,

00:47:29.749 --> 00:47:32.910
a person.
And you'll see even the Supreme Court decision

00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:36.309
Roe v. Wade that some of
that history is traced.

00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:43.299
And the Catholic Church, not until the -- in
the late 1800s did they

00:47:43.299 --> 00:47:49.259
think that abortion was problematic at least
in the early days because

00:47:49.259 --> 00:47:52.269
there was a notion of ensoulment, when does
the soul enter the fetus?

00:47:52.269 --> 00:47:56.940
And before that, there was no strictures against
that.

00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:59.450
Similarly, in the common law, there were no
strictures against

00:47:59.450 --> 00:48:03.630
abortion.
So this is a more modern conception that's

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:06.890
come, ironically, with
scientific evidence.

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:11.579
Now that from the time you join a sperm and
an egg, everything goes

00:48:11.579 --> 00:48:15.720
from there.
And so if you've got to pick a time when personhood

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:19.180
begins or human
life begins, for many, conception seems like

00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:22.299
a more obvious time than
birth.

00:48:22.299 --> 00:48:27.180
But my -- my point is that lots of us religiously
 -- for religious

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:32.030
reasons and with religious interpretations,
a number of Jews, and lots

00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:36.289
of Christians, if we thought that fetuses
were human beings, I hope we

00:48:36.289 --> 00:48:42.691
would stand up the way Catholic doctrine now
asks us to, and a lot of

00:48:42.691 --> 00:48:45.380
evangelicals do to say it's equivalent to
infanticide.

00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:51.440
And we don't human beings to be killed.
And so I understand that urge and I appreciate

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:53.299
why people feel that
way.

00:48:53.299 --> 00:48:56.979
But they -- I ask them to also understand
my theological understanding

00:48:56.979 --> 00:49:01.190
which I think is Biblically-based, is historically-based
and we're in

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:04.839
the pluralistic society, we should have the
right to choose based on

00:49:04.839 --> 00:49:10.529
our own religious beliefs.
I'm worried that we're getting close to the

00:49:10.529 --> 00:49:15.279
time that we need to move
out of this room.

00:49:15.279 --> 00:49:16.279
One more question.

00:49:16.279 --> 00:49:23.279
&gt;&gt; It's appropriate for the end.
From the end of the Bible the Book of Revelation,

00:49:23.279 --> 00:49:27.819
makes all kinds of
fantastic images appear in people's heads

00:49:27.819 --> 00:49:32.380
and is used as justification
for all sorts of terrible things that are

00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:34.910
done or things that are
terrible that will be done unbelievers.

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:40.099
I come from the Lutheran tradition and Martin
Luther had very big

00:49:40.099 --> 00:49:44.160
questions about whether Revelation should
be part of the Cannon or not.

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:48.579
Can you talk about how Revelations should
inform our understanding of

00:49:48.579 --> 00:49:50.950
God in our modern world?

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:58.479
SCOTTY McLENNAN: So Revelation is an apocalyptic
writing after the

00:49:58.479 --> 00:50:03.710
time of the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem
in 70 A.D., many

00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:07.539
people who would interpret it very politically
in terms what was going

00:50:07.539 --> 00:50:12.460
on in Israel at the time and the hopes for
the end of the Roman Empire

00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:17.880
and how that might come about and so on.
It's full of wonderful but potentially damaging

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:26.969
imagery.
It's a very engaging, um, story, if you will.

00:50:26.969 --> 00:50:32.219
And it has been used in a wide variety of
ways to prophesied the coming

00:50:32.219 --> 00:50:37.569
end of the world and there's many communities
which have sold all their

00:50:37.569 --> 00:50:43.220
goods and on the basis on a sense of the end
time is tomorrow, and

00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:51.099
they've found actually, didn't work that way.
A famous psychologist at Stanford, Leon Festinger,

00:50:51.099 --> 00:50:55.200
came up with the
notion of cognitive dissonance, this psychological

00:50:55.200 --> 00:51:00.180
things, by studying
one of these communities in the 19th century

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:05.410
who did everything because
they thought the end time was coming on a

00:51:05.410 --> 00:51:07.569
certain date.
They sold all their goods, et cetera, and

00:51:07.569 --> 00:51:09.729
then it didn't happen.
They set another date.

00:51:09.729 --> 00:51:13.690
It didn't happen, and at some point, people
had to put together this

00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:16.579
sense of reality which they thought was Biblically-based,
and what was

00:51:16.579 --> 00:51:19.749
actually happening, and it created cognitive
dissonance was the term

00:51:19.749 --> 00:51:25.849
that he used psychologically for that.
So Revelation is a book that you want to look

00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:28.259
at.
What was its historical time and place?

00:51:28.259 --> 00:51:31.940
Why was it written?
What's the basis of that imagery?

00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:34.799
How literally should we take that imagery?
And so on.

00:51:34.799 --> 00:51:39.069
But you're right, it's been used in quite
extraordinary ways.

00:51:39.069 --> 00:51:42.770
Why would we emphasis so much this particular
apocalyptic gospel rather

00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:46.529
than looking at -- this apocalyptic writing,
rather than looking at the

00:51:46.529 --> 00:51:51.210
Gospels, the stories of Jesus told from a
number of different angles

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:54.480
and what he did and how he lived and what
we taught us to do as human

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:57.440
beings.
That's what often confusing to me.

00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.440
Thank you very much.

00:51:58.440 --> 00:51:58.460
