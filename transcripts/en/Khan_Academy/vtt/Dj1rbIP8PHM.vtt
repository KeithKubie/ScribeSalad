00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.350
Let's talk a little bit
about the US customary units

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:04.570
of weight.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.850
So the one that's
most typically used

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.850
is the pound,
especially for things

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.470
of kind of a human scale.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.700
And to understand
what a pound is,

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.200
most playing balls are
roughly about a pound.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.510
So, for example, a soccer
ball-- my best attempt

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.420
to draw a soccer ball.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.320
So let's say that this is a
soccer ball right over here.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.860
And then of course it has
some type of pattern on it.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.009
So you could imagine a
soccer ball is about a pound.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.060
So it's roughly one pound.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.300
And a pound will
often be shorthanded

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.060
with this "lb." right over here.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.810
So it's about a pound.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.630
A football, an
American football,

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.859
is also a little under a pound.

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:48.400
But we could say it
is about a pound,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.750
just so we get a sense of what
a pound actually represents.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.650
Now, if you want to go to
scales smaller than a pound,

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.730
you would think about
using the ounce.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.670
And the relation between the
ounce and the pound when we're

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.030
thinking about weight
is that one pound--

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:21.680
let me write this--
is equal to 16 ounces.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.050
Or another way of
thinking about it

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.190
is that 1 ounce is equal
to 1/16 of a pound.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.700
And if you want to
visualize things

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.960
that weigh about an ounce,
you could imagine a small box

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.210
of matches weigh about an ounce.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.640
So a small box of matches
might weigh about an ounce.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.355
Maybe a small AA battery
would weigh about an ounce.

00:01:50.355 --> 00:01:51.730
But that gives
you a sense of it.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.970
So if you were to take
16 of these together,

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.010
they would be about the
weight of a soccer ball.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.530
16 of these things together,
they would be about--

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.717
they would be about the weight
of a soccer ball or a football.

00:02:03.717 --> 00:02:05.300
Now, if we want to
think about weights

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.495
that are larger than a pound,
then we would go to the ton.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:22.042
And a ton is equal to-- 1
ton is equal to 2,000 pounds.

00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:24.250
And you have to be a little
bit careful with the ton.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.420
We're talking about
the US customary units,

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.990
and this is where we're
talking about 2,000 pounds.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.265
But when we're talking on
a more international level,

00:02:31.265 --> 00:02:32.890
this is sometimes
called the short ton.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.200
There's also a long ton.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.730
There's also the metric ton.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.730
But here we're talking
about US customary units,

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.720
which is the short ton.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.430
So one ton is 2,000 pounds.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.700
And to get a sense of something
that weighs 2,000 pounds,

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.720
or to get a sense of what
2,000 pounds is like, or what

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.510
might be measured in tons,
a car is a good example.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.990
Your average midsize sedan
would weigh about a little

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.920
under to a little over
2 tons, so a little

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.230
under to a little
over 4,000 pounds.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.120
If we're talking about a
small van or minivans or vans

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.911
or trucks, it's going to
be larger than two tons.

00:03:13.911 --> 00:03:15.410
And if you think
about smaller cars,

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.730
you think it's going to be
probably around 3,000 pounds.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.550
It's going to be
less than 2 tons.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:28.891
So a car is going to be
approximately 2 tons.

00:03:28.891 --> 00:03:30.390
So hopefully, that
gives you a sense

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.130
of what units you'd use
in the US customary system

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.741
for different scales of weights.
