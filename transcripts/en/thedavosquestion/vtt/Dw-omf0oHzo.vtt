00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.160
&gt;&gt; Um, I know there's a broad question being
asked what do I think can be done this year,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:21.130
and why there are many, many choices - I decided
to talk about Malaria. The reason I talk about

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.349
Malaria is that there are uh, a million children
die every year in Africa, over there. We have

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:34.250
all the tools that are necessary to prevent
those deaths. In addition there is an enormous

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:45.800
economic toll to Malaria and if we can prevent
this disease and to eliminate the mortality

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:56.150
that the child has, then we make a huge difference.
All it takes is a united effort in countries

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:03.960
by people who have the where-with-all and
the capabilities to launch programs on a very

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:12.909
aggressive footing to scale up the war against
Malaria. And such a coalition has come together

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:21.190
on the road back malaria under a strong task
force that is designed to create these national

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.290
plans or help countries prepare national plans,
coordinate them into a regional plan and go

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:34.880
on an aggressive time table of implementation.
I believe the time is right this year - we

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.850
should have universal access to bed nets,
we should have universal access to the next

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.420
generation drugs, we should have universal
access to indoor spraying. And if we are able

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.110
to do that, then I believe we can eliminate
all Malaria deaths within the next 3 to 5

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.270
years. That would be the one thing I would
think we should work on this year - hope you

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.710
agree - would love to hear your comments.
