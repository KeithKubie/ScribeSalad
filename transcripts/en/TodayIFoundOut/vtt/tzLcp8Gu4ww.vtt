00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:02.670
Why You Can't Put Metals in the Microwave

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.820
If you’ve ever wondered why there is such
a taboo on putting metals in the microwave,

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.530
well, wonder no more.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.300
First, it should be noted that it is not unsafe
to put all metals in the microwave.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.570
Indeed, you often put metals in the microwave
anytime you put a hot pocket in the little

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.770
pouch and place it in the microwave.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.830
The pouch has a thin layer of aluminum lining
the inside that is designed to absorb the

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.320
microwaves and heat up a bit so as to brown
the outside of the hot pocket.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.210
On top of that, the inside walls of your microwave
oven are made of metal.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.589
If you look closely, you’ll also see that
the window you look at the food through also

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:37.780
has metal mesh lining it.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.659
The holes in this mesh are smaller than the
wavelengths of the electromagnetic radiation

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:43.429
your microwave is producing.

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:46.190
This makes it so the waves can’t pass through
the holes.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.620
Visible light, however, is comprised of much
smaller wavelengths, so that form of radiated

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.690
energy passed through the holes just fine,
allowing you to see inside your microwave

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.170
while it’s running without getting cooked
yourself.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.600
So if the inside of your microwave is lined
with metal and certain food products, such

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.479
as hot pockets and pot-pies, have containers
that contain metal, why does your microwave

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.780
manual say not to put metal in the microwave?

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.300
First, let’s talk a little about how a microwave
oven actually works.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.219
At its core, a microwave oven is a pretty
simple device.

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:22.440
It’s basically just a magnetron hooked up
to a high voltage source.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.950
This magnetron directs microwaves into a metal
box.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.659
These generated microwaves then bounce around
inside the microwave until they are absorbed

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.759
via dielectric loss in various molecules resulting
in the molecules heating up.

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.869
Matter that works well here are things such
as water, ceramics, certain polymers, etc.

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.890
These all end up converting microwave energy
into heat quite effectively by a process known

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.549
as “dielectric heating”.

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.759
Basically, molecules such as water molecules
are electric dipoles.

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.140
This means that they have a positive charge
and a negative charge on opposite ends.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.479
Thus, they will rotate themselves rapidly
when trying to align themselves with the alternating

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.860
electric field from the microwaves.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.819
As these molecules rub against each other,
they heat up and, as they do so, they themselves

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.799
also become part of the cooking process, heating
up molecules around them that may not be absorbing

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.980
much, or any, of the microwaves.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.310
Metals, on the other hand, are great conductors
of electricity, being packed with electrons

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.769
that can move freely.

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:27.760
Depending on the shape/type/thickness/distribution/etc.
of metal, you may observe some heating of

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.099
the metal itself in the microwave or none
at all.

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.010
You may also observe some arcing of electricity
or none at all.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.430
What’s going on here is that when these
microwaves hit the metal, free electrons on

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.290
the surface of the metal end up moving from
side to side very rapidly.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.720
This, in turn, prevents the electric wave
from entering the metal; thus, the waves end

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.680
up being reflected instead.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.600
However, there is also the potential that
this ends up creating a sufficient charge

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.909
density that the electrical potential in the
metal object exceeds the dielectric breakdown

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.160
of air.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.410
When this happens, it will result in arcing
inside your microwave, from that metal to

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.310
another electrical conductor with lower potential
(often the wall of the microwave).

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.239
In extreme cases, these electrical sparks
can end up damaging the wall by burning small

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.239
holes in it.

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.590
It can also end up burning out the magnetron
in your microwave oven or, in modern microwaves,

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.159
can provide a surge that ends up damaging
sensitive microelectronics, possibly killing

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.969
your microwave or making it unsafe to use,
in the case of a hole in the inner metal wall

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:33.950
in your microwave.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.530
Another way it can kill the magnetron of your
microwave is when enough of the generated

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.650
microwaves don’t get absorbed, such as if
the food is wrapped in aluminum foil or mostly

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.719
enclosed in a metal container or if you just
run the microwave empty for long enough.

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:52.090
On a more mundane level, something like a
spoon or a metal plate or the like, positioned

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.310
correctly, will simply make your food potentially
not cook normally.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.530
On that note, once again, it is actually acceptable
to put metal in a microwave under the proper

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.930
conditions.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.359
Some microwaves even have metal grates inside
for setting food on, such as is often the

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:09.470
case with certain convection ovens.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.180
There are also certain types of metal pots
and pans that are microwave safe.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.890
These all, however, are carefully designed
to not cause any problems in your microwave

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:19.890
oven.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.000
In general, putting metal in the microwave
is unsafe, not because you are at risk of

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.140
bodily harm or the like (though in extreme
cases a fire might be started in your microwave),

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.920
but, more to the point, primarily because
it has the potential of damaging your microwave.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.170
Bonus Facts:
• Metal powder at room temperature does

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.270
a good job of absorbing microwave radiation.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.960
When it does so, it heats up.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.140
It’s not wholly understood what is going
on here; but it is known that if the metal

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.510
particle size is less than 100 micrometers,
the particle will absorb microwaves, instead

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.020
of reflecting them.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.560
This is generally how the microwave pouches,
such as come with hot pockets or pot pies,

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.450
work; though, they sometimes use a form of
ceramic instead, with the same effect of generating

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.950
heat to brown the outside of the food.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:11.170
These pouches and containers meant for browning
are known as susceptors.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.410
• The type of radiation emitted by microwave
ovens is non-ionizing.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.290
This means that it doesn’t contribute to
your chance of getting cancer like x-rays,

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.930
ultraviolet light, etc do.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.130
Outside of potential burn risks, experiments
done with rodents have yet to show any major

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:34.020
adverse effect to prolonged exposure to microwaves
at the 2.45 GHz range seen in most microwave

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.770
ovens, even with continual low level exposure.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.060
• The particular band of microwaves produced
by typical microwave ovens (2.45 GHz) was

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.630
chosen primarily due to the fact that it is
a frequency set aside for non-communication

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:49.630
uses.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.330
Within the available frequencies that are
not set aside for communication, 2.45 GHz

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:00.880
was chosen because 433.92 MHz would require
expensive equipment to generate sufficient

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:07.900
power to heat food; 5.8 GHz and 24.125 GHz
would require a much higher cost on electricity

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:14.410
used to run the oven; and 915MHz was rejected
as it wasn’t a band available world-wide,

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.440
as 2.45 GHz was.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:24.600
915 MHz, though, is occasionally used in industrial
microwave ovens.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.570
• Electromagnetic waves were predicted by
James Clerk Maxwell in 1864.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.860
It wasn’t until 1888 though that Heinrich
Hertz was able to build a device that was

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.800
capable of producing and detecting microwaves.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.910
His device used a horse trough; Leyden jars;
a zinc gutter (worked as an antenna); and

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.690
a wrought iron point spark.

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.420
• The first known documented use of the
term “microwave” was in 1931 in a Telegraph

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:54.410
&amp; Telephone Journal: “When trials with wavelengths
as low as 18 cm were made known, there was

00:06:54.410 --> 00:07:01.030
undisguised surprise that the problem of the
micro-wave had been solved so soon.”

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.650
• Even though most microwave ovens let you
choose between power levels, there generally

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.330
isn’t any change in the frequency level
of the microwaves being generated.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.260
Rather, it simply changes the duty cycle of
the magnetron.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.130
In other words, it turns on and off at a different
rate.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:20.270
• A convection oven is basically just a
conventional microwave that also has a way

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.970
to brown food like a traditional oven.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.910
In order to provide this browning effect,
the convection oven may use traditional oven

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:33.000
heating elements or might use something such
as a high powered halogen bulb.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.860
• The ability to use microwaves as a heating
device for food was originally discovered

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.820
by an engineer by the name of Percy Spencer.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.760
Spencer was working on building magnetrons
for radar sets.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:47.400
One day, he was standing in front of an active
radar set when he noticed the candy bar he

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.070
had in his pocket melted.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:53.630
Upon noticing this, Spencer made the monumental
mistake of telling other people instead of

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.690
keeping it to himself and working on it on
his own.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:01.050
He and some other experimenters began trying
to heat other food objects, presumably to

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.810
get out of actually working while they were
at work.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.090
The first one he heated intentionally was
popcorn.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:10.930
The second was an egg, which ended up exploding
in the face of one of his co-workers.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:15.780
Spencer then created what we might call the
first true microwave oven by attaching a high

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:21.190
density electromagnetic field generator which
would then shoot into a metal box, so that

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:25.420
the electromagnetic waves would have no way
to escape and the oven would be much more

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:26.790
efficient and safe.

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:31.010
He then placed various food items in the box
and monitored their temperature to observe

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.020
the effect.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:37.649
The company Spencer was working for, Raytheon,
then filed a patent on October 8, 1945 for

00:08:37.649 --> 00:08:41.229
a microwave cooking oven, eventually named
the Radarange.

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:47.459
This first commercial microwave oven was about
6 feet tall and weighed around 750 pounds.

00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:50.470
The price tag on these units was about $5000
a piece.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:57.660
It wasn’t until 1967 that the first microwave
oven that was both relatively affordable ($495)

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.370
and reasonably sized (counter-top model) was
available.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:05.620
Further, it wasn’t until microwave ovens
became extremely popular in the 1970s that

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.830
they were commonly known as “microwave ovens”.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:12.899
Before that, they were typically known as
“electronic ovens”.

00:09:12.899 --> 00:09:16.439
• Forks are particularly susceptible to
sparking in a microwave due to the fact that

00:09:16.439 --> 00:09:21.110
their tines are relatively close together
and will produce high voltage at the tips.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:26.120
This voltage will exceed the dielectric breakdown
of air, which is about 3 megavolts per meter.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.870
The air then forms a kind of conductive plasma,
which is the spark you see.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:34.120
This, in turn, makes the fork an even more
effective antenna for the microwaves, worsening

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.319
the problem.

00:09:37.319 --> 00:09:42.430
• Microwaves convert Vitamin B12 to an inactive
form, which means about 30-40% of the Vitamin

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:46.230
B12 in microwaved foods is not usable by mammals.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:51.380
On the other hand, spinach loses about 77%
of its folate when cooked in a normal stove,

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.790
but retains nearly all of it when cooked in
a microwave.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:59.019
In the same way, steamed vegetables, as a
rule, tend to retain more of their nutrients

00:09:59.019 --> 00:10:02.779
in a microwave than when cooked in a traditional
oven.

00:10:02.779 --> 00:10:08.149
• At one time, most long distance telephone
calls were transmitted via a large network

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:13.089
of microwave radio relay links, such as AT&amp;T’s
“Long Lines”.

00:10:13.089 --> 00:10:19.009
In the 1950s, about 5400 telephone calls could
be run through a single microwave channel

00:10:19.009 --> 00:10:20.680
via multiplexing.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.329
The distance between hops was typically around
40-50 miles.

00:10:24.329 --> 00:10:28.029
The additional cost of transmitting this way
was a large part of why long distance was

00:10:28.029 --> 00:10:30.149
so expensive historically.

00:10:30.149 --> 00:10:34.660
With the advent and installation of fiber
optic lines and advanced satellite systems,

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:39.649
this made the old ground based microwave relay
links obsolete for transmitting long distance

00:10:39.649 --> 00:10:40.649
calls.

00:10:40.649 --> 00:10:58.160
(Although, satellite systems are essentially
just a space-based version of this same thing).
