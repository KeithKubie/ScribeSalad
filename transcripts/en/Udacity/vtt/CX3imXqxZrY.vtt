00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.500
Now the answer I was looking for in this question, is

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.416
that it would be most likely mutation in the coding region,

00:00:05.416 --> 00:00:09.420
not the non-coding region. There were several levels by which you

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.330
could have addressed the y part of the question. And I've

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.870
come up with three different answers, an OK, a better and

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.100
a best answer to the y question. I'm going to read these

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.490
and I want you to evaluate your own answer against these

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.660
possible answers. An OK answer would have been that the coding

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.560
region mutations change proteins. Okay. Sure. So

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.400
what? A better answer would have said that

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.770
coding region mutations alter amino acid sequence

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.570
and thus protein function. Gives me some idea

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.720
that, you understand the full impact of

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.500
the mutation. But it doesn't really juxtapose the

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.550
notion of what a coding region mutation

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.780
does and why a non-coding mutation wouldn't better

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.170
describe this. So the best answer would be that a

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.500
coding region mutation is more likely to alter amino acid

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.650
sequence. And thus the function of the protein compared to

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.030
a non-coding mutation, which is more likely to affect the

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.629
expression of a functioning and intact protein. Go ahead and

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.690
rank your answer somewhere on the spectrum here, from OK

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.820
to better to best. And you can pick check boxes

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.790
in between. Go ahead, tell me how you think you did.
