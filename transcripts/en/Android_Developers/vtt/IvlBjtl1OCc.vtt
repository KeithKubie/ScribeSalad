Abrams: One of the things
I really enjoyed

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:03.200
about developing
on Android

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.634
is all the debugging support
that the platform has,

00:00:05.634 --> 00:00:06.968
and especially
the fact that

00:00:06.968 --> 00:00:08.501
the simulator
and the device

00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:10.133
are actually
quite similar.

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.901
You can issue similar
commands to each one.

00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:15.267
There's a trace view
to see how your performance is,

00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:16.901
and there's also
the ADB shell

00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:19.701
to allow you to install
and uninstall, uh, your games,

00:00:19.701 --> 00:00:22.868
and as well as see what
processes are running right now.

00:00:22.868 --> 00:00:24.934
The sound support on android
is also really good.

00:00:24.934 --> 00:00:27.000
There's support for many
different kinds of formats.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.634
It's easy to load them up
and play them,

00:00:28.634 --> 00:00:30.434
and it's quite responsive.

00:00:30.434 --> 00:00:31.968
So some things
I'd like to see

00:00:31.968 --> 00:00:33.934
to make Android development
a little bit easier

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:35.801
is the ability
to store byte arrays

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:37.601
into the shared preferences,

00:00:37.601 --> 00:00:39.400
and also the ability
to simulate

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.934
saving and restoring behavior,

00:00:40.934 --> 00:00:42.968
because the lifecycle
is very important

00:00:42.968 --> 00:00:44.234
to Android development.
