00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:00.839
- [Voiceover] We've already seen

00:00:01.136 --> 00:00:03.300
that if we were to start with
the differential equation,

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:06.336
the derivative of Y with
respect to X is equal to Y

00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:08.131
and we have the initial condition

00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:11.133
that Y of zero is equal to one,

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.530
but the particular solution to this

00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:13.110
given these initial conditions,

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.024
is Y of X is equal to E to the X.

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:18.820
Or I guess we can just
Y is equal to E of the X

00:00:19.117 --> 00:00:21.866
if we didn't want to write it
with the function notation.

00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.182
And that's all fair and well

00:00:23.182 --> 00:00:24.267
and this works out well.

00:00:24.267 --> 00:00:26.000
This is a separable differential equation

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.027
and we can integrate things quite easily.

00:00:29.027 --> 00:00:32.122
But as you will see as you
go further in the world

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.371
of differential equations,

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.667
most differential equations
are not so easy to solve.

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:39.434
In fact, many of them
are impossible to solve

00:00:39.434 --> 00:00:41.467
using analytic methods.

00:00:41.467 --> 00:00:43.333
And so given that, what do you do?

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.467
We've nicely described some phenomena,

00:00:45.467 --> 00:00:46.633
modeled some phenomena

00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:47.800
using the differential equations

00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:48.012
but if you can't solve it analytically

00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:50.011
do you just give up?

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.534
And the answer to that question is no.

00:00:53.633 --> 00:00:54.639
You do not just give up

00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:58.084
because we now have computers,

00:00:58.084 --> 00:01:01.333
and computers are really
good at numerical methods.

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.482
Numerical methods for approximating

00:01:03.482 --> 00:01:06.084
and giving us a sense of what the solution

00:01:06.084 --> 00:01:08.900
to a differential
equation might look like.

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:09.642
And so how do we do that?

00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.330
Well, in this video we can explore

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:14.120
one of the most straightforward
numerical methods

00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:17.011
for approximating a particular solution.

00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:19.006
So what we do is,

00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:20.852
so I'm gonna draw a little table here.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.766
So, a little table here.

00:01:25.512 --> 00:01:26.400
Actually let give myself.

00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:27.970
I'm gonna do it over here
on the left hand side.

00:01:30.815 --> 00:01:32.100
A little table.

00:01:32.867 --> 00:01:36.300
So, X and then Y.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.005
XY.

00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:42.099
And then DY, DX.

00:01:42.594 --> 00:01:44.300
And you could set up a table like this

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:46.169
to create a slope field.

00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:47.833
You could just pick all the ...

00:01:47.833 --> 00:01:48.839
You could sample X as in Y

00:01:49.433 --> 00:01:51.967
in the XY plane,

00:01:51.967 --> 00:01:53.566
and then figure out for our first order

00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:55.133
differential equation like this,

00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:57.280
what is the slope going
to be at that point

00:01:57.028 --> 00:01:58.981
and you could construct a slope field.

00:01:59.233 --> 00:02:01.235
And we're gonna do
something kind of related

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:03.386
but instead of trying to
construct a slope field,

00:02:03.386 --> 00:02:05.333
we're gonna start with
this initial condition.

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:06.341
We know that Y of zero is equal to one.

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:08.920
We know that the particular solution

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.094
of this differential
equation contains this point.

00:02:11.094 --> 00:02:12.945
So, we're gonna start with that point.

00:02:12.945 --> 00:02:14.997
So we're gonna start
with X is equal to zero

00:02:14.997 --> 00:02:16.094
and let me do this in a different color.

00:02:16.967 --> 00:02:19.200
We're gonna start with X is equal to zero,

00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:20.008
Y is equal to one.

00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:23.107
Which is that point right over there.

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:25.040
And we're gonna say, well, okay

00:02:25.004 --> 00:02:27.745
what is the derivative at that point?

00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:29.866
Well, we know the derivative at any point

00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:31.894
that's for any solution to
this differential equation

00:02:32.146 --> 00:02:35.200
the derivative is going to
be equal to the Y value.

00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:36.598
So in this case, the derivative

00:02:36.796 --> 00:02:38.900
is going to be equal to Y.

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:40.642
It's going to be equal to one.

00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:42.700
And in general, if the derivative

00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:43.586
just like what we saw in
the case of slope fields,

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:46.615
as long as the derivative
is expressed as a function

00:02:46.615 --> 00:02:49.533
of Xs and Y of Xs,

00:02:49.533 --> 00:02:51.767
then you can figure out what the slope

00:02:51.767 --> 00:02:54.366
of the tangent line will be at that point.

00:02:54.366 --> 00:02:57.334
And so, you say okay,
there's a slope of one

00:02:57.334 --> 00:03:01.767
at that point so I can
depict it like that.

00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:03.875
And instead of just keep doing
that with a bunch of points

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:05.266
we'll say okay, well let's just ...

00:03:05.266 --> 00:03:07.373
We know that the slope is changing

00:03:07.373 --> 00:03:10.200
or it's probably changing for most cases.

00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:12.768
But let's just assume it's
fixed until our next X

00:03:12.966 --> 00:03:15.600
and then use that assumption to estimate

00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:16.739
what the next Y would be.

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:19.000
So, what am I talking about here?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.489
So, when I talk about the next X

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.100
we're talking about well, let's just step.

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:23.767
Let's just say for the sake of simplicity,

00:03:23.866 --> 00:03:26.700
we're gonna have a delta X of one.

00:03:26.007 --> 00:03:27.026
A change in X of one.

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:29.130
So we're gonna step
from X equals zero now.

00:03:30.003 --> 00:03:32.636
We're gonna now step from that to

00:03:32.933 --> 00:03:35.100
X is equal to one.

00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:36.235
So we're now gonna go to ...

00:03:36.334 --> 00:03:37.900
Actually I may not use that.

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:40.223
I used that yellow color
already for the actual graph

00:03:41.114 --> 00:03:43.000
or for the actual E to the X.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.566
So now let's say X is equal to one.

00:03:44.566 --> 00:03:47.094
Our delta X is one.

00:03:47.094 --> 00:03:49.333
So we've just added one here.

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:49.342
And what we can do

00:03:50.233 --> 00:03:53.100
in our little approximation scheme here is

00:03:53.001 --> 00:03:55.004
well, let's just assume
that that slope was constant

00:03:55.004 --> 00:03:57.852
over that interval.

00:03:58.248 --> 00:04:00.330
So where does that get us to?

00:04:00.033 --> 00:04:03.636
Well, if Y was at one and
if I have a slope of one

00:04:03.933 --> 00:04:05.842
for one more, for one increase in X,

00:04:05.842 --> 00:04:08.166
I'm gonna increase my Y by one.

00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:10.264
So then Y is going to increase by one

00:04:10.264 --> 00:04:13.282
and is going to get to two.

00:04:13.282 --> 00:04:16.966
And we see that point right over there

00:04:16.966 --> 00:04:19.632
and you already might
see where this is going.

00:04:19.632 --> 00:04:24.266
Now, if this were actually
a point on the curve,

00:04:24.266 --> 00:04:25.533
on the solution,

00:04:25.533 --> 00:04:27.267
and if it was satisfying this,

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.267
what would then the derivative be?

00:04:29.267 --> 00:04:30.766
Well, the derivative is equal to Y.

00:04:30.766 --> 00:04:31.715
The slope of the tangent line

00:04:31.715 --> 00:04:32.718
is going to be equal to Y.

00:04:33.015 --> 00:04:36.008
So, in this case, the
slope of the tangent line

00:04:36.008 --> 00:04:38.373
is now going to be equal to two.

00:04:38.373 --> 00:04:39.548
And we could depict that.

00:04:39.548 --> 00:04:41.866
Let me depict that in magenta here.

00:04:41.866 --> 00:04:46.866
So, it is going to be two.

00:04:46.867 --> 00:04:47.924
It's gonna look ...

00:04:47.924 --> 00:04:49.169
So the slope of the tangent line there

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.333
is going to be two.

00:04:51.333 --> 00:04:52.700
And so, what does that tell us?

00:04:52.007 --> 00:04:55.808
Well if we step by our delta X one more.

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.362
So now our X is equal to two.

00:04:59.362 --> 00:05:04.167
What should the corresponding Y be?

00:05:04.733 --> 00:05:05.866
Well, let's see.

00:05:05.866 --> 00:05:10.866
Now for every one that we
increase in the X direction

00:05:11.002 --> 00:05:13.135
we should increase two in the Y direction

00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:14.867
because the slope is two.

00:05:14.867 --> 00:05:18.873
So, the very next one should be four.

00:05:19.467 --> 00:05:20.500
Y is equal to four.

00:05:20.005 --> 00:05:21.938
So, we could imagine

00:05:22.433 --> 00:05:24.200
we have now kind of had a constant slope

00:05:24.002 --> 00:05:26.107
when we get to that
point right over there.

00:05:26.305 --> 00:05:27.534
And now we can do the same thing.

00:05:27.534 --> 00:05:29.525
Well if we assume DY, DX

00:05:29.525 --> 00:05:31.671
based on the differential
equation it has to be equal Y,

00:05:31.671 --> 00:05:33.300
okay, the slope of the tangent line there

00:05:33.003 --> 00:05:34.330
is going to be the same thing as Y.

00:05:34.627 --> 00:05:36.734
It's going to be four.

00:05:36.734 --> 00:05:41.343
And so, if we step our X up by one,

00:05:41.343 --> 00:05:43.594
if we increment our X by one again,

00:05:43.594 --> 00:05:45.733
once again, we just decided
to increment by one.

00:05:45.733 --> 00:05:47.166
We could have incremented by 10,

00:05:47.166 --> 00:05:49.433
we could have incremented by .01.

00:05:49.433 --> 00:05:50.438
And you could guess which
one's going to give you

00:05:50.933 --> 00:05:51.942
a more accurate result.

00:05:52.833 --> 00:05:54.292
But if we step up by one now

00:05:54.292 --> 00:05:55.767
and our slope is four,

00:05:55.767 --> 00:05:57.533
well, we're gonna increase by ...

00:05:57.533 --> 00:05:58.535
If we increase X by one

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:00.266
we're gonna increase Y by four.

00:06:00.266 --> 00:06:05.266
So we are going to get to eight.

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:10.323
And so, we are at the
point three comma eight

00:06:10.323 --> 00:06:13.967
which is right over here.

00:06:13.967 --> 00:06:16.233
And so, for this next stretch,

00:06:16.233 --> 00:06:21.233
the next stretch is
going to look like that.

00:06:21.467 --> 00:06:23.674
And as you can see just by doing this,

00:06:23.674 --> 00:06:26.633
we haven't been able to approximate

00:06:26.633 --> 00:06:28.634
what the particular solution looks like

00:06:28.733 --> 00:06:29.750
and you might say, "Hey, so how do we know

00:06:29.075 --> 00:06:31.458
"that's not so good of an approximation?"

00:06:32.133 --> 00:06:33.766
And my reply to you is well, yeah

00:06:33.766 --> 00:06:34.774
I mean, depends on what your goals are.

00:06:35.566 --> 00:06:36.633
But I did this by hand.

00:06:36.633 --> 00:06:38.567
I didn't even do this using a computer.

00:06:38.567 --> 00:06:40.300
And because I wanted to do it by hand

00:06:40.003 --> 00:06:43.169
I took fairly large delta X steps.

00:06:43.466 --> 00:06:45.133
If I wanted a better approximation

00:06:45.133 --> 00:06:47.266
I could have lowered the delta X

00:06:47.266 --> 00:06:48.333
and let's do that.

00:06:48.333 --> 00:06:50.400
So let's take another scenario.

00:06:50.004 --> 00:06:51.237
So let's do another scenario

00:06:51.633 --> 00:06:53.166
where instead of delta X equal one,

00:06:53.166 --> 00:06:55.300
let's say delta X equals 1/2.

00:06:55.003 --> 00:06:59.136
So once again, X, Y

00:06:59.833 --> 00:07:03.489
and the derivative of Y with respect to X.

00:07:04.166 --> 00:07:05.767
So now let's say I want to take ...

00:07:05.767 --> 00:07:06.776
So we know this first point.

00:07:07.667 --> 00:07:09.600
We're given this initial condition.

00:07:09.006 --> 00:07:11.740
When the X is zero, Y is one

00:07:12.334 --> 00:07:15.133
and so the slope of the tangent
line is going to be one.

00:07:15.133 --> 00:07:16.950
But then if we're incrementing by 1/2

00:07:16.095 --> 00:07:19.578
so then when X is, I'll
just write it as 0.5.

00:07:20.942 --> 00:07:23.541
0.5.

00:07:23.541 --> 00:07:27.300
What is our new Y going to be?

00:07:27.003 --> 00:07:28.336
Well we're gonna assume that our slope

00:07:28.633 --> 00:07:31.551
from this to this is this
slope right over here.

00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:33.967
So our slope is one, so
if we increase X by 0.5

00:07:33.967 --> 00:07:36.300
we're gonna increase Y by 0.5

00:07:36.003 --> 00:07:39.010
and we're going to get to 1.5.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.667
So, we can get 0.5, 1.5.

00:07:43.667 --> 00:07:45.266
We get to that point right over there.

00:07:45.266 --> 00:07:47.330
Actually you're having
trouble seeing that.

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:49.130
This stuff right over here
is this point right over here

00:07:50.003 --> 00:07:53.008
and now our new slope is going to be 1.5.

00:07:53.008 --> 00:07:57.079
Which is going to look like.

00:07:57.871 --> 00:08:01.700
Which is going to look like
actually not quite that steep.

00:08:01.007 --> 00:08:03.009
I don't want to overstate
how good an approximation is

00:08:03.009 --> 00:08:04.442
and it's starting to
get a little bit messy

00:08:05.333 --> 00:08:06.734
but it's gonna look something like that.

00:08:06.734 --> 00:08:08.913
And what you would see if
you kept doing this process,

00:08:08.913 --> 00:08:10.900
so if your slope is now 1.5,

00:08:10.009 --> 00:08:12.775
when you increment X by another 0.5

00:08:13.666 --> 00:08:15.167
where you get to one.

00:08:15.167 --> 00:08:19.766
So now if you increment by 0.5

00:08:19.766 --> 00:08:20.768
and your slope is 1.5,

00:08:20.966 --> 00:08:25.966
your Y is going to increment
by half of that by 0.75

00:08:26.133 --> 00:08:29.400
and so, you're gonna get to 2.25.

00:08:29.004 --> 00:08:31.617
So now you get to one, 2.25

00:08:32.013 --> 00:08:33.105
which is this point right over here.

00:08:33.933 --> 00:08:35.767
Once again, this is a
better approximation.

00:08:35.767 --> 00:08:36.966
Remember, in the original one

00:08:36.966 --> 00:08:39.967
Y of one you know should be equal to E.

00:08:39.967 --> 00:08:43.764
Y of one in the actual
solution should be equal to E.

00:08:43.764 --> 00:08:46.109
2.7 on and on and on and on and on.

00:08:46.109 --> 00:08:51.109
Now in this one, Y of one got us to two.

00:08:51.933 --> 00:08:54.700
In this one Y of one got us to 2.25.

00:08:54.007 --> 00:08:57.013
Once again, closer to the
actual reality, closer to E.

00:08:58.003 --> 00:08:59.337
Instead of stepping by 0.5,

00:08:59.634 --> 00:09:02.933
if we stepped by 0.1 we
would get even closer.

00:09:02.933 --> 00:09:07.900
If we stepped by 0.0001 we would get

00:09:07.009 --> 00:09:09.375
even closer and closer and closer.

00:09:10.266 --> 00:09:11.633
So there's a bunch of
interesting things here.

00:09:11.633 --> 00:09:13.534
This is actually how most
differential equations

00:09:13.534 --> 00:09:15.728
or techniques that are derived from this

00:09:15.728 --> 00:09:17.334
or that are based on numerical methods

00:09:17.334 --> 00:09:18.400
similar to this

00:09:18.004 --> 00:09:20.083
are how most differential
equations gets solved.

00:09:20.479 --> 00:09:22.200
You know it's not the exact same solution

00:09:22.002 --> 00:09:23.007
or the same method that the idea

00:09:23.007 --> 00:09:25.573
that most differential
equations are actually solved

00:09:26.266 --> 00:09:27.933
or I guess you can say simulated

00:09:27.933 --> 00:09:29.430
with a numerical method

00:09:29.043 --> 00:09:31.090
because most of them
actually cannot be solved

00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:32.376
in analytical form.

00:09:33.267 --> 00:09:35.744
Now you might be saying,
"Hey, well what method is

00:09:35.744 --> 00:09:37.356
"this one right over here called?"

00:09:37.356 --> 00:09:39.377
Well, this right over
here is called Euler's.

00:09:40.212 --> 00:09:42.400
Euler's Method

00:09:42.004 --> 00:09:44.005
after the famous Leonhard Euler.

00:09:44.931 --> 00:09:47.166
Euler's Method.

00:09:47.166 --> 00:09:48.173
And not only actually
is this one a good way

00:09:48.866 --> 00:09:52.433
of approximating what the solution to

00:09:52.433 --> 00:09:54.367
this or any differential equation is,

00:09:54.367 --> 00:09:56.500
but actually for this differential
equation in particular

00:09:56.005 --> 00:09:57.339
you can actually even use this

00:09:57.834 --> 00:10:02.834
to find E with more and
more and more precision.

00:10:03.763 --> 00:10:05.700
Anyway, hopefully you found that exciting.
