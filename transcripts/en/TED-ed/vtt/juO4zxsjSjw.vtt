00:00:06.956 --> 00:00:11.697
Will winning the lottery make you happier?

00:00:11.697 --> 00:00:15.596
Imagine winning a multi-million dollar
lottery tomorrow.

00:00:15.596 --> 00:00:18.547
If you're like many of us,
you'd be ecstatic,

00:00:18.547 --> 00:00:20.616
unable to believe your good luck.

00:00:20.616 --> 00:00:25.178
But would that joy still be there
a few years later?

00:00:25.178 --> 00:00:26.527
Maybe not.

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:31.256
A famous study of 22 lottery winners
showed that months after winning,

00:00:31.256 --> 00:00:35.617
their average reported levels of happiness
had increased no more

00:00:35.617 --> 00:00:39.758
than that of a control group 
who hadn't won the lottery.

00:00:39.758 --> 00:00:43.497
Some were actually unhappier
than they had been before winning.

00:00:43.497 --> 00:00:47.158
And later studies have confirmed that
our emotional well-being,

00:00:47.158 --> 00:00:50.668
how often and how intensely 
we feel things like joy,

00:00:50.668 --> 00:00:52.237
sorrow,

00:00:52.237 --> 00:00:53.768
anxiety,

00:00:53.768 --> 00:00:55.048
or anger,

00:00:55.048 --> 00:01:00.398
don't seem to improve with wealth
or status beyond a certain point.

00:01:00.398 --> 00:01:04.339
This has to do with a phenomenon
known as hedonic adaptation,

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.378
or the hedonic treadmill.

00:01:06.378 --> 00:01:09.486
It describes our tendency to adapt
to new situations

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:13.628
to maintain a stable 
emotional equilibrium.

00:01:13.628 --> 00:01:15.298
When it comes to feeling happy,

00:01:15.298 --> 00:01:19.329
most of us seem to have a base level that
stays more or less constant

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.728
throughout our existence.

00:01:21.728 --> 00:01:23.609
Of course, the novelty of better food,

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:25.148
superior vacations,

00:01:25.148 --> 00:01:26.868
and more beautiful homes

00:01:26.868 --> 00:01:30.330
can at first make you feel like you're
walking on air,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.269
but as you get used to those things,

00:01:32.269 --> 00:01:35.970
you revert to your 
default emotional state.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.748
That might sound pretty gloomy,

00:01:37.748 --> 00:01:41.730
but hedonic adaptation makes us 
less emotionally sensitive

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.709
to any kind of change,

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:46.269
including negative ones.

00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:48.050
The study with the lottery winners

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.211
also looked at people who had suffered 
an accident that left them paralyzed.

00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:56.860
When asked several months after
their accidents how happy they were,

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.251
they reported levels of happiness
approaching their original baseline.

00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:06.270
So while the hedonic treadmill may
inhibit our enjoyment of positive changes,

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.019
it seems to also enable our resilience
in recovering from adversity.

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.311
There are other reasons 
that winning the lottery

00:02:13.311 --> 00:02:16.060
may not make us happier in the long run.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.870
It can be difficult to manage
large sums of money,

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.675
and some lottery winners wind up
spending or losing it all quickly.

00:02:23.675 --> 00:02:25.871
It can also be socially isolating.

00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:30.547
Some winners experience a deluge of
unwelcome requests for money,

00:02:30.547 --> 00:02:33.812
so they wind up cutting themselves off
from others.

00:02:33.812 --> 00:02:36.941
And wealth may actually make us meaner.

00:02:36.941 --> 00:02:40.520
In one study, participants played
a rigged game of monopoly

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.721
where the experimenters made
some players rich quickly.

00:02:44.721 --> 00:02:48.143
The wealthy players started
patronizing the poorer players

00:02:48.143 --> 00:02:51.812
and hogging the snacks 
they were meant to share.

00:02:51.812 --> 00:02:53.912
But just because a huge influx of cash

00:02:53.912 --> 00:02:57.082
isn't guaranteed to bring 
joy into your life

00:02:57.082 --> 00:02:59.850
doesn't mean that money 
can never make us happier.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.302
Findings show that we adapt to extrinsic
and material things,

00:03:03.302 --> 00:03:05.862
like a new car or a bigger house,

00:03:05.862 --> 00:03:09.172
much faster than we do 
to novel experiences,

00:03:09.172 --> 00:03:12.843
like visiting a new place
or learning a new skill.

00:03:12.843 --> 00:03:14.312
So by that reasoning,

00:03:14.312 --> 00:03:18.341
the more you spend money
on experiences rather than things,

00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:20.193
the happier you'd be.

00:03:20.193 --> 00:03:23.774
And there's another way to turn
your money into happiness:

00:03:23.774 --> 00:03:26.493
spend it on other people.

00:03:26.493 --> 00:03:29.962
In one study, participants were
given some money

00:03:29.962 --> 00:03:34.433
and were either asked to spend it
on themselves or on someone else.

00:03:34.433 --> 00:03:37.563
Later that evening, researchers called up
these participants

00:03:37.563 --> 00:03:39.814
and asked them how happy they were.

00:03:39.814 --> 00:03:42.793
The happiness levels of those who had
spent the money on others

00:03:42.793 --> 00:03:47.464
were significantly greater than that
of those who had spent it on themselves.

00:03:47.464 --> 00:03:50.644
And that seems to be true 
around the world.

00:03:50.644 --> 00:03:57.214
Another study examined the generosity
of over 200,000 people from 136 countries.

00:03:57.214 --> 00:03:59.244
In over 90% of these countries,

00:03:59.244 --> 00:04:04.053
people who donated tended to be happier
than those who didn't.

00:04:04.053 --> 00:04:07.803
But this may all be easier said than done.

00:04:07.803 --> 00:04:12.154
Let's say a million dollars 
falls into your lap tomorrow.

00:04:12.154 --> 00:04:14.264
What do you do with it?
