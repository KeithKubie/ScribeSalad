00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.140
If nothing can be faster than the speed of
light, why don’t we make the speed of light

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.780
faster?

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.940
Hey there speedsters, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.759
Unless you’re a certain comic book character
who keeps messing up the timeline -- Barry

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.009
-- you can’t go faster than the speed of
light.

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.359
It’s the top, the be all end all of speed,
and nothing can go faster than it, including

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.990
itself, and it’s always been that way, period.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.769
End of story.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.119
OR IS IT???

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.930
That’s what theoretical physicists at the
Imperial College of London are trying to figure

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:35.930
out.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.790
Decades ago, they proposed that the speed
of light may have been faster in the early

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.790
days of the universe.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.040
They weren’t able to test their prediction
because instruments weren’t sensitive enough

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.650
to precisely measure the cosmic microwave
background radiation, a.k.a. the light leftover

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.730
from the Big Bang.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.510
Now you may be wondering, why would they even
think the speed of light might have been different

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.510
at any point?

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.290
Well, all across the universe, the cosmic
background radiation seems to be about the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.620
same temperature no matter where you look,
and this is puzzling.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.330
For that to be true, photons across the universe
must have interacted and settled into an equilibrium,

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.890
but given the size of the universe and the
speed of light, that’s just not possible.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.690
The most commonly accepted way to get around
this so called “Horizon problem” is known

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.500
as the Inflation Theory.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.850
This idea states that when the universe was
just 10-35 seconds old --so a decimal point

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.710
with 34 zeroes and then a 1 seconds--, it
expanded by a factor of 1026 --which is an

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.950
insanely bigly number-- in a tiny fraction
of a second, before chilling out and expanding

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.670
at the much less ludicrous speed we see today.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.440
That means before the universe stretched out
at the speed we see today: the photons could

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.030
have been in equilibrium.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.820
The Inflation Theory is so popular because
it solves the Horizon Problem along with other

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.890
issues the Big Bang Theory presents.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.880
But there's another way around this problem…
what if the speed of light isn't constant?

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.950
Why not have light just... move faster?

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.479
That’s what these scientists are trying
to figure out, and it would challenge a huge

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:56.479
precedent.

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.619
See one of Einstein's biggest breakthroughs
came with the discovery that light is always

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.900
traveling at a certain speed, specifically
299,792,458 m/s.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:10.489
I don’t care who you are, where you’re
from, what you did, as long as you measure

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.920
light, that’ll be the speed.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.849
If you’re driving at 100 miles an hour and
turn on your headlights, the photons coming

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.730
out of them don’t go 100 miles an hour faster.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.540
Einstein realized if the speed of light is
constant, then space and time could be flexible

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.260
parts of the equation and the theory of Special
Relativity was born.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.489
And this constant speed thing seems to hold
up no matter what we do.

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.739
Some of you may have seen stories about scientists
slowing down light.

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:33.739
But they're not.

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:34.739
not really.

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.540
When light goes through a medium like water
or a pane of glass -- which is probably how

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.810
you've seen light "slowed down" the photons
themselves aren’t traveling more slowly,

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.870
they’re just bouncing off the atoms and
taking a less direct path.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.560
It’s why when they leave the medium light
travels quickly again, instead of staying

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.379
at its slower speed.

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.620
This illustrates why people usually specify
that there’s nothing faster than the speed

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.400
of light in a vacuum.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.359
So right now, the speed of light seems pretty
darn fixed.

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.799
But so does the rate the universe is expanding.

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.409
13.8 billion years ago, when the universe
was brand new and the rules were like the

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.069
wild west of physics, maybe one of those things
wasn’t so steady.

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.400
When our instruments are good enough we’ll
test this new idea and if it’s wrong, we’ll

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.400
stick with cosmic inflation.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.450
If it’s accurate, well, we’re going to
have a lot of rethinking to do.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.640
If cosmic inflation theory IS true, then there
could be parallel universes.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.769
To learn how and see me IN TRIPLICATE, check
out this awesome 360 video we made on the

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:25.769
topic.

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.409
So which makes more sense to you, insane inflation
or an upped speed of light?
