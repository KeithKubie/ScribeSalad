00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:10.190
My name is Collen Gwiyo. I'm from Zimbabwe.
I'm a member of the young global leaders and

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:19.189
I'm a member of parliament in Zimbabwe. My
view is that it's true. The coming of the

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:30.170
World Cup next year will greatly benefit the
continent in three respects. Firstly, definitely

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:38.590
South Africa will have an advantage, but also
the region, second, will also benefit the

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:46.860
neighboring countries depending on the level
of preparedness. And also the different countries

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.629
within the continent. As long as they have
already put in a place a program for that

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:03.980
tourists who will be coming to see the World
Cup will also spend extra days in the different

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:13.140
countries, so that they can experience different
African cultures. And also the areas of food,

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.620
special interests. It is my hope that the
countries should also gain their position

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:29.180
to put in place mechanisms to fit themselves
after the World Cup. Of course there will

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:38.570
be a need to continue with issues of economic
development having found the bases from the

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.870
investment arising from the World Cup. Thank
you.
