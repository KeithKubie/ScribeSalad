Many well publicized studies from Google,

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.665
Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, and others, all show

00:00:05.665 --> 00:00:08.039
that UI performance translates directly to

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.720
dollars and cents. A drop in performance

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.620
directly drives a drop in user engagement. In short, speed is not a

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.660
feature, it's a requirement. Users won't use your app if it's not fast
