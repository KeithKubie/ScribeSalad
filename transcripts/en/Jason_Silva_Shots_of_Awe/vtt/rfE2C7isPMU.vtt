00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.920
[OPENING MUSIC PLAYS]

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:13.300
MAN #1: So one of
the things that

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.570
would be really useful
to have, I think,

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.530
is an operating manual
for human beings.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.330
Like literally, if
we could figure out

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.480
a set of instructions,
a set of algorithms

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.950
that would teach us how
to optimize ourselves,

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.540
how to tweak the knobs and
levers of consciousness

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.060
towards useful spaces,
of contemplation,

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.240
and transformations so that
we may become more than what

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.130
we are-- so that we may
expand, transcend, transform.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.610
And there's a wonderful
idea popularized

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.260
by Kevin Kelly, known as
Finite and Infinite Games.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.130
Now Finite and Infinite Games
is a book by religious scholar

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.520
James P. Carse.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.820
And Kevin Kelly, who
co-founded Wired Magazine,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.190
has praised it for "altering
my thinking about life,

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.910
the universe, and everything."

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.150
And, essentially, it
comes down to this.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.801
Finite games are
played to win or lose.

00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:03.300
Right?

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.549
That's familiar.

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.370
That's boring, right?

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.520
Infinite games are played
to keep the game going.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.360
take note of this idea.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.200
It is no longer about
black and white.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.450
It is no longer about
winning or losing.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.510
The clue here is to
keep the game going,

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.580
to reach a kind of
cosmic homeostasis,

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.730
to move to spaces beyond
entropy, beyond death.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.070
It's not about
conquering, it's about

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.260
continuing to exist,
to contemplate.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.860
It's about immortalizing and
internalizing consciousness.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.860
The futurist Ray Kurzweil
has popularized the term

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.970
singularity as the moments in
which humans transcend biology.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.570
Jesuit scholar Peter de Charin
talks about the omega a point

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.560
and the directionality
of evolution.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.350
Others have written about
the fact we decommissioned

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.896
natural selection,
and now we get

00:02:00.896 --> 00:02:04.430
to look deep within ourselves
and actually decide,

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.670
author what we wish to become.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.206
We are a geologic force.

00:02:10.206 --> 00:02:11.914
Now, we've seen
how this power can

00:02:11.914 --> 00:02:13.468
be used in destructive ways.

00:02:13.468 --> 00:02:15.800
We've seen the effects
of global warming,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.520
but we must also realize
that we have unique capacity

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.180
with this new construction
kids for all reality to,

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.530
not just address the grand
challenges of humanity,

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.580
but essentially
to fix the world.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.570
Not to win or lose, but
to keep the game going.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.380
So let us say this, right?

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.640
Let's stop playing
the finite game.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.860
Let us play the infinite game.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.210
