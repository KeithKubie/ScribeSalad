00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.070
What I want to do in this
video is think about a concept

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.310
that we've already thought
about multiple times

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.560
in the context of
many, many videos.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.910
And this is the idea of
utility-- utility, which

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.300
is really just a way of
saying how much benefit

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.900
or satisfaction or
value do you get out

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.190
of getting a good or service.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.390
But the angle that we're
going to take in this video

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.850
is going to be
slightly different.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.180
In the past, when we were
measuring benefit or value,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.295
we either measured
in terms of dollars,

00:00:30.295 --> 00:00:34.540
where we said, hey, the benefit
of getting an incremental Honda

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.182
Civic was $5,000.

00:00:36.182 --> 00:00:37.640
And we talk about
the incremental--

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.710
we're talking about, and we've
heard the word many times--

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.540
we were talking about
the marginal benefit.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.950
Or early on, when we
talked about the production

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.830
possibilities
frontier and we talked

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.150
about the marginal benefit
of another squirrel,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.025
we were talking about
it in terms of berries.

00:00:51.025 --> 00:00:52.399
We were talking
about it in terms

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.371
of another good or service.

00:00:54.371 --> 00:00:55.870
What we're going
to do in this video

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.950
is just think about
it in absolute terms.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.850
We're just going to think of
some arbitrary way of measuring

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.040
utility and then just
assign values to.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.590
What's the value of
getting one chocolate bar?

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.090
And then what's the value that
we give to the next chocolate

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.600
bar and then the
chocolate bar after that?

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.716
And we're going to do the
same things about fruit.

00:01:12.716 --> 00:01:14.090
And from that,
we're going to see

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.320
if we can build up
some of the things

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.620
that we already know
about demand curves

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.010
and how things relate to price
and the price of other goods

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.310
and things like that.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.825
And in particular, we're going
to focus on marginal utility.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.690
So obviously, you could
have total utility.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.350
If I have four
chocolate bars, you

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.200
could say the total utility I'm
getting from all four of them.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.200
Or, you could think
about marginal utility,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.680
the utility I'm getting from
the next incremental chocolate

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.270
bar or the next
incremental pound of fruit.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.074
And before I move on,
there's one thing--

00:01:50.074 --> 00:01:51.740
and this was a point
of confusion for me

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.530
when I first learned
this-- is OK,

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.670
I'm using the word
marginal utility now.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.280
In the past, I've used
the word marginal benefit.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.150
They sound very similar.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.250
In fact, I even used
the word benefit

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.340
when I defined the word utility.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.650
How are these two
things different?

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.220
And the simple answer is,
conceptually, they aren't.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.480
Conceptually, they are
the exact same thing.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.210
The difference is
how the words tend

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.330
to be used in the context of
a traditional microeconomics

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.220
class.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.510
So when people
talk about utility,

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.120
they tend to measure it
in terms of some type

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.390
of absolute measure that
they just came up with.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.180
You can view them
as utility unit,

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.250
some type of satisfaction units.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.280
While when they talk
about marginal benefit,

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.040
they tend to measure
it either in dollars

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.510
or in terms of some other goods.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.410
But I've seen either
term used either way.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.499
So they really do mean
the exact same thing.

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:46.790
But in this video, we're
going to use the term utility,

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.190
and we're going to come
up with a measuring scale,

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.300
and it's a somewhat
arbitrary one.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.970
And we're going to
use that to come up

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.290
with some conclusions about
the basket of goods someone

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.360
might purchase depending
on different prices.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.360
So as you could imagine, I
pre-wrote these two things.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.110
We're going to talk
about chocolate bars,

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.580
and we are going to
talk about fruit.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.660
So right here in these
little tables here,

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.770
I've shown the marginal
utility of each incremental.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.490
In the case of chocolate
bars, each incremental bar,

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.560
and in the case of fruit, each
incremental pound of fruit.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.870
So this is saying that first
chocolate bar-- obviously,

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.610
if I have no chocolate
bars I'm getting

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.632
no utility from
chocolate bars-- and this

00:03:26.632 --> 00:03:28.090
is saying that that
first chocolate

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.920
bar has a marginal utility.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.590
So the utility of that next
incremental one is 100.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.630
I'm not saying $100.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.880
I'm not saying it's equivalent
to 100 pounds of fruit.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.120
I'm not saying it's
equivalent to 100 berries.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.160
I'm just arbitrarily
saying it is 100.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.000
And what matters
is not that this

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.740
is 100 or 1,000 or a million.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.590
What matters is how this
compares to other things.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.570
So for example, if I--
let's say this is 100,

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.380
and if I know that I like
fruit-- a pound of fruit--

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.650
20% more than that
first-- Or if I like

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.857
an incremental-- my first
pound of fruit-- 20% more,

00:04:01.857 --> 00:04:03.940
then I would have to say
that the marginal utility

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.920
of my first pound
of fruit is 120.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.190
And this is what we
said right over here.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.150
And if, another way
to think about it

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.064
is, if the marginal utility
of the second chocolate

00:04:15.064 --> 00:04:16.730
bar I get-- because
I've already enjoyed

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.240
a little bit of chocolate bar,
and I'm a little chocolated

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.230
out-- is 20% less than
that, then if this is 100,

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.730
then this would have to be 80.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.530
I could have set this
to be 1,000 and this

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.610
to be 800 and this to be 1,200.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.420
I could have set this
to be 10 and this

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.000
to be 8 and this to be 12.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.070
What matters is, is
that they really just

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.640
have the same ratios
between them that really do

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.947
reflect my actual preferences.

00:04:37.947 --> 00:04:39.780
So let's just think
about this a little bit.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.830
My first chocolate bar,
I'm pretty excited.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.130
I just call it 100.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.810
The next chocolate bar, I'm
a little bit less excited

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:46.447
about it.

00:04:46.447 --> 00:04:47.780
I've already had some chocolate.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.806
My craving has been
satiated to some degree,

00:04:49.806 --> 00:04:50.930
but I still like chocolate.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.350
So I'll call that an 80.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.240
We could call it 80
satisfaction units,

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.610
whatever you want to call it.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.609
Then the next chocolate
bar after this-- now I'm

00:04:57.609 --> 00:05:01.200
starting to get pretty stuffed,
and I'm really chocolated out.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.159
And so I'm not getting
as much benefit from it.

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:05.408
And then finally if you give
me another chocolate bar,

00:05:05.408 --> 00:05:06.120
it's even less.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.994
And if we were to list
a fifth chocolate bar,

00:05:07.994 --> 00:05:09.640
I might not want it at all.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.382
My marginal utility
might go to 0 maybe

00:05:11.382 --> 00:05:12.590
for that fifth chocolate bar.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.501
Maybe that sixth chocolate bar,
I have to somehow get rid of it

00:05:15.501 --> 00:05:17.500
somehow, because I'm so
tired of chocolate bars.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.930
Maybe it'll have a
negative marginal utility.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.740
And we could think about
the same thing with fruit.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.450
The first pound of fruit, I'm
pretty excited about fruit.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.340
I have a fruit craving.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.290
I like that first pound
of fruit even more

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.830
than that first chocolate bar.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.450
I like it 20% more.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.680
So I get to 120, you could
call it utility points

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.980
or whatever arbitrary
unit you want to call it.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.980
Then my next pound
of fruit, once again

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.230
I'm having diminishing
utility, diminishing benefit

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.900
as I get more and more
incremental pounds of fruit.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.520
Now, it's very
important to realize

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.110
this is marginal utility,
not total utility.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.640
This is a utility I'm getting
from each incremental pound.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.450
It's positive, so
I'm still enjoying

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.710
that next incremental pound.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.890
I'm just enjoying it a little
bit less than the pound before.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.710
And to realize what
total utility is,

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.670
if I were to have
two pounds of fruit,

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:15.210
I would have 120 of utility
from that first pound.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.560
And then I would have 100
from the second pound.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.320
And so you would say I had
a total utility of 220,

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.735
you could call them utility
units, from both pounds.

00:06:25.735 --> 00:06:27.860
Now with just the information
that I've given here,

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.318
there's a few things
you could say.

00:06:29.318 --> 00:06:31.810
You could say, well look,
my first pound of fruit

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.860
I enjoy more, 20% more than
my first chocolate bar.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.930
You could also say that
my second pound of fruit,

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.280
I enjoy it or I could derive
about the same amount of value

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.270
as my first chocolate bar.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.040
You could say that my
second chocolate bar

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.050
I enjoy less than my
first chocolate bar.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.679
You could even say 20% less
if these numbers are good.

00:06:50.679 --> 00:06:52.220
But this still
doesn't give you a lot

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.980
of information about
how you would actually

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:54.690
spend your money.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.481
You might say, well,
obviously wouldn't you

00:06:56.481 --> 00:06:58.625
want to just buy fruit
over chocolate bars,

00:06:58.625 --> 00:07:01.250
or at least that first pound of
fruit over that first chocolate

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.230
bar?

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.120
Well, you might, but it depends
on how much that fruit actually

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.300
costs.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.160
Just looking at this
alone, we can just

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.000
make relative judgments
about how much

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.075
we prefer each incremental
bar or each incremental pound

00:07:13.075 --> 00:07:14.675
or them relative to each other.

00:07:14.675 --> 00:07:16.050
But it really
doesn't tell us how

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.464
we would spend our actual money.

00:07:18.464 --> 00:07:19.630
So let's think about things.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.520
Let's put some prices
on some of these goods

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.061
and think about how
we would actually

00:07:23.061 --> 00:07:25.970
allocate our dollar given
these marginal utility

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.990
numbers right over here.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:35.600
So let's say that the
chocolate bars are $1 per bar.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.225
And let's say that the
fruit is $2 per pound.

00:07:40.225 --> 00:07:41.600
So this is going
to be per pound.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.092
This is going to be per bar.

00:07:43.092 --> 00:07:44.550
And what we're
going to think about

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.830
is we're going to think
about marginal utility

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.850
for that incremental
chocolate bar per price

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:53.590
of that incremental
chocolate bar.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:57.490
And here the price is going
to be at $1 per pound.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:01.250
So here, for that first bar,
I'm going to be spending $1,

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.380
and I'm getting 100
marginal utility

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.000
points, whatever
you want to call it.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.760
So I'm getting 100 marginal
utility points for that dollar.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.870
So I'm getting 100 marginal
utility points per dollar.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.370
Here, same logic.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.730
I'm getting 80 marginal
utility points per dollar.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:16.930
This is pretty simple math.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.880
Here I'm getting 60 marginal
utility points for the dollar.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.359
Here I'm getting 40.

00:08:21.359 --> 00:08:22.900
So that doesn't seem
too interesting.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.858
It might be a little bit
more interesting here.

00:08:24.858 --> 00:08:27.960
What is the marginal utility
per incremental fruit

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:33.090
that I'm getting per dollar,
per price, or actually per price

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:35.510
of the incremental fruit here?

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.190
Well here, that first
pound of fruit I'm

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.900
getting 120 marginal utility
points we could call them.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.730
But I paid $2 for it.

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.900
So 120-- let me
write it over here.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.620
So for that first
incremental fruit,

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.350
the marginal utility for
that first fruit is 120.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:57.090
And the price of that first
pound of fruit is equal to 2.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.990
So I'm getting 60 marginal
utility points per dollar.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:02.550
I'm getting 60.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.000
Here, 100 marginal utility
points, but I'm spending $2.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.060
So that's 50 points per dollar.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.130
This is 25 points per dollar.

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.770
This is 10 points per dollar.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.380
Now this makes things a
little bit more interesting.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:24.043
If I had $5 to spend, how
would I want to spend my $5?

00:09:27.072 --> 00:09:28.780
What you really just
want to think about,

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.670
where are you getting the most
satisfaction for each dollar?

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:34.340
Where are you getting the
most bang for your buck?

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.730
So where am I going to
spend my first dollar?

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:38.040
So dollar one.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.600
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.930
My first dollar,
where am I going

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.685
to get the most
satisfaction per dollar?

00:09:46.685 --> 00:09:48.060
Well, I get the
most satisfaction

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.250
per dollar right over here.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.750
I get 100 satisfaction
units for a dollar.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.890
Even though I like
a pound of fruit,

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:56.305
I'm getting less
satisfaction per dollar.

00:09:56.305 --> 00:09:58.580
So I'm getting less
bang for my buck.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.160
So my first dollar is going
to go right over there.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.950
I'm going to buy one candy bar.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:08.330
Then where am I going to
spend my second dollar?

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.724
So once again, I just want
to look at all of my options,

00:10:10.724 --> 00:10:12.140
and we're going
to assume that I'm

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.230
going to spend my $5 on
either of these two just

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:16.310
to limit our universe.

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.120
Once again, I'm going to
maximize my bang for buck.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.480
I get 80 satisfaction points
or marginal utility points

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.550
over here per dollar.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:24.890
I only get 60 over here.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.580
So I'm going to buy even
a second chocolate bar.

00:10:30.952 --> 00:10:31.660
Let's keep going.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.200
Where am I going to
spend my third dollar?

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.950
Now, it gets a little
bit interesting.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.600
I could spend my third dollar
right over here and get

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.470
60 points per dollar,
or I could spend it over

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:46.586
here and get 60
points per dollar.

00:10:46.586 --> 00:10:47.960
I'd actually get
the same amount.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.610
There are both 60
points per dollar.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:50.690
So I'm kind of neutral.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:52.440
I'm going to get the
same bang for my buck

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.950
whether I get
another chocolate bar

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:55.815
or whether I get another fruit.

00:10:55.815 --> 00:10:57.190
So just for
simplicity, let's say

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:59.150
I get another chocolate bar.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.200
I could have got the fruit too.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.465
It's really a toss up.

00:11:02.465 --> 00:11:04.290
I could flip a
coin, and I choose

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:06.030
to get another chocolate bar.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.430
So I first spent my first
$3 on three chocolate bars.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:11.820
Now where am I going to
spend my fourth dollar?

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.290
Well, my fourth dollar, now
my best bang for my buck

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:16.780
isn't to get another
chocolate bar.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.340
I'm only going to get
40 units per buck there.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.280
Now it is to spend it on fruit.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.970
So now the next dollar I could
spend on half a pound of fruit,

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.310
and I would get this.

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:30.160
So my fourth dollar
I could spend

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.610
on this for half
a pound of fruit

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.290
because it's $2 per pound.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:37.400
And then I could spend my
fifth dollar there too.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.862
So this is my fourth and my
fifth dollar because it's $2.

00:11:39.862 --> 00:11:41.570
You could think of it
that we're spending

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.970
$2 for one pound of fruit.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.700
And we're getting 60
utility points per dollar.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.960
So we're getting the best bang
for our buck right over there.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.470
But what was useful
about this is

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.220
it allowed us without
thinking about money

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.810
to say how much do we like
these things irrespective

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.980
of their actual price and
then give it a certain price.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.570
It allowed us to think
rationally about, well,

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.460
how would we actually
spend our money.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.210
In this case, when
chocolate bars are $1

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:08.780
and fruit is $2 per
pound, we decided

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:14.220
to buy three chocolate bars
and only one pound of fruit.
