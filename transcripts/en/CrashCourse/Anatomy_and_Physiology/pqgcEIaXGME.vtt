00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
In the summer of 1822, a French-Canadian fur-trapper
named Alexis St. Martin was going about his

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.980
business near Lake Michigan, when he was shot
by a hunter, right in the stomach.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.820
The wound was severe, and everyone expected
St. Martin to die that night.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.920
But…he didn’t.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.510
A local army doctor named William Beaumont
kept him alive.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.650
In fact, Beaumont performed so many surgeries
on the injury over the next several months,

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.040
that he decided, somewhat questionably, to
just keep St. Martin’s stomach wound open.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.680
St. Martin was left with a hole, or fistula,
in his abdominal wall, which allowed anyone

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.579
to see right into his stomach.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.760
Now, it’s probably hard to work as a fur
trapper with a hole in your guts, but Beaumont

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.040
saw -- or possibly created -- an opportunity.
He hired St. Martin -- technically as a handyman,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.920
but really as a guinea pig.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.360
Over several years and some 238 experiments,
Beaumont recorded what St. Martin ate, and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.260
what his stomach did to his meals.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.640
Sometimes they just skipped the eating part
all together and just shoved some food, tied

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.769
to a string, right into the guy’s gut-hole.

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.320
Beaumont took samples of gastric juices and
had them analyzed by chemists -- something

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.160
no one else had done before -- and he also
noticed that St. Martin’s digestion slowed

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.440
at certain times, like when he was sick or
stressed.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.700
I mean, like, beyond the stress of having
a gaping hole in your abdomen.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.540
Through his somewhat questionable research,
Beaumont discovered some major secrets of

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.920
the digestive system, like that the stomach’s
extremely strong acids and muscular contractions

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.470
break down food, and that some foods are more
digestible or less digestible than others,

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.910
and that the brain can affect the stomach.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.090
Beaumont’s findings -- as well as his methods of clinical
observation -- revolutionized the field of physiology.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.290
And St. Martin? Don’t worry about him. He
lived to be 83 years old, in great health.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.740
And a hole in his guts...

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.440
Now, I sincerely hope that you can’t actually
see what’s going on in your stomach, but

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.380
lemme tell you, the story there is epic.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.480
In your digestive system’s mission to disassemble
food into its tiniest, most basic molecular

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.420
forms, the stretch that runs from your mouth
to your stomach unleashes all of the mechanical

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.380
and chemical powers at its disposal.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.039
It physically roughs up food; douses it in
protein-loving, acid-triggered enzymes; reduces

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.880
it all into a creamy paste -- and as a bonus,
because it likes you, it also kills a whole

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.700
host of harmful invaders that, for whatever reason,
found their way through your face and into your tube.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.200
But your stomach’s not the end of the line
for your food.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.800
Unless…it is.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.020
I mean, most of the time, everything from
your mouth to your stomach prepares food to

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.050
be absorbed by your tissues. But sometimes...food
finds its way back up.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.550
Yeah, in case the story of Alexis St. Martin
didn’t make you wanna do this already,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.480
now I’m talking directly about vomiting.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.740
Let’s begin with the beginning: with your
mouth, aka your oral, or buccal, cavity.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.920
Now we don’t usually think of it this way,
but that is where digestion starts -- the

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.050
mechanical and chemical breakdown of food
through chewing and enzyme-action.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.660
The inside of your mouth is lined with a tough,
thick layer of stratified squamous epithelium

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.740
that can stand up to lots of friction, like
getting scraped by tortilla chips and, like,

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.810
grilled cheese sandwiches that maybe were
cooked a little too much on the top.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.380
Your anterior hard palate and the flexible posterior
soft palate form the roof of your mouth.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.260
The hard palate provides, like, a hard surface
for the tongue to mash food against, while

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.360
the soft palate forms a movable fold of flesh
that reflexively closes off the nasopharynx

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.380
when you swallow, so food gets directed down
your esophagus and not up into your nasal cavity.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.040
We all know what teeth are for, and you have
roughly 32 of them in your basic types that

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.080
help you masticate, or chew your food.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.560
The tongue lives on the floor of your mouth,
and is basically just a big muscle that grips

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.340
and constantly repositions your food as you
chew.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.760
The resulting ball of mush actually has its
own special name -- it’s a bolus -- and

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.260
the tongue rolls it back to the pharynx, in
preparation for swallowing.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.550
But that’s just the physical action that
goes on in your mouth. Just as much destruction

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.560
is taking place through chemistry.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.160
The bolus is broken down with the help of
three major pairs of salivary glands that

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.740
churn out an average of 1.5 liters of slightly
acidic saliva every day.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.340
More than four soda cans worth of spit. Per
day.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.800
And all that saliva delivers enzymes like
salivary amylase, a digestive enzyme that

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.090
breaks down starches into glucose monomers.

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.570
Now, once the food enters the pharynx, it’s
propelled by peristalsis into the esophagus,

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.350
which, except for the little sphincter at
the end that keeps food moving in the right

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.090
direction, is really just a glorified laundry
chute lined with smooth muscle.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.670
The only time you probably even remember that
you have an esophagus is when something’s

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.190
stuck in there, or if you’re feeling intense
heartburn, or if you just puked.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.910
But, moving on.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.150
Assuming you have not puked yet, then the
bolus moves on to Dr. Beaumont’s ticket

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.540
to fame: The stomach.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.940
The stomach is the stretchiest part of your
digestive tube, capable of holding 2 to 4

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.930
liters of material at any given time.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.940
TWO TO FOUR LITERS! That’s a lot of nachos.
Mixed with spit.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.050
But of course it’s much more than just a
storage tank -- it’s lined with the same

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.560
four main layers found through most of the
GI tract -- the mucosa, submucosa, muscularis

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.920
externa, and serosa -- but it’s got a few
special modifications.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.820
For one thing, the muscularis includes an
additional layer of smooth muscle that gives

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.320
it extra strength, allowing the stomach not just to
hold materials, but to actively smush them around.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.680
And the inner mucosa is made up almost entirely
of mucous cells, which produce a protective

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.710
coat that keeps the stomach tissues from getting
digested along with your lunch.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.420
This inner lining is dotted with millions
of tiny, deep gastric pits which lead down

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:35.100
to tubular gastric glands. These glands, in
turn, contain various types of secretory cells

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.639
that brew up some of the most potent chemicals
in your body.

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.750
For example, your stomach has parietal cells
that release hydrochloric acid -- a substance

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.350
more acidic than battery acid -- which lays
waste to most of the bacteria, viruses, and

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.960
other stuff that could make you sick.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.880
It also helps denature, or change the shape of, proteins
to make it easier for enzymes to digest them.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.560
And maybe more importantly, when the hydrochloric
acid is combined with pepsinogen, an inactive

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.300
enzyme that’s secreted by another kind of
stomach cell called chief cells, the mixture

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.200
creates the protein-digesting enzyme pepsin.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.520
Together, this super-powered acid and protein-hungry
enzyme can annihilate nearly anything they encounter.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.850
This was apparently something that Beaumont
observed first-hand, by dropping hunks of

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.169
meat into a cup filled with St. Martin’s
personal gastric fluids.

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:23.949
He watched the gobbits of food dissolve over
time, which is partly how he discovered the

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:27.300
stomach’s role in digestion was as much
chemical as mechanical.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.450
But with so much mind-blowingly powerful stuff
at your stomach’s disposal, somebody down

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:36.710
there has to be in charge -- so your gastric
glands also contain enteroendocrine cells.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.139
These cells release regulatory hormones, like
serotonin and histamine, which act locally

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:46.250
to trigger other cells, to, say, release more
acid, or contract muscle tissue. And when

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.880
the time comes to tamp the action down, they secrete
other hormones like somatostatin, to inhibit secretions.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.120
And then there are G-cells, which produce
the most important hormone for stimulating

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.040
gastric activity: gastrin.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.919
Most signals that increase stomach activity
get the job done by increasing the secretion

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:07.199
of gastrin, which then stimulates the release of other
gastric fluids, as well as stomach-muscle activity.

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:11.059
Now, if the smell of baking cookies has ever
made your mouth water and your belly grumble,

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.740
then it might not surprise you to learn that
these stomach secretions are ruled by neural

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.080
mechanisms as well hormonal ones.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.699
In fact, stomach regulation occurs in three
phases, based on where the food is sensed

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:24.339
-- the brain, the stomach, and the small intestine.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:29.300
The cephalic phase is the one ruled by your
brain, and it kicks in when you first see,

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.000
smell, taste, or even think about food.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.160
That sensory input gets relayed to the hypothalamus,
which stimulates the medulla oblongata, which

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:41.000
then taps the parasympathetic fibers in the vagus nerve.
From there, the signals are sent to the stomach

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.880
with the word that, “Hey, we think that maybe cookies
are on the way, so you might want to prepare yourself.”

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:51.000
Now this is a conditioned reflex, so it only works
if you want to eat the food in question. If

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.400
I happen to be super-full, or not feeling
well, or somebody puts a pile of squid eyeballs

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.180
in front of me, the cephalic phase isn’t
gonna happen.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.160
And no offense if squid eyeballs are totally
your thing, they’re just not my thing.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.860
But say I eat the plate of squid eyeballs
anyway because, you know, I’m trying to

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:10.139
be polite. Well, even without the cephalic
warm up, when that food hits my stomach, local

00:08:10.139 --> 00:08:13.990
mechanisms, both neural and hormonal jump
start the gastric phase.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:18.800
For the next few hours, as my stomach grows
distended from the food, it activates stretch

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:24.460
receptors that again stimulate my medulla and get my
vagus nerves to tell my stomach to turn up the juice.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:28.580
At the same time, the secretion of gastrin
is activated by other signals, like the rise

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.699
in alkalinity caused by the stomach acid getting
neutralized as it does its job.

00:08:32.699 --> 00:08:36.359
Conversely, as stomach acidity increases,
it inhibits the release of gastrin.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.800
Now, the third phase of gastric regulation
-- the intestinal phase -- speeds or slows

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:44.360
the rate in which your stomach empties, so
that the small intestine doesn’t get too

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:49.140
overloaded with too much acid -- or with the
creamy paste that your stomach turns your

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.080
food into, known as chyme.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.020
Now remember, not a lot of absorption actually
occurs in the stomach.

00:08:55.029 --> 00:08:59.430
The stomach is more like a decontamination
tank. Sure, it pummels your food down to a

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:04.180
paste, but it’s also where your body tries to
obliterate any nasties that could make you sick.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:08.420
As long as food is still in there, your body
has a chance to kind of size it up, and feel

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:13.500
it out, and it reserves the right to eject
anything that it feels is potentially dangerous.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:18.639
Lots of factors can trigger the stomach’s
urge to purge, or vomit, but the most common

00:09:18.639 --> 00:09:23.529
are simply ingesting too much food, or eating
some kind of irritant or toxin, like those

00:09:23.529 --> 00:09:28.360
produced by bad bacteria, too much alcohol,
certain drugs, or unappealing foods.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.139
Of course if you’ve ever puked in a moment
of trauma or stress, you know how emotions

00:09:32.139 --> 00:09:35.559
and anxiety can also trigger your stomach
to launch its lunch.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:40.360
That’s the brain influencing the cephalic
phase of gastric regulation again, by sending

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.600
extra fight or flight signals to the stomach.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.440
Beaumont noticed this mind-stomach connection
whenever St. Martin’s digestion was affected

00:09:46.449 --> 00:09:50.389
by illness or stress -- something you’d
think he’d have felt every time that doctor

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:52.709
came at him with some meat on a string.

00:09:52.709 --> 00:09:55.889
If you were able to keep down your lunch down
today, you learned how mechanical and chemical

00:09:55.889 --> 00:10:00.300
digestion start in the mouth and continue
in the stomach, where food is pummeled by acids

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.800
and enzymes and turned into chyme. We also
looked at the stomach’s cephalic, gastric,

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.500
and intestinal phases of digestive regulation.
