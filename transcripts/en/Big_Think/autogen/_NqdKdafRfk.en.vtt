00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.909
about five years ago Google started this

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919
about five years ago Google started this
 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.390
about five years ago Google started this
interesting experiment they wanted to

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400
interesting experiment they wanted to
 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.280
interesting experiment they wanted to
figure out how to build the perfect team

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290
figure out how to build the perfect team
 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.110
figure out how to build the perfect team
and so what they did is they started

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120
and so what they did is they started
 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.240
and so what they did is they started
collecting huge amounts of data about

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250
collecting huge amounts of data about
 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.790
collecting huge amounts of data about
all the teams within Google and their

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800
all the teams within Google and their
 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.160
all the teams within Google and their
initial hypothesis was you can make

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170
initial hypothesis was you can make
 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.410
initial hypothesis was you can make
teams better by putting the right people

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420
teams better by putting the right people
 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.910
teams better by putting the right people
together right if you have some

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920
together right if you have some
 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.890
together right if you have some
introverts and some extroverts or maybe

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900
introverts and some extroverts or maybe
 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.050
introverts and some extroverts or maybe
you have on people who are friends away

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060
you have on people who are friends away
 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.510
you have on people who are friends away
from the conference room or or maybe you

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520
from the conference room or or maybe you
 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.060
from the conference room or or maybe you
need strong leaders and followers but

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070
need strong leaders and followers but
 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.819
need strong leaders and followers but
who you put together they figured is the

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829
who you put together they figured is the
 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.470
who you put together they figured is the
way to build the perfect team that's

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480
way to build the perfect team that's
 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.840
way to build the perfect team that's
that's the thing you want to control so

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850
that's the thing you want to control so
 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.549
that's the thing you want to control so
they collected all their data they spent

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559
they collected all their data they spent
 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.740
they collected all their data they spent
millions of dollars and years looking at

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750
millions of dollars and years looking at
 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.020
millions of dollars and years looking at
this stuff and they couldn't find any

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030
this stuff and they couldn't find any
 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.270
this stuff and they couldn't find any
correlation between who was on a team

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280
correlation between who was on a team
 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.010
correlation between who was on a team
and whether that team was effective or

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020
and whether that team was effective or
 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.200
and whether that team was effective or
not so they decided to start looking at

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210
not so they decided to start looking at
 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.369
not so they decided to start looking at
this question a completely different way

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379
this question a completely different way
 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.920
this question a completely different way
they started focusing instead of who is

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930
they started focusing instead of who is
 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.290
they started focusing instead of who is
on the team they started looking at how

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300
on the team they started looking at how
 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.990
on the team they started looking at how
the team interacts we've all felt this

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000
the team interacts we've all felt this
 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.479
the team interacts we've all felt this
before that maybe away from a team

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489
before that maybe away from a team
 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.660
before that maybe away from a team
setting where we're really outgoing but

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670
setting where we're really outgoing but
 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.950
setting where we're really outgoing but
then when we sit down we kind of are

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960
then when we sit down we kind of are
 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.390
then when we sit down we kind of are
more sedate because that's how the team

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400
more sedate because that's how the team
 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.219
more sedate because that's how the team
behaves or maybe there's a group norm

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229
behaves or maybe there's a group norm
 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.929
behaves or maybe there's a group norm
that it's okay for people to interrupt

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939
that it's okay for people to interrupt
 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.030
that it's okay for people to interrupt
each other or maybe it's the alternative

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040
each other or maybe it's the alternative
 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.350
each other or maybe it's the alternative
that the group norm is that everyone

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360
that the group norm is that everyone
 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.840
that the group norm is that everyone
takes turns talking or you stay on the

takes turns talking or you stay on the
 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.280

agenda or you start the meeting by
 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.340

gossiping groups develop these unwritten

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350
gossiping groups develop these unwritten
 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.730
gossiping groups develop these unwritten
rules and that's how they function and

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740
rules and that's how they function and
 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.090
rules and that's how they function and
it turns out those group norms that was

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100
it turns out those group norms that was
 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.950
it turns out those group norms that was
the thing that determined whether a team

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960
the thing that determined whether a team
 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.679
the thing that determined whether a team
was successful or not in particular

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689
was successful or not in particular
 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.679

there were two norms that seemed to have

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689
there were two norms that seemed to have
 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.260
there were two norms that seemed to have
a huge influence on whether a team could

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270
a huge influence on whether a team could
 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.600
a huge influence on whether a team could
work together and really become

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610
work together and really become
 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.510
work together and really become
productive the first was what's known as

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520
productive the first was what's known as
 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.410
productive the first was what's known as
equality and conversational turn-taking

equality and conversational turn-taking
 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.120
equality and conversational turn-taking
what this basically means is does

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130
what this basically means is does
 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.310

we've all been in team meetings where

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200
we've all been in team meetings where
 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.219
we've all been in team meetings where
half the table is quiet right maybe some

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229
half the table is quiet right maybe some
 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.080
half the table is quiet right maybe some
expert is in the room and and when a

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090
expert is in the room and and when a
 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.359
expert is in the room and and when a
question comes up they just talk for 10

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369
question comes up they just talk for 10
 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.740
question comes up they just talk for 10
or 15 minutes and they tell everyone
