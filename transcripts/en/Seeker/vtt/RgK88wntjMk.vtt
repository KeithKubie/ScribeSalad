00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.180
Of all the Earth-Moon-like systems in all
the solar system, Pluto might not come to

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.180
mind.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.990
But maybe it should.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.890
Hey guys, Amy on DNews today taking you all
the way to Pluto!

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:14.890
Well, not literally…

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.860
We’re all pretty familiar with Pluto.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.890
If you're around my age, Pluto was very much
a planet in your grade school science books.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.640
But then in 2006 it was reclassified as a
dwarf planet and a lot of people mourned the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.640
loss.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.870
But Pluto’s still out there, and the New
Horizons mission is a little over a month

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.310
from its closest encounter with the distant
body.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.070
But we’re not just going to Pluto for the
sake of understanding the little planet-turned-dwarf-planet,

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.460
though of course that’s a scientifically
important goal.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.910
An up close study of Pluto might help us understand
our own planet a little more.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.989
So first off, Pluto isn’t just a little
ball of ice somewhere between 680 and 720

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.760
miles in diameter orbiting an average of 3.7
billion miles from the Sun.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.680
It’s a planet with an atmosphere.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.390
Astronomers first found it in 1988 when Pluto
passed in front of a star.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.460
The starlight flickered before being completely
obscured by the planet, offering solid evidence

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.500
of a gaseous medium surrounding the body.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.400
Further observations revealed that this atmosphere
is composed predominantly of nitrogen.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.650
That’s pretty uncommon.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.200
There are only three other bodies in the solar
system that we know have nitrogen-rich atmospheres:

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.630
Saturn’s moon Titan, Neptune’s moon Triton,
and our very own Earth.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.710
In Pluto’s case, the atmosphere constantly
regenerates as surface ice sublimates, and

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.680
that tenuous atmosphere is just pouring off
the little planet much like scientists think

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.270
the primitive atmosphere escaped from the
early Earth.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.490
Measuring and understanding how and why Pluto’s
atmosphere behaves the way it does might help

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.140
explain how the Earth’s atmosphere developed,
which could have some interesting implications

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.150
on why and how it is that our planet alone
seems suitable for life.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.340
But there’s something else Pluto could teach
us about Earth, and that’s about its relationship

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.860
with its largest moon Charon.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.860
Or “Karon.”

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.960
Both pronunciations are correct.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.860
For the time being, we know Pluto has five
moons: Charon, Hydra, Nix, Styx, and Kerberos.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.610
Charon is massive compared to Pluto; it’s
about half the size of its host planet.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.899
It’s so big that it doesn’t simply orbit
Pluto, the dwarf planet and its largest moon

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.420
actually both orbit a point in space between
them, making them a binary system.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.029
The only other planet with a surprisingly
large moon is, you guessed it, Earth!

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:13.120
The Moon is a little more than a quarter the
size of the Earth, large enough that both

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.180
bodies orbit a point just slightly off the
Earth’s centre.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.790
Pluto and Charon are also tidally locked to
one another, always showing the same face

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:20.790
to each other.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.840
It’s a rare arrangement and, you guessed
it, the only other such system is our Earth-Moon

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.840
system.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.430
Notice how you only see one face of the Moon?

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.939
It’s tidally locked to the Earth so we’ll
never see the far side from home!

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.512
So with Pluto we have a celestial body with
a nitrogen-rich atmosphere escaping at an

00:02:34.512 --> 00:02:38.980
alarming rate and a relatively massive moon
showing the safe face to that planet…

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.329
Scientists want to understand all these features
because they’re fascinating, but if we learn

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.969
something about our own planet in the process
all the better, because it might help in our

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:47.590
future search for life on other planets.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.349
In the meantime here on Earth and on the not-so-distant
horizon, Toyota is fueling the future with

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.469
the new Toyota Mirai.

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:57.250
Using the most abundant element in the universe,
Hydrogen, the new Mirai is looking to the

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.870
future with sustainability in mind.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.120
So, how excited are you guys to get to Pluto?

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.720
Really excited, or totally beside yourself
giddy excited!
