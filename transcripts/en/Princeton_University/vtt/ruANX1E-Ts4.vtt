MARK BEISSINGER:
So Global Seminars

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.330
is a small group experiential
learning course offered

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.740
by Princeton, by the Princeton
Institute for International

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.650
and Regional Studies.


00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.470
We take a small group
of Princeton students

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.740
to a location around
the world, teach them

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.040
a course on a topic
in that place,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.900
have them interact
with the subjects

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.490
that they're learning
about in the classroom.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.440
So they go out to
sites that they're

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.130
learning about in
the classroom, maybe

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.770
they visit an ancient
site or a museum.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.710
They have experts come
into the classroom who

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.180
tell them about the
various aspects of what

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.110
they're learning.


00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.500
These are things that they can't
do on the Princeton campus.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.500
So they have this
experiential element.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.920
VICTORIA SEYOUM:
It was definitely

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.200
one of the highlights of
my Princeton experience.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.480
We were able to be in class
and discuss the Roman ghettos.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.120
And then hours
later, we would be

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.800
walking through the
Roman ghettos, actually,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.900
there is real time.


00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.710
So I think that sort of learning
experience is very unique.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.450
And it's something
that I'm really

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.000
grateful that I had the
opportunity to be a part of.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.370
MAYA WAHRMAN:
Well, I think being

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.450
able to take a class on a
place while you're there

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.940
for the time is really
invaluable, because even little

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.760
cultural interactions
that-- especially,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.100
because we were kind of an
anthropology based seminar--

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.180
that we're learning about.


00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.260
We're reading about how men and
women interact in public, how

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.890
people treat their children,
and then you go to the market

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.840
and you see that.


00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.630
AVANEESH NARLA: I think
the best part of it

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.680
was that we were so immersed
in the entire experience.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.030
And we had this
group of people who

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.400
came from a diversity
of academic interest.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.390
I studied something
else and other people

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.600
studied economics and so forth.


00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.600
All of us shared a
passion for a language,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.280
and this emotion really helped
us understand language better

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.540
and how it plays an important
role in each other lives.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.000
GHITA GUESSOUS: As
a science major,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.080
I don't get to think about
a lot of the philosophical

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.630
implications of modern things.


00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.990
And photography's a
very modern technology.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.460
And it was very
valuable for me to be

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.310
able to think for an
extended period of time

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.440
about all these themes,
about how photography relates

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.420
to things like appearances,
and death, and life, and light,

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.210
and shadows, and all of these
dichotomies in everyday life

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.130
MARK BEISSINGER: So all
of the global seminars

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.150
are faculty driven
in the sense that we

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.490
go to places that the
faculty know about,

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.300
are experts about
where they want to go.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.280
The people that we have
teaching these seminars

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.030
are some of the
world's leading experts

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.840
on those particular societies.


00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.800
ZACH RUCHMAN: The
relationship that I developed

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.250
with the professor to say
served as a mentor for me

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.320
throughout my entire Princeton
career, and he continues too.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.140
I still see him when
I'm in New York.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.890
We grab drinks.


00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.540
We grab dinner.


00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.240
It was much easier to
develop that relationship

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.800
on that seminar when we were
all together for six weeks

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.220
than it would have been
on campus when there

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.010
were so many distractions
and there were so

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.830
many things to do.


00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.880
And being in one
place for six weeks

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.880
and just focusing on
one subject really

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.390
allowed that
relationship to develop.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.930
MARK BEISSINGER:
What stands out most

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.930
are the experiences
that students have,

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.540
and those are things that
they just don't forget.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.460
The ways in which they've
connected with society, just

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.270
the things that they've seen,
the kind of learning that

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.290
takes place, they praise
that over and over again.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.040
MAYA WAHRMAN: What the
Global Seminar does

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.580
is you are there specifically
for the purpose of being there

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.010
and for soaking in that place.


00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.800
And I would say you should
do a Global Seminar.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.090
If you're thinking about
it, go to the place

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.710
that excites you
most, that would maybe

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.340
be hardest for you get to.


00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.130
Try all the foods.


00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.490
Really try to kind of
get in deep, I would say.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.540
