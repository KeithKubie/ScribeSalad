00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.850
To check our understanding of
the Floyd-Warshall algorithm,

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.689
let's do an iteration as an exercise.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:10.794
Suppose that the table d is in the state
below after the k=3 iteration.

00:00:10.794 --> 00:00:16.300
Which is where vertex 3 was allowed to
be an intermediate vertex along a path.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.560
I want you to fill in the table
on the right with the values of d

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.119
after the final iteration,
where k is equal to 4.
