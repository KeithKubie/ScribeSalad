00:00:02.301 --> 00:00:07.673
NARRATOR: Baalbek, Lebanon,
the 9,000-year-old Temple

00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:12.478
of Jupiter contains three of
the largest monolithic stones

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:17.150
in the world, weighing
approximately 1,000 tons,

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:21.387
or two million pounds each.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.126
Pumapunku, Bolivia, scattered
across a high desert plateau

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:31.164
are precisely-cut,
100 ton blocks,

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:35.168
believed to date back
at least 2,000 years,

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:37.037
and perhaps much earlier.

00:00:39.872 --> 00:00:43.409
The Giza Plateau, Egypt.

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:46.379 line:0%
The Great Pyramid is
built from more than 2.3

00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:49.382 line:0%
million limestone
bricks, each weighing

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:54.587 line:7%
a staggering 5,000 pounds.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.690 line:0%
All around the world
stand colossal monuments

00:00:57.723 --> 00:01:02.595 line:0%
to mankind's ancient past,
gigantic structures that

00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:07.200 line:0%
have endured for thousands of
years, built with stone blocks

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:10.603 line:0%
so massive, that modern
builders have not even

00:01:10.636 --> 00:01:12.372 line:7%
attempted to duplicate them.

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:18.344
[machinery whirring]

00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:25.885 line:0%
 Our 988 Cat loader can
probably lift a 22 ton

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:27.887 line:7%
boulder, just for perspective.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.225 line:0%
And it can probably roll
and drag along the ground

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:34.627 line:7%
maybe a 40 ton boulder.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.230
But when you're talking
a 50 ton boulder,

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:42.235
then we need to bring in cranes,
hydraulic jacks, steel beams,

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:43.469
girders.

00:01:43.502 --> 00:01:44.637
It's a whole nother
set of tools, even

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.906
with modern day technology.

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.741
I mean, I can only
imagine how they

00:01:48.774 --> 00:01:50.910
would move boulders that size.

00:01:50.943 --> 00:01:52.845
It baffles my mind.

00:01:52.878 --> 00:01:53.913
I have no idea.

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:54.847
It's crazy to think about.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.250
[music playing]

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.784
NARRATOR: How is it
possible that 10,000

00:01:58.817 --> 00:02:01.721
years ago, our ancestors
moved around the most

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:04.390
massive of stones?

00:02:04.423 --> 00:02:07.860 line:0%
The answer is either another
previous super civilization

00:02:07.893 --> 00:02:13.366 line:0%
existed here on Earth, or
extraterrestrials imparting

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.669 line:7%
technological knowledge to us.

00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:20.806 line:0%
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest such structures provide

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:24.377 line:0%
physical evidence that
extraterrestrial beings

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.615 line:0%
visited Earth and assisted our
ancestors in the distant past.

00:02:29.648 --> 00:02:32.418 line:0%
And each of these three
megalithic sites--

00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:34.687 line:7%
as well as numerous others--

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.523 line:0%
have very specific
stories behind them that

00:02:37.556 --> 00:02:40.560 line:7%
say they were built not by men.

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:46.299
But by the gods using
the power of levitation.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:49.802
GIORGIO: Some ancient
mythologies speak of the fact

00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:54.907
that some of these stones were
put into place with sound,

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.279
that these things all of a
sudden levitated into place.

00:03:00.312 --> 00:03:04.817
What the local legend of
Stonehenge talks about

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.688
is that those big
stones were transported

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:10.256
by way of levitation.

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:12.525
[music playing]

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:16.395
NARRATOR: Similar to the
mythical story of Stonehenge,

00:03:16.428 --> 00:03:18.864
the ancient legends
of Bolivia say

00:03:18.897 --> 00:03:21.534
that the megalithic
stones of Pumapunku

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:25.004
were floated into place.

00:03:25.037 --> 00:03:29.875
In the 5th century BC, the
Greek historian Herodotus

00:03:29.908 --> 00:03:32.345
wrote that the Egyptians
were given knowledge

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:35.414
from the guardians of
the sky on how to float

00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:37.750
the massive limestone
blocks with which

00:03:37.783 --> 00:03:40.620
they built the Great Pyramid.

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:43.556 line:0%
 What we see is the
very real possibility

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:46.425 line:0%
that extraterrestrial
civilizations visited Earth

00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:49.762 line:0%
all throughout the world,
and that each time they did,

00:03:49.795 --> 00:03:53.499 line:0%
they felt it was very important
to impart this sacred knowledge

00:03:53.532 --> 00:03:58.838 line:0%
about the importance of acoustic
frequencies and the keys

00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:02.908 line:0%
to unlocking the
mysteries of the universe.

00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:05.044
NARRATOR: The
University of Bristol,

00:04:05.077 --> 00:04:11.617
England, January 17, 2017.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.920
Researchers unveil a
prototype for what they call

00:04:14.953 --> 00:04:19.458
a portable tractor
beam, a handheld device

00:04:19.491 --> 00:04:22.862
that can levitate small
objects using only sound waves.

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:24.964
[music playing]

00:04:27.566 --> 00:04:29.335 line:0%
 Recently, the
University of Bristol

00:04:29.368 --> 00:04:32.738 line:0%
came up with a handheld device
with an array of speakers that

00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:37.343 line:0%
allows the holder of this to
actually focus sound waves

00:04:37.376 --> 00:04:40.613 line:0%
and sound waves alone,
and then levitate

00:04:40.646 --> 00:04:42.815 line:7%
small pieces of light material.

00:04:45.584 --> 00:04:47.486
When we look at this
portable tractor beam,

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:50.556
can we extrapolate the idea
that this is a technology

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:53.959
in its infancy, where
in ancient times,

00:04:53.992 --> 00:04:57.392
it was actually being used
to levitate large stones.
