00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
&gt;&gt; We're about to have Margery Krevsky, the
author of Sirens of

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.600
Chrome, the enduring allure of [INAUDIBLE].
Margery co-founded Productions Plus located

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.070
in Bingham Farms, Michigan,
in 1981 and the agency has quickly grown -- grew

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.420
to one of the major
players in selecting and training talent for

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.420
auto shows.
Productions Plus has recently evolved to become

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.470
a full-fledged talent
management firm and has offices in LA and

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.330
Chicago.
Margery and Productions Plus, the talent shop

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.509
are also involved in
booking talent for conventions, toy shows,

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:19.369
food demonstrations and
movies being filmed in Michigan, which is

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:27.300
exciting.
So without further ado, please help me in

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.710
welcoming our guest, Margery
Krevsky.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.730
MARGERY KREVSKY: Thank you, thank you.
And it's wonderful to be here and hello to

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.610
everyone out there in
simulcast land, too.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.400
Today, I'm going to take you through Sirens
of Chrome.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:01:01.160
You have the book in your hand and Sirens
of Chrome -- that's the name

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.490
that I give to people, the models, that work
the auto shows.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.420
It's not just the cars that are wonderful,
although if you read a quote

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.606
from me in the newspaper, it will be at the
auto show, the cars are the

00:01:15.606 --> 00:01:19.530
stars.
But we have to remember that cars cannot talk.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.220
They are fabulous, magnificent, mute, beautiful
creations but they can

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.520
not talk so someone has to talk for them.
So from the beginning of auto show history,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.310
someone has had to do it.
So I'm going to take you on that ride.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.930
And it is a very interesting ride of history,
but I'm going to tie it

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.080
into fashion too, just because I'm a girl
and I like fashion, so we're

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.260
going to do that.
And we are going to compare some of the automotive

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.960
fashion to the
regular fashions that people wore in those

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.090
days too.
So it's kind of a multi-layered talk, Sirens

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.180
of Chrome.
I'm very proud that Sirens of Chrome did win

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.420
in Michigan one of the
2009 most notable books, and it sure doesn't

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.410
hurt that Michigan is
known as the car state.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.250
And this is the first section of my talk talked
Awakening the Wheels,

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.230
and our timeframe is 1900 to 1920.
People ask me when did the first auto show

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.650
begin?
Well, there's a big fight between Chicago

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.880
and New York about where it
really started.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.090
And from the research I've done, I think that
at the Chicago coliseum

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.400
and the first Sirens of Chrome or product
specialists were not gorgeous

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.510
models, were not gorgeous men or women -- you
have to remember the year

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.270
was 1905 and people didn't even know if cars
really worked.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.120
Most people had transportation they had a
horse and buggy, and they

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.989
weren't sure that a car, a mechanism, a machine
could really be

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.701
reliable enough.
So the people you see in this picture up here

00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:06.110
are a family, and the
gentleman is a physician because he did house

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.680
calls.
They did those in those days.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.750
And if the physician chose a car over a horse
and buggy, that was a

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.330
pretty strong statement.
So the first product specialist or Sirens

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.760
of Chrome usually were
families because cars were marketed to families.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:32.150
Now we are in Michigan and, of course, Detroit
is known as Motor City

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.920
and the very first show in Detroit was at
the Detroit fairgrounds in

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.250
1908 and this is a very rare photograph of
that.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:47.040
Notice the name signs on here.
Daimler, which was one time was a very significant

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.379
name in car
manufacturing.

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:57.040
And also over here, it says McKay in Auto-motion.
At the time Henry Ford started to create his

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.870
concept of a car in an
assembly line, he had an engineering background

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.909
and there were hundreds
of other engineers, especially in Michigan

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.430
and on the East Coast who
thought I can make cars too.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.650
And they could.
They were many different cars made.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.570
The only difference was they were engineers,
they could create a car,

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:25.130
but you had to know how to create lots of
cars and then market them.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.750
Now we're going into the Awakening of the
Wheels, 1900 to 1920, and

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.370
this is when Detroit really became nicknamed
the Motor City.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:40.540
You go back in time to the 1920s, and I have
the fashion photographs up

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.020
here and they are in the book.
Fashions changed radically.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.520
They were pretty hip for their days.
Women's skirts came up, hair got cut, makeup

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.840
became acceptable, and
people began to look at cars not only as basic

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:03.120
transportation but also
it began to have a fun element with it also.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.930
And here is a very interesting poster of the
advertising of one of the

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:17.169
first Detroit auto shows.
So America gets Detroit as the Motor City.

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:23.630
The next 1920 to 1940 I call the Combustible
Years, because these were

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:30.860
years when engineering and the creation of
motors and things that made

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.900
motors work better became created.
And at the middle, I have a picture of the

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.699
human hood ornament.
And remember this, we're going to see this

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.759
motif carry out in every
decade.

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:46.280
In fact if you go to the Detroit auto show
which opens on January 16,

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.020
you may even see a reproduction of many of
this.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.430
In the combustible years, what happens to
cars?

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:58.530
You had two slides of previous cars where
they were kind of boxy, they

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.440
were always in black, but now we get curved
bumpers, sleek, shiny

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.360
hoods, and the beginning of the human hood
ornament theme.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:15.600
The combustible years, 1920 to 1940, Ford
productions soars.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:22.770
Of course, being from Michigan, the name Ford
is a very, very strong

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:28.150
element in the consciousness not only of the
state but also the United

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.130
States.
But the Ford production soared to -- and you

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:37.300
will see in the corner --
25 million automobiles meaning that that reached

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:43.700
across the nation.
Also in 1930, a very significant piece of

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.680
art was done at the Detroit
Institute of Art by Diego Rivera.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.910
Ford commissioned him to do the murals in
the center lobby.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:07:01.550
And if you haven't seen them, it's really
a statement of how the Ford

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.170
industry and the automotive industry becomes
engrained in American

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:08.280
culture.
Now one of the things I'm going to do along

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.940
with just talk is I'm going
to also show you some fashions.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:19.410
And I'm going to begin with a fashion and
Renee if you are come out

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:20.420
here.
This is Renee.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:25.770
Renee is not just a model Renee is a Sirens
of Chrome.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:31.450
Renee it a model but she has been a product
specialist for the auto

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:36.740
show floor all around the country for five
years working for Nissan.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:44.680
And she is wearing vintage auto show clothes.
These are clothes that stood beside these

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.990
magnificent, mute vehicles
and talked about them.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:56.300
The dress organza, the year 1950, and she's
carrying with her the car

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:03.230
to which the dress made coordinates.
The color of the dress is pretty much the

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:09.070
same color as a 1950 Ford.
Now go back in color history a little bit,

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:14.070
this was very radical, very
avant-garde and very, very forward for 1950.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:21.910
But, of course, the dress is very lovely.
It's still in fashion now.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:27.750
If I could fit in it, I would wear it at some
point also.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.540
Thank you, Renee.
And she'll be back with three other outfits.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:34.070
But we're going to go to the combustible years
between 1920 and 1940

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:41.229
and this picture from 1938 is one of the first
documented pictures of

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:45.939
women, Sirens of Chrome, who are literally
talking about an engine.

00:08:45.939 --> 00:08:50.089
They're performing a skit demonstrating the
workings of the Chevrolet

00:08:50.089 --> 00:08:55.319
engine.
And if you could, in the -- if you could just

00:08:55.319 --> 00:08:59.850
jump into that picture,
you would see the energy that this created

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.100
at the auto shows.
They had people in very glamorous gowns, and

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:08.459
notice the picture book
has and the gloves talking about the inside

00:09:08.459 --> 00:09:12.619
of the engine.
Started in this era and continues.

00:09:12.619 --> 00:09:18.800
If you'll notice the GM picture, 1936, people
packed to the auto shows.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.800
The auto show began to be part of the Americana
culture people wanted

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.300
to go there.
It was definitely part of America.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:31.579
And it wasn't just for guys who like cars.
It was for the entire family.

00:09:31.579 --> 00:09:39.439
Because people began to realize, even in the
1920s to the 1940s that

00:09:39.439 --> 00:09:44.040
women were very interested especially in the
interiors of the cars and

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:52.450
the colors.
In the combustible years, 1920 to 1940, show

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.300
business really got into
the act.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:01.430
The picture that you see here from 1939, there's
no business like car

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:04.119
business.
There was a phenomena is America there called

00:10:04.119 --> 00:10:07.429
the Ziegfield Follies.
This phenomena became interpreted into the

00:10:07.429 --> 00:10:12.569
auto shows and many of the
preview nights that opened the auto shows

00:10:12.569 --> 00:10:17.589
began with extravaganzas that
were very similar to the Ziegfield Follies.

00:10:17.589 --> 00:10:22.209
However, instead of having the star name come
out, they would have

00:10:22.209 --> 00:10:26.619
chorus girls and they would have musicians
and magicians and songs but

00:10:26.619 --> 00:10:32.499
it was the star that came out that was human,
the star was the car

00:10:32.499 --> 00:10:38.079
surrounded by all of this.
And here is a 1927 hood ornament, actually

00:10:38.079 --> 00:10:43.290
she is one of the Marion
Morgan dancers of the year who was hired by

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:48.240
Packard to go around the
country doing interpretive dance around the

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:57.900
cars.
The Apex of Excess, 1940 to 1960.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:03.499
And I call this the Apex of Excess for this
era and there was also

00:11:03.499 --> 00:11:08.600
another era of excess and that was in the
1980s.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:13.639
Here is our hood ornament, again, a Jean Seberg,
the actress, like

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:15.749
look.
Very sleek.

00:11:15.749 --> 00:11:21.899
Very dramatic.
And what was excessive about automobiles at

00:11:21.899 --> 00:11:23.890
this time?
Excessive chrome.

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:28.730
You'll notice in the very upper right of the
Buick, the very massive,

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:36.249
very strong grill on the front, the curves,
the fins, and the bumpers

00:11:36.249 --> 00:11:39.350
and right at the middle top, I found this
wonderful photograph of

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:46.069
fashion at the time which was also excess,
and that is the jacket with

00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:52.500
a modified hip line having almost wings.
This was at the beginning of the 1930s and

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:58.079
saw that that really related
to what was happening in automobiles at the

00:11:58.079 --> 00:12:06.129
time too.
The warriors came, 1940 to 1944, something

00:12:06.129 --> 00:12:09.209
very interesting happened in
our country.

00:12:09.209 --> 00:12:15.439
We had all of these great assembly lines that
were making major cars

00:12:15.439 --> 00:12:29.540
for manufacturers.
But during the war, from 1942 to 1944, they

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:38.510
all stopped.
Literally, car manufacturing stopped during

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:47.639
that time so that these
companies could produce tanks and munitions

00:12:47.639 --> 00:12:56.759
for the war.
But some of the advertising and the marketing

00:12:56.759 --> 00:13:14.450
still remained because
there were still a lot of cars out there and

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:21.910
used cars that could be
sold.

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:43.240
So this picture called Holding Down the Fort
from 1942 is one of those

00:13:43.240 --> 00:14:40.309
rare photographs.
If you look very carefully in this photograph,

00:14:40.309 --> 00:14:57.889
it's in the book that
you have, there is a license plate on the

00:14:57.889 --> 00:15:01.619
front and it has the initials
of 41.

00:15:01.619 --> 00:15:10.369
That is the first recorded instance of a vanity
plate.

00:15:10.369 --> 00:15:22.069
So Ford really started the vanity plate.
In 1943, when some of the soldiers started

00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:36.569
to come back from the war,
ads began to run such as the one you see on

00:15:36.569 --> 00:15:40.790
the right announcing that
you're coming back in with the saying you're

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:49.109
on the beam, which is I
think a naval expression, I was told, in 1943.

00:15:49.109 --> 00:15:53.199
So we come back -- hello?
[PAUSE]

00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:55.239
We come back --

00:15:55.239 --> 00:15:56.239
[PAUSE]

00:15:56.239 --> 00:16:16.419
Our next era is 1940 to 1960.
And in 1960 and this was my age, I love

00:16:16.419 --> 00:16:29.589
the 60s.
And I have Renee over here.

00:16:29.589 --> 00:16:41.699
Renee do you want to come in?
This is my absolute favorite that you're going

00:16:41.699 --> 00:16:47.429
to see today.
Psychedelic power, 1960s.

00:16:47.429 --> 00:17:05.199
I love the dress, but you have to know what
car this stood beside, the

00:17:05.199 --> 00:17:15.329
1960s, of course the group was the Beatles.
And Rolls Royce created for John Lennon, the

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:22.370
Rolls Royce Phantom, the
psychedelic phantom.

00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:27.860
And this car actually was --
Thank you.

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:28.860
[PAUSE]

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:33.690
This car actually was at Greenfield Village,
I think was about a year

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:44.799
ago, and I remember going to see it, and taking
this dress to just

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:54.179
stand beside it.
And it is a beautiful combination of the Siren

00:17:54.179 --> 00:17:58.659
of Chrome in the perfect
dress with the perfect car that really is

00:17:58.659 --> 00:18:03.130
a historical car.
And used a great deal, I understand, by John

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:04.929
Lennon who really loved
it.

00:18:04.929 --> 00:18:05.929
Thank you.

00:18:05.929 --> 00:18:18.100
Now what else happened in the 1940s to the
1960s?

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:27.201
Imports began.
That may be a bad word in Detroit, but it

00:18:27.201 --> 00:18:36.430
did happen.
And if you look at the bottom, BMW began with

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:42.970
their small little car
the i7. This summer I sat in an i7 at the

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:49.580
Sloan Museum when they had
one of their car shows.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:19:00.690
It's very small, it's very cramped.
I'm 5'9", but it sure is a cute little car.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:04.110
And they were able to get all of these lovely
sirens to come in the

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:10.380
car.
Also what's happening in the Apex of Excess

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:18.049
is in the middle you see a,
an ad that appeared in Life magazine called

00:19:18.049 --> 00:19:24.519
Fashion on Parade.
And what was happening in automotive design

00:19:24.519 --> 00:19:35.860
was they decided, you know,
we have all these designers, and they're these

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:42.509
designers who are just
looking at cars, but if we were to look at

00:19:42.509 --> 00:19:44.519
what was happening in
women's fashion.

00:19:44.519 --> 00:19:48.029
So automotive designers and this started with
General Motors asked a

00:19:48.029 --> 00:19:52.950
designer at the time, Hattie Carnegie, to
design a dress or an ensemble

00:19:52.950 --> 00:20:01.659
for each one of their brands.
And that is in the book.

00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:06.639
And it is a great panorama of fashion and
car design for that era.

00:20:06.639 --> 00:20:13.080
And I love the look of the concept sports
cars.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:22.919
Sport cars have pretty much always been with
us, but especially in the

00:20:22.919 --> 00:20:32.080
1950s, they started to become very, very glamorous.
And notice the very glamorous Siren of Chrome

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:36.700
that they have beside
that sports car.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:44.050
Now Apex of Excess.
This one picture on the left, the Chicago

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:48.510
Auto Show, Cadillac debutante
concept car from 1950.

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:57.580
One of the reasons that I wrote this book
is whenever I go out to

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:05.909
dinner, I have lots of car stories to tell.
Some of them I think are true.

00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:13.580
Some of theme I know are true.
And some are probably fantasy.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:24.929
This car picture I thought was fantasy.
I then heard that Cadillac in the 1950s developed

00:21:24.929 --> 00:21:31.789
a concept car and on
the inside, the interior was lined with Somali

00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:37.909
leopard pelts.
Now I did not think that was true.

00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:41.370
But it was a great story to tell.
The research for this book was mainly done

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:46.289
at the NAHC, the National
Automotive Historical Collection at the Skillman

00:21:46.289 --> 00:21:58.570
Library in Detroit,
and I mentioned this story to one of the librarians,

00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:04.169
and she said, you
know, I think that might be true.

00:22:04.169 --> 00:22:16.179
I think I've seen that picture.
So, you know how you're supposed to be very

00:22:16.179 --> 00:22:24.299
quiet at a library?
She brought the picture and she put it down

00:22:24.299 --> 00:22:35.490
in front of me.
And I had to just scream because it really,

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:47.440
really was true.
Because people had been telling me that -- it

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:56.509
is so politically
incorrect to do now, that in the 50s they

00:22:56.509 --> 00:23:02.610
couldn't even conceive it --
but they did.

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:12.810
And notice the Siren of Chrome, or the model,
who is in the car, she

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:19.629
has a dress with complimentary color in custom
Somali leopard.

00:23:19.629 --> 00:23:23.340
And I think it took -- I have it listed in
the book -- over a hundred

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:31.630
skins to, to create that.
The other thing that is amusing in this time

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:41.600
in the 1950s Sirens of
Chrome were not all on the auto show floor.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:53.330
Television was a very, very big thing.
And Dinah Shore who is the singer you see

00:23:53.330 --> 00:24:06.020
in that sports car, in the
Chevrolet sports car, was on TV every week

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:15.019
and she ended her show with
a little song See the USA in your Chevrolet

00:24:15.019 --> 00:24:23.559
and that became a thought
that just went through your head all week.

00:24:23.559 --> 00:24:39.019
And she appeared for Chevrolet and General
Motors at many auto shows

00:24:39.019 --> 00:24:48.120
around the country.
And thus began stars, movie stars, songstresses,

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.370
singers who
represented cars.

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:56.980
And here are other famous people who are Sirens
of Chrome.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:04.409
There is Cary Grant at the BMW i7.
Gorgeous Cary Grant.

00:25:04.409 --> 00:25:13.419
There there's a wonderful story behind this.
This was taken -- this was taken in France

00:25:13.419 --> 00:25:21.789
just after he and Grace
Kelly had completed their Alfred Hitchcock

00:25:21.789 --> 00:25:26.929
movie and he very much want
today stay in Europe.

00:25:26.929 --> 00:25:32.679
And so the contract with BMW permitted him
a very luxurious summer

00:25:32.679 --> 00:25:36.249
there.
And then Greta Garbo.

00:25:36.249 --> 00:25:51.280
Greta Garbo was very famous for her beautiful
legs and so when Mercedes

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:57.169
brought out the new bench-type of seating
at the Detroit Auto Show,

00:25:57.169 --> 00:26:01.429
they brought in Greta Garbo to display this
beautiful leather seating.

00:26:01.429 --> 00:26:08.780
And there she is luxuriously draped on the
seat with her beautiful mink

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:14.110
coat.
And then at the top, Miss Americas.

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:22.970
Literally from the beginning of the 50s until
very, very recently

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:31.129
[INAUDIBLE] company usually General Motors,
and they travelled all over

00:26:31.129 --> 00:26:38.649
the United States and went to dealerships.
[INAUDIBLE] from 1956 she's standing [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:38.649 --> 00:26:45.169
Detroit, and behind
them are all of the sirens of the automotive

00:26:45.169 --> 00:26:48.799
business.
And then below it are the starlets.

00:26:48.799 --> 00:26:55.640
All the Sirens of Chrome maybe you don't know
their names, but they

00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:04.400
worked very hard to bring glamour and information
to the, to the auto

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:11.549
show.
Apex of Excess, 1940 to 1960, we continue

00:27:11.549 --> 00:27:17.900
with very unusual cars like
James Bond car.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:27.289
You know, all those early James Bond movies,
they always had those

00:27:27.289 --> 00:27:36.549
great cars, those were one of the biggest
draws to the auto show

00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:43.830
especially in the 1960s it certainly didn't
hurt that some of the

00:27:43.830 --> 00:28:10.519
starlets would come along with the stars.
You see Jaguar beginning to make a very big

00:28:10.519 --> 00:28:17.429
presence at auto shows.
And Ford motor company with this great photograph

00:28:17.429 --> 00:28:25.009
on the right one of
their concept cars, this is called a uni-wheel

00:28:25.009 --> 00:28:31.419
car.
One wheel that would balance the entire car.

00:28:31.419 --> 00:28:38.850
Very unusual concept, but what else is unusual
about the photograph

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:50.760
fashion-wise was think of the 1960s.
Women wearing pants at the beginning of the

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.789
1960s was very, very
fashion forward.

00:28:53.789 --> 00:29:00.691
So when you look at these photos now, and
you have to think about where

00:29:00.691 --> 00:29:10.820
did they -- where did they come from.
1960s, the car becomes the chick magnet.

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:20.740
The automobile is so engrained in the [INAUDIBLE]
of Americana and the

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.169
styling is so sensational and sexy that it
does become a chick magnet.

00:29:23.169 --> 00:29:32.740
And now Renee, let's take our next wardrobe.
We're going to ahead about 20 years, this

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:36.649
is 1980.
And do you remember me talking about the Apex

00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:42.100
of Excess?
In the 1980s, you can't over-design anything

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:46.389
anymore.
You had ruffles, ruches, sequins, pearls.

00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:51.980
But this is what was happening on the auto
show floor in the 1980s.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:30:02.030
And this was also the time a Farrah Fawcett,
hair and big hairdos.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:12.430
And the car that she has is the very special
version of the Corvette

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:22.070
and of course, the Corvette is one of the
signals of great looking,

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:27.490
sexy cars.
I'll just quote you the name of the color

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:30.990
of that pink, it's called
Bitchin' Pink.

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:38.429
And I didn't name it.
That came from the creative team that did

00:30:38.429 --> 00:30:43.039
that.
And this was another outfit that was on the

00:30:43.039 --> 00:30:47.269
floor of the auto show.
Thank you, Renee.

00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:57.309
Then, we continue from chick magnet to muscle
car mania in the 1970s.

00:30:57.309 --> 00:31:14.649
And the dress that you saw that she wore from
the 1960s could also go

00:31:14.649 --> 00:31:21.220
into this.
You will notice cars began to have car detailing.

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:29.830
And they have a lot of work that's done in
the front, cut out in the

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:39.460
front, grills are different they're not just
massive, they may be

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:44.139
indented.
So the muscle car mania began.

00:31:44.139 --> 00:31:52.629
And in fact on Woodward Avenue in Detroit
every August, the Dream

00:31:52.629 --> 00:31:56.970
Cruise brings out the best of these muscle
cars.

00:31:56.970 --> 00:32:02.389
Something happened during the 1970s and 1980s
in the muscle car

00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:08.830
segment.
And that is the racing circuit began.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:18.129
We always had racing ever since cars could
go on a track we have had

00:32:18.129 --> 00:32:24.350
racing.
But it really started to take hold during

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:28.269
the 70s and 80s.
Every automotive company decided they would

00:32:28.269 --> 00:32:31.399
have either their own
racing team or they would support a, a vehicle.

00:32:31.399 --> 00:32:39.730
So we begin to see also a lot of advertising
on cars during the racing

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:49.509
circuit also.
And here is [INAUDIBLE] excitement and I put

00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:57.210
in this slide because this
slide is General Motors, Pontiac Fiero.

00:32:57.210 --> 00:33:02.019
The name play is going away but it certainly
was an exciting time at

00:33:02.019 --> 00:33:10.600
the auto shows.
Because the color of Fiero red was bright,

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:22.919
sexy, and very identifiable.
And also this was the beginning of creating

00:33:22.919 --> 00:33:32.159
T-shirts and memorabilia in
the special colors of those cars.

00:33:32.159 --> 00:33:42.000
And now we come to the present what happens
at auto shows.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:54.590
We now have divas that become Sirens of Chrome,
and here is Celine Dion

00:33:54.590 --> 00:34:01.559
doing a -- for the celebrity black tie evening,
singing for Chrysler.

00:34:01.559 --> 00:34:12.150
And then at present shows, we have Sirens
of Chrome that are just very

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:21.069
beautiful around an Mitsubishi SST.
And auto shows are not only part of America,

00:34:21.069 --> 00:34:28.809
[INAUDIBLE] but they are all over the world.
And I've taken most of these pictures except

00:34:28.809 --> 00:34:33.829
the one in Shanghai.
There's a show every two years in Paris, show

00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:36.710
in Frankfurt, I took
pictures from there.

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:42.859
And it is really global.
Almost every major city in the world hosts

00:34:42.859 --> 00:34:47.690
some kind of auto show.
And here we go into the future.

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:56.110
The power of the auto show which we will see
here in Detroit in the

00:34:56.110 --> 00:35:02.410
next couple weeks, this is a picture of the
press conference.

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:21.599
And I love this Toyota i-unit, because not
only do you see cars but you

00:35:21.599 --> 00:35:33.691
see concepts of other vehicles that the designers
are working on.

00:35:33.691 --> 00:35:43.380
And then I love this picture from -- from
the 1950s, this is the Monte

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:54.430
Carlo, the Pontiac Monte Carlo.
And at that time, the big siren of the screen

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:59.869
was Gina Lollobrigida.
So they decided to do three very attractive

00:35:59.869 --> 00:36:06.410
look-a-likes for that.
So that gives you a little overview of Sirens

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:12.970
of Chrome.
And do you have any questions about cars?

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:21.309
The era? The fashions or
the people that participated in it?

00:36:21.309 --> 00:36:22.309
Sure?

00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:23.309
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:23.309 --> 00:36:30.401
MARGERY KREVSKY: That's correct.
So the question is beside being models and

00:36:30.401 --> 00:36:38.000
probably looking attractive
do you have to know about the car?

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.950
You have to be a gear head.
And that's very deceiving sometimes.

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:49.200
Because when you go on the auto show floor,
you'll see people and they

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.640
look like models, and you'll think oh, that's
a very attractive man or

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.640
women -- and I say man or woman because there
are both men and women

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:57.160
that are product specialists -- but all of
them go through a very

00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:09.640
rigorous training program.
I know just within my company we handle some

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:24.470
of those training programs
and most of them are at least five days.

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:27.250
You learn about the culture of the automotive
company.

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:33.160
You learn about each model.
You learn about some of the future things

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:37.530
that they're doing, and you
learn about, usually the top 10 or 20 questions

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:39.460
that people might ask
about the vehicle.

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:43.440
Although you can never know everything, that
you have a source to go

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.440
to.
But you can talk car.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.460
You know about the business.
You know how an engine works.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:50.150
You know what a carburetor is.
You know what a [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:56.359
You know what a fuel injection engine is,
and also you can explain

00:37:56.359 --> 00:38:02.680
today hybrid technology because a lot of people
are interested in green

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:08.890
and green vehicles, and what that means.
So before we take another question, I want

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:13.819
to show you our final dress
which is from the 1980s.

00:38:13.819 --> 00:38:16.520
And I always use this one for last because
this is the Bob

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.210
Mackie-designed dress.
And I showed you the Pontiac Fiero.

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:24.069
This goes with the Pontiac Fiero and is called
the Flame Dress and was

00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:43.079
one of four dresses he designed for Pontiac.
Actually some day this dress will probably

00:38:43.079 --> 00:39:02.220
be in a museum because in
1982, it was on the auto show floor, and I

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:08.880
believe it was also repeated
again in 1983.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:18.881
During that time Bob Mackie designed for movie
stars such as Cher and

00:39:18.881 --> 00:39:27.240
other very, very glamorous stars, and here
he took a turn at designing

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:33.631
for the auto show.
And other designers that designed for the

00:39:33.631 --> 00:39:40.480
auto show were Bill Blass,
Jeffery Dean, Halstead, all of the big names.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:45.980
So that is our flame dress.
Thank you, Renee.

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:51.620
So that was a good question.
So they had to be attractive, but they also

00:39:51.620 --> 00:40:00.460
have to be gear heads.
Because people are coming to the auto show,

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:26.320
sure they want to see the
car, but a lot of people really want to know

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:38.140
what the technology is and
what's under the hood and how is this one

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:40.630
different from the other
competitor.

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:43.610
Competitive information is a very important
part of the training.

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:48.060
And also part of the training is driving the
cars.

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:50.880
You can't talk a car unless you really driven
it and can talk about

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:53.119
it's take off.
You can say the car goes from 0 to 60 in like

00:40:53.119 --> 00:41:00.670
ten seconds, but until
you experience that, you really can't talk

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:05.420
about it intelligently.
So thank you for that question.

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:06.420
Any others?

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:07.420
[PAUSE]

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:08.420
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:11.980
MARGERY KREVSKY: Well I think that everyplace
that has an auto show

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.660
has a Siren of Chrome.
My area of expertise are the national auto

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:15.660
shows.
But certainly every hot rod show, every small

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:16.869
little parking lot that
says in the summer, we'll have at auto show

00:41:16.869 --> 00:41:24.010
here, so bring your car
out.

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:34.910
Cars and autos are just part of our DNA.
When I've travelled around the country to

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:40.510
my book signings, some of
the -- one of the first questions I'll ask

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:44.160
someone is what was your
first car?

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:51.329
And just like you can never forget your first
kiss, you never forget

00:41:51.329 --> 00:41:53.420
your first car.
What was your first car?

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:54.420
&gt;&gt; Dodge Caravan.

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:59.940
MARGERY KREVSKY: See? See?
And my was a VW beetle in turquoise, and I

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:06.000
even named the car.
We have such affection for cars in our -- in

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.859
our lives.
But yes.

00:42:07.859 --> 00:42:12.260
Every single motor show probably has a Siren
of Chrome standing beside

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:19.230
it.
And the reason is the same all over, and that

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:22.069
is the cars are hot,
they're great, they're historical or just

00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:23.190
loved by someone, but they
can't talk.

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:25.839
And so someone needs to talk about them because
we are interested in

00:42:25.839 --> 00:42:26.839
them.
Any other questions?

00:42:26.839 --> 00:42:27.839
Yes, Lindsey?

00:42:27.839 --> 00:42:28.839
&gt;&gt; How many models do you staff for the Detroit
auto show, for

00:42:28.839 --> 00:42:29.839
example?

00:42:29.839 --> 00:42:30.839
MARGERY KREVSKY: About 200.
Around 200.

00:42:30.839 --> 00:42:31.839
And someone in my office will correct me when
I get back and say, no,

00:42:31.839 --> 00:42:32.839
it was 250.
But that is a massive project but -- I want

00:42:32.839 --> 00:42:37.750
you to remember the first
auto show of the year does not start in Detroit.

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:38.750
The first auto show really is in September
and usually starts with the

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:42.869
Texas state fair which has the longest running
auto show of any city.

00:42:42.869 --> 00:42:43.869
That auto show which is part of their fair,
runs 30 days.

00:42:43.869 --> 00:42:45.630
Most auto shows run anywhere from 7 to 10-day
in major cities like

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:46.630
Detroit, New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Miami,
Los Angeles, and

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:47.630
Chicago.
And then most, what I would call, moderate,

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:48.630
medium cities have auto
shows also.

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:49.630
Buffalo, Providence, San Antonio, Texas, also
have auto shows.

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:50.630
So it's all over.
There are 73 auto shows all over the United

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:51.630
States from September until
May.

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:52.630
Then those shows stop and then summer events
begin with automotive.

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:53.630
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite auto show?

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:54.630
MARGERY KREVSKY: My personal favorite, besides
the Detroit Auto Show

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:55.630
which is where -- where I live, is I like
the Chicago Auto Show because

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:56.630
it's in the dead of winter there, and you
would think everyone would

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:57.630
want to stay just holed up in winter, but
it is amazing to me the

00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:58.630
families of the people that bring brave major
snowstorms to come to see

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:02.280
the auto show and the first day at the McCormick
Place at the auto show

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.910
people are lined up.
But you say "favorite."

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:07.372
They're are many favorite elements that I
have of other shows around

00:43:07.372 --> 00:43:09.190
the country, too.
For example, the San Diego Auto Show in California

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:11.119
you can't beat the
location.

00:43:11.119 --> 00:43:15.349
The San Francisco Auto Show which is usually
over Thanksgiving time,

00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:19.589
brings the holiday atmosphere to it because
it's usually open on

00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:22.670
Thanksgiving day.
People are filled with holiday spirit.

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:27.670
The New York Auto Show opens usually Good
Friday or the Saturday after

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:30.319
Good Friday, and so it's Easter and people
come through that show on

00:43:30.319 --> 00:43:33.230
Easter day all dressed up.
So it's a very wide, wide span, and I enjoy

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:34.230
them all.
Or you go down in Miami and people come through

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:36.109
there from South Beach
and that's a show in itself.

00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:37.109
Yes?

00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:38.109
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:38.109 --> 00:43:39.109
MARGERY KREVSKY: Well as far as innovation,
you can't keep the human

00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:40.109
spirit of creativity down.
So it can't be a relatively depressed economic

00:43:40.109 --> 00:43:41.109
time, but that created
creative spirit is still there.

00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:42.190
However what can be realistically interpreted
and what people will buy

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:44.400
is another thing that needs to be decided.
But the ideas that I hear coming out of automotive

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:45.400
companies that
design, the design studios are pretty amazing.

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.400
I was at the LA Auto Show last month, and
Honda had a press conference

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:47.400
and one of their main focuses during that
press conference was new

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.400
design.
They had their designers speak.

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:49.400
Their executive spoke, but mainly they focused
on some pretty

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.400
interesting new things that potentially could
come out.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.400
And most people now are very interested in
the hybrid cars, [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.400
I always like today think from 1900, the beginning
of my book, until

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.400
2008, that was phase one of the great automotive
industry.

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:54.470
I do believe we are seeing now in 2009, 2,010
that next, that next

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:56.780
venture, and I think it will be pretty exciting.
When you see historically in pictures where

00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:57.869
we went in a hundred years,
just imagine where we're going to go now just

00:43:57.869 --> 00:43:59.599
with the technology.
And my car right now, sure it drives great.

00:43:59.599 --> 00:44:09.760
But the technology in it is really great.
I can talk on the phone, it will tell me where

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:12.240
to go, it will tell me
if I'm -- if I'm going to hit something.

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:13.240
It's really cool.

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:14.240
[PAUSE]

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:15.240
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:16.240
MARGERY KREVSKY: Fashion-wise how are they
displaying technology?

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.240
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:18.240
MARGERY KREVSKY: You'll have to go the auto
show and see.

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.369
You'll have to go -- because I can say the
words, but you have to see

00:44:20.369 --> 00:44:21.369
it and then have somebody stand beside you
and take you through it.

00:44:21.369 --> 00:44:23.841
It would be like displaying a computer for
the first time.

00:44:23.841 --> 00:44:24.841
You're going to get the same -- it looks like
a box, you're going to

00:44:24.841 --> 00:44:25.841
open the top, you're going to turn it on and
whatever.

00:44:25.841 --> 00:44:26.841
And you will just have a wonderful time because
it's right there.

00:44:26.841 --> 00:44:27.841
It's like a fun time.
And how does that relate to fashion?

00:44:27.841 --> 00:44:28.841
When you go to the auto shows, half the exhibits
exhibit houses really

00:44:28.841 --> 00:44:29.841
in my opinion are art houses.
And they need to showcase these cars to make

00:44:29.841 --> 00:44:30.841
them look great, but also
I stand there and I look and I think, that

00:44:30.841 --> 00:44:31.841
display could be the Museum
of Modern Art.

00:44:31.841 --> 00:44:32.841
And not only do you see American designers
but also when you go to the

00:44:32.841 --> 00:44:33.841
BMW or you go to one of the other manufacturers
in Europe you see what

00:44:33.841 --> 00:44:34.841
those design heads think is very cutting edge
also.

00:44:34.841 --> 00:44:35.841
That is wonderful it is like going to a museum
in some ways so come.

00:44:35.841 --> 00:44:36.841
I'll meet you there.

00:44:36.841 --> 00:44:37.841
&gt;&gt; Do car companies or the [INAUDIBLE] go
out and look for designers

00:44:37.841 --> 00:44:38.841
that they have a certain designer that they
think is really hot or

00:44:38.841 --> 00:44:39.841
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:39.841 --> 00:44:40.841
MARGERY KREVSKY: Well, in our company, we
have a very special woman

00:44:40.841 --> 00:44:41.841
and her name is Sherry Garnett, and she happens
to be seated over

00:44:41.841 --> 00:44:42.841
there, Sherry stand up here.
And Sherry Garnett is a graduate of Parson's

00:44:42.841 --> 00:44:43.841
School of Design.
You've seen Project Runway and Tim Gunn and

00:44:43.841 --> 00:44:44.841
Heidi Klum, well, she's our
Heidi Klum and Tim Gunn combined at Productions

00:44:44.841 --> 00:44:45.841
Plus.
And she has a pulse, ever since I think she

00:44:45.841 --> 00:44:46.841
was little, because the
design was in her mind and she was going to

00:44:46.841 --> 00:44:47.841
be a designer.
She does a lot of research and has the pulse

00:44:47.841 --> 00:44:48.841
and an understanding of
each brand that we represent and that's a

00:44:48.841 --> 00:44:49.841
very critical thing.
And in her mind, she will create conceptions

00:44:49.841 --> 00:44:50.841
and she will draw them out
and present them to the automotive decision

00:44:50.841 --> 00:44:51.841
makers and from that
discussion, and it is a major group of meetings,

00:44:51.841 --> 00:44:52.841
the wardrobe will
result.

00:44:52.841 --> 00:44:53.841
The things that you saw on Renee as part of
the mini-fashion show did

00:44:53.841 --> 00:44:54.841
not just happen.
These were deep, deep thoughts, the color

00:44:54.841 --> 00:44:55.841
had to be perfect, the design
had to be perfect.

00:44:55.841 --> 00:44:56.841
I can only imagine all of the behind-the-scenes
discussion on that

00:44:56.841 --> 00:44:57.841
flame dress that you saw because the flames
had to look right.

00:44:57.841 --> 00:44:58.841
They had to be part of the same advertising
thought and [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:58.841 --> 00:44:59.841
that was already there.
So great questions.

00:44:59.841 --> 00:45:00.841
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:00.841 --> 00:45:01.841
MARGERY KREVSKY: Well, and also that goes
with fashion.

00:45:01.841 --> 00:45:02.841
If you look what's happened in fashion, fashion
is a lot more classic

00:45:02.841 --> 00:45:03.841
now.
An example of that would be the Lexus, the

00:45:03.841 --> 00:45:04.841
Lexus people.
Informed Sherry Garnett that they wanted to

00:45:04.841 --> 00:45:05.841
do things that were very
classy and classic and they wanted a named

00:45:05.841 --> 00:45:06.841
designer on their floor.
And so they chose a designer and that designer's

00:45:06.841 --> 00:45:07.841
thought happened to be
very classic clothes.

00:45:07.841 --> 00:45:08.841
And at first look, you would look and say,
that's a navy suit, that

00:45:08.841 --> 00:45:09.841
looks pretty classic but when the look at
the cut, and the structure,

00:45:09.841 --> 00:45:10.841
that could really stand up for years.
So they were going to more elegance instead

00:45:10.841 --> 00:45:11.841
of more flash.
And as you saw with the 80s and that little

00:45:11.841 --> 00:45:12.841
pink number that was over
designed, that was a lot of flash.

00:45:12.841 --> 00:45:13.841
So car design and fashion design changes,
change as well.

00:45:13.841 --> 00:45:14.841
But I think we go to the auto show this year
and there's always a

00:45:14.841 --> 00:45:15.841
mixture.
You're going to find a very sleek styling

00:45:15.841 --> 00:45:16.841
but there's always something
that really out there and wild too.

00:45:16.841 --> 00:45:17.841
&gt;&gt; Can you talk a little bit about your role
or your company's role in

00:45:17.841 --> 00:45:18.841
the Michigan film industry?

00:45:18.841 --> 00:45:19.841
MARGERY KREVSKY: Sure and that's another question,
and the question is

00:45:19.841 --> 00:45:20.841
talking about my company's role in the Michigan
film industry.

00:45:20.841 --> 00:45:21.841
And that's a -- that's a great question.
Because as most of you know, in Michigan during

00:45:21.841 --> 00:45:22.841
the past year and a
half, the State has given some very hefty

00:45:22.841 --> 00:45:23.841
tax benefits to anyone who is
coming to the state of Michigan to make a

00:45:23.841 --> 00:45:24.841
film.
As a result, a industry started here about

00:45:24.841 --> 00:45:25.841
a year and a half ago.
And so there are many major producers and

00:45:25.841 --> 00:45:26.841
directors that are coming in
to cast most of these films.

00:45:26.841 --> 00:45:27.841
You've probably seen the film, Clint Eastwood's
film Grand Torino, of

00:45:27.841 --> 00:45:28.841
that cast done here.
The major stars still come from Hollywood

00:45:28.841 --> 00:45:29.841
but most of the other actors
come from here, and we do a lot of that actor-finding.

00:45:29.841 --> 00:45:30.841
We work with casting agents.
In fact yesterday, we had a casting session

00:45:30.841 --> 00:45:31.841
 -- and I don't know I'm
allowed to say the name of the movie, but

00:45:31.841 --> 00:45:32.841
the director from Los Angeles
came in, looking for children, looking for

00:45:32.841 --> 00:45:33.841
second leads and looking for
character actors.

00:45:33.841 --> 00:45:34.841
And there are 130 [INAUDIBLE] now that are
slotted to be filmed here in

00:45:34.841 --> 00:45:35.841
Michigan that have been approved for funding.
And as the largest film and talent provider

00:45:35.841 --> 00:45:36.841
in the state, we hope to
have a lot of that.

00:45:36.841 --> 00:45:37.841
So auto show is show biz and show biz is show
biz.

00:45:37.841 --> 00:45:38.841
But it's a good question.
Anything else?

00:45:38.841 --> 00:45:39.841
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:39.841 --> 00:45:40.841
MARGERY KREVSKY: I wish I had a crystal ball
so I could answer that.

00:45:40.841 --> 00:45:41.841
But I do have some thoughts on that.
And number one yes, Cobo Hall is an issue,

00:45:41.841 --> 00:45:42.841
you read about that all the
time.

00:45:42.841 --> 00:45:43.841
But the city found several million dollars
to fix it up for the show or

00:45:43.841 --> 00:45:44.841
I think everyone would have been very, very
unhappy.

00:45:44.841 --> 00:45:45.841
So there have been some fix-up things.
And as far as the show with the economy and

00:45:45.841 --> 00:45:46.841
the car business, we have
graphs in business and on the graphs, things

00:45:46.841 --> 00:45:47.841
go up and things go down.
It's basic math when you see a graph, and

00:45:47.841 --> 00:45:48.841
so we're going through a very
unusual and challenging period now, where

00:45:48.841 --> 00:45:49.841
on the graph we are going
down and we hope that it keeps going up.

00:45:49.841 --> 00:45:50.841
So also, it's an interesting time in business
because the people who

00:45:50.841 --> 00:45:51.841
were in business who weren't as committed,
may not be here anymore but

00:45:51.841 --> 00:45:52.841
those who are really in it to win it and really
be part of this

00:45:52.841 --> 00:45:53.841
business are a part of it.
So it is a very interesting time.

00:45:53.841 --> 00:45:54.841
Okay.
Lindsey, thank you.

00:45:54.841 --> 00:45:55.841
Thank all of you and thank you for your wonderful
questions and you

00:45:55.841 --> 00:45:56.841
like, I would be happy to sign any of your
books afterwards.

00:45:56.841 --> 00:45:56.843
Thank you.
