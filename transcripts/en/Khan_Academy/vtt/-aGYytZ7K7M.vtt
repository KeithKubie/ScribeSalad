00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:02.289
- [Voiceover] So let's talk about all of the different ways

00:00:02.289 --> 00:00:04.030
that molecules can be transported

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.282
across a cellular membrane.

00:00:06.282 --> 00:00:07.954
So perhaps the most basic,

00:00:07.954 --> 00:00:10.346
the most passive of the passive transports

00:00:10.346 --> 00:00:11.971
would be straight up diffusion.

00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:13.550
And if you have a small enough molecule,

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.203
let's say this is molecular oxygen.

00:00:15.203 --> 00:00:18.639
It's small, it doesn't have any charge, it has no polarity.

00:00:18.639 --> 00:00:20.779
That will be able to diffuse down

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.007
its concentration gradient through the cellular membrane.

00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:26.398
But as we start to talk about things with more charge

00:00:26.398 --> 00:00:27.768
or things that might be larger

00:00:27.768 --> 00:00:29.631
then we're going to need some help.

00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:32.346
Now the first type of help is just help to allow things

00:00:32.346 --> 00:00:34.990
to flow down their concentration gradient.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.038
And that we call facilitated diffusion.

00:00:37.038 --> 00:00:39.847
We have a whole video on facilitated diffusion.

00:00:39.847 --> 00:00:41.217
And one form of facilitated diffusion,

00:00:41.217 --> 00:00:43.214
Hey, just open up a tunnel and let things

00:00:43.214 --> 00:00:44.844
flow down their concentration gradient.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:48.354
We saw that with the potassium ion channels,

00:00:48.354 --> 00:00:51.424
where potassium builds up on the inside of the cell

00:00:51.424 --> 00:00:53.217
because of the sodium potassium pump,

00:00:53.217 --> 00:00:55.748
let me just be clear, down here this is the inside,

00:00:55.748 --> 00:00:58.627
this is the outside of the cell,

00:00:58.627 --> 00:01:00.814
and then but then these channels allow the potassium

00:01:00.814 --> 00:01:02.398
to flow down their concentration gradient.

00:01:02.398 --> 00:01:04.395
It's gonna be put in check because of its charge

00:01:04.395 --> 00:01:05.375
and its more positive outside

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:06.977
and we'll talk about in other videos,

00:01:06.977 --> 00:01:08.401
but it's just a simple tunnel.

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.537
Now sometimes that tunnel is gated.

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:12.975
It's only going to be open if a certain trigger is hit.

00:01:12.975 --> 00:01:15.251
And we see that when we talk about signals

00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:19.086
going down a neuron voltage gated channel.

00:01:19.086 --> 00:01:21.060
Once the voltage hits a certain amount,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.871
then the channel opens, and then the sodium

00:01:22.871 --> 00:01:24.705
that has a higher concentration outside,

00:01:24.705 --> 00:01:27.930
can flow down its concentration gradient inside.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.235
But both of these, this is considered passive transport,

00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:33.835
it's facilitated diffusion, passive transport,

00:01:33.835 --> 00:01:35.437
we're allowing things to flow down

00:01:35.437 --> 00:01:37.132
their concentration gradient.

00:01:37.132 --> 00:01:39.412
You can see here, the sodium is going in,

00:01:39.412 --> 00:01:41.479
I'm sorry, the potassium is going in the direction

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:42.621
of its concentration gradient,

00:01:42.621 --> 00:01:45.059
it's high concentration inside,

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:46.434
low concentration outside,

00:01:46.434 --> 00:01:47.711
so we're allowing it to flow down

00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:49.266
the concentration gradient.

00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:52.383
Here the sodium is high concentration outside,

00:01:52.383 --> 00:01:54.496
low concentration inside, and this happened

00:01:54.496 --> 00:01:56.799
because of the sodium potassium pump,

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.889
but we're allowing it to now flow down

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:00.700
its concentration gradient.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.822
Now let's talk about active transport.

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:05.701
So passive transport doesn't require any energy

00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:06.797
to make this stuff happen.

00:02:06.797 --> 00:02:09.403
It's just about things flowing down their gradient.

00:02:09.403 --> 00:02:13.470
In active transport, we're either directly using energy

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.396
to make something go against its gradient,

00:02:16.396 --> 00:02:19.995
or we're using some energy from a previous active transport

00:02:19.995 --> 00:02:22.572
to help facilitate something else

00:02:22.572 --> 00:02:24.151
going against this gradient.

00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:26.199
So first let's talk about primary active transport,

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:29.427
'cause this might be a little bit more easy to think about.

00:02:29.427 --> 00:02:31.799
None of them are that daunting.

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.336
And the best case of this,

00:02:33.336 --> 00:02:35.078
if we're talking about animal cells,

00:02:35.078 --> 00:02:37.678
is the sodium potassium pump.

00:02:37.678 --> 00:02:39.838
The sodium potassium pump, super important

00:02:39.838 --> 00:02:43.343
for establishing resting membrane voltage,

00:02:43.343 --> 00:02:45.559
I guess you could say resting membrane potential,

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.414
but the concentration gradients it establishes

00:02:48.414 --> 00:02:49.668
are also very important.

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:51.828
The sodium having a high, it establishes,

00:02:51.828 --> 00:02:55.543
it pumps sodium ions out of the cell

00:02:55.543 --> 00:02:57.749
against its concentration gradient.

00:02:57.749 --> 00:02:59.583
So we say that sodium ions already have

00:02:59.583 --> 00:03:01.278
a higher concentration outside,

00:03:01.278 --> 00:03:02.996
but it keeps pumping them out.

00:03:02.996 --> 00:03:05.945
And to do that, it needs to use ATP.

00:03:05.945 --> 00:03:10.403
It breaks up ATP into ADP and a phosphate group.

00:03:10.403 --> 00:03:11.726
It hydrolizes it.

00:03:11.726 --> 00:03:14.076
And so that's why it's sometimes called an ATPase.

00:03:14.076 --> 00:03:17.141
It's an enzyme that helps break up ATP.

00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:20.401
But it uses that, and it uses that energy to pump sodium

00:03:20.401 --> 00:03:24.604
out of the cell and potassium into the cell.

00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:27.297
And then, as we'll see, that sodium that's pumped out of it,

00:03:27.297 --> 00:03:28.900
that kind of forms a potential energy

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.381
because it starts to build a chemo-electrochemical gradient

00:03:33.381 --> 00:03:36.841
which can later be used to power secondary active transport.

00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:39.140
We'll talk about that in a few seconds.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.840
Now this is in animal cells,

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.110
the analog in plant cells, fungi, protus prokaryotes

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.522
is the proton ATPase, or the proton pump,

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:52.240
which does the same thing, but it does it,

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.982
instead of doing it in two directions,

00:03:53.982 --> 00:03:56.350
it does it for protons, it pumps the protons

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.732
out of the cell against their concentration gradient.

00:03:59.732 --> 00:04:01.468
So even though you have a higher concentration

00:04:01.468 --> 00:04:04.161
outside than inside, it'll continue to pump them out,

00:04:04.161 --> 00:04:07.853
but to do, to power it, it uses ATP to change

00:04:07.853 --> 00:04:10.105
its conformation in the right way.

00:04:10.105 --> 00:04:11.823
And so that's why it's of, this is often called

00:04:11.823 --> 00:04:16.908
the proton ATPase, this is called sodium potassium ATPase,

00:04:16.908 --> 00:04:18.905
that's our friend the sodium potassium pump,

00:04:18.905 --> 00:04:21.046
this is called proton ATPase,

00:04:21.046 --> 00:04:24.436
and you wouldn't see these in the same cell.

00:04:24.436 --> 00:04:25.880
So maybe I'll draw a little line over here,

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.408
this would be in plants, fungi, protus, things like that.

00:04:30.408 --> 00:04:32.149
This would be in animal cells.

00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:35.428
But both of them are actively using energy.

00:04:35.428 --> 00:04:38.469
They are directly using ATP to transport things

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:40.308
against their concentration gradient,

00:04:40.308 --> 00:04:42.375
which is why we call it active transport.

00:04:42.375 --> 00:04:45.625
Now, because you have these concentration gradients,

00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:48.899
or these electrochemical gradients are established,

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:53.596
those can be used to do other forms of active transport.

00:04:53.596 --> 00:04:56.340
And that's what we call secondary active transport.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.654
So this right over here, this is my little depiction

00:04:58.654 --> 00:05:03.030
of a symporter, and this is a sodium glucose symporter.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.723
And what it does, is it leverages the sodium

00:05:05.723 --> 00:05:08.301
flowing down its concentration gradient.

00:05:08.301 --> 00:05:09.787
And once again, that was established

00:05:09.787 --> 00:05:11.876
with the sodium potassium pump,

00:05:11.876 --> 00:05:13.599
so it's flowing down its concentration gradient,

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.248
but it's leveraging that energy,

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:18.870
you can imagine putting a little wheel

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.843
under a waterfall to make it spin,

00:05:20.843 --> 00:05:24.466
to also make glucose, to transport glucose against

00:05:24.466 --> 00:05:25.933
its concentration gradient.

00:05:25.933 --> 00:05:28.069
So the glucose already has a,

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:30.252
will have a high concentration gradient here,

00:05:30.252 --> 00:05:32.550
low over here, but it's transporting glucose

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.227
against its concentration gradient.

00:05:34.227 --> 00:05:36.108
We talk about it in other videos.

00:05:36.108 --> 00:05:39.104
And then another example of secondary active transport

00:05:39.104 --> 00:05:41.982
is an antiporter, or an exchanger.

00:05:41.982 --> 00:05:44.583
In the symporter, a cotransporter, they're both going

00:05:44.583 --> 00:05:46.812
in the same direction even though one is going

00:05:46.812 --> 00:05:48.414
with its concentration gradient,

00:05:48.414 --> 00:05:50.341
that's essentially powering it,

00:05:50.341 --> 00:05:51.734
and the other one is going against

00:05:51.734 --> 00:05:52.988
its concentration gradient,

00:05:52.988 --> 00:05:54.594
that's why it's active transport.

00:05:54.594 --> 00:05:57.915
With an exchanger, they're going in opposite directions,

00:05:57.915 --> 00:06:01.193
so you have the sodium calcium ion exchanger,

00:06:01.193 --> 00:06:02.772
and here the sodium is going down

00:06:02.772 --> 00:06:04.188
its concentration gradient,

00:06:04.188 --> 00:06:06.115
and that fuel's taking the calcium ions

00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:09.927
outside of the cell against its concentration gradient.

00:06:09.927 --> 00:06:11.460
So once again, anytime something is going

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.387
against its concentration gradient,

00:06:13.387 --> 00:06:15.964
and once again, in this case, it's calcium,

00:06:15.964 --> 00:06:18.008
it's going to be active transport.

00:06:18.008 --> 00:06:20.771
But since the sodium ions, the sodium ions

00:06:20.771 --> 00:06:21.824
are going in a different direction

00:06:21.824 --> 00:06:25.144
than the calcium ions, we call this an antiporter,

00:06:25.144 --> 00:06:29.185
while this right over here is a cotransporter, a symporter.

00:06:29.185 --> 00:06:31.948
Now you might say hey, isn't the sodium potassium pump,

00:06:31.948 --> 00:06:33.299
isn't this an antiporter?

00:06:33.299 --> 00:06:35.760
Things are going in different directions?

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.598
And the difference is, both of these,

00:06:37.598 --> 00:06:39.201
this is primary active transport

00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:40.687
and the sodium potassium pump,

00:06:40.687 --> 00:06:42.219
both of these things are going against

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:44.169
their concentration gradient.

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:46.329
And a true antiporter, it's really

00:06:46.329 --> 00:06:47.931
secondary active transport.

00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:50.090
One of them is going with their concentration gradient,

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.203
going down it, which is providing the energy,

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:55.709
to take the other thing against its concentration gradient.

00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:58.865
So anyway, hopefully this gives you a high level overview

00:06:58.865 --> 00:07:00.567
of the various forms of transport,

00:07:00.567 --> 00:07:02.146
and it gives you more appreciation

00:07:02.146 --> 00:07:06.766
for how beautiful and intricate and mesmerizing

00:07:06.766 --> 00:07:08.559
a cellular membranes and all the different things

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:11.757
that cells have to do actually are.
