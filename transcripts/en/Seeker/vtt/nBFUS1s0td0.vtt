00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.110
Scientists have recently discovered two gene
variants that are more common in gay men than

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.020
straight men, adding to the evidence that
homosexuality is, at least, partially genetic.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.429
This news may actually sound familiar to you,
as studies in the early ‘90s also identified

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.340
regions on the 8th and X-chromosomes that
were correlated with homosexuality.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.300
But the genes identified this time are on
the 13th and 14th chromosomes, and it’s

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.300
the first time ever scientists have identified
specific genes, not just a region on a chromosome

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.640
that could be correlated with sexuality.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.390
The genes were found by comparing the DNA
of 1077 gay men with the DNA of 1231 straight

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.900
men, looking for variations as small as a
single nucleotide.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.920
The gene on chromosome 13, called SLITRK6,
is active in a region of the brain called

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.530
the diencephalon; that same region contains
the hypothalamus.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.350
The SLITRK6 gene has been shown to be active
in the hypothalamus of male mice fetuses days

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.700
before they’re born, which is thought to
be a crucial time for sexual differentiation.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.469
The other gene scientists identified is called
TSHR, and it’s mainly active in regulating

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.250
the thyroid, an endocrine gland in your neck.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.250
The thyroid releases hormones that control
your metabolism, and there is a thyroid condition

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.000
where the TSHR gene doesn’t function, leading
to an overactive thyroid and weight loss.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.350
This condition, called Grave’s disease,
is more common among gay men.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.150
So these recently pinpointed genes fit nicely
with past research, but it’s possible to

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.440
have these variants and not be gay.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.810
By our current understanding homosexuality
is influenced by many genes, each having a

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.080
small effect.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.619
And the environment probably plays a role
too.

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.870
You may have noticed that I never mentioned
any studies involving women, and that’s

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.090
because the science on female homosexuality
is lagging behind.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.330
So as always, more research is needed, but
in this case don’t go googling it at work,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.320
leave this one to the pros.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.240
The evidence that several genes could contribute
to homosexuality may explain why some people

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.580
are bisexual too.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.340
Thanks for watching, be sure to come back for more, and

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.720
I'll see you next time on Seeker.
