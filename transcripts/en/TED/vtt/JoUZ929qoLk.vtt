00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:14.537
So, I have a friend.

00:00:15.828 --> 00:00:17.924
She's an actress, she's in her 60s.

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:20.736
She's super bright,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.175
badass,

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.032
emotionally intelligent.

00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:27.451
And a couple of days before Christmas,
she was at the post office.

00:00:28.258 --> 00:00:31.133
It was really crowded,
as it is around the holidays,

00:00:31.157 --> 00:00:33.580
and she was filling out some forms

00:00:33.604 --> 00:00:35.427
and she was really focused.

00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:39.191
And out of nowhere,
someone moved her out of the way --

00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:44.488
just physically put their hands on her
and moved her out of the way.

00:00:45.208 --> 00:00:48.165
He apparently needed something
that she was blocking,

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:49.453
so he moved her.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.270
Maybe he had said something to her,
maybe he didn't, she didn't hear it ...

00:00:54.294 --> 00:00:57.066
Either way, she was focused,
she was filling out the form.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.629
And the next thing you know,
there were hands on her,

00:00:59.653 --> 00:01:01.523
and she was being moved out of the way.

00:01:01.867 --> 00:01:03.929
He then got what he was reaching for,

00:01:05.102 --> 00:01:06.949
whatever she was blocking,

00:01:06.973 --> 00:01:08.551
and went on his merry way.

00:01:09.718 --> 00:01:12.618
She said that she was shocked at first --

00:01:12.642 --> 00:01:14.133
yeah.

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:17.705
And then a fury rose up in her
that she could not explain:

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.078
not annoyance,

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.569
not frustration,

00:01:21.593 --> 00:01:24.328
but "fury" was the word that she used.

00:01:24.352 --> 00:01:26.001
And she went on to say,

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:29.964
"I mean, I wanted to get physical.

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:33.851
I don't know -- I was furious.

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:36.414
And I don't know why.

00:01:36.438 --> 00:01:38.291
I mean, he didn't hit me.

00:01:38.315 --> 00:01:39.526
He didn't hurt me,

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.034
he didn't violate me.

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:42.911
He moved me,

00:01:43.317 --> 00:01:46.052
and I wanted to hurt him,

00:01:46.076 --> 00:01:47.291
or at the very least,

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:49.423
run after him and yell in his face."

00:01:50.952 --> 00:01:53.809
So later, I was left pondering this fury,

00:01:55.408 --> 00:02:00.397
and looking for an explanation as to why,
even in her telling of it,

00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:01.906
I felt fury, too,

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.514
and why this was a word and a feeling
that I was hearing a lot about lately.

00:02:07.792 --> 00:02:09.801
I feel like this is the point in the room

00:02:09.825 --> 00:02:12.705
where all the men are getting
a little bit uncomfortable.

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:13.735
(Laughter)

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:14.909
It's OK.

00:02:15.307 --> 00:02:16.457
Stay with me.

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:21.578
This fury is something
that I have been chomping on

00:02:21.602 --> 00:02:24.404
since the last US presidential election.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.166
And it seems that many women have.

00:02:28.202 --> 00:02:30.825
This fury was not my friend's alone.

00:02:31.672 --> 00:02:33.542
Her fury was ignited

00:02:34.122 --> 00:02:38.798
by lifetimes of men
helping themselves to women's bodies

00:02:38.822 --> 00:02:40.342
without consent.

00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:44.299
There's a culture of men
helping themselves to women,

00:02:44.323 --> 00:02:45.477
and in this case,

00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:47.645
in a seemingly innocuous way,

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:49.761
where a woman's body is like a saltshaker:

00:02:49.785 --> 00:02:52.151
"Get out of the way
so I can get to the fries" --

00:02:52.175 --> 00:02:53.325
(Laughter)

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.811
to the most egregious,

00:02:56.835 --> 00:02:58.263
violent

00:02:58.287 --> 00:03:00.209
and horrific situations.

00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:04.737
I imagine that some of you
are wondering what the connection is

00:03:04.761 --> 00:03:07.376
between the innocuous and the horrific,

00:03:07.845 --> 00:03:11.560
two things that seem to be
on opposite ends of the spectrum.

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:16.897
Well, the common thread is the spectrum.

00:03:18.106 --> 00:03:22.135
The innocuous makes space
for the horrific.

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:29.299
And women have to live
with the effects of both

00:03:29.934 --> 00:03:31.661
and everything in between.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.716
Fellas,

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.769
can you imagine you're just on your phone,

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.614
and someone walks up to you
and just takes it out of your hand?

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:44.947
And they're like, "OK dude,
I don't know why you're getting so upset,

00:03:44.971 --> 00:03:46.506
I want to make a phone call.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.017
I'm going to give it back to you
as soon as I'm done.

00:03:49.041 --> 00:03:50.191
Whatever."

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.102
And then imagine if someone takes
that cell phone out of your hands --

00:03:55.126 --> 00:03:57.519
I don't know -- once a day,

00:03:58.438 --> 00:03:59.596
twice a day,

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.898
random times.

00:04:01.427 --> 00:04:02.578
And the explanation is,

00:04:02.602 --> 00:04:06.412
"Yeah, well, I mean,
you got a fancy case,"

00:04:06.436 --> 00:04:10.124
or "You shouldn't have
taken it out of your pocket,"

00:04:10.148 --> 00:04:12.413
or "Yep. Yeah.

00:04:12.437 --> 00:04:13.907
That's just the way it is."

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.359
But somehow, no one ever talks about
the person who took the cell phone.

00:04:21.246 --> 00:04:23.594
Overly simplified, I get it,

00:04:23.618 --> 00:04:25.891
but you see where I'm going.

00:04:27.026 --> 00:04:30.452
Men are so used to helping
themselves, that it's like ...

00:04:31.118 --> 00:04:32.591
they can't help themselves.

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:38.204
And not because men
are fundamentally less moral,

00:04:38.228 --> 00:04:43.944
but because this is a very big
blind spot for most men.

00:04:46.046 --> 00:04:49.081
When someone helps themselves to a woman,

00:04:49.105 --> 00:04:53.851
it not only triggers
discomfort and distress,

00:04:54.505 --> 00:04:59.412
but the unspoken experiences
of our mothers' lives,

00:04:59.436 --> 00:05:01.270
sisters' lives

00:05:01.294 --> 00:05:03.876
and generations of women before us.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.029
That's lifetimes of women dealing with men

00:05:10.053 --> 00:05:13.674
who assume they know better for us
than we know for ourselves,

00:05:15.657 --> 00:05:18.299
being the property of husbands,

00:05:18.953 --> 00:05:20.914
landowners,

00:05:20.938 --> 00:05:25.020
and having old, white men tell us
the fate of our lady parts;

00:05:26.087 --> 00:05:31.453
lifetimes of having our bodies used
for love and objects of desire,

00:05:31.477 --> 00:05:37.839
instead of bodies that we get to wield
and use as we choose;

00:05:39.144 --> 00:05:42.464
lifetimes of knowing that whether
we play by their rules or not,

00:05:42.488 --> 00:05:46.426
we still have to tolerate harassment,

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.865
assault

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.142
and even worse;

00:05:49.648 --> 00:05:54.785
lifetimes of our bodies being used
as property that can be hit and hurt,

00:05:55.336 --> 00:05:58.242
manipulated and moved

00:05:58.915 --> 00:06:01.753
and like objects that are not
deserving of respect;

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:09.907
lifetimes of not being able to express
the anger of our bodies.

00:06:12.578 --> 00:06:14.907
It's no wonder we feel this fury.

00:06:17.446 --> 00:06:20.881
And if you add in the history of race --

00:06:21.602 --> 00:06:23.488
which is a whole other talk --

00:06:24.396 --> 00:06:27.663
it gets exponentially more complicated.

00:06:30.173 --> 00:06:33.091
When women get manhandled,
we start to rationalize,

00:06:33.115 --> 00:06:35.341
try to figure out the ways that it was --

00:06:35.365 --> 00:06:36.709
"It was probably our fault.

00:06:36.733 --> 00:06:41.005
You know what? He probably said
something, and I didn't hear him.

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:42.514
I'm just overreacting.

00:06:42.538 --> 00:06:43.866
I'm totally overreacting."

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.040
No.

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:46.869
No.

00:06:47.508 --> 00:06:48.658
No.

00:06:49.244 --> 00:06:51.929
No, no, no, no, no.

00:06:52.988 --> 00:06:57.497
Women have been trained
to think that we are overreacting

00:06:57.521 --> 00:07:01.246
or that we're being too sensitive
or unreasonable.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.097
We try to make sense of nonsense,

00:07:03.121 --> 00:07:05.405
and we swallow the furious feelings.

00:07:05.429 --> 00:07:08.749
We try to put them into
some hidden place in our minds,

00:07:08.773 --> 00:07:10.261
but they don't go away.

00:07:11.794 --> 00:07:16.509
That fury sits deep inside
as we practice our smiles --

00:07:16.533 --> 00:07:19.013
(Giggling) "Yes, of course" --

00:07:19.037 --> 00:07:20.513
and try to be pleasant.

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:24.511
"I know --" (Giggling)
"Yes, yes, of course,"

00:07:24.535 --> 00:07:27.153
because apparently, women
aren't supposed to get angry.

00:07:29.925 --> 00:07:35.673
That fury that my friend felt
holds centuries

00:07:35.697 --> 00:07:41.864
of never being able to directly address
or express our indignation,

00:07:43.028 --> 00:07:44.947
our frustration

00:07:44.971 --> 00:07:46.378
and our rage.

00:07:48.022 --> 00:07:51.265
When someone thinks
they can help themselves to our bodies,

00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:54.508
it not only ignites the current fury,

00:07:55.289 --> 00:07:57.234
but it lights up the past.

00:07:59.686 --> 00:08:02.209
What seems like a benign moment
at the post office

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.466
is actually an anger grenade.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.251
Well,

00:08:08.907 --> 00:08:10.075
kaboom!

00:08:12.627 --> 00:08:16.229
Today, the global collection
of women's experiences

00:08:16.253 --> 00:08:18.167
can no longer be ignored.

00:08:19.236 --> 00:08:21.801
Time's up on thinking
that we're overreacting

00:08:21.825 --> 00:08:23.533
or "This is just the way it is."

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:28.654
Time's up on women being held responsible

00:08:28.678 --> 00:08:31.818
for men's bad behavior.

00:08:31.842 --> 00:08:37.054
It is men's responsibility
to change men's bad behavior.

00:08:38.104 --> 00:08:43.960
(Applause)

00:08:46.183 --> 00:08:47.827
Our culture is shifting,

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:50.062
and it's time.

00:08:52.101 --> 00:08:53.756
So my fellow women

00:08:54.852 --> 00:08:56.695
and our gentle men,

00:08:58.841 --> 00:09:02.661
as we are here together
within this particular window

00:09:02.685 --> 00:09:07.341
of this large-scale movement
towards women's equality,

00:09:08.532 --> 00:09:11.572
and as we envision a future
that does not yet exist,

00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:14.111
we both have different invitations.

00:09:15.935 --> 00:09:17.150
Men,

00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:22.823
I call you in as allies,

00:09:23.955 --> 00:09:26.673
as we work together towards change.

00:09:27.982 --> 00:09:31.770
May you be accountable
and self-reflective,

00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:36.870
compassionate and open.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:43.355
May you ask how you can support a woman
and be of service to change.

00:09:44.721 --> 00:09:46.659
And may you get help if you need it.

00:09:48.676 --> 00:09:49.873
And women,

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.313
I encourage you

00:09:54.127 --> 00:09:56.703
to acknowledge your fury.

00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:59.599
Give it language.

00:10:00.528 --> 00:10:03.721
Share it in safe places of identification

00:10:03.745 --> 00:10:05.332
and in safe ways.

00:10:07.788 --> 00:10:10.677
Your fury is not something
to be afraid of.

00:10:11.488 --> 00:10:14.610
It holds lifetimes of wisdom.

00:10:15.857 --> 00:10:17.334
Let it breathe

00:10:19.062 --> 00:10:20.212
and listen.

00:10:21.366 --> 00:10:22.516
Thank you.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:26.086
(Applause)

00:10:29.237 --> 00:10:30.577
Thank you.

00:10:30.577 --> 00:10:32.627
(Applause)
