00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.540
Being arrested is a terrifying and frightening
thing with all the horror stories about police

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.799
abuses of power and other prisoners being
absolutely dead-set on making your life miserable

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:21.339
in a variety of horrifying ways… at least
that’s what the movies have taught us.

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:25.630
As so often happens, the reality of being
arrested doesn’t generally reflect what’s

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.449
depicted on the big screen.

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.000
So what about the one phone call rule?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.239
It turns out, “You get exactly one phone
call when arrested” is a useful, simple

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.640
plot element, and easier to explain to an
audience than, “being arrested is a legal

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.690
minefield where your rights can vary based
on a variety of factors.”

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.739
In reality, the number of phone calls you
can make varies from as many as you want to

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.960
zero, depending on the severity and location
of your crime and how you act when arrested.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.680
Thanks to the sixth amendment, you are entitled
to legal counsel and, as clarified in the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.090
Supreme Court ruling in Brewer v. Williams,
you are entitled to that counsel “at or

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.590
after the time that judicial proceedings have
been initiated… whether by formal charge,

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.409
preliminary hearing, indictment, information,
or arraignment.”

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.770
As Hollywood depicts, you are also perfectly
within your rights to keep your mouth shut,

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.280
though they don’t actually tend to get it
quite correct in the way it’s commonly portrayed.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.299
The police only need to give you the Miranda
warning if they are conducting a custodial

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.119
interrogation and want the record of that
interrogation to be admissible in court.

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.590
Other than that, giving you the Miranda warning
isn’t necessary.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.340
In fact, even if they don’t give you this
warning when they are about to perform a custodial

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.399
interrogation, they can still use what they
learn in their investigation.

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.439
It’s just that what you specifically said,
in this case, isn’t admissible in a criminal

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:51.439
trial.

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.280
But if they use this information to find other
evidence, that certainly is.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.540
So, bottom line, contrary to what Hollywood
shows, don’t expect them to give you the

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.859
Miranda warning while they are cuffing you,
and certainly don’t think you now have a

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:08.110
get out of jail free card because they didn’t.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.420
As you might expect, any lawyer worth anything
will tell you to exercise the right to shut

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.090
up, no matter if you are 100%, without a shadow
of a doubt perfectly innocent and plan on

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.030
being completely honest about it.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.750
There is literally no benefit to you talking
to the police in this situation where you

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.900
find yourself being arrested or brought in
for questioning about something you allegedly

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.900
did.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.890
(For more on this subject, check out this
phenomenal lecture from Professor James Duane

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.390
and Officer George Bruch, of the Virginia
Beach Police Department.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.860
Officer Bruch even goes into some clever interrogation
methods used by the police to get people to

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.860
talk.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.920
Needless to say, in these interrogations,
they are extreme experts at extracting information

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.580
that might incriminate you and you are in
a high stress situation.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.920
You will lose every time.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.099
And if innocent, you might even make it seem
you’re guilty unintentionally due to the

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.739
stress of the situation.

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.310
The police aren’t looking to get an innocent
person convicted, but they don’t know you

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.830
and if you’re in that situation, they very
likely don’t think you’re innocent to

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.970
begin with and are looking for even the smallest
hint of evidence to use to further the case

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:15.970
against you.)

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.580
Now, the fact that you’re entitled to speak
to a lawyer would suggest you’re allowed

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.580
to use the phone.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.190
But not actually.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.370
You don’t necessarily need to use the phone
yourself to get a lawyer.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.110
Further, the dramatic scenes depicted in cinema
where you use your one phone call to contact

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.510
someone and they don’t pick up, and so you
don’t get another call, is also completely

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.510
bunk.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.909
While there is some variation in laws from
state to state, in general the police can,

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:45.420
at their discretion, allow you to make any
number of calls to friends or family members,

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.349
or really anyone you want, to set your affairs
in order.

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.629
As with using the phone at all, these phone-calls
are (usually) a privilege offered by the police;

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.430
a privilege that can be revoked at any time
should you become violent or antagonistic,

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.490
or are simply wasting their time by not using
your phone call(s) for a legitimate reason.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.520
But if you behave yourself and are using your
calls constructively, in general you’re

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.920
not going to have any trouble getting access
to a phone.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.019
As mentioned, the laws vary from state to
state.

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.810
For example, in the state of Nevada (171.153
of the Nevada Revised Statutes),

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.860
Any person arrested has the right to make
a reasonable number of completed telephone

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.799
calls from the police station or other place
at which the person is booked immediately

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.810
after the person is booked and, except where
physically impossible, no later than 3 hours

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.070
after the arrest.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.520
So in this case, unless the phone lines are
down or you become so violent that they end

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.730
up having to tase you to unconsciousness,
or similar scenarios, you’ll get a “reasonable

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.360
number” of phone calls regardless of how
much of a jerk you may be.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.950
One would imagine that the better you behave,
though, the higher a “reasonable number”

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.670
will turn out to be.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.150
However, this isn’t always the case in other
states where sometimes your only phone-related

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.940
right is potentially the ability to contact
a lawyer.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.320
But, again, even if this is not a right, generally
if you need to call your boss at work to say

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.320
you’re not going to make it in, or contact
your husband to tell him where you’re at,

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:09.250
or you need to arrange for someone to pick
up your kids from school, etc. etc., most

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.230
police officers are happy to accommodate that
as long as you’re not causing problems.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.860
Anecdotally, in researching this topic, I
even found one case where an officer was willing

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.960
to drive those arrested to an ATM so the people
could get money needed for posting bond.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.430
His department did not take credit or debit
cards.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.440
So when it’s that or waiting around for
the person to make the necessary phone calls

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.410
to gather together the cash and have someone
bring it in, at that particular department,

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.640
they just take you to an ATM if you’ve got
the necessary cash in your bank account.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.990
It’s quicker and easier for them (and you).

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.500
Without them doing this, there are scenarios
where you might spend the whole weekend in

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.420
the county jail waiting for a judge to see
you, when you otherwise could have just made

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.650
bond and been out right away.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:57.320
So what if you’re causing problems, but
still need to get a lawyer, notify someone

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.220
to pick up your kids or similar important
things, but the police aren’t inclined,

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.580
nor required to give you a phone call?

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.170
In these cases, the police will typically
take care of it, depending on what specifically

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.850
you need of them.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.560
Even if you do play-nice, they may also not
allow you to use the phone if they believe

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.150
you may communicate with someone outside to
dispose of evidence or something of this nature.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.750
For this reason, in some departments, they
may simply have a policy of always being the

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.360
go-between no matter what.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.360
So no phone calls for you in these cases.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.820
This, of course, leaves massive room for interpretation
for people on both sides of the law and, since

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.820
the police are only human beings, mistakes
can and will be made.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.250
So, bottom line, once arrested, you have many
rights that you’re free to exercise; making

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.870
a phone call isn’t (usually) one of them.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.880
Regardless of what Hollywood has told you,
yelling at an officer, “Where’s my f*****g

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.320
phone-call” is likely going to end with
you not getting one in many states.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.330
However, if you call someone and they accidentally
hang up, an officer isn’t going to gleefully

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.520
tell you, “That was your one and only phone-call!

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.280
You’re now stuck in prison forever! *cackles
madly*” They’ll probably just let you

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.571
re-dial so they can finish processing you
and go about their other duties, or if their

00:07:03.571 --> 00:07:04.780
shift is up, go home.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.910
While there are certainly bad-eggs in every
profession (usually highly publicized in the

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:07.910
case of police), contrary to what is often
perceived because of these high profile screw-ups,

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.370
most police officers are just normal people
doing their jobs as outlined by the law and

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.700
aren’t going to go out of their way to mess
with your life.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:19.750
Beyond any moral or legal issues, doing that
would typically just result in more paperwork

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.250
for them to do.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:28.790
While most (including me) are happy to use
“prison” and “jail” interchangeably.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.640
Prison and jail are technically not the same
thing.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:37.830
In the U.S., jail is run by county sheriff’s
offices, while prison is run by the Prisons

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.430
and Corrections office of each state.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:47.160
In Canada, jail is run by the provincial government,
while prison is run by the federal government.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.450
You might also be wondering about phone rights
after being convicted.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:54.750
The rules here also vary from state to state,
but in general there are allotted times where

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.320
prisoners will have access to a phone.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.100
But it costs… a lot.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.630
In fact, the fees charged by prison phone
service providers were so ridiculous that

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.680
the FCC recently stepped in.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:12.370
Before this, when making calls the cost could
be as high as $17 for a 15 minute phone call.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:18.080
Now, even for collect calls it’s only about
$3.15 for a 15 minute conversation.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:24.060
Still quite expensive by typical standards,
but much better than over $1 per minute.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:28.030
As FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler stated, “This
means that many families will no longer have

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:32.400
to choose between talking to their loved ones
in prison and paying their utility bills.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.159
It means that society will benefit from the
decreased rates of recidivism that family

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:38.360
contact brings.”

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.590
While the inmates and their families are certainly
happy about this, the companies involved are

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:46.550
not and some of them are currently contesting
this in court, claiming the new rates are

00:08:46.550 --> 00:09:05.820
below their cost to maintain the networks
to the prisons.
