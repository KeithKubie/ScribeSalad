00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:08.288
(electronic music)

00:00:10.905 --> 00:00:12.792
- Iman Shumpert, of the New York Knicks,

00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:14.195
is in our kitchen eating cereal.

00:00:14.195 --> 00:00:15.028
- Crazy.

00:00:15.028 --> 00:00:16.753
- So we're gonna go interview him,

00:00:16.753 --> 00:00:20.223
we're gonna leave right now, let's go.

00:00:20.223 --> 00:00:22.041
- I'm happy you came to the show, man,

00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:24.534
we're gonna play this little
game called Shump Says.

00:00:24.534 --> 00:00:25.829
We're gonna give you a topic

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.238
and you give us some
quick thoughts on 'em.

00:00:27.238 --> 00:00:28.071
- That's all we want.

00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:30.246
- I'll tell you exactly
what Shump would say.

00:00:30.246 --> 00:00:31.079
- Alright.

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.636
- So how do you feel
about the Brooklyn Nets?

00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:35.270
- You know, great group of guys.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.025
Cool black and white
jerseys and everything...

00:00:37.025 --> 00:00:38.216
- They do have some cool jerseys.

00:00:38.216 --> 00:00:39.639
- But they're the New Jersey Nets.

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:42.193
I just hate that Knick
fans are now Nets fans...

00:00:42.193 --> 00:00:43.272
- Oh that's happening?

00:00:43.272 --> 00:00:46.155
- Until we beat 'em and then
they're Knicks fans again.

00:00:46.155 --> 00:00:47.622
- How do you feel about Rihanna?

00:00:47.622 --> 00:00:49.719
- I love Rihanna, love you.

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.916
I don't need to know when
you walking down the street.

00:00:51.916 --> 00:00:54.426
People in real life be
Tweetin' about this all day.

00:00:54.426 --> 00:00:55.259
- Yeah.

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:56.991
- There be people on my
timeline talkin' about

00:00:56.991 --> 00:00:58.900
what Rihanna's doin', don't care.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.204
- What's some of your favorite
stuff to eat on the road?

00:01:01.204 --> 00:01:03.230
- I like Rice Krispies Treats.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.735
- What do you think of Rice
Krispies with chocolate chips?

00:01:05.735 --> 00:01:06.568
- Nah.

00:01:06.568 --> 00:01:07.429
- Yeah, me either.

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:09.659
- And how do you feel about
peanut butter and jelly

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.269
in the same jar?

00:01:11.269 --> 00:01:12.459
- Pretty cool.

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:14.612
- So we have some Twitter questions

00:01:14.612 --> 00:01:16.529
from some people from Twitter.

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:18.692
(chirping)

00:01:18.692 --> 00:01:21.289
- So first question from @Winston_Wolfe:

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.294
"What's an unwritten rule that
basketball fans don't know?"

00:01:24.294 --> 00:01:27.515
- If I pull out my
phone, they will fine me.

00:01:27.515 --> 00:01:29.518
- Why will they fine you
for pullin' out your phone?

00:01:29.518 --> 00:01:31.351
- It's unprofessional.

00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:34.122
- Most professionals use phones, though,

00:01:34.122 --> 00:01:36.838
like lawyers use phones
- This is basketball.

00:01:36.838 --> 00:01:38.954
- @DonovanStrain says

00:01:38.954 --> 00:01:41.928
"Your hi-top fade versus Norris Cole."

00:01:41.928 --> 00:01:44.514
(bell rings)

00:01:44.514 --> 00:01:46.236
I know the answer, I mean.

00:01:46.236 --> 00:01:47.553
- His is what you expect.

00:01:47.553 --> 00:01:48.386
- Yeah.

00:01:48.386 --> 00:01:50.165
- He's just, box,

00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:51.532
uh,

00:01:51.532 --> 00:01:52.411
part.

00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:53.565
- Unimaginative, you know.

00:01:53.565 --> 00:01:55.412
- Like I knew you were gonna do that.

00:01:55.412 --> 00:01:58.330
- Oh this is from @JaylaPlante, he said

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.435
"Can you hit us with the Kanye walk?"

00:02:00.435 --> 00:02:02.641
- Oh, the Kanye walk.
- Yeah.

00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:04.419
- He just hit 'em with the...
(laughs)

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:06.493
I don't know, that's
his thing now, you know.

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:09.698
- Yo, thanks for the (crosstalk).

00:02:09.698 --> 00:02:11.346
- Thanks for the cereal, baby.

00:02:11.346 --> 00:02:12.179
- This was dope.

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:14.481
- Cereal with Shump.

00:02:14.481 --> 00:02:16.302
♫ The truth (banging muffles lyrics)

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:18.990
♫ Talk up my dude, I can't hear you

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.067
♫ Copy my every move like
(banging muffles lyrics)

00:02:21.067 --> 00:02:24.009
♫ I'ma still excel while
you people in my rear-view

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.784
♫ Yeah, I'm cruisin' like a boat launch

00:02:26.784 --> 00:02:30.757
♫ I'm close with the swish,
I don't smoke cigars boy

00:02:30.757 --> 00:02:32.089
♫ I dropped my phone

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:36.814
♫ I chucked a three,
three of those to the dome

00:02:36.814 --> 00:02:39.897
