we know that brain health depends on

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680
we know that brain health depends on
 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.799
we know that brain health depends on
proper nutrition and so when we see

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809
proper nutrition and so when we see
 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.509
proper nutrition and so when we see
people who have nutritional deficiencies

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519
people who have nutritional deficiencies
 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.520
people who have nutritional deficiencies
maybe for example having not enough

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530
maybe for example having not enough
 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.849
maybe for example having not enough
vitamin b12 or missing certain fats like

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859
vitamin b12 or missing certain fats like
 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.070
vitamin b12 or missing certain fats like
the omega-3 fats in their diet we see

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080
the omega-3 fats in their diet we see
 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.099
the omega-3 fats in their diet we see
that there's a vastly increased risk of

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109
that there's a vastly increased risk of
 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.140
that there's a vastly increased risk of
illnesses like depression and anxiety we

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150
illnesses like depression and anxiety we
 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.670
illnesses like depression and anxiety we
also know that in clinical trials we can

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680
also know that in clinical trials we can
 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.950
also know that in clinical trials we can
we can use those nutrients to actually

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960
we can use those nutrients to actually
 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.500
we can use those nutrients to actually
treat brain illnesses like depression

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510
treat brain illnesses like depression
 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.100
treat brain illnesses like depression
and dementia so every good psychiatric

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110
and dementia so every good psychiatric
 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.200
and dementia so every good psychiatric
evaluation involves some lab testing

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210
evaluation involves some lab testing
 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.520
evaluation involves some lab testing
just to make sure that the basic

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530
just to make sure that the basic
 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.229
just to make sure that the basic
physiology things like your thyroid your

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239
physiology things like your thyroid your
 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.229
physiology things like your thyroid your
B vitamin levels the amount of potassium

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239
B vitamin levels the amount of potassium
 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.850
B vitamin levels the amount of potassium
and sodium in your body that those are

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860
and sodium in your body that those are
 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.529
and sodium in your body that those are
normal for a lot of people they are but

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539
normal for a lot of people they are but
 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.880
normal for a lot of people they are but
for some people they aren't and those

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890
for some people they aren't and those
 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.420
for some people they aren't and those
are instantly reversible deficiencies so

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430
are instantly reversible deficiencies so
 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.319
are instantly reversible deficiencies so
for example if you have an iron

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329
for example if you have an iron
 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.939
for example if you have an iron
deficiency you're just you're going to

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949
deficiency you're just you're going to
 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.220
deficiency you're just you're going to
be sluggish you're going to have a brain

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230
be sluggish you're going to have a brain
 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.680
be sluggish you're going to have a brain
fog you're not going to feel well it's

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690
fog you're not going to feel well it's
 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.819
fog you're not going to feel well it's
interesting we sort of start with

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829
interesting we sort of start with
 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.279
interesting we sort of start with
evaluation in labs when really part of

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289
evaluation in labs when really part of
 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.260
evaluation in labs when really part of
my work has been how do we get food into

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270
my work has been how do we get food into
 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.929
my work has been how do we get food into
the conversation and so I can assess you

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939
the conversation and so I can assess you
 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.789
the conversation and so I can assess you
with a lab test but for example if you

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799
with a lab test but for example if you
 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.480
with a lab test but for example if you
never eat wild salmon or mussels or any

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490
never eat wild salmon or mussels or any
 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.490
never eat wild salmon or mussels or any
good fatty fish that's a good source of

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500
good fatty fish that's a good source of
 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.160
good fatty fish that's a good source of
those long-chain omega-3 fats we know

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
those long-chain omega-3 fats we know
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.600
those long-chain omega-3 fats we know
that your levels are going to be low and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610
that your levels are going to be low and
 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.280
that your levels are going to be low and
so really we can learn a lot about

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290
so really we can learn a lot about
 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.230
so really we can learn a lot about
someone's nutritional status just by

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240
someone's nutritional status just by
 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.969
someone's nutritional status just by
asking them simple questions it doesn't

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979
asking them simple questions it doesn't
 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.580
asking them simple questions it doesn't
require expensive testings in our clinic

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590
require expensive testings in our clinic
 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.920
require expensive testings in our clinic
we simply ask people what they eat for

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930
we simply ask people what they eat for
 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.899
we simply ask people what they eat for
breakfast lunch and dinner and that

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909
breakfast lunch and dinner and that
 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.210
breakfast lunch and dinner and that
that's really the goal of my book II

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220
that's really the goal of my book II
 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.910
that's really the goal of my book II
complete is helping people walking them

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920
complete is helping people walking them
 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.530
complete is helping people walking them
through nutritional assessment it's

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540
through nutritional assessment it's
 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.789
through nutritional assessment it's
called the simple food assessment just

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799
called the simple food assessment just
 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.770
called the simple food assessment just
because it's simple and thinking about

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780
because it's simple and thinking about
 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.120
because it's simple and thinking about
what are your challenges at every meal

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130
what are your challenges at every meal
 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.460
what are your challenges at every meal
and what are the nutrients and the foods

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470
and what are the nutrients and the foods
 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.109
and what are the nutrients and the foods
most importantly the foods that are

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119
most importantly the foods that are
 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.460
most importantly the foods that are
missing we know that there are these

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470
missing we know that there are these
 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.889
missing we know that there are these
very important nutrient dense foods

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899
very important nutrient dense foods
 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.810
very important nutrient dense foods
they're foods that have more nutrients

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820
they're foods that have more nutrients
 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.850
they're foods that have more nutrients
for your brain per calorie and we want

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860
for your brain per calorie and we want
 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.350
for your brain per calorie and we want
those nutrients because you use them to

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360
those nutrients because you use them to
 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.300
those nutrients because you use them to
make everything in your brain I mean if

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310
make everything in your brain I mean if
 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.740
make everything in your brain I mean if
you think about every molecule in your

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750
you think about every molecule in your
 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.719
you think about every molecule in your
brain starts at the end of your fork and

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729
brain starts at the end of your fork and
 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.670
brain starts at the end of your fork and
so really it's what I love about food

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680
so really it's what I love about food
 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.530
so really it's what I love about food
and clinical practice I'm a psychiatrist

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540
and clinical practice I'm a psychiatrist
 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.139
and clinical practice I'm a psychiatrist
is that it gives us an intervention that

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149
is that it gives us an intervention that
 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.359
is that it gives us an intervention that
really you can focus on an employee

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369
really you can focus on an employee
 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.010
really you can focus on an employee
every day and it's a way that we can

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020
every day and it's a way that we can
 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.780
every day and it's a way that we can
help patients and people in general take

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790
help patients and people in general take
 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.880
help patients and people in general take
care of themselves really employ self

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890
care of themselves really employ self
 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.430
care of themselves really employ self
here with every bite so that's the idea

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440
here with every bite so that's the idea
 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.170
here with every bite so that's the idea
behind nutritional psychiatry is it's

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180
behind nutritional psychiatry is it's
 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.199
behind nutritional psychiatry is it's
being called so a lot of times we focus

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209
being called so a lot of times we focus
 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.300
being called so a lot of times we focus
on super foods or singular foods I

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310
on super foods or singular foods I
 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.610
on super foods or singular foods I
focused a lot of my work on kale but

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620
focused a lot of my work on kale but
 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.199
focused a lot of my work on kale but
really what we want to think is is in

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209
really what we want to think is is in
 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.300
really what we want to think is is in
food categories and what I see in

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310
food categories and what I see in
 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.949
food categories and what I see in
clinical practice over and over again is

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959
clinical practice over and over again is
 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.170
clinical practice over and over again is
these same food categories are missing

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180
these same food categories are missing
 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.390
these same food categories are missing
in people's diets and when we look at

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400
in people's diets and when we look at
 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.420
in people's diets and when we look at
the the eater landscape in America what

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430
the the eater landscape in America what
 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.190
the the eater landscape in America what
we see is that people are really missing

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200
we see is that people are really missing
 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.900
we see is that people are really missing
some of these key nutrients that are

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910
some of these key nutrients that are
 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.210
some of these key nutrients that are
they're eating very call it the beige

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220
they're eating very call it the beige
 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.220
they're eating very call it the beige
diet or the 12 year old boy diet like

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230
diet or the 12 year old boy diet like
 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.470
diet or the 12 year old boy diet like
lots of highly processed foods not a lot

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480
lots of highly processed foods not a lot
 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.360
lots of highly processed foods not a lot
of colors we want to get people having

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370
of colors we want to get people having
 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.220
of colors we want to get people having
more of those rainbows on their plates

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230
more of those rainbows on their plates
 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.840
more of those rainbows on their plates
so the food categories that I really

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850
so the food categories that I really
 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.759
so the food categories that I really
love to see people put back into their

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769
love to see people put back into their
 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.350
love to see people put back into their
diet when it comes to eating for brain

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360
diet when it comes to eating for brain
 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.330
diet when it comes to eating for brain
health we'd love to see the leafy greens

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340
health we'd love to see the leafy greens
 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.150
health we'd love to see the leafy greens
so things like kale I've got some some

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160
so things like kale I've got some some
 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.550
so things like kale I've got some some
watercress right here that a

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560
watercress right here that a
 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.870

particularly liked very very nutrient

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880
particularly liked very very nutrient
 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.360
particularly liked very very nutrient
dense green and by nutrient dense that's

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370
dense green and by nutrient dense that's
 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.070
dense green and by nutrient dense that's
a very important concept as much more

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080
a very important concept as much more
 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.690
a very important concept as much more
importantly calories calories really

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700
importantly calories calories really

only help us calculate nutrient density

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739
only help us calculate nutrient density
 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.440
only help us calculate nutrient density
