00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.500
Hey what's up guys, we are back.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.500
Huge success with the pokeball castings

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.700
except from the bubbles.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.500
The bubbles are our number one enemy and we need a way to get rid of them.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.500
I 've got a lot off suggestions in the comments saying we should build a vaccum chamber

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.500
so we can extract the bubbles,

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.320
So our silicon and plaster castings are as perfect as they can be

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.940
so that is exactly what we are gonna do today

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.120
So I've gathered up these materials and we're going to spend our afternoon together

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.520
Building ourselves a vacum chamber.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.520
This here is a twelve inch stainless steel cooking pot

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.120
And we're not going to need the lid, we just need the pot itself

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.360
I also stopped by a hose supply company and picked a bunch of various fittings.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.380
We have a couple of quarters inch shut off valves,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.220
We have a quarter inch cross,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.080
Three quarter inch male to male nipples,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.560
(That's actually what they're called)

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.480
A quarter inch hose barb

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.120
And a fitting just to connect them up to a vacuum pump.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.820
And just for fun, I picked up a liquid filled vacuum gauge as well

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.420
This isn't really necessary, it's just going to show us what pressures we're holding inside the vacuum.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.800
So we have got our pot, we've got our fittings,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.840
We've got our vacuum pump

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.180
And now it's time to put them together,

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.500
And for our lid, I'm using some of this three-quarter inch, crystal clear acrylic.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.840
I'm using this stuff because we're gonna be able to look down inside the chamber,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.760
and see what's going on.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.420
Now, acrylic is pretty brittle,

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.580
and under vacuum pressure it can implode.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.120
but three-quarters of an inch thick should be more than we need.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.400
That should give it enough integrity to hold up to the pressures we're gonna put it under.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.080
I'm also using some clear poly tubing for the vacuum hose,

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.940
But if you look closely, you can see the stuff has really thick walls.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.360
So when we pull a vacuum it's not gonna suck in on itself and collapse the tube.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.080
Now this sheet of acrylic is way bigger than we need,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.600
And frankly it's quite expensive,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.180
This piece right here probably costs about $100.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.760
But all we're gonna need is a section just bigger than the mouth of the pot.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.320
So we're gonna flip this thing over, use a sharpie marker

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.860
And draw around the edges,

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.820
Leaving about a quarter to half inch overlap all the way around.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.280
Let's go grab ourselves a jigsaw, and cut this thing out.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.120
This is a vacuum pump I picked up from Harbor Freight,

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.200
It was one of their higher-end models, but still really cheap.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.760
This one goes down to 22 and a half microns which is honestly overkill for this project,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.520
But I got it just in case,

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.400
But you never know what might be down the road, it might justify the expense.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.080
Vacuum pumps are designed to suck air out of objects,

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.560
And the air gets sucked into this little port here.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.920
So to make it a little easier I picked up this little fitting

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.800
And that's gonna screw on

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.400
This is a ninety degree elbow

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.800
that'll connect to our hose,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.880
So we can swivel it any direction we want.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.640
Once our ninety degree hose barb is attacked, we can take our hose and just press it over top.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.680
So we've got our three quarters inch acrylic lid, we've got our pot, we've got our vacuum pump,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.440
This is the part where we put them all together.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.800
This little tool here is called a tap

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.880
And it's for making the little ridged grooves for screw holes.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.360
This is a quarter inch NPT, that stands for national pipe thread,

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.000
And for this one we need a 7/16ths drill bit to drill a pilot hole for it.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.840
now to drill the suction hole in the lid, we can really put it anywhere we want,

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.200
But I'm gonna put mine closer to the side, and here's why:

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.120
If we ever wanna flip this thing over and use it as an acrylic base,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.680
We can put something like a glass bell jar over top so we can see the reaction happening.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.200
However if our hole is in the middle, any object we put in the middle is gonna block the suction.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.800
But if we have the hole near the edge, it should still be able to work in either direction.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.920
So there you go, now we have a threaded hole in our acrylic lid,

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.040
And at this point we can go ahead and remove the paper,

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.880
because we're not gonna be machining it anymore,

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.880
So let's go ahead and throw on some thread tape,

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.880
Get all these things connected together, and get ready to finish up.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.720
So here's the idea of how this works:

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.120
We've got our pot with the lid

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.160
And when this thing is closed,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.600
The vacuum pump will suck air out of the system.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.120
Now we've got these little ball valves here so we can actually close off the vacuum,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.720
turn this thing off and it should stay.
