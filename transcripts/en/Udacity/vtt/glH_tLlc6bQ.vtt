00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.240
So what's so special about Gulp?

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.120
I teased it a little already,
but let's have a closer look.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.060
The main difference between Grunt and
Gulp is that Grunt focuses on

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.340
configuration, while
Gulp focuses on code.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.850
But what does that
even mean in practice?

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.900
Have a look at this Grunt
configuration file.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.830
It's not important that you understand
everything it does right away.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.050
We'll get to that later.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.195
It uses a JavaScript config object,
to configure certain tasks,

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:26.670
such as concat or uglify.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.210
To change or

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.840
extend one of these tasks, you would
have to modify the plugins themselves.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.980
Consider the same functionality
in this gulp config file instead.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.190
It looks more like son of JavaScript,
and that's a good thing.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.110
At any given point,

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.380
you can intervene, and type your files
into another function before moving on.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.795
The second big argument
is all about speed.

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:46.960
Grunt executes tasks in sequence.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.200
One after each other.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.220
Where Gulp, by default,
executes tasks in parallel, and

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.060
finishes when all have finished.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.990
But that's not all that makes
Gulp usually come up much faster.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.410
Gulp comes with the concept of streams,
that cause much less IO, or

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.940
file system access.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.239
And James will tell you a bit more
about how streams work in just a bit.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.810
Head to the Gulp installation
instructions and instructor notes,

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.080
and install Gulp on your system.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.810
If you haven't done so already,
you need to install Node.js and

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.260
NPM before that, and
those instructions are also in the note.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.280
If you need a little more
help figuring it out,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.580
the next note will have
more detailed instructions.
