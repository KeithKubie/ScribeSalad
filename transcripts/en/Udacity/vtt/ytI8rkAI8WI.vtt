00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's look at a triple pulley. We'll first see have a triple pulley work.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We would wrap around this top pulley.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Go down around the bottom, wrap once more around the top

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and then connect somewhere in the middle here.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Now we can see that the tension is pulling upwards one, two, three times.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The force diagram for that is well, the weight points down

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and we have three arrows upwards each representing that tension.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Since the weight is a 1000 N, these each balance 1/3 of that and so we get a force of 333 N.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Of course the consequence is that your going have to pull three times further

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
than you did in the single case.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You can do similar thinking to solve for the quadruple pulley.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now you may already be seeing a very amazing pattern emerging from this data.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Before we explicitly point it out there, why don' we calculate

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
one more method for lifting this rock by 1 m, let's look at an incline plane.
