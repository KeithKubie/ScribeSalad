00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.110
These deep sea mushroom-shaped organisms don’t
fit in any known subdivision of the animal

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.110
kingdom.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.830
They’re flat discs and a stalk with a mouth
on the end and are kinda like corals and comb

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.290
jellies but not exactly so researchers are
baffled.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.429
And Airbus is patenting virtual reality sensory
isolation headgear which aside from audio

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:22.359
visual components include squirting smells
up passengers’ noses.

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.740
So you can completely forget you're flying
in an airplane.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.740
Vsauce!

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.740
Kevin here.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.810
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.620
Meta augmented reality glasses make science
fiction a reality.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.070
They use the natural world as the focus of
the computer interface - creating a real-time

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.680
map of your surroundings and allowing you
to interact with holograms.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.550
It’s the first machine to allow two people
to view and interact with digital information

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.379
from different perspectives while holding
eye contact - so for instance you could play

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.160
Minecraft with a friend in the same physical
space.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.960
The interface is designed by the same guy
who did the Iron Man movies and they hope

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.860
to implement this in everything from healthcare
and engineering to education and gaming.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.000
Jake from Vsauce3 tried them on and said this...

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.909
Quant e-Sportlimousine is a spots car that
runs on salt water.

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.829
It has a top speed of 217 mph and uses an
electrolyte flow cell power system to power

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:22.720
four electric motors.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.880
Electrical power for the drive train is created
by using salt water as an electrolyte and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.710
the solution is held in two 200-litre tanks
allowing you to drive up to 373 miles on a

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.210
single charge.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.070
And they just received approval to test it
on roads in Europe.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.620
UCLA biologists successfully used a genetic
'remote control' to slow the aging process.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.871
By activating a gene in the nervous system
or intestines of fruit flies they can see

00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:53.960
the aging process slow and they hope this
research can eventually be used to delay the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.799
onset of diseases in humans.

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.670
It turns out Stonehenge is way bigger than
we thought.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.820
Using radar, laser scanners and magnetometers,
researchers uncovered 17 new chapels, ritual

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.770
shrines, massive pits and a 108 foot long
burial mound containing a gigantic wooden

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.020
building that they believe was used for rituals
involving dead bodies.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.800
These new findings drastically change our
understanding of Stonehenge which was reshaped

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.670
for hundreds of years beginning in 3100BC.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.710
4MM is a jetpack for runners.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.081
Developed at Arizona State University, it
enhances human speed and agility with the

00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:36.720
goal of allowing any soldier to run a four
minute mile.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.550
DARPA asked for assistance in developing augmented
ability exoskeletons for able-bodied soldiers

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.860
and trials of the jetpack have shown its ability
to make users run faster while exerting less

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.090
energy.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.190
This shape-shifting architecture concept expands
and contracts based on temperature.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.470
It uses Shape Memory Polymer joints connected
to plywood to expand the original surface

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.240
area four times.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.170
The idea is to create architecture that isn’t
so rigid and is more attuned to the environment

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.610
but they admit real world applications on
a large-scale are a ways off.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.830
New ultralight ceramic cubes could be used
to build lighter, stronger airplanes, trucks

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.100
and batteries.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.470
The nanoscale struts can recover from being
crushed and they’re light enough to float

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.520
through the air.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.490
Ceramic usually shatters when dropped due
to its weight but at the nanoscale the material

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.190
is recoverable from compression - and they’re
now working to apply this nanostructure design

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.670
to lithium-air batteries.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:39.540
Finally, Eye Know uses streetlights and time-lapse
to create a kaleidoscope of Tokyo.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:51.480
I’m gonna leave you with smart headlights
that can adapt to any conditions at highway

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.580
speeds.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:04:40.720
And as always - thanks for watching.
