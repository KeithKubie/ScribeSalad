00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
You know that slimy,
gross blob of green

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.964
you get caught in
when you go swimming

00:00:03.964 --> 00:00:05.630
in a lake or a pool
that needs cleaning?

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:06.690
That stuff is the best!

00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:13.900
Hey peeps.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.483
Trace here, coming
at you from D News.

00:00:15.483 --> 00:00:18.460
How do you feel about algae?

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.690
Ambivalent, right?

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.700
I used to be like
that, but no longer.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.400
I am on board.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.600
I think algae is great, and
I don't care who knows it.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.460
Algae is amazing.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.130
Algae is a blanket term for a
large group of plants ranging

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.900
from single-celled
simple organisms

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.040
to giant kelps and seaweeds.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.220
Algae use chlorophyll to
produce energy and exhale

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.220
oxygen, which is great for us.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.300
But they can also be used for a
ton of other fantastic things.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.997
One major thing is algae could
be used to produce biofuel.

00:00:44.997 --> 00:00:47.330
Back in the spring, the Journal
of Environmental Science

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.150
and Technology published
a study showing algae

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.390
could be used to produce 25
billion gallons of biofuel

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.300
annually in the
United States alone,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.174
without stressing
our water resources.

00:00:57.174 --> 00:00:58.840
Well, that's only
one-twelfth of the way

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.900
to getting us off
fossil fuels altogether.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.060
This is just algae,
pond scum, slime.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.920
You might think oh, man, this
biodiesel from algae thing

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.800
is super complicated.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.090
But in reality, they put algae
in a press and squeeze it.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.590
Boom.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.300
Oil.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.070
Honestly.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.620
That's a lot like
an olive press.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.716
It gets 75% of the
efficiency of the algae.

00:01:17.716 --> 00:01:19.340
But by adding chemicals
to the process,

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.070
we can get up to 100% of
that oil out of the product.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.430
And that's not all algae can do.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.450
In Hamburg, Germany, a
15-unit apartment building

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.820
is powered by giant
tanks of algae

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.490
that's living there
on the exterior.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.610
The plants keep the
building cool in the summer

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.110
and insulate in the winter.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.680
Excess heat is funneled into
saline tanks to be used later.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.590
But that's not all.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.660
When the algae is grown enough,
it's harvested from the tanks

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.290
and put into a biomass
processor in the basement

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.375
to be used to
power the building.

00:01:46.375 --> 00:01:48.350
You don't want to
make power from algae?

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.272
That's OK.

00:01:49.272 --> 00:01:50.230
How about street lamps?

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.740
Yep.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.020
A French biochemist named
Pierre Calleja talked about it

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.670
at Ted X earlier this year.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.370
The plan would be to use this
CO2-sucking, energy-producing

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.130
algae to make oxygen
and energy, but also

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.720
use that extra energy to make
their bio-luminescence light

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.610
the streets at night.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.650
It's still conceptual, but aside
from imagining a city bathed

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.742
in an otherworldly
green awesomeness,

00:02:11.742 --> 00:02:13.200
you could just get
the street lamps

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.460
and put it on your own head.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.070
This is freaky as
hell, but maybe could

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.530
be the future perhaps, maybe?

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.770
Maybe?

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.960
I don't know.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.760
This is some kind of
dystopian, Promethean

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.800
strangeness, you guys.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.590
The little tubes are filled
with algae that feed on the CO2

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.190
exhaled by the
wearer and the light

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.450
hitting the thin tubes
from the outside.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.210
And when the wearer
needs a meal,

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.240
he or she can just suck
some of that algae right

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.270
into their bodies.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.990
The plants are
nutritious, though I

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.160
wouldn't say delicious.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.790
Not that I've tried them,
except for that one summer

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.460
at the lake, but
that was an accident.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.480
Currently the suit,
designed by Burton Nitta,

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.290
is relegated to the realm of
strange things, but who knows.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.710
If a food crisis hits, we
might be willing to try it.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.100
Algae, respect.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.600
Nice job.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.600
Keep up the good work, man.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.590
So what do you think?

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.548
Would you wear the suit,
live in the apartment,

00:02:57.548 --> 00:02:59.960
power your car with
this little organism?

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.587
