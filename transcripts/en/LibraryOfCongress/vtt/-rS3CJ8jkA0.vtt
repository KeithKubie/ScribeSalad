00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.340
&gt;&gt; Roberta I.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.790
Shaffer: And today we are pleased
to be cosponsoring this event

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.490
with our sister unit, the African
Hebraic and Middle Eastern Division

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.010
of library services and you
will meet the esteemed head

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.470
of that unit a little
bit later in the program.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.520
I just wanted to take a few
minutes to sort of set us

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.300
up for Human Rights
Day and its origins.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.580
Most people in the audience I
don't think looking out will recall

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.910
that it was started as a universal
declaration of human rights

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.550
in the United Nations in
1948 it was in Paris however.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.140
And it emanated from
the four freedoms

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.460
that President Franklin Delano
Roosevelt had articulated

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.010
in his 1941 State of the
Union address to Congress.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.260
And those four freedoms which were
very, very well known by everyone

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:30.680 position:56%
at the time were, of course, freedom
of religion, freedom of speech,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.310
freedom from want and
freedom from fear.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.100
Franklin Delano Roosevelt then
appointed the first lady Eleanor

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.890
to spearhead an effort
through the United Nations

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.990
to develop a universal
declaration of human rights.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.290
And I think what's worth recalling

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.490
at this time is the
composition of the delegation.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:06.320
So the delegation represented many,
many countries, Lebanon, Canada,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.930
the UK, Chile of course,
the United States,

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.320
China, the then Soviet Union.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.020
But what I think is even more
striking to think about in terms

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.260
of our discussions about human
rights today and then of course,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.660
our esteem colleagues and panelists
that we will hear from shortly,

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.330
is the fact that the initial
drafters were not just lawyers

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.990
and jurists.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:41.470 position:56%
Among the drafters were playwrights,
art collectors, of course,

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:49.030
educators, diplomats, trade
unionists, a former army official

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.930
from World War One,
and a theologian.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.010
So I'm always struck when I think

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.850
about human rights how
very interesting it was

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.740
that that initial group
that first recognized

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.990
that indeed there are universal
rights and that there, therefore,

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.470
must be universal protections
and universal ways to assure

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.810
that protections both
financial, as well as diplomatic

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.610
and perhaps even the use of force.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.650
That it was not just the
law that set that milestone.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.920
So I hope you will
think about that today

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.470
when you are listening
to our panelists.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.310
The more mundane thing
I need to ask you is

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.000
to please silence your
electronic devices.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.140
To please note that you do have
a question sheet in your program,

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.440
so if you would like to ask a
question to please write it down

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.540
and submit it to one of the
law library staff members

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.660
around the room.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.500
There is a program survey
and it is now my pleasure

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.050
to just briefly tell you
about our wonderful moderator

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.980
and convener for today.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.930 position:56%
Jane McAuliffe is our colleague, she
is inaugural head of the National

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.950
and International Outreach
Service Unit at the Library

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.640
of Congress, a newly created unit.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.520
She comes to this position
with an enormous resume.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.560
Former president of Bryn Mawr
College, former Dean of arts

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.620
and sciences at Georgetown
University.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.360
But most important, I think
for today's discussion a very,

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.170
very well respected and
prolific writer in the areas

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.740
of Islam and religious studies.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.950
She has her doctorate
in religious studies

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.360
from the University of Toronto.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.720 position:56%
And the final thing I will do before
turning the podium over to Jane is

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.010
to ask you to please make
sure that anything you brought

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.590
in today is neatly tucked
in the seat in front of you

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.290
and that your minds are in
the open and upright position.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.800
Jane, please take the podium.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.510
Thank you so much for
joining us today.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:12.040
[ Applause ]

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.340
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe:
Thank you Roberta.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.640
Good morning.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.560
Can you hear me, great?

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.760
It's my pleasure to
introduce the speakers

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.750 position:56%
who will tackle this fascinating and
ever so important topic this morning

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.340
and then to moderate the panel
of discussion that will follow

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.310
after their individual
presentations.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.650
We have for distinguished
speakers this morning

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.750
and I will do very brief
introductions of each of them

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.650
and then call them forward.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:50.800
The first is our own Issam Saliba
who is a specialist in Islamic law

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.660
for the Law Library of Congress
and has been so since 2003.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.030
He's written broadly and he's
written some very important things

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.430
on such matters as the
Saddam Hussein trial,

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:10.400 position:56%
on international tribunals, national
crimes in the Hariri assassination,

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.810
on Lebanon its presidential
election,

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.200
and the conflicting
constitutional interpretations.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.730
He's also written on a place of
Sharia among the legal systems

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.140
of the world, which would
probably be the very prelude

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.350
for today's discussion.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:34.280
Issam Saliba also testifies before
Congress on matters relevant

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:40.090
to his field of Islamic law on such
matters as the Iraqi Constitution

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:45.710
and the laws on oil and gas
production in those areas.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.820
So a broad range of expertise
is represented in his testimony.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.180
Prior to coming to the Library
of Congress he practiced law

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.350
as a member of the Beirut bar
and he's also an associate member

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.090
of the District of Columbia bar.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:06.570 position:56%
Our next speaker will be Dr. Kristen
Stilt who's a professor of law

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:10.850
and co-director of the
Islamic Legal Studies program

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.620
at Harvard Law School.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.400
Before that she was at Northwestern
as a professor of international law

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.320
at the Northwestern Law School
and is a professor of history

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.890
in the university itself.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:29.900
Her JD is from the University
of Texas at Austin and her PhD

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.330
in Middle Eastern studies
and history is from Harvard.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.460
She has had research
support from some

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.890
of the country's most
prestigious foundations,

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:45.000
including the Carnegie Foundation
and the Guggenheim Foundation

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.800
and has published material
which is particularly important

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.690
for our conversation.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:56.830
Her book with Oxford University
Press in 2011 was Islamic Law

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:01.950
in Action, a journal published this
year in the International Journal

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:06.830
of Constitutional Law is
entitled Contextualizing

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.300
Constitutional Islam.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:15.710
Her colleague at Harvard is Dr.
Intisar Rabb who is also professor

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.600
of law at Harvard Law
School and co-director

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.390
of its Islamic legal
studies program.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:28.330
Doctor Rabb is also a professor of
history at Harvard and a professor

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:32.070
at the Radcliffe Institute
for Advanced Studies.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:35.380
Before coming to Harvard she
taught at New York University

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.230
in their Middle Eastern
Islamic studies department

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:41.130
and at NYU Law School.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.800
She's been a visiting
associate professor

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.420
in the Islamic legal studies
program at Harvard and a member

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:52.660
of the faculty at the
Boston College Law School.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.650
Her bachelor's degree is
from Georgetown University,

00:08:55.650 --> 00:09:02.150
her JD from Yale and bot her
MA and PhDs are from Princeton.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:06.270
Dr. Rabb was a law clerk
for Judge Thomas Ambro

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.570
of the United States Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:14.560
She too has been supported by
major foundations in this country,

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.360
including the Carnegie
Foundation and the Beckman Center

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.560 position:56%
for Internet and Society at Harvard.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.960 position:56%
Her most recent publications include
an edited volume that she did

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:30.520
with Michael Cook and others in
2013, entitled Law and Tradition

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.810
in Classic Islam, as well as her
own monograph Doubt in Islamic Law

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:39.770
that was published this year
by Cambridge University Press.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:45.220 position:56%
And finally we have Dr. Sherman
Jackson who is the King Faisal Chair

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:53.340
of Islamic thought and culture
and has been so since 2011.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.830
This is the first and the oldest
endowed chair in Islamic studies

00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:01.010
in the United States, it's at the
University of Southern California.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.900
Sherman is in Southern
California now, but he has been

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.660
in many other places including
University of Texas at Austin,

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:13.650
Indiana University, Wayne State
and the University of Michigan.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:16.730
His PhD, however, is from the
University of Pennsylvania,

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.500
so he has East Coast roots.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.530 position:56%
His publication list is too long for
me to read every single one of them,

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:25.990
but they come in an
amazing range of material.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:31.140
Most recent book is entitled
Initiative to Stop the Violence,

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:35.060
Sadat's Assassins and the
Renunciation of Political Violence

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.870
that Yale published last year.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:40.860
He has written on Sufism,
he's written on Islam

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.170
in the black American and Islam
and the problem of black suffering

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:48.350
and several other books
on Islamic law.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:52.980
He's currently working on a book
called Beyond Good and Evil Sharia

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.440
and the challenge of
the Islamic Secular.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.100 position:56%
Each of our speakers has 15 minutes.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.680
We will keep the four
presentations to an hour.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:10.480
I will do kind of diplomatic
timing, but will also rely

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.410
on my colleagues to
be good citizens.

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:17.510
So with that I welcome
Issam Saliba to the podium.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:27.300
[ Applause ]

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.350
&gt;&gt; Issam M. Saliba: Thank
you Jane, good morning.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:35.490
Islamic law is a legal system of
special characteristics described

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:39.240
by the late Joseph Schacht
Introduction to Islamic Law.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:45.060
At the epitome of Islamic thought
the most typical manifestation

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:51.730
of the Islamic way of life, the
core and kernel of Islam itself.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:55.660
Unlike its counterparts in the
west Islamic law regulates acts

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.300
of worship and religious
rituals [inaudible].

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:03.740
And acts of regular
transactions or [inaudible].

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:08.950
The purpose of this presentation is
to inquire whether the reformation

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:12.010
of the law of Muamalat
and not the law

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:15.330
of any particular state is possible

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.780
from within the Islamic
legal theory.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:24.890 position:56%
The Islamic legal theory is based on
immoral concept of right and wrong

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:30.030
or good and bad under which the
law mandates the performance

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.220
of what is good and
forbids the performance

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.410
of what is bad of the human acts.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:43.400 position:56%
Back in the 1950's, the late US
Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:48.790
captured the essence of this
theory by pointing out that

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:54.400
under American law in
contrast to Islamic law one may

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.630
at the same time be
a law-abiding citizen

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.540
and a totally shabby character.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.650
The majority of Muslim scholars
who organizing to schools

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:10.290
of Islamic legal thought
or [inaudible] argued

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:16.480
that a human reason cannot on
its own gain knowledge of the law

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.750
because it's determination
of the goodness and badness

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:26.270
of human acts is relative and
with the changing identity

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:30.010
of the person making
the determination.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:34.780
To illustrate this point Abu
?amid Mu?ammad Al Ghazali,

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:39.490
the 12 century Muslim
scholar gives in his book.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:41.960
[ Foreign Language Being Spoken ]

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.980
The example of killing a king.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:50.930
He states that the act of
killing is considered a good act

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:56.400
by the King's enemies and a
bad act by his supporters.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.950
Muslims believe the sharia
consisting of the divine commands

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:05.770
of God regulates all
aspects of the human conduct,

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:09.760
including in the field
of legal relations.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.400
What God describes
is necessarily good.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:20.560
What God forbids or
proscribes is necessarily bad.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.410
The Quran, the holy book of
Islam, and the traditions

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:28.930
or the prophet Mohammed
contain the divine commands

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.770
and are the primary
source of the law.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:36.170
The Sunnah was transmitted
through order reports

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.780
or [inaudible] before
being collected

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.760
into what is known
as Books of Hadith.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:46.180
God's prescriptions and
proscriptions are rarely

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:51.600
if at all readily identifiable
as legal rules.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.800
For example, verse 590 of
the Quran warns the believers

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.370
against gambling and against wine.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:04.870
The meaning is relatively clear,
gambling and wine are prohibited.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:09.540
But it is not clear one,

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:14.580
whether these prohibitions
entail worldly punishments.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:19.260
Two, whether the punishments
are civil or criminal.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:23.270
And three, whether the two
prohibitions have the same

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:24.940
legal consequences.

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:28.670
To deal with such questions the
school has developed a specialized

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:31.210
discipline of study
known as [inaudible]

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:33.940
or science of understanding.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:38.000
[Inaudible] gives a human
reason, the prominent role

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.820
of interpreting the divine commands

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:46.070
to derive the legal rules using
the utmost intellectual efforts

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.790
in a process called Ijtihad.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:53.230
In [inaudible] Al Ghazali states

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:58.750
that [inaudible] is among
the most noble sciences why?

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:06.380 position:56%
Because it is the place where reason
and revelation conjoin and opinion

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.430
and divine commands coalesce.

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:15.650
Through Ijtihad the schools
interpreted verse 590

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:18.620
to derive two different rules.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.690
One making the consumption of wine

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:25.260
or any other intoxicants
a criminal act punishable

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.210
by a number of lashes.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:34.890
The other making gambling a grave
sin for which expiation is due.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.760
The totality of the
interpretations produced

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.800
by the schools during
a formative period

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:47.470
of about 300 years constitutes
what we call today sharia law

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:49.790
or Islamic law.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:54.850
Even though it has according to
Justice Jackson an amazing record

00:16:54.850 --> 00:17:00.910
of accomplishments, Islamic law
has been stagnant for a long time

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:07.650
and some of its rules are
incompatible with modern norms.

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:11.960
A Muslim who abandons
Islam is still subject

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:16.230 position:56%
to the death penalty notwithstanding
his [inaudible] right

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:20.420
to believe or not to believe.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:24.810
A Jew is still required
to convert to Islam

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:31.800 position:56%
or pay the jizya notwithstanding the
instructions of the prophet Mohammed

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:37.740
that no Jew shall be
enticed to leave Judaism.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:41.670
And the [inaudible] faith
is still the confessed form

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:45.430
of government notwithstanding
the silence

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:48.890
of the Quran on this subject.

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:52.570
Three questions are
relevant to our inquiry.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:56.420
First, is Islamic law immutable?

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:59.880
The majority of Muslims appear
to believe in the immutability

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.300
of Islamic law by refusing

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:06.870
to critically discuss past
interpretation of sharia.

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:11.860 position:56%
In his book The Reconstruction of
Religious Thought in Islam published

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:19.070 position:56%
in 1930 Muhammad Iqbal referring to
millions of Muslims in India writes,

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:25.420 position:56%
unfortunately, the conservative
Muslim public of this country is not

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:30.560
yet quite ready for a critical
discussion of [inaudible],

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:35.670
which if undertaken is likely
to displease most people

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:39.340
and raise sectarian controversies.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.030 position:56%
Attempts at legal reforms undertaken

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:47.820
by self-proclaimed Muslim states
have largely gone backward.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.660
In the 1990's Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd,

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:56.620
an Egyptian professor was
judicially declared [inaudible]

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.840
because of his academic writings.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:06.250
And as a result his marriage to
his Muslim wife was nullified.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:10.390
Going back to the Islamic
legal theory, we find no basis

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:13.470
for the belief in the
immutability of the law

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.040
as interpreted by the schools.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:20.350
None of the schools has ever
claimed finality or exclusivity

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:23.210
of its interpretations of sharia.

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:29.280
Imam Abu Hanifa [inaudible]
is reported to have said,

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:33.590
our ruling is an opinion,
the best we could attain.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:38.060
Whoever comes with a better
option deserves our support.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:43.340 position:56%
And the Islamic [inaudible] there is
room for different interpretations

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:51.600 position:56%
to coexist and by extension for such
interpretations to evolve or change.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.130
In one [inaudible] Prophet
Muhammad is reported to have said,

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:58.370
the disagreement of my
community is a blessing.

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:02.290
The Islamic legal theory itself
recognizes the evolving nature

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:09.730
of Islamic law by adopting the
maxim that states there is denying

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:13.040
that the changes in times
lead to changes in law.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:19.500
It incumbent upon the Muslim
polity to realize that the law

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.750
as formulated by the schools
during the early centuries

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:26.920
of Islam is not impervious
to change.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.850
Second, can the sharia support
the new interpretations?

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:36.100
The universal principles and
values of sharia, such as justice,

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:41.580
equality, and the public
interest not only support but call

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.000
in my opinion

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.330
for new interpretations
of the divine commands.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:53.030
[Inaudible], a Muslim scholar who
died around 1316 argues in one

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:56.230
of his writings that the principle

00:20:56.230 --> 00:21:01.350
of public interest is the ultimate
guide in deriving the legal rules

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:05.260
of sharia and should be
given precedence even

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.710
over contrary statements
of the divine text.

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:15.110
In his collection of fataawas
[inaudible] the renowned 14th

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:18.680
century Muslim scholar
quotes approvingly

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:23.780
that God would support a just
government of unbelievers,

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:28.630
meaning unMuslims and would not
support an unjust government

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:31.260
of believers meaning Muslims.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:35.760 position:56%
In 1925, Ali Abdel Raziq, a
faculty member of Islamic University

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:40.020
of Al-Azhar published a book
titled, Islam and the Foundation

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:46.380
of Governance in which he relies
on divine sources to conclude

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:51.080
that sharia gives the Muslim
polity the right to adopt the form

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:56.110
of government most
suitable to its needs.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.470
If the Sunni Muslim polity
ideas with [inaudible]

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:06.690
and Ali Abdel Raziq there is no
doubt that the political theory

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:11.230
of the caliphate would undergo a
dramatic reformation from within.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:18.240
And lead to the establishment of a
modern government without the need

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:22.170
for assistance from
us here in the west.

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:28.140
In the reconstruction of religious
thought Muhammad Iqbal writes the

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:32.180
republican form of government is
not the only authority consistent

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:36.470
with the spirit of Islam, but has
also become a necessity in view

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:41.700
of the new forces that are
set free in the word of Islam.

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:46.560
Because of his belief in
the compatibility of Islam

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:52.220
with modern government Sheikh
Muhammad Abdu, the great reformer

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:58.740
of the 19th century has allegedly
said after visiting friends.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:04.860
In France I saw Islam
I didn't see Muslims.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:10.050
In Egypt I see Muslims
I don't see Islam.

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:15.820
My colleagues on this
panel may have more to say

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.630
about how specific interpretations

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:24.060
of sharia would support
through reformation.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:29.820
Third, who has the authority
to reform Islamic law?

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:34.210
To answer this question we need
to go back to the formative period

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:40.610
and find out how the work of the
various schools was legitimized

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:44.250
into becoming a binding law.

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:48.310
The schools did not have any
authority in this regard.

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:53.710 position:56%
None of the schools had any official
status, representative capacity

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:59.570
or legislative mandate to decide
on what the law is or isn't.

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:02.990
They all came into existence
on their own initiative

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:06.420
and acted independently
from and at times

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:09.200
in confrontation with the state.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:14.620
The authority that legitimized
the law as formulated

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:19.980
by the schools was the
authority of the Muslim people.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:24.930
Schools that did not garner the
consent of the people disappeared

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:31.220
and their interpretations of the
divine commands never became law.

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:35.460
Among the many schools that came
into existence only the work

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:42.420
of a few got the support
needed to become binding law.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:46.120
The authority of the Muslim
polity as the legitimizing factor

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:53.330 position:56%
of Islamic law has been enshrined in
the doctrine of Ijma or consensus.

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:58.510
And that this doctrine the
consensus of the Muslim polity

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:01.750
on a legal matter not
only legitimizes

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:07.230 position:56%
that legal rule resulting therefrom,
but constitutes an original source

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:10.830
of the legal rules themselves.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:17.660
As a consequence, the Muslim polity
not the Muslim scholars has the

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:21.820
authority to reform Islamic law.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:28.110
In concluding, it is
reasonable to wonder

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:34.840
if the Islamic legal theory
allows for the reformation

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.800
of Islamic law from within.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:43.130
Why haven't such reformations
materialized?

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:47.990
The essence of the answer
given by Muhammed Iqbal early

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:52.970
in the last century is
probably still valid today.

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:58.560
The conservative Muslim public
is still not yet quite ready

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:04.290
for a critical discussion of the
past interpretation of sharia.

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:06.510
Thank you very much.

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:23.140
[ Applause ]

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:27.260
&gt;&gt; Kristen A. Stilt: Thank you to
Dr. Saliba and to Kimberly Zellars

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.850
and everyone here at the Library
of Congress for this invitation

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:34.390
to be here on or in honor of
I should say Human Rights Day.

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:37.100
We have a few more days until
Human Rights Day itself.

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:41.240
I am very pleased to be here with
such distinguished colleagues.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:47.220 position:56%
And today I'll be focusing on family
law in this short presentation.

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:51.280
So family law in Muslim majority
countries has undergone tremendous

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:55.380
change over the past century
and this change continues today

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:58.070
with intensity and controversy.

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:00.110
And change can happen in many ways

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:03.140
and can be led by many
types of actors.

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:06.990
But today I'm talking about
when actors such as legislators

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:11.650 position:56%
or activists or monarchs want to
change family law with the intention

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:14.740
of improving the rights
of women and children.

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:19.840
And in general, this change has
sought to adopt national laws

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:24.470 position:56%
that would modify the rules of
Islamic law that had been applicable

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:27.870
and predominant in that
particular country.

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:30.440
And these efforts and
I'll call them reforms

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:35.080
because that's the term the
actors use themselves have focused

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.600
on a number of areas in particular.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:43.300
So substantively, these efforts
have aimed at placing restrictions

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:46.850
on a husband's right to enter
into a polygamous marriage,

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:48.410
limiting a husband's right

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:52.780 position:56%
to unilaterally declare his wife
divorced, extending a mother's right

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:56.350
to custody of the children
and be compensated for it

00:27:56.350 --> 00:28:00.160
by her ex-husband, raising
the minimum marriage age,

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:04.440
expanding a wife's ability to get
a divorce at her own initiative

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.960
and requiring a husband
to compensate his wife

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.870
if he arbitrarily divorces her.

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:13.490 position:56%
So in some Muslim majority countries
and we'll take Turkey as the example

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:16.970
of this, major modification of
the family law have been made

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:20.340
by essentially adopting
secular codes.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:25.130
In doing so in Turkey for example,
Turkey operated in the context

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:28.730
of its form of secularism as
enshrined in its constitution

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:32.780
and did not attempt to justify
any of its changes as compatible

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.830
with Islamic law in any way.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:37.690
But in most Muslim
majority countries,

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:40.750
the rules of Islamic law
are particularly relevant

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:42.690
in the area of family law.

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:46.260
And so the change process or
the reform process takes place

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:51.170 position:56%
within this space and changes are
presented as taking place internally

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:54.480
to Islamic law rather than
something external to it.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.890
So just to be clear
what I mean by that.

00:28:56.890 --> 00:29:00.050
This may be in a country for
which religious law is not part

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:03.110
of other areas of the law like
business law or criminal law

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:07.090
or international law, but family
law often remains a domain

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:09.400
where there's a belief
that it is Islamic law

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.090
and that it should remain that way.

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:14.760
That belief is somewhat problematic
and we can talk about that later.

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:18.820
So the reasons for this internal
approach range from faith-based

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:23.850 position:56%
to pragmatic, including the personal
beliefs of advocates and lawmakers

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:27.870
and concerns over the lack of
popular acceptance of a family law

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:32.080
that appears to be western
or secular in origin.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:36.120
And so my talk today will focus
very briefly on two changes

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:39.830
in Sunni family law and how
those changes have been presented

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:42.120
or justified to strategies.

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:47.040
My focus in this project from which
this short presentation is derived

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:50.630
is focused mainly on the Arab
Sunni world, but we can talk beyond

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:52.440
that later if you would like.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.160
So one when more preliminary
comment.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.070
I think we want to think and
talk about what is gained

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:01.350
and what is lost when family
law in a country is seen

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:04.570
as the exclusive domain
of Islamic law.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:09.420
It tends to mean that when an
advocacy organization sees a social

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.110
need for a change they
have to carefully think

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:15.280
about whether they can
justify it in Islamic terms.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.700
But of course if they can
the potential for acceptance

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.420
of the change can be much higher.

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:23.170
But, of course, many of these
countries have signed international

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:26.780
human rights treaties, such as
the convention on the elimination

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:30.560
of all forms of discrimination
against women or CEDAW.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:35.520
Although, sometimes they have put
reservations with those treaties.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.700
And advocacy groups might be
very active in conversations

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.590
about human rights treaties
like CEDAW and see them

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:44.880
as setting important
benchmarks or goals.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.980
But is the fact that a
country's laws are not compatible

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:52.720
with CEDAW off for example, on its
own enough to garner the initiative

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:55.510
to change the law and
that's the big question.

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:58.850
And the answer is probably
not for many places.

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:01.930
An exhaustive study
of Morocco and Jordan

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:05.100
that a scholar has just
completed she noted quote,

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:08.980
despite women's groups questioning
that family law should be

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:13.720
or indeed is Islamic law publicly,
they still have to recognize

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:17.600
that family law is Islamic law,
which limits the possible arguments

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.400
that can be used to
advance their claims.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:24.310
So with that background I just
want to cover two areas of the law

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:25.700
and show you what the change was

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.740
and then how it was
justified in Islamic terms.

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:32.130
And the first one is polygamy

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:36.190
and the strategy that's been
used is essentially taking powers

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:39.510
that were left in the hands of
individuals and the husbands

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:44.070
in particular and assigning
that power to a judge.

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:48.960
So few Muslim majority countries
have abolished polygamy as a matter

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:54.600
of national law, but most attempt
to curtail the rights of a husband

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.280 position:56%
to enter into a polygamous marriage.

00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.590
And they place emphasis
on the Quranic verse

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:02.910
that requires equitable
treatment among wives.

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:07.740
Quote, then marry from among other
women, such as are lawful to you,

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:10.480
two, three or four, but
if you have reason to fear

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.070
that you might not
be able to treat them

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:14.480
with equal fairness that only one.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:19.450
And that verse seems to speak
to a man and cautions him.

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:24.140
Yet another verse says, no it's
not possible to do that quote

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:26.590
and it will not be within
your power to treat your wives

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:30.010
with equal fairness,
however, you may desire it.

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:33.940
And so do not allow yourselves
to incline towards the exclusion

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:38.020
to one exclusion of the other
leaving her in a state of having

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:39.320
and not having a husband.

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.660
I just paraphrased there.

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:45.700 position:56%
So many countries have adopted laws
that essentially require the husband

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:49.630
to go to the judge and
not leave that decision

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:53.050
about equal treatment
up to the individual.

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:59.300
Morocco adopted this approach
in 2004 in its family law code

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.490
that many you might
be familiar with.

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:05.030
In the preamble the Moroccan king
said he would not allow outlaw

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:08.800
polygamy due to his belief
that it is permissible.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:12.800
But he said that polygamous
marriages would only be allowed

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:17.010
under compelling circumstances
and stringent restrictions

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:19.860
with the judge's authorization.

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:23.480
The judge must verify that
the husband has the means

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:27.000
and there must be an exceptional
mode of justifying polygamy

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.280
and this perspective second
wife must know and must consent

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.870
to the polygamist marriage.

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:39.830
Most recently in Jordan the
Jordanian Women's Union officially

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:42.340
opposed polygamy, but
they were afraid

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:46.100
that they wouldn't achieve
that in the 2010 law.

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:50.590
And so they instead proposed
judicial oversight along the same

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:53.170
lines as what was done in Morocco.

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:57.410
So notice how this strategy
works, it does not attempt

00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:01.450
to declare polygamy impermissible
or even illegal in the state,

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:06.160
but instead uses those verses
to say to the husband more

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.680
or less we don't think you're
the one that should decide

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:12.680
and the judge will
be the one to do it.

00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:15.240
But I should note that even
that strategy has been seen

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:18.810
as too controversial
in some countries.

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:21.860
So the next area, the second
area quickly is the area

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:23.160
of marriage contracts.

00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:27.510
And the strategy here is something
I call encouraging the permissible.

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:31.260
So this strategy recognizes
that a gap exists

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:34.800
between what's permissible
as a matter of Islamic law

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:40.110
and what reformers think they can
actually require as state law.

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:44.060
And so they try to approximate
state law by encouraging people

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:47.030
to take advantage of
options they already have.

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:50.680
And so on one level this is sort
of like know your rights campaign,

00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:55.570
but the more you can encourage
something the more it would be

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:59.800
potentially taken up by individuals
the more you can approximate

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.940
something like national law.

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:05.680
And so a good example of
this comes from Jordan.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:10.060
So marriage contracts can contain
additional stipulations as long

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:14.270
as they don't undercut the
essence of the contract itself.

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:17.470
So the Jordanian laws of 1976

00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:22.890
and 2010 specifically
identify conditions or clauses

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:25.900
in the contract that are
considered acceptable

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.980
and would be upheld
by a Jordanian court.

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:32.260
These include for example,
requiring the husband not

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:35.730
to take another wife, not to
prevent the wife from working,

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:38.860
not to require her to move
to a place she doesn't want

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:41.760
and giving her the right
to divorce herself.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.660
And so the activists felt that
they were not able to achieve

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:48.340
that as a matter of
national law for example,

00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:50.080
without anything else spoken

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:53.330
about in the contract the
husband do those things.

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:57.250
But by mentioning these in the
law there's an implicit statement,

00:35:57.250 --> 00:36:00.260
you can do this, you can
put this into your contract

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:03.570
and the state will uphold that.

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:09.390
But in contrast, Egypt was not
able to go down that same path.

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:12.700
So while women may add
stipulations in their contract

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:17.170
and that's not a problem at all
what activists had wanted was a way

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:21.010
in which to make it known to women
here's conditions you can put in.

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:25.070 position:56%
These the state will uphold and your
contract will not be considered null

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:26.980
and void as a result.

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:32.690
And so a coalition
drafted a marriage contract

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:34.520 position:56%
that not only included a blank space

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:38.830 position:56%
where these stipulations could be
written in, but also listed a number

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:43.590
of questions that the notary was
supposed to ask the couple helping

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:47.530
to perhaps prompt them to
consider these conditions.

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:52.060
And the questions included
speaking to the husband,

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:55.850
do you agree to abstain from
marrying an additional wife

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:58.150
and if you do so, do you agree

00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:01.240
that your wife will have the
right to divorce herself.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:05.090
And so by posing questions like
this to the husband in a yes

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:09.090
or no way the idea was at that
moment when the couple is filling

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:13.640 position:56%
out this marriage contract the
woman would understand she could ask

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:17.310
for this and the husband would
have to essentially say no

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:21.080
if he didn't want that to be
included in the marriage contract.

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:25.450 position:56%
And so the Egyptian government
actually supported this new marriage

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:28.640
contract that would have
these prompting questions

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:32.290
and sought the opinions of
religious scholars on it.

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:34.870
One of the highest
religious officials in Egypt,

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:39.070
the Sheikh of al-Azhar actually
rejected this proposed marriage

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:44.620
contract and he said while
it's lawful for the woman

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:50.550 position:56%
to achieve these conditions in her
contract it should not be encouraged

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:52.380
as a matter of state law.

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:56.780
And he said it violated a concept
of the husband's superiority

00:37:56.780 --> 00:38:00.690
or authority over the
particular -- over the woman.

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:04.720 position:56%
And so the rejection of the standard
contract is essentially a rejection

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:07.720
of that strategy of
encouraging the permissible,

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.680 position:56%
at least in that particular context.

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:15.230
So the stipulation is permissible
according to the religious leader

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:19.010
who essentially who said
he wouldn't support it.

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:21.580
But encouraging it through the
national marriage registration

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:25.930
process was not according to him.

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:28.110
So just to sum up this strategy

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:33.170
of encouraging the permissible it
is distinct from a national law

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:36.090
that would require that
result on every individual.

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:39.840 position:56%
It would leave it to the individuals
to adopt it or not to adopt it,

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.040
but the extent of encouragement
could come close

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:47.780
to approximating a national law
if indeed everyone adopted it.

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:49.840 position:56%
But it's easier, it's more palatable

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.360
because it doesn't raise
the same level of opposition

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:58.060
as perhaps a national law that
would prevent polygamy for example,

00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:02.120
to go back to the example
I started with.

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:09.360 position:56%
So in being mindful of my precise
time limits I've given you here just

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:12.680
two areas of law, polygamous
marriages

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:16.630
and then marriage contracts and
marital relations more generally,

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:21.440
along with a strategy that went
along with each particular area.

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:27.840
Encouraging the permissible
and delegating authority

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.000
to a judge or other official.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.900 position:56%
This comes from a larger work I have
in which I discuss nine strategies

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:37.490
across a wide array of
substantive areas of family law

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:41.480
and can certainly talk about that
later or send anyone the paper

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.960
if this is a concern of yours.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:47.460
But given that our context today is
Human Rights Day I want an echo an

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:50.440
issue I mentioned at the outset.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:54.250 position:56%
So one of the goals of this
project of identifying strategies is

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:57.790
to contribute to a larger
conversation about the benefits

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:02.210
and disadvantages of using
strategies rooted in Islamic law

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:05.350
in comparison with other
ways that could be used

00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:09.550
to achieve improvements in this
case for women and children

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:11.500
in the context of family law.

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:16.110
And of course, a prominent other
source of law or change comes

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:21.100 position:56%
from the convention on the rights of
women as I mentioned at the outset.

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:23.000
So I just leave us
with four questions

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.790
that I hope we can talk about.

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:30.100
So the first is what is gained
and what is lost when family law

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:35.360 position:56%
in a particular country is seen as
the exclusive domain of Islamic law.

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:39.730
And what is gained and what is
lost and from who's perspective.

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:42.540
Secondly, what is gained and what
is lost when Islamic arguments

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:47.750
on family law are particularly
relevant in a society and what

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:51.040
if they're the only relevant
argument in a society.

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:54.450
The third one is how can
international human rights based

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:57.570
arguments become persuasive
in a context

00:40:57.570 --> 00:40:59.830
where they have not been
very persuasive right.

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:04.740
What about a country or a society
or a component of a society

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:07.820 position:56%
where the international human rights
arguments have not been considered

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:09.840
persuasive or even important.

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:14.370
And then the last one is how can
international human rights norms

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:18.250
and Islamic law work together
and I do think they can.

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:20.810
Can they be mutually reinforcing?

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:23.240
So let me leave with
those open-ended questions

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:25.080
that we can come back to.

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.880
Thank you.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:46.040
[ Applause ]

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.340
&gt;&gt; Intisar A. Rabb: He
was handing me a pointer,

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:50.420
I thought about doing a PowerPoint
presentation, but I've heard

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:54.010
that power corrupts and
PowerPoint corrupts to a point

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:58.330
so I thought I'd avoid that
for right now that comes later.

00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:04.340
I'd like to thank Issam Saliba,
Kimberly Zellars, Cliff Brown

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:09.440
and all the other librarians
who are here and have invited us

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:13.770
to inform this session
which I'm honored to join.

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:17.010
I'll be talking about
Islamic criminal law

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:21.950
through internal critique or as
related to internal critique.

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:24.970
And this is the talk in a
nutshell, so I'll try and say this

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:27.350
in 30 seconds and then you
can you ignore the rest

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:29.020
or you can stay tuned
for the details.

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:31.860
So basically I'll be talking --

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:36.040
I want to discuss the doctrine
of doubt in Islamic law

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:41.910
as a significant feature of Islamic
criminal law and make the argument

00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:45.580
that this concept of doubt
and dynamic interpretation

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:50.020
that goes along with it are key
to what I'm calling a process

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:55.270
of internal critique that pervades
Islamic law on a meta-level

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:59.630
and that could lead to
positive change in criminal law.

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:01.870
So that's the talk in a nutshell.

00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:04.640
So as to the details let
me start by saying a word

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:08.510
about why we should be interested
in the idea of internal critique,

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:12.490
which as I'm using it is a process
through which an illegal arena

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:15.240
that I'm concerned with Muslim
jurists critically assess the

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:17.390
rulings and applications
of Islamic law.

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:19.680
So they critically
assess Islamic law.

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:23.860
And this process tends to happen
at particular historic moments,

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:25.950
both medieval and modern.

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:29.960
And such moments might occur when
the entire system of Islamic law

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:34.860
and governance does not exemplify
the values it purports to espouse

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:39.270
or it does not serve the purpose of
ensuring law and order with respect

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:43.510
to a greater moral system
or it functions in a context

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:47.020 position:56%
in which those preserving or seeking

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:51.770
to preserve the moral order lack
the political or legal authority

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:55.130
to do so, to provide
the type of individual

00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:57.250
and institutional guidance

00:43:57.250 --> 00:44:00.070
or governance required
for a just society.

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:05.770
So in short, internal critique
often follows moments of crisis,

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:11.980
such as the fall of Baghdad in 1258
or the fall of Baghdad in 2003.

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:15.440
So this moment is arguably
one such moment.

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:17.790
Today we might expect
to see internal critique

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:20.310
where there is a widespread lack
of authority, ongoing questions

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:27.070
about who speaks for Islam, such
questions as Issam Saliba raised.

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:31.170
The tragic rise of extremist
groups like ISIS who use violence

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:35.340
in the form of war and egregious
harsh criminal punishments

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:38.140
and that's something I'll focus
on in particular as a means

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:40.430
of social control of
gaining territory,

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:43.270
instilling terror all
the while claiming

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:47.590
that their actions are
based on early Islamic law.

00:44:47.590 --> 00:44:49.650
So nothing could be more false.

00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:53.920
And then the rest of the talk I
have aimed to explain what I mean

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:59.500
by that, not by refuting what
are simply outrageous discussions

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:04.020
that question whether sex, slavery
or wanton killing are sanctioned

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.610
by Islamic law they're not.

00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:11.340
But by giving a sense of the type
of reasonable decision-making

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:15.280
that Islamic law does historically
sanction in areas of law

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:18.110
and policy in the criminal arena.

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:22.530
And then I want to talk about
the type of dynamic rules

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:25.020
that Muslim thinkers,
judges, jurists,

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:28.430
other scholars produced
historically with respect

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:33.280
to what I call a doctrine of
doubt in Islamic criminal law.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:38.100
And then I'll end with a look
at some modern experiments

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:42.420
in Islamic criminal law
that seek to use or that

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.490
through internal critique
seek to change

00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:47.420
or update their Islamic
criminal law codes.

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:51.680
And just one word about
-- one more word

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:55.020
about the term Islamic
critique or internal critique.

00:45:55.020 --> 00:46:01.760
I prefer to use this term over
reform, although our title

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:05.350
for the talk is called
perspectives on Islamic law reform

00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:09.450
because this is a sort of
critique that is a means

00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:17.450
of updating Islamic law through
using Islamic legal arguments.

00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:21.760 position:56%
And this relates to what Kristen
Stilt was saying about the resonance

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:26.370
or salience of international
human rights norms as opposed

00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:31.410
to Islamic legal arguments and
perhaps the end is the same

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:35.420
of universal or shared
values, but the articulation

00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:37.830
of them may resonate
more in one context.

00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:40.450
And I think internal
critique captures that better

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:43.500
than human rights reform.

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:47.950
So let's start with
what do I mean by doubt.

00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:51.550
I want to start with an
episode from early Islamic life,

00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:56.300 position:56%
it's something that's reported in
both Sunni and Shia sources repeated

00:46:56.300 --> 00:47:00.580
across the board and
throughout Islamic history as one

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:03.060
of the iconic examples of --

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:04.880
an illustrative example

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:08.270
of what should happen
in criminal law context.

00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:15.430
So in this early episode there's
a type of early police force

00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:19.380
in a small Arabian
town out patrolling.

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:23.150
And members of the patrol come
across a man in the town ruins

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:26.910
and he's holding a bloodstained
knife and he's standing

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:31.870
over another man who apparently
has just been stabbed to death.

00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:35.770
So the patrol arrest the man
with the knife and upon arrest

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:38.650
that man confesses
and says I killed him.

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:44.470
And the suspect is brought before
Ali, who is the beloved cousin

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:46.420
and son-in-law of the
prophet Muhammad

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:50.850
who had died just a
few decades before Ali

00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:56.260
in Islamic history is the fourth
caliph according to Sunni accounts

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:59.700
and the first imam,
according to Shia accounts.

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:04.350
So he's an authoritative early
figure and he's presiding

00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:06.800
over criminal trials in
his capacity as leader

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.680
of the young Muslim community.

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:14.300
And upon hearing the defendant's
story Ali reportedly sentenced the

00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:17.470
man to death in accordance with
the Islamic law of homicide

00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:21.050
which accommodates the death
penalty, life for life,

00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:27.930
unless there's commutation at the
request of the victim's family.

00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:30.080
So before the sentence was carried

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:33.530
out another man rushed forward
telling the executioners don't be

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:36.730
so hasty, don't kill him
I did it he announced.

00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:39.880
And Ali returned to the
condemned man incredulously well,

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:42.410
what made you confess to a
murder that you did not commit.

00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:45.800
And the man explained that while
he thought Ali would never take his

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:49.140
word for it because all the
signs had pointed to him

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:53.140
as the perpetrator, but in
reality he was a butcher

00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:56.530
who had just finished
slaughtering a cow and immediately

00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:59.850
after the slaughter he
needed to relieve himself.

00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:03.810
So he entered the area of the
ruins, bloody knife still in hand

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:06.900
and upon return he came across
the dead man and he stood

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:09.880
over him actually in
concern and it was then

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:11.780
that the patrol encountered him.

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:16.390
And he figured that he couldn't
plausibly avoid admitting

00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:20.000
to the crime and so
he did so and decided

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.640
to leave the matter in God's hands.

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.570
And a second man, the
actual perpetrator,

00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:26.260
purported actual perpetrator,

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:29.200
he offered a corroborating story
explaining that he was the one

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.570
who had murdered the
man for his money

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:35.250
and then he fled upon hearing the
sounds of the patrol approaching.

00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:38.660
And on his way out he passed
this butcher entering the area

00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:43.510
and watched the events unfold just
as the butcher had described them.

00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:46.860
And once the butcher had been
content condemned to death

00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:51.190
that man didn't want the
blood of two men on his hands.

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:54.940
So this episode and we can
refer to it as the case

00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:56.910
of the falsely accused butcher,

00:49:56.910 --> 00:50:01.060
we see that things are not
exactly always how they seem.

00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:04.590
And it really depicts
and was used in the --

00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:09.020
whether or not it's an actual case
and this is a case or similar cases

00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:12.740
like it have been reported
in the Jewish tradition,

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:16.420
early Christian traditions,
etcetera.

00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:20.130
So whether the case is
historically accurate in all

00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:25.410 position:56%
of its facts the point is that it
was used by Muslim jurists over time

00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:31.080
to be a guide to how Islamic
criminal law should be applied

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:33.000
and critically so.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.450
So the case depicts the
difficulties that the early

00:50:37.450 --> 00:50:39.820
and medieval Muslim judges
faced when attempting

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:42.640
to apply Islamic criminal law
without the benefit of being able

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:50.240
to discern the facts fully, the
law fully or the morality fully

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:54.240
of any particular case
with any certainty.

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:57.250
So as for the facts here confession

00:50:57.250 --> 00:51:01.990
or witness testimony typically
suffices to establish guilt

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:05.480
in Islamic criminal law, but
here Ali was presented only

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:09.260
with circumstantial evidence
and contradictory evidence.

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:13.310
So the facts didn't help and
then there was some doubt

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:14.610
about the facts.

00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:17.950
As for the law or the Islamic
law of homicide the Quran

00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:21.010
and other foundational
texts contain clear rules

00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:24.460
about intentional murder
being the only area

00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:27.520
for which the life
for life rule applies.

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:32.910
But was this intentional, the facts
didn't seem to quite point there

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:35.150
and so the law, therefore,
was not quite on point.

00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:37.920
There was some doubt about
whether the law applied.

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:40.300
And as for morality and, therefore,

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:45.380
legitimacy of punishment given
scriptural commands to punish

00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:49.230
but not do so when there was
any doubt about the facts

00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:54.100
or the law Ali needed to stay
his hand in the interpretation

00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:57.170
of the Muslim jurists
discussing this case.

00:51:57.170 --> 00:52:03.490
The question is why and to what
extent and the answer is shrouded

00:52:03.490 --> 00:52:07.240
by a tangled web if
you look at the history

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:09.990
that took Muslim jurists
centuries to weave and, therefore,

00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:11.580
take some time to unravel.

00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:13.840
And don't worry I'm
not going to take all

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:15.710
that time to unravel it here.

00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:19.760
But I'll cut to the center that
based on Islamic values of justice

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:24.560
and fairness Muslims may doubt
an avoidance of punishment

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:28.630
on its basis a central pillar
of Islamic criminal law

00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:30.530
and they expressed it in the form

00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:34.210
of a legal maxim what
I call the doubt canon

00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:37.030
to avoid criminal punishments
in cases of doubt,

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:39.450
avoid criminal punishment
in cases of doubt.

00:52:39.450 --> 00:52:40.820
This was repeated over
and over again,

00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:45.090
avoid criminal punishments
in cases of doubt.

00:52:45.090 --> 00:52:47.330
So [inaudible] episodes
like this one,

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:49.280
the case of the falsely
accused butcher,

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:51.690
they occur in early Islamic sources

00:52:51.690 --> 00:52:57.330
and Muslim jurists explain these
cases with reference to doubt.

00:52:57.330 --> 00:53:03.490
And I want to say here for anyone
familiar with American criminal law

00:53:03.490 --> 00:53:08.110
that the Arabic term for doubt
should shubha was a term of art.

00:53:08.110 --> 00:53:12.340
It assumed a much more expansive
meaning than the common conception

00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:15.740
that we have as American
lawyers of reasonable doubt,

00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:19.390
which is largely a
fact-based concept.

00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:21.810
So rather than representing a
principle effect [inaudible]

00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:25.510
standard of proof the Islamic
doctrine covered factual

00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:29.140
uncertainties, legal ambiguities,

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:33.140
even extralegal considerations
that I call moral doubt.

00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:36.550
And moreover, the Islamic
doctrine of doubt corresponds

00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:40.710
to analogous American doctrines
that are seemingly as disparate

00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:44.490
as the principle of legality,
the presumption of innocence,

00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:48.550
legal ambiguity and the
corresponding rule of lenity.

00:53:48.550 --> 00:53:50.730
The requirement of proof
beyond a reasonable doubt

00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:55.370
and lesser standards of proof,
mens rea requirements, mistake,

00:53:55.370 --> 00:54:00.050 position:56%
ignorance, impossibility, and other
potentially mitigating circumstances

00:54:00.050 --> 00:54:01.360
and even mercy.

00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:04.290
All of these are covered
by this term shubha.

00:54:04.290 --> 00:54:09.950
And in addition to that there's
another uniquely Islamic aspect

00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:16.080
or valence that also applies to
the term that comes to the floor,

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.860
something called contractual
doubt or interpretive doubt

00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:21.160
and we can discuss those.

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:24.070
I hear Sherman Jackson laughing

00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:25.950
because he knows what
these refer to.

00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:31.320 position:56%
But we can discuss those in the Q&amp;A.

00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:38.760
So to be sure this notion of doubt
pervading Islamic criminal law is

00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:42.190
contrary to conventional
notions of Islamic criminal law

00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:47.100
into the conventional practice that
we see reported about in the news.

00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:51.440
The conventional theory posits
God as a divine lawgiver

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:54.700
who asserts absolute
supremacy over the law.

00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:56.070
The classical textbook version

00:54:56.070 --> 00:55:02.650 position:56%
of Islamic legal theory posits this
idea of divine legislative supremacy

00:55:02.650 --> 00:55:08.290
where God is the sole lawgiver
who expresses himself in the form

00:55:08.290 --> 00:55:15.780
of a set of texts, the Quran Muslim
Scripture and the Sunnah as reports

00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:22.320
from the prophet and the
Imams in the Shia tradition.

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:26.140
And there's no questioning

00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:28.440
or interpreting really
what these texts say,

00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:32.690
that's a conventional sort of
narrow version of Islamic law.

00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:37.560
And the most strictly textual
version of this theory then looks

00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:43.410
to Islamic criminal law in ways
that that you might read about.

00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:46.770
As you know someone
steals cut off their hand.

00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:51.060
But in point of fact Islamic
law historically favored a more

00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:57.660 position:56%
pragmatic textualist account,
meaning there's reliance on the text

00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:02.850
and interpreted -- the text is
interpreted as lawyers do relevant

00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:05.300
to the context in front of them

00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:08.060
and the surrounding factors
that go into the text.

00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:11.250
So I'll say that and I
hope we can get a chance

00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:12.790
to talk about that more.

00:56:12.790 --> 00:56:19.170
But I want to move next to asking
how all this is relevant today.

00:56:19.170 --> 00:56:25.710
Islamic law is as pervasive as our
other speakers have pointed to.

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:29.950
Since the 1970's, some 28 countries
have introduced constitutions

00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:33.900
with clauses referring to or
incorporating Islamic law sharia

00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:36.360
as a source or the source of laws.

00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:39.960
So these constitutions
have sharia clauses.

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:44.500
And in that same time, at least a
dozen states have adopted Islamic

00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:48.820
penal codes or Islamic criminal law
codes as well in countries ranging

00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:54.440
from Iran, Pakistan and Saudi
Arabia to provinces in Malaysia,

00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:57.540
northern Nigeria and now Syria.

00:56:57.540 --> 00:57:04.180 position:56%
And more recently in the wake of the
tumultuous Arab uprisings that began

00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:12.030
in 2010, the ongoing crisis in
Iraq because of groups like Isis,

00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:16.180
there's a lot of uncertainty
about the status of Islamic law

00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:21.210
or the status of justice in
these regions based on arguments

00:57:21.210 --> 00:57:26.880
that Islamic law is being applied
in ways that make people suffer.

00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:31.330
And the emergence of these ideas
of Islamic law has prompted more

00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:34.350
than anything fears
of its punishments.

00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:36.350 position:56%
In fact, those punishments have come

00:57:36.350 --> 00:57:41.260
to represent sharia itself
often we leave it untranslated

00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:45.320
to highlight the exoticism and
the danger that it can evoke.

00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:51.710
And on this view sharia is only
a religious code that seeks

00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:57.570
to oppress women, amputate hands,
execute apostates and indeed,

00:57:57.570 --> 00:58:03.010
reports of summary executions and
other types of violence on the part

00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:07.040
of state and non-state actors
in some of these countries.

00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:13.740
They fuel this perception, I
mean there's something to that.

00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:19.630 position:56%
So it's no wonder then that sharia
inspires fear of its spread not only

00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:22.490
in the Muslim world,
but across the globe.

00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:24.510
But what I want to
say is that contrary

00:58:24.510 --> 00:58:32.320
to these ahistorical manifestations
of Islamic criminal law,

00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:37.470
there is the history that I talked
about of the pervasiveness of doubt

00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:42.370
and then I want to now briefly
to try to keep within time look

00:58:42.370 --> 00:58:45.830
to a situation or situations now

00:58:45.830 --> 00:58:51.600
where there's some internal
criticism amongst Muslims

00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:56.480
about the Islamic criminal laws
that they see applied in ways

00:58:56.480 --> 00:59:00.130
that promote injustice
rather than justice.

00:59:00.130 --> 00:59:04.170
Examples of the codes that
are emerging out of this sort

00:59:04.170 --> 00:59:09.670
of internal critique have
come up in Iran in 2013.

00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:13.690
And I should say none of these
examples have actually been applied

00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:18.990
they're codes that have been
drafted very, very recently.

00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:23.480
So this is a new cutting-edge
phenomenon and it remains

00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:26.860
to be seen what the
application will be.

00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:31.950
For the country Iran
in 2013, Brunei in 2014

00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:35.800
and the Maldives just earlier
this year and for the sake

00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:39.220
of time I'll just focus on Iran.

00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:49.010 position:56%
So in Iran after the 1979 revolution
all pre-revolution criminal laws,

00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:52.410
which were based on the
French code were abolished.

00:59:52.410 --> 00:59:56.980
And right after the
revolution or some years

00:59:56.980 --> 01:00:02.810
after the revolution the
criminal law was replaced

01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:07.680 position:56%
with Islamic criminal law that was
un-codified, it was finally codified

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:11.040
in 1883, some four years
after the revolution.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:14.640
And in substance the code
followed the same basic structure

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:17.340
as classical Islamic criminal
law where you had a set

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:23.380
of fixed punishments for
violations of a limited set

01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:26.230
of crimes called hudood laws.

01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:31.870
You had a set of non-fixed
punishments for violations

01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:38.690
of lesser crimes called Ta'Zir
laws or misdemeanors we might say,

01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:40.680
I'm really simplifying here.

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:43.220
And then you had this
law of retaliation,

01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:44.600
eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:52.540
So in big picture terms the code
generally followed that structure,

01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:57.220
but with the rise in
political excess in executions

01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:02.850 position:56%
in Iran many Muslim jurists began to
debate the use of the death penalty

01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:07.690
and the application
of this code itself.

01:01:07.690 --> 01:01:10.500
And so this is the --
and these debates raised

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:13.040
over the course of 10, 15 years.

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:18.390
Those complaints from the jurors
culminated in a suspension

01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:23.400
or moratorium on the
death penalty in 2002.

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:31.220 position:56%
And then finally the revision of the
Islamic criminal law code in 2013.

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.580
And one of the elements that
I'll point to and again,

01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:36.710
this is all hypothetical we
haven't seen any applications yet.

01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:42.620
But it's a significant element in
that those critiquing the code said

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:46.680
that there was not enough emphasis
on procedure and in the idea

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:52.850
that jurists or judges don't always
know whether the facts, the law

01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:57.570
or the moral concerns that should
go into an intelligent application

01:01:57.570 --> 01:02:03.920 position:56%
of a criminal law system, especially
an Islamic criminal system

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.380
were there.

01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:11.710
And so they've incorporated the
doubt doctrine that looks to ensure

01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:16.520
that the facts of the law and
the moral or the legitimacy

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:17.900
of the punishment is
not in question.

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:20.910
And they actually incorporated
the doubt doctrine

01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:23.140
for the first time
into the new code.

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:28.530
This canon that says avoid criminal
punishments in cases of doubt

01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:31.450
and exactly that formulation
is now in the new code.

01:02:31.450 --> 01:02:33.780
It remains to be seen
how it is applied.

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:36.110
So I'm going to conclude.

01:02:36.110 --> 01:02:44.870
I've tried to address both
problems and prospects for change

01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:50.480
or updating Islamic criminal law
with respect to internal critique

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:55.020
and highlighted some of the
modern experimental examples.

01:02:55.020 --> 01:03:01.420
Judges tend to appeal to and
I just want to end by saying

01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:07.590
that why the history of doubt in
Islamic criminal law is important

01:03:07.590 --> 01:03:12.090 position:56%
to these internal critiques and to
looking forward to both the problems

01:03:12.090 --> 01:03:14.590
and prospects that I
tried to highlight.

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:17.590
So judges tend to appeal to
conceptions of Islamic law drawn

01:03:17.590 --> 01:03:21.130
from its foundational
text and understandings

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:25.440 position:56%
from the ever authoritative founding
period we might say of Islamic law

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:28.050
from the 7th to 11th centuries.

01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:33.070 position:56%
And law is like that, it's tradition
bound whether we're speaking

01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:35.940
about American or Islamic
law or most other systems.

01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:39.670
Just as we American lawyers look
to America's founding period

01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:44.750
for authority often Muslim jurists
look to Islam's founding period.

01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:48.030
So the history ends up
being very important.

01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:53.800
The local politicians and Islamists
tend to be ignorant or illiterate

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:56.990
of the history and
I think that adding

01:03:56.990 --> 01:04:00.990
that to the larger
conversation could be of help

01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:03.990 position:56%
to the project of internal critique.

01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:06.740
So what happens when jurists and
lawyers contemplate the history

01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:10.000
and operation with a wider
expanse of sources and attention

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.720
to Islam's overarching
values and purposes?

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:17.280
What happens if we pay more
attention to both the problems

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:20.080
and the prospects endemic
to internal critique?

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.760
These are the questions
that I posit in my own work,

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:26.110
I pose to others working on these
issues and they are questions

01:04:26.110 --> 01:04:28.330
that I hope to discuss
with you today.

01:04:28.330 --> 01:04:30.130
Thank you.

01:04:30.130 --> 01:04:58.060
[ Applause ]

01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.360
&gt;&gt; Sherman A. Jackson:
Well good morning everyone.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:04.310
I want to begin by thanking
of Jane and Issam and Kimberly

01:05:04.310 --> 01:05:08.110
and everybody who's responsible
for affording me this opportunity

01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:09.500
to before you this morning.

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:13.950
But I'm really worried about time
so I'm just going to jump in.

01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:16.380
I would like to begin with
the matter of nomenclature,

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:19.260
particularly the term reform.

01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:22.330
Specifically, I would like to
underscore an important distinction

01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:27.800
between reform as an attempt to
correct, adjust, improve, update,

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:31.220
edit or even add to the
enterprise of Islamic law.

01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:34.310
A reform on the other
hand as a gesture indebted

01:05:34.310 --> 01:05:36.860
to the Protestant Reformation.

01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:40.110
The latter reference implies that
the problem rests fundamentally

01:05:40.110 --> 01:05:43.670
with the basic structure,
institutionalized understandings

01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:45.150
and interpretive methods

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:48.560
through which Islamic law
traditionally negotiated social,

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:53.240
political, economic
and cultural reality.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:56.870
On this understanding meaningful
reform requires a whole scale

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:59.180
scrapping or at least
marginalization

01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:03.320
of the classical tradition and its
replacement with a brand-new set

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:08.350
of modern methods, institutional
structures and points of departure.

01:06:08.350 --> 01:06:12.500
To my mind, however, as attractive
as this may seem to some,

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:16.090
this is not the most useful
approach to reforming Islamic law,

01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:18.150
certainly not in the long run.

01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:19.830
And let me take a moment
here to give

01:06:19.830 --> 01:06:23.750
at least one major reason why
I believe this to be the case.

01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:28.710
Key to any successful reform of
Islamic law or any legal system

01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:33.090
for that matter is the
concept and value of authority.

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:37.060
By this I am not referring to any
power of coercion, but more simply

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:41.420
to the ability to enlist the
community's assent by conveying

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:46.160
to them a palpable sense that it
is right for them to follow one.

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.860
Of course, in the modern
west we generally assume

01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:53.700
that reasonableness is or should
be all the authority one needs

01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:56.690
to enlist a community's assent.

01:06:56.690 --> 01:07:01.150
In truth, however, there is not
one but many forms of reason

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:04.820
and this raises the need for an
authority beyond reason itself

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:08.560
to adjudicate all of
our reason debates.

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:12.490
In the United States speaking in
talk constitutional terms at least,

01:07:12.490 --> 01:07:14.990
this is the U.S. Constitution.

01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:20.070
As Americans we often disagree and
put forth all kinds of reasons for

01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:25.730
and against positions on abortion,
affirmative action or free-speech

01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:29.810
and we may even see our
opponents' views as unreasonable.

01:07:29.810 --> 01:07:33.570
In the end, however, we accept
the Supreme Court's authority

01:07:33.570 --> 01:07:36.060
to terminate these
disputes in the interest

01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:39.310
of preserving the civic order.

01:07:39.310 --> 01:07:44.510 position:56%
In law then authority works a lot
like trumps in the game of pinochle,

01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:46.760
I hope you know pinochle.

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:50.540
And to borrow the expression
of Thomas Hobbes

01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:55.610
where there is no agreed-upon
authority clubs become trumps.

01:07:55.610 --> 01:07:59.420
The civil order in other
words simply falls apart.

01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:03.200
Of course, one might argue in the
case of Islam that something other

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:06.820
than sharia, for example
liberalism could assume the role

01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:09.020
of authority broker.

01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:11.180
But even beyond the
substantive problems

01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:15.380
with such a proposition it
would take literally centuries

01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:18.200
for such a substitution
to take place.

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:22.140
And in the meantime, massive,
unpredictable instability

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:26.300
and dislocation would
be the order of the day.

01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:30.710
My approach to reform, therefore,
proceeds on the understanding

01:08:30.710 --> 01:08:34.960
that reform is most effectively
achieved by engaging rather

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:37.950
than jettisoning the
classical tradition.

01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:41.590
Of course, this too raises
significant problems.

01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:43.820
To begin with there
are literally dozens

01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:45.800
of present contemporary topics

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:50.720 position:56%
that the classical tradition never
contemplated from stem cell research

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:54.160
to copyright law to
sex change operations.

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:58.000
Beyond this many issues in which
the classical tradition spoke

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.330
definitively for example
issues relating to women,

01:09:01.330 --> 01:09:03.600
religious minorities
or the authority

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:07.920
of the Muslim ruler cry
out for reconsideration.

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:12.310
Here the fear is that engaging the
classical tradition will either

01:09:12.310 --> 01:09:17.890
blind us to contemporarility or
entrap us in forms of thinking

01:09:17.890 --> 01:09:22.070 position:56%
about an arranging society from
which we desperately seek to escape.

01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:25.890
In the brief time I have remaining,
therefore, I would like to point

01:09:25.890 --> 01:09:28.770
to just a few features of
the classical tradition

01:09:28.770 --> 01:09:32.560
that might give some indication
about how Islamic law might come

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:36.430
to terms with these
related challenges.

01:09:36.430 --> 01:09:40.900
The first feature is actually the
easiest, namely the institution

01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:46.970
of Ijtihad or fresh unmediated
interpretation of the sources.

01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:48.270
Obviously, where the issue

01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:51.910
at hand is historically
unprecedented one cannot rely

01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:55.450
on the classical schools
of law for solutions even

01:09:55.450 --> 01:09:57.950
through extensions by analogy.

01:09:57.950 --> 01:10:02.580
Ijtihad in this context becomes
an obligation by default.

01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:05.320 position:56%
This is actually quite
straightforward from the perspective

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:07.460
of the classical tradition.

01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:10.820
Modern Muslims, however, often
invents a certain diffidence

01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:14.360
or even hostility towards Ijtihad.

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:17.840
This is less a question
though of Ijtihad's status

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:21.230
as a legitimate approach
to sharia than it is a sort

01:10:21.230 --> 01:10:25.630 position:56%
of resentment towards the sense
that it is largely western modernity

01:10:25.630 --> 01:10:29.400
that is generating the need
for Ijtihad to begin with.

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:32.990
With time of course, such
feelings can only dissipate.

01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:37.750
In fact, I would hazard that a good
deal of Ijtihad is likely to emerge

01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:43.030 position:56%
out of those Muslim communities from
whom western reality is not imposed

01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:44.880
or sensed as being imposed,

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:48.130
but is rather the only
reality they have ever known.

01:10:48.130 --> 01:10:53.210 position:56%
But what may be difficult to imagine
in the present moment this points

01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:56.720
to the importance of western
Muslim communities and the future

01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:00.030
or to the future of Islamic law.

01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:05.400
Now having said this much, Ijtihad
remains limited in its utility.

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:07.700
For many of the most
problematic features

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:10.340
of Islamic law are
precisely those rules

01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:14.740
that the classical tradition has
upheld for literally centuries.

01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:17.750
Of course, one could
argue and many Muslims do

01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:21.540
that Ijtihad is also
the solution here.

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:24.510
We simply need to go back
and reinterpret the sources

01:11:24.510 --> 01:11:27.480
in order to produce new rules.

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:32.140
Ultimately, however, this takes us
back to the problem of authority

01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:36.520
for like it or not the classical
tradition will likely retain much

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:39.570
more authority than any
contemporary individual

01:11:39.570 --> 01:11:42.200
or movement could hope to muster.

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:46.390 position:56%
Nor are we guaranteed that new rules
will necessarily be better rules

01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:50.180
as we see in the case of so-called
extremist movements today.

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:53.380
Nor will contemporary
interpretations necessarily win the

01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:56.380
day by simply declaring
themselves to be right

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:59.560
and classical rules to be wrong.

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:02.520
This recognition, however, of
the basic authority wielded

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:07.100
by the classical tradition need
not bind us to the perspective

01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:12.270
or to the perspectives of the
classical jurists themselves

01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:15.210 position:56%
for there was an important
distinction between their statements

01:12:15.210 --> 01:12:18.770
of law and their assessments
of fact.

01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:22.450
On this distinction classical
rules can be right in terms

01:12:22.450 --> 01:12:24.790
of their legal substance
and it is not my contention

01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:27.660
that they're necessarily
right, but they could be right.

01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:31.690
While at the same time being
wrong when the attempt is

01:12:31.690 --> 01:12:36.300
to apply these rules to change
the factual circumstances.

01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:40.120
Recognizing this feature
renders any number of the rules

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:43.710
on the books totally
obsolete and inapplicable

01:12:43.710 --> 01:12:46.740
to a modern set of circumstances.

01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:51.890
Classical deliberations were not
theoretical, but rather practical.

01:12:51.890 --> 01:12:56.590
They aim to address the concrete
everyday realities of society.

01:12:56.590 --> 01:13:02.940
As such, almost all classical legal
conclusions include an admixture

01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:07.230
of law that is the jurists'
interpretations of the sources

01:13:07.230 --> 01:13:10.820
and fact of the practical
circumstances the jurists were

01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:13.150
seeking to adjudicate.

01:13:13.150 --> 01:13:16.840
While the strictly legal dimension
of these rulings might be assumed

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.140
to entail an element

01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:21.710
of transcendence being presumably
grounded in some interpretation

01:13:21.710 --> 01:13:25.760
of scripture the factual
dimensions could not.

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:29.930
To take one example, based on
prophetic precedent contracts

01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:34.600
of sale generally entail an implied
warranty with a specified amount

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:38.050
of time to check the
product's integrity.

01:13:38.050 --> 01:13:42.780
How much time, however, dependent
on the jurists' factual assessment

01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:47.700
of what prevailing circumstances
dictated as fair and reasonable.

01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:52.050
In that light the maximum time
allowed for real estate was set

01:13:52.050 --> 01:13:56.980
at 36 days and this is the maximum
warranty period that one will find

01:13:56.980 --> 01:14:01.390
in classical laws on classical
manuals on Islamic law.

01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:04.360
But this 36 day allowance
was clearly not a matter

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:09.770
of permanent law even if the rule
[inaudible] implied warranties was.

01:14:09.770 --> 01:14:11.320
And in modern context

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:14.870
where commercial real estate is
extremely complicated this period

01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:19.680 position:56%
could easily be extended to allow
years to test a building's integrity

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:22.780
and such an adjustment would
be perfectly legitimate

01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:26.390
as a standard feature
of Islamic law.

01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:29.000
We see the importance and
authenticity of this approach

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.160
to Islamic law and in exchange
recorded by an old friend of mine

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:35.220
on whom I actually will
my dissertation way back

01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:36.960
in the last century.

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:40.160
The 13th century Egyptian jurist
of the [inaudible] school,

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:43.860
Shihab al-Din al-Qarafi and I'm
translating here from the Arabic.

01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:48.590
Question, what is the correct view
regarding those rulings upheld

01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:53.150 position:56%
in the school of Maliki, Shafi'i and
the rest which have been deducted

01:14:53.150 --> 01:14:55.820
on the basis of habits
and customs prevailing

01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:59.900
at the time these jurists
reached these conclusions.

01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:02.890
When these customs change
and the practice comes

01:15:02.890 --> 01:15:07.070
to indicate the opposite of what it
used to, are the rulings recorded

01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:10.870
in the manuals of the jurists
rendered thereby defunct.

01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:15.670
It becoming incumbent to issue new
rulings based on the new custom

01:15:15.670 --> 01:15:18.920
or is it to be said we
are merely followers

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:21.920
of the independent,
authoritative jurists.

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:25.710
It is thus not our place
to innovate new rulings

01:15:25.710 --> 01:15:28.790
as we lack the qualifications
to do so.

01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:32.350
Therefore, we issue rulings
according to what we find

01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:34.830
in the books handed
down on the authority

01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:38.970
of the independent
authoritative jurists.

01:15:38.970 --> 01:15:44.040
Answer, holding to rulings that
have been deduced on the basis

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.110
of prevailing customs even

01:15:46.110 --> 01:15:51.290
after these customs have changed is
a violation of unanimous consensus

01:15:51.290 --> 01:15:56.890
and an open display of ignorance
of the religion, end of quote.

01:15:56.890 --> 01:16:00.810
Again, almost every area of
Islamic law consists of rules

01:16:00.810 --> 01:16:05.510
that include an admixture of legal
interpretations on the one hand

01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:08.060
and factual assessments
on the other.

01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:12.070 position:56%
This includes rules in areas ranging
from family law to the status

01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:16.030
of non-Muslims, commercial
law, jihad and even aspects

01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:20.310
of the criminal law for example,
rules governing apostasy.

01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:22.700
In all of these areas
where the rules

01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:25.130
of the books reflect
the lived realities

01:16:25.130 --> 01:16:28.860
of pre-modern Muslim society
these rules can be adjusted

01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:33.500
to modern facts without in
any way violating the sanctity

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:35.830
of Islamic law.

01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:37.130
Another major feature

01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:39.770
of the classical tradition
is its recognition

01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:42.480
of the limits of Islamic law.

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:45.400
This is a difficult point
to make in a modern context

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:50.700 position:56%
where secular is assumed to take
over where the religious leaves off.

01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:57.100
And secular is understood to
be the antithesis of religious.

01:16:57.100 --> 01:17:00.670
My point, however, is simply
that Islamic law recognized

01:17:00.670 --> 01:17:05.720
that the law itself was not
intended to address all issues.

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:09.970
And that beyond the scope of the
source's jurisdiction other forms

01:17:09.970 --> 01:17:14.470
of deliberation, including those
that rely on reason, science,

01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:18.640
practical experience, even
perhaps spiritual epiphany could be

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:20.640
legitimately invoked.

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:23.360
To be sure this never
amounted to what we

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:26.940
in the modern west would
identify as secular

01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:30.320
for Muslim jurists never
acknowledged the propriety

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:34.300
or proceeding as if
God did not exist.

01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:36.140
They did recognize, however,

01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:40.750
that Islam as a religion is
broader in scope than sharia.

01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:43.740
And that the limits of
sharia do not, therefore,

01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:46.130
equal the limits of Islam.

01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:50.190
Thus, assuming that sharia did
not address an issue concretely an

01:17:50.190 --> 01:17:55.050
approach to that issue that
was grounded say in chemistry

01:17:55.050 --> 01:17:59.230
or actuarial science or plain old
mathematics could be perfectly

01:17:59.230 --> 01:18:05.130
Islamic even if it was not based
in sharia in the strict sense.

01:18:05.130 --> 01:18:10.100
This is the area for which I have
coined the term the Islamic secular

01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:13.030
rather than opposing
or even competing

01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:17.270
with sharia is simply
complement sharia by recognizing

01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:20.160
that in many instances
Muslims cannot rely

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:22.590
on sharia for concrete answers.

01:18:22.590 --> 01:18:27.320
In fact, in any number of instances
their reasoning will be generically

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:32.030
indistinguishable from that of
their non-Muslim compatriots.

01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:36.020
Take an issue for example,
such as speed limits

01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:42.090 position:56%
or licensing medical doctors, excuse
me or licensing medical doctors.

01:18:42.090 --> 01:18:45.800
The most sharia could provide here
would be the value of ensuring

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:50.130
that such policies served the
communal interests of safety,

01:18:50.130 --> 01:18:52.310
competence, and the like.

01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:56.030
What actually constitutes
safety or competence, however,

01:18:56.030 --> 01:19:00.800
in concrete terms could not be
determined on the basis of sharia

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:03.440
for there simply is
nothing in sharia

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:08.650
that could identify 55 miles per
hour as an appropriate speed limit

01:19:08.650 --> 01:19:12.140
or three or four or
six years of rotation

01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:15.160
as a requirement for
medical licensing.

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:19.190
Rather, in deliberating these
issues, Muslims would have to rely

01:19:19.190 --> 01:19:24.620 position:56%
on the same kinds of considerations
upon which non-Muslims rely physics,

01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:29.460
actuarial science, insurance
adjusters, experience and the like.

01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:33.490
And this would extend to a
virtually endless list of issues

01:19:33.490 --> 01:19:37.430
in the contemporary public
domain from immigration policy

01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:41.970
to national healthcare, from
FAA regulations to tenure

01:19:41.970 --> 01:19:45.290
and promotion procedures
in our universities.

01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:49.680
All of this is extremely
important for at least two reasons.

01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:53.650
First, precisely because
things such as speed limits

01:19:53.650 --> 01:19:55.610
or building occupancy codes

01:19:55.610 --> 01:19:59.220
or national healthcare plans
are not governed by sharia

01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:03.150
in the strict sense Muslims
and non-Muslims can be brought

01:20:03.150 --> 01:20:06.240
into conversation and
debate over these issues

01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:08.940
on a shared intellectual plane.

01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:14.940 position:56%
Sharia in other words, does not
constitute a barrier between Muslims

01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:18.330
and non-Muslims when it comes
to debating these issues.

01:20:18.330 --> 01:20:23.100
Second, because society is perhaps
more affected on a daily basis

01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:26.180
by regulations in the
non-sharia realm than it is

01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:30.420
by rules strictly dictated by
sharia, even in a polity governed

01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:34.510
by sharia the area of presumed
conflict between Muslims

01:20:34.510 --> 01:20:39.080
and non-Muslims might be much
narrower than is commonly presumed.

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:41.230
And the area of what
John Rawls will refer

01:20:41.230 --> 01:20:46.680
to as public reason might be much
broader than is commonly assumed.

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:50.730
Attention to the Islamic
secular is also important

01:20:50.730 --> 01:20:54.730
to the modern political order
of Muslim states for part

01:20:54.730 --> 01:20:58.380
of the problem here is the
tendency on the part of governments

01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:01.760
on the one hand and Islamist
movements on the other

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:05.440
to invoke the unassailable
authority of sharia as a means

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:06.870
of raising whatever rules

01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:10.570
or policies they propose
beyond critique.

01:21:10.570 --> 01:21:14.330
Careful attention to the Islamic
secular meanwhile could confer

01:21:14.330 --> 01:21:17.100
at least three distinct advantages.

01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:21.700
First, it could insulate Muslim
governments from inflated charges

01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:27.550 position:56%
of violating Islamic law every time
they institute economic, educational

01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:32.860
or bureaucratic policies that are
not explicitly dictated by sharia.

01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:35.900
Second, it could empower
Muslim communities

01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:39.460
to hold their governments to
greater degrees of accountability

01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:41.950
by denying these governments
the ability

01:21:41.950 --> 01:21:47.180 position:56%
to wrap their everyday policy in the
unassailable authority of sharia.

01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:52.090
Finally, it could contribute to
the domestication of power itself

01:21:52.090 --> 01:21:57.180 position:56%
by forcing power to negotiate its
right to coerce rather than assuming

01:21:57.180 --> 01:22:00.950
that Muslim rulers in governments
have some uncontested right

01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:03.130
to coerce in the name
of what a friend

01:22:03.130 --> 01:22:06.150
of mine would call
God's pious dictator.

01:22:06.150 --> 01:22:12.700 position:56%
I would like to end these incomplete
ruminations on reform in Islamic law

01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:16.480
by referring to what remains in
my mind an outstanding problem.

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:17.780
And I'd like to take advantage

01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:21.000
of the intellectual
[inaudible] room underscored.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.170
The problem of which I am
speaking is quite simply history.

01:22:24.170 --> 01:22:31.210
More specifically, unlike modern
states Islamic law never devised a

01:22:31.210 --> 01:22:35.340
mechanism for wiping the
books clean of outmoded,

01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:38.200
discarded or discredited rules.

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:42.690
Rather, juristic culture as
a whole oversaw this process

01:22:42.690 --> 01:22:44.640
by constantly identifying

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:50.680
and updating what each school
identified as its going opinion.

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:54.780
With the marginalization of this
legacy in modern times, however,

01:22:54.780 --> 01:23:00.330
the entire record of every opinion
ever reached lay at the disposal

01:23:00.330 --> 01:23:04.620
of the Muslim masses, including
moderate Islamist movements,

01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:08.530
the majority of whom are
untrained in the law.

01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:12.170
This means that they can
go back and access rules

01:23:12.170 --> 01:23:14.760
that have been long
discarded or discredited

01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:18.070
by the sharia establishment
and treat these rules

01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:20.500
as if they were the going opinion.

01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:22.280
And this without the benefit

01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:27.570
of knowing the important
distinction between law and fact.

01:23:27.570 --> 01:23:30.350
What renders this even
more problematic, however,

01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:33.270
is the fact that this rich
and variated [inaudible]

01:23:33.270 --> 01:23:37.520
of Muslim juristic opinion
is extremely valuable

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:41.400
in demonstrating both the
pluralistic nature of Islamic law

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:45.640
and the degree of intellectual
boldness and sophistication

01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:49.820
that went into Muslim
legal deliberations.

01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:55.610
Thus it would be remiss to try
to block access to this very rich

01:23:55.610 --> 01:24:01.450
and inspiring legacy and yet this
very access itself poses real

01:24:01.450 --> 01:24:05.500 position:56%
problems and even potential dangers.

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:09.980
Devising a solution to this
problem in my mind will be key

01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:13.020
to preserving any gains
that a successful attempt

01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:16.520 position:56%
to reform Islamic law might achieve.

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:20.190
Yet, I must admit that I
remain stymied by this problem,

01:24:20.190 --> 01:24:22.940
I'm not sure how to handle it.

01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:26.870
In the end, however, whatever
solution the Muslim community

01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:32.390 position:56%
ultimately settles upon one can only
hope that the cure does not turn

01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:35.660
out to be worse than
the very disease.

01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:37.960
Thank you very much.

01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:41.390
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: Let me
kick off with this question.

01:24:41.390 --> 01:24:45.830
As many of you know, Prime Minister
Tony Blair was here last week

01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:49.310
to give the Kissinger lecture
on international affairs

01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:52.950
and his remarks got a lot of press.

01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:55.410
In his remarks Prime
Minister Blair said

01:24:55.410 --> 01:25:00.070 position:56%
that defeating Isis what he insisted
on calling [inaudible] was to quote,

01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:03.540
only a necessary beginning
because again to quote,

01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:08.540
force alone will not prevail

01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:13.700
and the Islamist ideology
has also to be confronted.

01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:19.090
So my question to the four of you
is what does Islamic law reform

01:25:19.090 --> 01:25:23.020
or to use Intisar's
words, internal critique,

01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:29.250 position:56%
have to do with confronting Islamist
ideology, something that's on a lot

01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:31.550
of people's minds right now?

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:36.340
&gt;&gt; Issam M. Saliba: Who would
like to, would you like?

01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:38.540
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe:
Deer in the headlights.

01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:39.840
Why don't you start Sherman?

01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:41.140
&gt;&gt; Sherman A. Jackson: Oh my God.

01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:42.440
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: Oh
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy.

01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:43.810
&gt;&gt; Sherman A. Jackson: I
was thinking that, you know,

01:25:43.810 --> 01:25:46.270
whoever plans to run for
president should probably try

01:25:46.270 --> 01:25:48.000
and answer that question.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:55.100
I think that there are
a couple of things.

01:25:55.100 --> 01:26:03.070
I think that with regard to
Islamic law one of the things

01:26:03.070 --> 01:26:06.120
that I think would play
an important role in all

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:09.850
of this is a greater diffusion

01:26:09.850 --> 01:26:14.120
of religious literacy
within society at large.

01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:18.280
Because it is in some
sense the absence,

01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:24.540
the lack of religious literacy
in Muslim society generally

01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:30.120
that enables these views
to gain an audience

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:33.950
and to get a multiplier effect.

01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:39.690
And, you know, I travel in
the Muslim world more often

01:26:39.690 --> 01:26:43.310
than my wife would like, but
one of the things that I --

01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:46.620
an impression, just an
impression I've not done any sort

01:26:46.620 --> 01:26:48.370
of study or anything like this.

01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:51.740
But one of the impressions
that I get is that in a number

01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:56.790
of instances sort of official
policy seems to be to sort

01:26:56.790 --> 01:27:01.350
of keep public religious discourse
at a minimum as a means of sort

01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:04.800
of controlling religion in general.

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:10.660
And I think that what that does
is that sustains a reality,

01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:17.520
a very limited religious literacy
and that opens up the way for those

01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:20.320
who want to make all kinds
of other outlandish claims,

01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:24.020
particularly given the reality of
the internet and things like that

01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:26.650
to be much more effective
in that regard.

01:27:26.650 --> 01:27:31.800
So I think that one of the keys

01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:36.410
to turning this corner is a greater
diffusion of religious literacy

01:27:36.410 --> 01:27:40.050 position:56%
and I', going to be very clear about
what I have in mind in that regard.

01:27:40.050 --> 01:27:44.990
I'm not talking about turning
society into a society of clerics,

01:27:44.990 --> 01:27:47.610
that's not what I'm
talking about at all.

01:27:47.610 --> 01:27:51.810
But there are a number of just
sort of general literacy issues

01:27:51.810 --> 01:27:59.360
in Islamic law that could be
very useful and stemming the kind

01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:03.790
of extremism and I'm going to
give you just one small example

01:28:03.790 --> 01:28:08.210
so that you know that I'm
speaking in concrete terms.

01:28:08.210 --> 01:28:11.010
If you have a command in the Quran

01:28:11.010 --> 01:28:17.750
or the [inaudible] the
prophet do, do this.

01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:24.050
Classical Islamic theory
universally recognizes the fact

01:28:24.050 --> 01:28:30.140
that that command can mean
either must do, should do,

01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:36.980
may do and this is standard,
this is standard gear.

01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:42.390
But for the uninitiated any
command that they might encounter

01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:47.370
in the Quran or the Sunni will
represent to them must do.

01:28:47.370 --> 01:28:52.420
And this can have far-reaching
implications and effects.

01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:54.890
And this is why I think
that greater diffusion

01:28:54.890 --> 01:28:59.350
of religious literacy is a key to
turning the corner in this regard.

01:28:59.350 --> 01:29:00.650
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: Thank you.

01:29:00.650 --> 01:29:01.950
&gt;&gt; Intisar A. Rabb: I'm going
to say something briefly.

01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:05.760
I mean I was sitting here trying
to think of how even to approach

01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:08.780
that question with
respect to context here.

01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:11.970
What would we -- that
relate to extremists

01:29:11.970 --> 01:29:13.450
who commit acts of violence.

01:29:13.450 --> 01:29:17.210
What would we say about
the person that blows

01:29:17.210 --> 01:29:21.980
up the planned parenthood
office or facility and claims

01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:26.200
that they're doing so on the
basis of their Christian values

01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:29.080
and aims to support life?

01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:34.080
And I think, I mean in addition
to the sort of religious literacy

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:40.610
which I think is on point I mean
one would want for not just those

01:29:40.610 --> 01:29:46.530
who may be in communities that may
encounter someone who is likely

01:29:46.530 --> 01:29:51.940
to blow up a planned parenthood
office about what the religious --

01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:53.540
that the religious requirements

01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:56.310
in Christianity do not
support such a thing.

01:29:56.310 --> 01:30:01.400
And all of this by analogy
to what's going on in some

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:03.040 position:56%
of the regions in the Islamic world.

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:11.210
But also that the greater
community, policymakers, educators,

01:30:11.210 --> 01:30:17.000
and the like also have this sort
of basic literacy in order not

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:22.940
to by way of buying into the
extremist claims sort of reify it

01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:25.940
and create this echo
chamber that results

01:30:25.940 --> 01:30:28.660
in policies that are problematic.

01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:33.300
So it's a political
problem I suppose more

01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:35.760
than one that's directly
related to Islamic law,

01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:38.270
but Islamic law certainly
relevant I think

01:30:38.270 --> 01:30:42.160 position:56%
in the educational and policy sense.

01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:45.600
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe:
Thank you, Kristen.

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:46.900
&gt;&gt; Kristen A. Stilt:
I would just recently

01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:49.420
when you first asked the question
it took me a minute to think

01:30:49.420 --> 01:30:54.030
about the connection between the
two because in some ways the kind

01:30:54.030 --> 01:30:57.460
of Islamic law reform we're talking
about a little bit here at least

01:30:57.460 --> 01:31:01.340 position:56%
with the criminal and the family
law context is sort of national laws

01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:04.530
and what nations do in terms
of their own legal system.

01:31:04.530 --> 01:31:07.310
But ideology of course
is boundaryless,

01:31:07.310 --> 01:31:10.340
it doesn't respect boundaries, it
doesn't respect national states,

01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:13.310
it's a vast, vast question.

01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:18.850 position:56%
And, you know, I think Sherman ended
with something that's right on point

01:31:18.850 --> 01:31:22.370
if I could just echo it, which
is that every opinion ever is

01:31:22.370 --> 01:31:29.830
at everyone's disposal and that is
as you said, positive and negative.

01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:35.260
And that is not something that the
current structures are necessarily

01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:37.180
set up to address.

01:31:37.180 --> 01:31:41.930
You can't change an internal law
in a country and address this kind

01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:45.440
of problem they're connected,
but perhaps by steps.

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:52.780
But it's a much bigger question
that spans places and times.

01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:54.300 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: Absolutely, yeah.

01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:55.600
&gt;&gt; Issam M. Saliba: My study

01:31:55.600 --> 01:32:03.300 position:56%
of Islamic law even though I'm not a
Muslim really made me very impressed

01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:09.930
with the legal theory that has
been formulated centuries ago.

01:32:09.930 --> 01:32:17.110
I mean here you have the 7th,
8th, 9th, 10th century people

01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:21.480
who are talking about the
importance of human reason,

01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:25.400
human reason not God,
of human reason

01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:29.710
in understanding what
God wants to say.

01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:33.200
Unfortunately, whatever happened
and this has nothing to do

01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:36.480
with Islam has to do with history.

01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:40.350
There was some kind of a
blockage, complete blockage.

01:32:40.350 --> 01:32:46.260
We have to accept the fact, we
have to admit that what some

01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:53.180
of what ISIS is doing has
a root in the traditions.

01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:58.630
Now this is not the whole
tradition, but there is some roots

01:32:58.630 --> 01:33:01.750
and I think the Muslim community,

01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:06.360
especially the intellectual
leaders have to come up and say

01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:11.910
that whatever they are
relying on is a portion

01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:17.470
that does not represent
the full Islamic tradition.

01:33:17.470 --> 01:33:27.600 position:56%
And this I think would agree with
Sherman teaching the public opinion,

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:33.880
the public Muslim, the
general people what Islam is,

01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:37.870
what religion is, true
religion is I think will help.

01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:42.700
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: Let me
raise the question of the Quran

01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:46.970
in relation to this conversation.

01:33:46.970 --> 01:33:50.160
You know, it's often said
by scholars of the Quran

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:52.810
that only a small proportion

01:33:52.810 --> 01:33:58.340
of the Quran contains
explicitly legal content,

01:33:58.340 --> 01:34:00.680
yet obviously the Quran continues

01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:05.440
to loom very large among
the sources of the law.

01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:09.270
So obviously, very large and any
thinking about a reformulation

01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:11.070
or reform of Islamic law.

01:34:11.070 --> 01:34:16.320
In fact, I would ask in a more
pointed way isn't the conversation

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:20.560
about Islamic law reform
fundamentally a conversation

01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:23.590
about the willingness
to reconceptualize

01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:26.130
and reinterpret the Quran?

01:34:26.130 --> 01:34:29.510
Doesn't that go to the heart

01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:34.630
of what we're discussing,
what we're trying to do?

01:34:34.630 --> 01:34:37.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Intisar A. Rabb: Sure, one thing
that I can say about that and I have

01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:41.140 position:56%
to be careful because Jane
McAuliffe she was my dean when I was

01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:43.590
in Georgetown as a
scholar of the Quran.

01:34:43.590 --> 01:34:48.400
But yes, it's been said
that something like 500

01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:50.790
out of the some 6,000 plus verses

01:34:50.790 --> 01:34:55.880
of the Quran have explicitly
legal content or write content.

01:34:55.880 --> 01:35:01.570
But by that scholars making
these claims are looking

01:35:01.570 --> 01:35:06.350
at the explicit rules that might
govern things like inheritance,

01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:11.020
laws of war, family
law and the like.

01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:17.250
But I don't think they mean to
suggest that the overarching values

01:35:17.250 --> 01:35:20.130
and lessons in parables
that come out in the rest

01:35:20.130 --> 01:35:25.030
of the Quran are not relevant
to Islamic law or sharia

01:35:25.030 --> 01:35:33.650
in its broader terms of the law of
ethics, etcetera that are wrapped

01:35:33.650 --> 01:35:35.910
up in interpreting
what Islamic law is.

01:35:35.910 --> 01:35:39.790
And so it's something that
I think a short answer

01:35:39.790 --> 01:35:44.240
to your question is
yes, is the conversation

01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:48.440
about Islamic legal change
really a conversation

01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:50.580
about reconceptualizing
understandings

01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:53.150
of the Quran in the modern world.

01:35:53.150 --> 01:35:57.920
I think yes, but I think it's not
with respect to the limited set

01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:01.580
of rules but the standards
as well and values

01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:08.100
that have always been a
part of the Islamic law mix.

01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:13.030
&gt;&gt; Issam M. Saliba: I was thinking
about this question very long time.

01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:15.770
That there in the Quran something

01:36:15.770 --> 01:36:22.130
that is unquestionable you cannot
interpret one way or the other.

01:36:22.130 --> 01:36:28.530
And one of the things that usually
people think about is the adultery

01:36:28.530 --> 01:36:35.320
and the adultery has a
punishment that the Quran specify.

01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:38.340
How can we change that?

01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:41.990
Is there a way to change
that through interpretation?

01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:48.590 position:56%
And I was thinking very deeply about
that until I got to read Al-Muwatta.

01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:52.690
Muwatta Imam Malik who wrote it

01:36:52.690 --> 01:36:56.380
and it is considered the
first legal book in Islam.

01:36:56.380 --> 01:37:04.410
And what caught my attention
is Hijaz that goes to prophet,

01:37:04.410 --> 01:37:09.770
a man who came to [inaudible]
before he came [inaudible]

01:37:09.770 --> 01:37:13.170
and told him I committed adultery.

01:37:13.170 --> 01:37:20.010
What do you expect if the Quran is
saying adultery has to be punished

01:37:20.010 --> 01:37:25.620
by death, what should he say?

01:37:25.620 --> 01:37:29.340
Well Abu-Bakr told him did
you tell anybody, he said no.

01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:34.420
He said go and repent, God
will accept your repentance.

01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:38.190 position:56%
And he went and he wasn't satisfied.

01:37:38.190 --> 01:37:43.200
He went to [inaudible] he
asked him the same question

01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:45.870
and [inaudible] answered
him the same thing.

01:37:45.870 --> 01:37:50.910
Then he went to the prophet
and what did the prophet say?

01:37:50.910 --> 01:37:55.560
He turned his face against
from him for three times

01:37:55.560 --> 01:38:02.260
and then he continued, this man
continued to want to clean himself.

01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:07.120
And then the prophet asked
him to [inaudible] one

01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:10.770
of his family and he did.

01:38:10.770 --> 01:38:14.770
And he asked, the prophet asked
him is he sick, is he mad,

01:38:14.770 --> 01:38:18.580
is there anything, they said no.

01:38:18.580 --> 01:38:28.190
And then the prophet was forced
to condemn him to be stoned.

01:38:28.190 --> 01:38:31.980
Now this story, I mean
this is coming Imam Malik

01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:38.420
and this is you cannot have
more authentic source more

01:38:38.420 --> 01:38:40.410
than Al-Muwatta.

01:38:40.410 --> 01:38:45.110
And this tells you something that
you can interpret from this story

01:38:45.110 --> 01:38:49.320
that even though is immoral
condemnation, the adultery,

01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:56.460
it's not necessarily has to be a
legal rule that you as a society

01:38:56.460 --> 01:39:02.460
or as a government should apply.

01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:05.710
So I think through the
Islamic [inaudible]

01:39:05.710 --> 01:39:11.180
in existence there is a lot
of room for improvement.

01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:15.790
And I'm not claiming that we
should just wipe away everything

01:39:15.790 --> 01:39:22.700
and come back start anew, but there
is a way for the deep thinkers

01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:28.060
of Islam to form Islamic
law from within.

01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:32.210
Not rely on the declaration
of the human rights or declare

01:39:32.210 --> 01:39:34.390
about what we say in the west,

01:39:34.390 --> 01:39:37.210
but in their own traditions
there are a lot of things

01:39:37.210 --> 01:39:40.080
that have not been consulted.

01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:42.380
&gt;&gt; Intisar A. Rabb: I know I said
something here, but could I just

01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:47.850
because this actually a case that
features largely in this history

01:39:47.850 --> 01:39:50.630
about -- you're referring
to the case of [inaudible].

01:39:50.630 --> 01:39:51.930
&gt;&gt; Issam M. Saliba: Yes.

01:39:51.930 --> 01:39:53.230
&gt;&gt; Intisar A. Rabb: Who went

01:39:53.230 --> 01:39:55.750
to the prophet three times
saying I've committed adultery.

01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:57.050
&gt;&gt; Issam M. Saliba: That's right.

01:39:57.050 --> 01:39:58.350
&gt;&gt; Intisar A. Rabb: And
was sort of turned away.

01:39:58.350 --> 01:40:01.910
And finally the prophet said
fine you committed adultery,

01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:04.880
but he didn't say anything
about punishment

01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:08.400
and the Quran doesn't say anything
about stoning as a punishment

01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:12.030
for adultery that was a Middle
Eastern tradition, perhaps it came

01:40:12.030 --> 01:40:16.150
from Jewish law in
the Old Testament.

01:40:16.150 --> 01:40:22.260
But it was not in Islamic
punishment it's not in the Quran.

01:40:22.260 --> 01:40:27.230 position:56%
So the townspeople based on that
local tradition ended up stoning him

01:40:27.230 --> 01:40:30.780
and in fact, when the prophet
heard about that he said,

01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:32.960
if you would have just let him go.

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:38.540 position:56%
And then there was a huge discussion
after that in the literature

01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:40.860
over the centuries
and until this day.

01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:42.690
And I'm sure you know this story

01:40:42.690 --> 01:40:49.340 position:56%
about whether the prophet was
advising folks to let [inaudible] go

01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:53.650
in his prophetic capacity
and that is the rule,

01:40:53.650 --> 01:40:56.350
the rule of doubt essentially
that I talked about

01:40:56.350 --> 01:40:59.130
or was it his personal
capacity and he was softhearted.

01:40:59.130 --> 01:41:02.130
I think, I mean and the
general interpretation was

01:41:02.130 --> 01:41:03.700
that it was the prophetic capacity

01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:06.340
and this is actually
the Islamic legal rule

01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:09.240
that undergirded this idea
of avoid criminal punishments

01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:10.540
in cases of doubt.

01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:13.770
But I think your general point is
right and I totally agree with that

01:41:13.770 --> 01:41:17.770
that there's a lot of
room for internal review

01:41:17.770 --> 01:41:20.100
and lots of room for revising.

01:41:20.100 --> 01:41:21.940
&gt;&gt; Issam M. Saliba: This
is my point, this my point.

01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:26.000
Why, for example, [inaudible]
doesn't have somebody to come out

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.220
and say, yes our tradition,
our tradition allow

01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:33.300
for this type of changes.

01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:37.290
We are not in need to go
to the United States law

01:41:37.290 --> 01:41:40.430
or to the French law,
it's our tradition.

01:41:40.430 --> 01:41:46.980
And there is a wealth of great
things in the sharia traditions

01:41:46.980 --> 01:41:50.840
that can not only reform Islamic
law, but can make it even better

01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:52.890
in my opinion than other laws.

01:41:52.890 --> 01:41:59.590
And here I remember what Jackson,
Jackson the Supreme Court,

01:41:59.590 --> 01:42:03.060
Robert Jackson about what he said.

01:42:03.060 --> 01:42:04.360
&gt;&gt; Sherman A. Jackson: Close.

01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:07.390
&gt;&gt; Issam M. Saliba: That's very,
very, very impressive what he said

01:42:07.390 --> 01:42:11.870
and he said that the
Islamic law has an amazing,

01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:17.330
I mean he used the word amazing
record of accomplishment.

01:42:17.330 --> 01:42:25.740
But [inaudible] letting them be
hidden because of our action today.

01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:27.250
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: Well you're
really raising a question

01:42:27.250 --> 01:42:28.550
of authority here.

01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:31.760
Well you reference
[inaudible], you know,

01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:37.180
within Sunni Islam is there a
sufficiently overriding authority

01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:43.930
that legal reform could have
any hope of implementation

01:42:43.930 --> 01:42:49.830
on a worldwide or a very
large scale or the reform

01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:51.130
of Islamic legal thinking.

01:42:51.130 --> 01:42:52.620
Sherman, I may have cut you off.

01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:54.400
&gt;&gt; Sherman A. Jackson: Well,
I mean I think that, you know,

01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:56.170
Muslim countries can, you know,

01:42:56.170 --> 01:43:00.230
institute whatever reforms
basically fit the context

01:43:00.230 --> 01:43:01.690
of what the political situation

01:43:01.690 --> 01:43:03.850
in that particular
country will accommodate.

01:43:03.850 --> 01:43:08.630
So terms of formal reforms,
I mean that can take place.

01:43:08.630 --> 01:43:11.450
I guess the broader question
is the degree of resonance

01:43:11.450 --> 01:43:14.480
that those reforms have among
the population to the extent

01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:17.290
that they are accepted as being
sort of legitimate reforms.

01:43:17.290 --> 01:43:20.620
And that's a more complicated
question, I think that with regard

01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:24.940 position:56%
to institutions such as [inaudible],
I think one of the things

01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:27.740
that we have to be more aware
of in the west is this is

01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:32.000
that on the one hand we want
[inaudible] or any other sort

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:37.760
of official sharia establishment,
you know, to take the lead

01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:41.140
in instituting some of
these reform measures.

01:43:41.140 --> 01:43:46.150
While at the same time not
fully appreciating the extent

01:43:46.150 --> 01:43:49.710
to which Alzar's inability
and I'm not picking

01:43:49.710 --> 01:43:54.070
on Alzar I'm just using him as
an example, inability to address,

01:43:54.070 --> 01:44:01.010
you know, major sort of issues in
society from wealth distribution

01:44:01.010 --> 01:44:05.210
to poverty to corruption
to foreign policy.

01:44:05.210 --> 01:44:09.390
Their inability to address these
issues undermines the authority

01:44:09.390 --> 01:44:12.680
with the masses and in so
doing undermines their ability

01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:15.440
or certainly limits their
ability, you know, to have the kind

01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:20.000
of authority that could enlist
the assent of the population.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.510
And in that vacuum that's
where many of, you know,

01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:27.740
the Islamist movements
come in to fill the void.

01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:31.760
So I think that, you know, just
looking at these institutions

01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:36.010
in isolation from the
ongoing political realities

01:44:36.010 --> 01:44:40.930 position:56%
of the Muslim world I think it's
sort of naive and it's asking Alzar,

01:44:40.930 --> 01:44:43.210
I mean essentially
to do the impossible.

01:44:43.210 --> 01:44:50.360
And I think that on the issue
of reinterpretation of the Quran

01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:55.940
and I say this in the interest
of trying to move us to a point

01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:59.770
where the kinds of
conversation between Islam

01:44:59.770 --> 01:45:04.050
and the west can actually
have a greater ability

01:45:04.050 --> 01:45:07.290
to actually lead somewhere.

01:45:07.290 --> 01:45:10.520
Look, in terms of let's
say this thing on adultery,

01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:14.510
the evidentiary burden for
adultery has been I mean almost

01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:16.000
impossible to.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.300
&gt;&gt; Issam M. Saliba: Absolutely.

01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:18.600
&gt;&gt; Sherman A. Jackson: To
achieve from the beginning.

01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:19.900
&gt;&gt; Issam M. Saliba: Absolutely.

01:45:19.900 --> 01:45:21.420
&gt;&gt; Sherman A. Jackson: And so
with regard to interpretation,

01:45:21.420 --> 01:45:23.590
there's not very much you need
to interpret very much there,

01:45:23.590 --> 01:45:26.120
I mean it's almost
impossible to prove.

01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:32.070
But what we have to recognize is
this is that many Muslims feel

01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:37.650 position:56%
that what they're being called upon
to do is reconcile Islam with a sort

01:45:37.650 --> 01:45:40.680
of hegemonic liberalism
that would basically argue

01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:42.980
that well there is no justification

01:45:42.980 --> 01:45:45.740
for having any rule
on adultery period.

01:45:45.740 --> 01:45:50.240
And what they're being asked
to do is reinterpret the Quran

01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:52.940
to the point that there
is no regulation

01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:54.630
on something like adultery.

01:45:54.630 --> 01:45:57.670
And I think that those,
I mean that kind

01:45:57.670 --> 01:45:59.490
of what I would consider extremism

01:45:59.490 --> 01:46:04.540 position:56%
on the other side also preempts a
possibility of meaning conversation.

01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:05.840
&gt;&gt; Issam M. Saliba:
Sure [inaudible].

01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:07.140
&gt;&gt; Sherman A. Jackson:
But that's [inaudible].

01:46:07.140 --> 01:46:08.440
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: Let's switch
the conversation a little bit here

01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:09.740
because I think one of the
other things that we really want

01:46:09.740 --> 01:46:12.920
to explore is what are the
engines of change here.

01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:18.340
Some of what you had to say Kristen
talked about particular forms of --

01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:21.610
particular kinds of
reform, who started them,

01:46:21.610 --> 01:46:26.050
where are things bubbling up, where
we actually getting some action.

01:46:26.050 --> 01:46:33.070
Intisar you too when you
talked about the code in Iran.

01:46:33.070 --> 01:46:36.530
How is it happening on the ground
can you speak to that a little bit?

01:46:36.530 --> 01:46:38.280
&gt;&gt; Kristen A. Stilt: Yeah
and I think just to pick

01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:41.550
up on the comment just
about Alzar to be clear.

01:46:41.550 --> 01:46:44.600
I think it's very important
to segment these conversations

01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:46.630
into substantive areas of the law.

01:46:46.630 --> 01:46:48.960
Alzar is very permissive
on Islamic finance,

01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:52.420
but has not been a very
strong supporter of changes

01:46:52.420 --> 01:46:54.460
that have been requested
by women's groups

01:46:54.460 --> 01:46:57.210
to enhance the rights
of women for example.

01:46:57.210 --> 01:47:01.380 position:56%
So I think we want to segment out
these kind of conversations and say,

01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:04.490
when it comes to inheritance
law which is quite specific

01:47:04.490 --> 01:47:08.050
in the Quran, you see that
really holding on even in a place

01:47:08.050 --> 01:47:09.630
like Tunisia where a lot

01:47:09.630 --> 01:47:13.100
of the family law has become move
towards a much more egalitarian

01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:15.520
model with Islamic justifications.

01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:18.370
But the inheritance portion has
remained pretty, pretty tight.

01:47:18.370 --> 01:47:20.790
Whereas, of course, in
criminal law very few countries

01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:25.540
as Intisar said apply
classical criminal law.

01:47:25.540 --> 01:47:28.110
So looking at different
substantive areas

01:47:28.110 --> 01:47:31.690
of the laws gives us another lens
on how things change, you know,

01:47:31.690 --> 01:47:36.820 position:56%
Islamic law is not consistently
applied the same way in every place.

01:47:36.820 --> 01:47:40.270
There's extreme variations
depending on the country and even

01:47:40.270 --> 01:47:43.420
within countries in a
place like Malaysia.

01:47:43.420 --> 01:47:47.130
But then to the point of where
the change comes from, you know,

01:47:47.130 --> 01:47:50.860
I think the bottom up is
a very important place

01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:53.130
and that's not always a good thing.

01:47:53.130 --> 01:47:55.870
But it's sometimes a very good
thing when we look at, you know,

01:47:55.870 --> 01:48:00.180
activism around women's issues
for example and other areas

01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:04.400
in which activists are driving and
demanding change and finding ways

01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:06.480
to justify it and trying
to get someone

01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:09.490
in authority to agree with them.

01:48:09.490 --> 01:48:10.790
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe:
Yeah, would you agree

01:48:10.790 --> 01:48:13.310
to that mechanism that
was working in the?

01:48:13.310 --> 01:48:15.190
&gt;&gt; Intisar A. Rabb: I think
bottom-up is a part of it

01:48:15.190 --> 01:48:21.110 position:56%
and I think top-down and lateral are
also parts of it, important parts,

01:48:21.110 --> 01:48:24.380
meaning that civil society
groups, human rights groups and the

01:48:24.380 --> 01:48:28.310
like they may come
with arguments seeking

01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:36.200
to identify economic disparities,
gender injustices and the like.

01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:40.510
And then perhaps the jurists
as in the criminal law case

01:48:40.510 --> 01:48:47.360
or the professors at the secular
university who draw on both Islamic

01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:51.780
and state law, which is still
generally based on European codes

01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:58.440 position:56%
in the Muslim world tend to come up
with arguments to push the envelope,

01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:02.880
push the laws to change much in
the way it happens in this country.

01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:05.050
You look at the civil
rights movement and we had,

01:49:05.050 --> 01:49:07.830
I mean it's a question about social
change or legal change right.

01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:11.930
Where you have a confluence of the
civil rights movement and people

01:49:11.930 --> 01:49:16.960
in the trenches, as well as
a willingness on the part

01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:18.650
of the legislators
and the government

01:49:18.650 --> 01:49:22.880
to listen perhaps together
with economic --

01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:25.010
with it falling into
the economic interest.

01:49:25.010 --> 01:49:26.310
I think a lot of that is happening

01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:27.610
around critical justice
reforms today.

01:49:27.610 --> 01:49:29.520
So I think it takes all sides,

01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:33.540
but I think what Sherman Jackson
just pointed to about the necessity

01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:37.820
of bringing the conversation
to a level of sophistication

01:49:37.820 --> 01:49:42.940
and constant engagement
in identifying

01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:44.460
and continuing those conversations

01:49:44.460 --> 01:49:46.060
with those various
sides is important.

01:49:46.060 --> 01:49:51.760
So I think it's both
horizontal and vertical.

01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:55.880
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: What about
the possibility of interference

01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:58.750
and I'll pose it this way.

01:49:58.750 --> 01:50:01.380
What right does a non-Muslim
institution like the Library

01:50:01.380 --> 01:50:04.200
of Congress have to
even raise these issues,

01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:07.040
I mean or to hold a
conference like this?

01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:11.480
That it really is a matter of
do the efforts of, you know,

01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:13.610
western universities, think tanks,

01:50:13.610 --> 01:50:19.710
NGOs to foster discussion
of Islamic law reform.

01:50:19.710 --> 01:50:23.160
Do they help or do they
hinder efforts undertaken

01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:25.460
in the Muslim world?

01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:35.290
&gt;&gt; Intisar A. Rabb: I don't want
to keep talking, but that's okay.

01:50:35.290 --> 01:50:38.160
I mean it's a great
self-reflective question, you know,

01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:39.670
what are we doing, what
are we talking about.

01:50:39.670 --> 01:50:43.000
I always tend to think
that I mean to the extent

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:49.080
that we can educate ourselves
and other students or uses

01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:53.540
of the library or policymakers to
the extent that we all interact

01:50:53.540 --> 01:51:00.430
in this world, which is shrinking
and where we as I alluded

01:51:00.430 --> 01:51:04.070
to before I think need
also to be educated.

01:51:04.070 --> 01:51:07.860
It's not just the Muslims who
need to have some literacy

01:51:07.860 --> 01:51:12.350
about their religion and what
it permits and doesn't permit

01:51:12.350 --> 01:51:15.470
and how it can be used as a
positive force in society.

01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:18.930
But it's also those outside of the
Muslim world, it's non-Muslims,

01:51:18.930 --> 01:51:21.270
it's lawyers, it's
policymakers and to that extent,

01:51:21.270 --> 01:51:24.150
I think there's a very
significant role.

01:51:24.150 --> 01:51:26.200
This is extremely important
and I'm happy to be part

01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:30.720
of this conversation to help us
better understand and grapple with

01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:32.860
and raise these questions
that relate

01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:35.270
to Islamic law and legal change.

01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:38.030
&gt;&gt; Issam M. Saliba: What is
wrong I think for us here

01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:44.310
in the west is we want to impose
or think that our way of life

01:51:44.310 --> 01:51:47.500
or thinking [inaudible]
has to prevail.

01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:51.300
We have to understand that in the
Islamic tradition there is great

01:51:51.300 --> 01:52:00.010
possibility and great
treasure that has to be used

01:52:00.010 --> 01:52:02.890
for any changes to happen.

01:52:02.890 --> 01:52:09.380 position:56%
But the way it has been happening
nowadays is we come to them and say,

01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:14.300
human rights, declaration of human
rights rather than saying what is

01:52:14.300 --> 01:52:20.870
in your own tradition that
would lead to the same result.

01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:24.570
Helping them thinking
through their own traditions,

01:52:24.570 --> 01:52:26.790
their own heritage
and there is a lot.

01:52:26.790 --> 01:52:30.240
&gt;&gt; Kristen A. Stilt: So I think
this conversation is critical

01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:32.360
and I think not to
have it is a mistake

01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:33.660
because it's basically saying,

01:52:33.660 --> 01:52:35.810
you have your conversation we'll
have ours, we don't have anything

01:52:35.810 --> 01:52:37.440
in common with each other.

01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:38.740
&gt;&gt; Issam M. Saliba:
No, no, no I'm saying.

01:52:38.740 --> 01:52:42.140
&gt;&gt; Kristen A. Stilt: No, I'm
supporting you, I'm supporting you.

01:52:42.140 --> 01:52:43.550
This conversation is crucial,

01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:49.540
but also just to nuance
that a little bit.

01:52:49.540 --> 01:52:52.450
Muslim majority countries
have adopted many

01:52:52.450 --> 01:52:54.850
of the international human
rights treaties and people

01:52:54.850 --> 01:52:57.010
in those countries believe
that they are entitled

01:52:57.010 --> 01:52:58.940
to those rights as well.

01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:02.260
And so for us to be
concerned about there being,

01:53:02.260 --> 01:53:04.910
it's good to be concerned
about imposition,

01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:09.040
but it's also I think important
to say you want that too.

01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:12.280 position:56%
And we're part of a big conversation
and maybe how you think about it

01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:15.480
or justify it or reach
certain points you might go

01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:16.810 position:56%
through a different thought process.

01:53:16.810 --> 01:53:20.360
But when people are standing up and
saying, we want the same rights,

01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:22.420
you know, our country
has signed this.

01:53:22.420 --> 01:53:25.040
Pushing their countries as
women's groups have done

01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:28.660
to drop the reservations
to CEDAW that say,

01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:31.770
no except for Islamic
law then we don't have

01:53:31.770 --> 01:53:33.250
to adhere to these rights.

01:53:33.250 --> 01:53:35.650
I think we want to see that
and recognize that and say

01:53:35.650 --> 01:53:37.960
that we're part of
one big conversation

01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:42.830
and that it's important
to have this here today.

01:53:42.830 --> 01:53:46.110
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: Your
thoughts on that Sherman?

01:53:46.110 --> 01:53:47.410
&gt;&gt; Sherman A. Jackson: Yeah,

01:53:47.410 --> 01:53:50.370
I mean look I think it's
important to keep talking.

01:53:50.370 --> 01:53:56.590
And I do think that and I
mean that very seriously.

01:53:56.590 --> 01:54:03.370
And I do think that there is a
certain danger of people sort

01:54:03.370 --> 01:54:08.260
of sitting around talking
to themselves in a manner

01:54:08.260 --> 01:54:12.710
that those conversations are never
open to a sort of critical gaze

01:54:12.710 --> 01:54:14.670
from another perspective.

01:54:14.670 --> 01:54:18.900
And I think that works on both
sides of the conversation.

01:54:18.900 --> 01:54:22.300
I think at the same time,

01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:27.090
I mean these conversations
can be hegemonic.

01:54:27.090 --> 01:54:30.460
They can start off
from premises that sort

01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:32.080
of basically turn the conversation

01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:34.220
into have you stopped
beating your wife yet.

01:54:34.220 --> 01:54:37.780 position:56%
Whereby, the other side can only
sort of continually apologize itself

01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:39.790
into more ever deeper holes.

01:54:39.790 --> 01:54:43.860
And I think that that kind of
conversation has to be avoided.

01:54:43.860 --> 01:54:46.520
But there's a very important
role for conversations like this

01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:52.440
because I think that -- I
Kristen alluded to it a bit.

01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:57.160
Without conversation we
don't even know those areas

01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:00.680
in which there is actual
or possible agreement.

01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:03.920
And I think that with more and
more conversation that's likely

01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:05.870
to be further flushed out.

01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:07.920
And I think that the
real key is, you know,

01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:09.820
how do we have these conversations,

01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:13.150
how do we sustain these
conversations, but how do we do

01:55:13.150 --> 01:55:17.090
so in a way that they
don't turn hegemonic.

01:55:17.090 --> 01:55:18.580
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: We've
got 15 minutes left

01:55:18.580 --> 01:55:23.240
and I have promised the
panelists that I would ask them

01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:26.120
to ask each other any questions
that have occurred to them

01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:28.110
as they listen to each other.

01:55:28.110 --> 01:55:31.440
And I also am going to
point to a bit of a dilemma.

01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:36.610
I have questions from the audience,
which unfortunately are illegible

01:55:36.610 --> 01:55:40.140
because they are blue ink
against a blue background.

01:55:40.140 --> 01:55:43.490
So I'm really struggling
to get them.

01:55:43.490 --> 01:55:45.980
I'm going to pass these
questions to the panelists to see

01:55:45.980 --> 01:55:49.230
if their eyes are working
any better than mine.

01:55:49.230 --> 01:55:53.810 position:56%
But if they start to read a question
and you recognize it as yours

01:55:53.810 --> 01:55:57.810
by all means, you know,
you may stand up

01:55:57.810 --> 01:56:01.400
and give some clarification
of the question.

01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:04.220
But we've got a little
technical difficulty here.

01:56:04.220 --> 01:56:07.010
But as I pass these
out are there questions

01:56:07.010 --> 01:56:09.400
that you have of each other.

01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:10.700
Go ahead.

01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:12.000
&gt;&gt; Kristen A. Stilt: I do.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:16.940
Something I want to add Professor
Saliba and Professor Jackson.

01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:23.030
So Sherman, you said when customs
and habits change and to me

01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:25.770
that raises the question
of who decides when customs

01:56:25.770 --> 01:56:30.090
and habits change and you mentioned
Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd and his views.

01:56:30.090 --> 01:56:34.530
And one of his views was
that economics have changed

01:56:34.530 --> 01:56:38.790
and inheritance -- there should
be an egalitarianism inheritance

01:56:38.790 --> 01:56:41.260
that was not widely accepted.

01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:45.170
So custom and habits changing
that in itself of course is a test

01:56:45.170 --> 01:56:48.250
of fear who decides and I was
wondering if you had a thought

01:56:48.250 --> 01:56:51.780
about that as you were talking
about how [inaudible] updated?

01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:53.080
&gt;&gt; Sherman A. Jackson: Yeah,

01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:57.380
I think the custom is a
double-edged sword in this sense.

01:56:57.380 --> 01:57:07.520
That on the one hand it clearly
changes, but on the other hand

01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:10.360
in a sense there can
be no single entity

01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:12.960
that can determine that change.

01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:17.000
Because part of what renders
custom custom is the very fact

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:18.300
that it's unowned.

01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:19.600
&gt;&gt; Kristen A. Stilt: Right.

01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:22.600
&gt;&gt; Sherman A. Jackson: So
for example where I grew

01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:30.150
up in Philadelphia the custom
was guys wear one earring

01:57:30.150 --> 01:57:35.250
in the left ear never
in the right ear.

01:57:35.250 --> 01:57:39.190
Over a period of time the
custom changes so that

01:57:39.190 --> 01:57:42.310
and only females wore two earrings

01:57:42.310 --> 01:57:46.200
and now there's a custom
guys wear two earrings.

01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:48.870
Now who determined that, you know,

01:57:48.870 --> 01:57:52.240
that was okay against
the old, nobody knows.

01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:55.120
But it's in a sense
Kristen precisely the fact

01:57:55.120 --> 01:57:57.980
that nobody knows is
what renders it a custom.

01:57:57.980 --> 01:57:59.280
&gt;&gt; Kristen A. Stilt: Right.

01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:00.580
&gt;&gt; Intisar A. Rabb: Yeah.

01:58:00.580 --> 01:58:01.880
&gt;&gt; Kristen A. Stilt: That there
wasn't a law hinging on it?

01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:03.180
&gt;&gt; Sherman A. Jackson: No.

01:58:03.180 --> 01:58:04.480
&gt;&gt; Kristen A. Stilt:
[Inaudible] difference right.

01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:05.780
&gt;&gt; Sherman A. Jackson: No,
no and so I think that,

01:58:05.780 --> 01:58:10.610 position:56%
I mean what you have are jurists who
will make this claim on the basis

01:58:10.610 --> 01:58:14.100
of custom and that claim will
either resonate or it won't.

01:58:14.100 --> 01:58:19.250
So for example, my own best
friend Al-Kharafi talks

01:58:19.250 --> 01:58:24.110
about how the custom
had changed in terms

01:58:24.110 --> 01:58:26.830
of the formulae used for divorce.

01:58:26.830 --> 01:58:31.840
And he was arguing against his
Malaki fellow jurists saying

01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:34.540
that this stuff that
you find in the books

01:58:34.540 --> 01:58:38.930
of Maliki is no longer applicable
because the custom has changed.

01:58:38.930 --> 01:58:40.720
Now some of them agree, some

01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:43.440
of them don't end this kind
of thing is argued out.

01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:46.810
But I don't think that there's
any single entity that has sort

01:58:46.810 --> 01:58:52.510
of formal authority to say,
this is now custom that is not.

01:58:52.510 --> 01:58:53.810
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: Okay.'

01:58:53.810 --> 01:58:55.110
&gt;&gt; Kristen A. Stilt: And someone

01:58:55.110 --> 01:58:57.600
like Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd says
[inaudible] and then is rebuffed,

01:58:57.600 --> 01:58:59.020
that's the nature of customs.

01:58:59.020 --> 01:59:02.210
&gt;&gt; Issam M. Saliba: Yeah, I would
say here there is two issues.

01:59:02.210 --> 01:59:06.380
Either there is a change that
come like in the common law,

01:59:06.380 --> 01:59:09.550
then things have changing gradually

01:59:09.550 --> 01:59:14.690 position:56%
and then the judges are articulating
this change and become law.

01:59:14.690 --> 01:59:19.170
In the Islamic tradition it's
not the judges who articulate

01:59:19.170 --> 01:59:24.380 position:56%
but scholars, which unfortunately we
didn't have since the 10th century.

01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:25.680
So this is one way.

01:59:25.680 --> 01:59:26.980
&gt;&gt; Sherman A. Jackson:
But not even scholars.

01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:28.280
&gt;&gt; Issam M. Saliba:
Well in the past years.

01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:29.580
&gt;&gt; Sherman A. Jackson:
But the problem,

01:59:29.580 --> 01:59:32.170
I mean even Kharafi says this,
scholars may hold something

01:59:32.170 --> 01:59:35.210
to be customary because
it's in the books.

01:59:35.210 --> 01:59:37.150
And [inaudible] saying
you have to go

01:59:37.150 --> 01:59:39.130 position:56%
and see what's customary in society.

01:59:39.130 --> 01:59:41.050
&gt;&gt; Issam M. Saliba: But
articulating that how

01:59:41.050 --> 01:59:43.960
in the common law the judges
articulate that change.

01:59:43.960 --> 01:59:47.610
That the judges are not making
the changes they are articulating

01:59:47.610 --> 01:59:48.910
the changes.

01:59:48.910 --> 01:59:50.210
So this is one way.

01:59:50.210 --> 01:59:54.140
The other way is through
the people deciding

01:59:54.140 --> 01:59:59.040 position:56%
and how the people deciding nowadays
is through whatever form they want.

01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:02.470
And this point for example
specifically Muhammad Iqbal

02:00:02.470 --> 02:00:05.790
who is a great Muslim
scholar and a great thinker

02:00:05.790 --> 02:00:09.430
and a great [inaudible] he
mentioned that in his writing

02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:11.630
when they were thinking about
creating books Pakistan.

02:00:11.630 --> 02:00:17.150
I don't think he had in mind at all
Pakistan like the present Pakistan

02:00:17.150 --> 02:00:21.210
and he was a devout Muslim
committed to his religion.

02:00:21.210 --> 02:00:23.110
So these are two ways.

02:00:23.110 --> 02:00:28.840
There is nothing wrong about the
people deciding through elections

02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:33.180
or whatever, but this has
to be articulated by someone

02:00:33.180 --> 02:00:38.650
who has some kind of credentials
that Muslims believe in the public

02:00:38.650 --> 02:00:40.700 position:56%
and I don't know where to find that.

02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:42.330
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: Well if
we're going to keep the faith

02:00:42.330 --> 02:00:46.430
of this audio I think we've got
to try and tackle the decipherment

02:00:46.430 --> 02:00:48.040
of a few of these question.

02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:49.340
&gt;&gt; Issam M. Saliba: Yeah.

02:00:49.340 --> 02:00:50.640
&gt;&gt; Kristen A. Stilt:
Can you read yours?

02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:51.940
I can read mine.

02:00:51.940 --> 02:00:53.240
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: All right, why
don't you take the start Kristen?

02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:54.540
&gt;&gt; Kristen A. Stilt: Do
you want me to read it?

02:00:54.540 --> 02:00:55.840
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: Yeah.

02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:57.140
&gt;&gt; Kristen A. Stilt: What advice
would you give to policymakers

02:00:57.140 --> 02:00:58.800
who are not Islamic scholars
yet wish to be effective

02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:01.600
at reconciling religious
and cultural traditions

02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:03.960
with governments, human
rights obligations

02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:07.260
under international treaties,

02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:10.850
particularly on the rights
of women such as CEDAW?

02:01:10.850 --> 02:01:12.950
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: Well go ahead.

02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:15.550
&gt;&gt; Kristen A. Stilt:
It's a great question.

02:01:15.550 --> 02:01:21.090
I teach a class that tries to
deal with this and in looking

02:01:21.090 --> 02:01:24.680
for materials I've found
this fantastic report

02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:27.280
by a group called Massawa
[phonetic], a group of women

02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:31.390
that started as sisters in
Islam Malaysia and expanded.

02:01:31.390 --> 02:01:35.370
And as I mentioned before,
a lot of countries will say

02:01:35.370 --> 02:01:38.720
to CEDAW we can't do this, we can't
do that because of Islamic law.

02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:43.470
And Massawa has a report that
basically takes apart every claim

02:01:43.470 --> 02:01:46.520
and says yes you can
and let me show you why.

02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:49.170
Yes you can and they're
speaking to the CEDAW commission

02:01:49.170 --> 02:01:52.000
and they say don't let these
countries get away with this

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.950
under the guise of Islamic
law, it's really patriarchy

02:01:54.950 --> 02:01:59.470
and we'll show you how you
can get there from here.

02:01:59.470 --> 02:02:05.340 position:56%
And that's fascinating and following
a group like that allows you then

02:02:05.340 --> 02:02:07.510
to work under the rubric
or in conjunction

02:02:07.510 --> 02:02:11.860
with someone who's trying
to operate internally.

02:02:11.860 --> 02:02:16.340
And yet at the same time be
supportive of their endeavor.

02:02:16.340 --> 02:02:19.860
So I've put that out there as
one example where that kind

02:02:19.860 --> 02:02:24.580
of conversation is taking place
within in an internal community,

02:02:24.580 --> 02:02:28.970
but they're taking to task there
are other countries that are trying

02:02:28.970 --> 02:02:32.190
to use these exceptions as
really what they say is a guise

02:02:32.190 --> 02:02:34.440
for just your patriarchy.

02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:35.740
&gt;&gt; Intisar A. Rabb:
I have a question

02:02:35.740 --> 02:02:38.210
that I think is directed
at Sherman Jackson.

02:02:38.210 --> 02:02:41.370
It doesn't say it but.

02:02:41.370 --> 02:02:44.360
&gt;&gt; Sherman A. Jackson:
[Inaudible] Intisar Rabb.

02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:48.220
&gt;&gt; Intisar A. Rabb: Is law reform
inhibited by different degrees

02:02:48.220 --> 02:02:51.490
of passion analogous
to gun control here

02:02:51.490 --> 02:02:57.240
where arguably the majority mildly
in favor of controls is thwarted

02:02:57.240 --> 02:03:00.360
by a passionate anti-control
minority?

02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:02.980
&gt;&gt; Sherman A. Jackson:
Yeah, I mean I think

02:03:02.980 --> 02:03:06.840
that that's definitely the
case, I mean whatever the sort

02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:09.220
of prevailing sensibilities,

02:03:09.220 --> 02:03:12.970
passions in society are will
have an effect on the extent

02:03:12.970 --> 02:03:16.670
to which reform can
actually take place.

02:03:16.670 --> 02:03:21.400
You know Muslim reformers are
human beings in parts of society

02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:25.680
like everybody else and,
you know, proposing this

02:03:25.680 --> 02:03:31.220
or that idea can be
easier or harder depending

02:03:31.220 --> 02:03:33.500
on the circumstances
that they're facing.

02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:35.170
I think the real question, however,

02:03:35.170 --> 02:03:42.220 position:56%
is you know how much authority does
the proposer of a particular reform,

02:03:42.220 --> 02:03:44.140
how much authority do they possess.

02:03:44.140 --> 02:03:49.930
And here I'll go back to a point
that Kristen made earlier and say

02:03:49.930 --> 02:03:51.320
that we have to differentiate,

02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:54.050
I mean there are different
kinds of authority.

02:03:54.050 --> 02:03:58.120
And let me just give you one
example of what I'm talking about.

02:03:58.120 --> 02:04:00.410
Most of us in this room
are probably old enough

02:04:00.410 --> 02:04:06.160
to remember the assassination
of Anwar Sadat in 1981.

02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:11.540 position:56%
In 1997, the group that assassinated
Sadat basically came out

02:04:11.540 --> 02:04:13.930
and renounced political violence.

02:04:13.930 --> 02:04:16.650
Now there have been all kinds
of meetings and back and forth

02:04:16.650 --> 02:04:19.450
between them and the government
and government officials

02:04:19.450 --> 02:04:22.330
and [inaudible], etcetera
all of them failed.

02:04:22.330 --> 02:04:27.030 position:56%
It was when the leaders of this
group, however, decided on their own

02:04:27.030 --> 02:04:29.290
that we're going to
renounce political violence,

02:04:29.290 --> 02:04:33.520
then they were able to sell that to
a much broader segment of society.

02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:40.690 position:56%
So they had a form of authority that
even, you know, jurists and clerics

02:04:40.690 --> 02:04:43.010
of [inaudible] might not have
had in that particular context.

02:04:43.010 --> 02:04:45.910
So I think that there are lots
of different players and we have

02:04:45.910 --> 02:04:51.100
to be sensitive to the type
of authority that is possessed

02:04:51.100 --> 02:04:55.230
and the type of authority that is
needed to address specific groups.

02:04:55.230 --> 02:05:00.100 position:56%
What type of authority is needed
let's say to address ISIS right now?

02:05:00.100 --> 02:05:01.860
Is it [inaudible] or
is it the [inaudible]?

02:05:01.860 --> 02:05:06.820
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe:
Intisar do you have?

02:05:06.820 --> 02:05:10.760
&gt;&gt; Intisar A. Rabb: Another
question here is how to tell when,

02:05:10.760 --> 02:05:12.060
how do you tell when consensus

02:05:12.060 --> 02:05:15.990
on legal change is pervasive
enough to be authoritative?

02:05:15.990 --> 02:05:19.380
And it seems -- this question
seems linked to this question

02:05:19.380 --> 02:05:25.070
of authority, but also to that
earlier question about, you know,

02:05:25.070 --> 02:05:27.710
just how does legal change happen.

02:05:27.710 --> 02:05:31.920
And I will only say this
that I think that every --

02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:36.380
we have to be careful to not speak

02:05:36.380 --> 02:05:39.940
in excessive generality even
though Islamic law is something

02:05:39.940 --> 02:05:45.980
that in some ways can be amorphous
and cross-border transnational.

02:05:45.980 --> 02:05:49.230
But I mean there are states
and different manifestations

02:05:49.230 --> 02:05:52.730
of Islamic law and
I think one element

02:05:52.730 --> 02:05:56.580
of authority is state
authority to control

02:05:56.580 --> 02:06:01.580
and monopolize violence
and other forms of law.

02:06:01.580 --> 02:06:08.390
And that's one easy way
of telling when a method

02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:12.880
of change is authoritative
you've convinced your legislators

02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:17.480 position:56%
through all of these different
actors that might do the convincing.

02:06:17.480 --> 02:06:18.990
As we talked about
before the horizontal

02:06:18.990 --> 02:06:21.560
and the vertical to
create legal change.

02:06:21.560 --> 02:06:24.920
But I mean there of course is a
social, religious aspect as well

02:06:24.920 --> 02:06:29.840
for those who follow
Islamic law that is private

02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:35.300
and there may be elements
of infusing or degrees

02:06:35.300 --> 02:06:40.750
to which you can infuse more of
the values of Islamic law relevant

02:06:40.750 --> 02:06:44.550
to the context in which you
live and that manifests itself

02:06:44.550 --> 02:06:46.630
in some changes in Islamic law.

02:06:46.630 --> 02:06:50.430
The extent of authority I think
then depends on the extent

02:06:50.430 --> 02:06:54.070
to which these individuals
follow an authoritative figure

02:06:54.070 --> 02:06:57.390
or school of thought.

02:06:57.390 --> 02:07:02.910
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: Probably have
time for one last question, Issam.

02:07:02.910 --> 02:07:04.560
&gt;&gt; Issam M. Saliba:
I think [inaudible].

02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:05.860
&gt;&gt; Kristen A. Stilt: Ayan
[phonetic] [inaudible].

02:07:05.860 --> 02:07:09.440
&gt;&gt; Issam M. Saliba: Ayan in
her recent book [inaudible]

02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:13.750
for reforming Islam,
including Islamic laws focused

02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:19.110
on the afterlife as
I don't know what --

02:07:19.110 --> 02:07:27.920
as an obstacle to everyday
secular life.

02:07:27.920 --> 02:07:30.440
Your comment.

02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:34.370
If this is what I understand.

02:07:34.370 --> 02:07:38.590
I personally from my reading
and study of Islamic law

02:07:38.590 --> 02:07:42.500
and Islamic tradition, I think
this is a great tradition.

02:07:42.500 --> 02:07:44.990
It has a great potential

02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:52.540
for correcting what we see
wrong here from within.

02:07:52.540 --> 02:07:58.350
And I don't think that
only can it be said to be

02:07:58.350 --> 02:08:01.680
for the afterlife it can
be for this life as well

02:08:01.680 --> 02:08:07.220
because there is a tremendous
principle and good traditions

02:08:07.220 --> 02:08:13.250
in the Islamic history that is not
being even known to most Muslims.

02:08:13.250 --> 02:08:16.910
For example, when you read, you
know, [inaudible] what he said

02:08:16.910 --> 02:08:23.060
about [inaudible] getting into the
church of [inaudible] in Jerusalem

02:08:23.060 --> 02:08:33.500 position:56%
and the time of the [inaudible] came
the patriarch invited him to pray

02:08:33.500 --> 02:08:37.340
in the church and he refused.

02:08:37.340 --> 02:08:42.220
Why, he said probably some of my
Muslim in the future will come

02:08:42.220 --> 02:08:46.350
and say this is where [inaudible]
prayed and we want to convert that.

02:08:46.350 --> 02:08:49.590
He went outside and
prayed in front of the.

02:08:49.590 --> 02:08:56.130
Now some Muslim, scholars even
they say this is not a true story,

02:08:56.130 --> 02:08:57.800
but whether this is true story

02:08:57.800 --> 02:09:04.900
or not it represents a great
part of the Islamic heritage.

02:09:04.900 --> 02:09:08.020
How can you [inaudible]
with what ISIS is doing

02:09:08.020 --> 02:09:10.510
by destroying the churches
in [inaudible].

02:09:10.510 --> 02:09:13.750
And this is what I'm saying,
I mean we have to go back

02:09:13.750 --> 02:09:18.230 position:56%
to the Islamic traditions themselves
and there is a tremendous,

02:09:18.230 --> 02:09:20.750
tremendous possibilities there

02:09:20.750 --> 02:09:26.040
to correct what I think is wrong
today with the likes of ISIS.

02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:29.790
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: Well maybe we'll
let that be the last word in terms

02:09:29.790 --> 02:09:34.540
of our open panel discussion,
but I'm going to go to the podium

02:09:34.540 --> 02:09:37.810
and introduce our very final
speaker of the morning.

02:09:37.810 --> 02:09:42.510
But before I do that may I ask you
to join me in thanking our panel.

02:09:42.510 --> 02:09:51.040
[ Applause ]

02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:55.050 position:56%
And now I would like to ask Dr. Mary
Jane Deeb to come to the podium.

02:09:55.050 --> 02:09:58.270
She is chief of the African
and Middle East Division here

02:09:58.270 --> 02:10:01.130
at the Library of Congress
and she's going

02:10:01.130 --> 02:10:04.860
to wrap this all up in a few words.

02:10:04.860 --> 02:10:10.040
I mean it's an impossible task that
we have asked Dr. Mary Jane Deeb

02:10:10.040 --> 02:10:13.690
to undertake, but I know you
will enjoy her final remarks.

02:10:13.690 --> 02:10:15.990
Thank you.

02:10:23.990 --> 02:10:28.090
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb: Thank
you Jane and thank you.

02:10:28.090 --> 02:10:34.030
I want first to thank the Law
Library, its acting law librarian,

02:10:34.030 --> 02:10:40.290 position:56%
Rebecca Schaffer, for hosting it and
the law librarians who organized it

02:10:40.290 --> 02:10:43.700
and who invited me to this
discussion, [inaudible],

02:10:43.700 --> 02:10:46.230 position:56%
Kimberly Zellars and all the others.

02:10:46.230 --> 02:10:48.480
So thank you for being here.

02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:56.620 position:56%
My division is cohosting this event
and so I'm delighted to be here just

02:10:56.620 --> 02:10:59.150
to make a few closing remarks.

02:10:59.150 --> 02:11:03.280
There are a few and I'm not going
to try to put everything together

02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:05.160
because it's been very
exciting and I'm going

02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:08.670
to leave you with their ideas.

02:11:08.670 --> 02:11:13.530
I'm going to wrap up
the program today,

02:11:13.530 --> 02:11:18.270
I will just make a few comments.

02:11:18.270 --> 02:11:23.000
The speakers have made fascinating
and thought-provoking presentations

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.310
and have challenged
many of the stereotypes

02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:28.550
that people have in
mind about sharia.

02:11:28.550 --> 02:11:35.780
So let me add my two cents to the
discussion, not as a legal scholar

02:11:35.780 --> 02:11:41.000
which I'm not, but as a
political scientist which I am.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:44.800
From that perspective that
is of a social scientist,

02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:51.150
I approach all law whether western
or Islamic as interpretation.

02:11:51.150 --> 02:11:55.560
It is the interpretation of
religious text, ethical principles,

02:11:55.560 --> 02:12:00.390
philosophical thesis
and/or cultural traditions.

02:12:00.390 --> 02:12:03.720
Islamic law as we have heard today

02:12:03.720 --> 02:12:07.400
or sharia is the interpretation
of mainly three things.

02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:10.520
The Quran, which is a
sacred religious text.

02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:14.280
The Hadith, which is verbally
transmitted sayings of the prophet.

02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:16.340
And the Sunnah, which
is a reported record

02:12:16.340 --> 02:12:18.440 position:56%
of the prophecy reads and teachings.

02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:22.210 position:56%
In addition, there is [inaudible],
which are the customs and traditions

02:12:22.210 --> 02:12:25.540
of the many Muslim
societies around the world.

02:12:25.540 --> 02:12:30.470
Again, as a social scientist I have
to categorize, to classify things.

02:12:30.470 --> 02:12:36.410
So how to classify Islamic law in
order to be able to analyze it.

02:12:36.410 --> 02:12:43.470
The issue I raise is an issue which
is important in the Muslim world

02:12:43.470 --> 02:12:50.070
and that is whether Sharia can be
classified as sacred law and so

02:12:50.070 --> 02:12:52.760
by definition unchanging.

02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:58.030
Example, you cannot really
change the 10 Commandments

02:12:58.030 --> 02:13:01.080
or is it secular law,
which is man-made and,

02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:03.690
therefore, can be changed.

02:13:03.690 --> 02:13:09.280
Professor Schacht maintains that
because Islamic law is derived

02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:15.150
from the Quran, which is a
sacred text and I'm quoting him,

02:13:15.150 --> 02:13:20.470 position:56%
Islamic law is a particularly
instructive example of a sacred law.

02:13:20.470 --> 02:13:25.800 position:56%
He argues that the individuality and
I think Professor Jackson referred

02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:29.430
to it, the individuality
of legal subject matter

02:13:29.430 --> 02:13:34.580
and religious norm is additional to
the [inaudible] variety of legal,

02:13:34.580 --> 02:13:39.390
ethical and ritual rules,
which is typical of sacred law.

02:13:39.390 --> 02:13:46.860
But others, such as Nasr Hamid Abu
Zayd whom we've been talking about,

02:13:46.860 --> 02:13:50.200
have argued that once the
revelations reach human beings

02:13:50.200 --> 02:13:53.200
and were interpreted by them
they were no longer in the sphere

02:13:53.200 --> 02:13:56.540
of the sacred, but rather
in that of the mundane.

02:13:56.540 --> 02:14:00.060
He stated that Quranic
interpretation I'm quoting him,

02:14:00.060 --> 02:14:02.590
was one of the tools
used in intellectual,

02:14:02.590 --> 02:14:04.530
social, and political struggles.

02:14:04.530 --> 02:14:09.300 position:56%
For him sharia cannot be considered
sacred or consequently unchangeable.

02:14:09.300 --> 02:14:13.330
It is unarguably man-made
having been created by jurists

02:14:13.330 --> 02:14:16.480
and Muslim scholars
over the centuries.

02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:18.920
The history of Islamic law seems

02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:26.280
to lean towards Abu Zayd's view
whom we have just discussed.

02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:30.850
The Sunnah existed in pre-Islamic
times and meant then a body

02:14:30.850 --> 02:14:35.050
of customs, beliefs and
traditions later in Islamic came

02:14:35.050 --> 02:14:38.780
to be associated as Muhammad's
reported conducts and sayings.

02:14:38.780 --> 02:14:41.680
But as you have heard, there
were competing views and reports

02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:45.020
in the prophet's sayings and doings
and the Muslim jurists needed

02:14:45.020 --> 02:14:47.240
to interpret them in
order to create a body

02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:50.590
of cohesive legal doctrines
and practices.

02:14:50.590 --> 02:14:52.180
[Inaudible] the customs

02:14:52.180 --> 02:14:56.170
and traditions was also
taken into consideration.

02:14:56.170 --> 02:14:58.750
They developed early on
the four major schools

02:14:58.750 --> 02:15:01.430
of Islamic jurisprudence, the
[inaudible] that we have talked

02:15:01.430 --> 02:15:06.460
about and with the founding
of the Hanafi School

02:15:06.460 --> 02:15:09.200
with [inaudible] Abu Hanafi.

02:15:09.200 --> 02:15:11.890
And then there was [inaudible]

02:15:11.890 --> 02:15:15.330
who established the Malaki
School of Jurisprudence.

02:15:15.330 --> 02:15:20.930
And Muhammad [inaudible] who
established Shafi'i School.

02:15:20.930 --> 02:15:23.610
And finally came the fourth
jurist Ahmed Ibn Hambal

02:15:23.610 --> 02:15:28.060
who established the Hanbali School
and you must have heard a lot

02:15:28.060 --> 02:15:33.850
about the Hanbalis and the impact
of that school of jurisprudence

02:15:33.850 --> 02:15:37.670
on Islamists, radical
Islamists today.

02:15:37.670 --> 02:15:41.360
In other words, from the very early
days of Islam there was debate

02:15:41.360 --> 02:15:45.130
as we have talked about
regarding Islamic law,

02:15:45.130 --> 02:15:48.550
it was not static as
sacred law would be.

02:15:48.550 --> 02:15:52.020
But instead, it was dynamic,
changing and evolving.

02:15:52.020 --> 02:15:55.890
And at the end there was
no consensus of the jurists

02:15:55.890 --> 02:15:58.450
on all aspects of law,
hence the emergence

02:15:58.450 --> 02:16:00.150
of these four schools
of jurisprudence.

02:16:00.150 --> 02:16:03.790 position:56%
In addition, through the divergences
between these four schools

02:16:03.790 --> 02:16:07.960
of sharia there exists another
perhaps even more important

02:16:07.960 --> 02:16:12.060
that between the two major branches
of Islam, the Sunni and the Shia,

02:16:12.060 --> 02:16:15.280
the approach of Shiism to
[inaudible] is somewhat different

02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:19.570 position:56%
from that of the Sunnis as they have
their own school of jurisprudence.

02:16:19.570 --> 02:16:22.000
There's the Ja'fari
school, the school was named

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:27.560
after [inaudible] Ja'fari in the
8th century, the religious imam.

02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:31.100
By the way, since 1959
the Ja'fari School

02:16:31.100 --> 02:16:35.170 position:56%
of Jurisprudence has been recognized
as the fifth school of jurisprudence

02:16:35.170 --> 02:16:38.270
by the [inaudible] in Cairo.

02:16:38.270 --> 02:16:41.540
Among Shiites the door
of Ijtihad seems

02:16:41.540 --> 02:16:48.820
to be slightly more open whilst
the door of Ijtihad and we have,

02:16:48.820 --> 02:16:51.290
Professor Jackson has
been talking about it.

02:16:51.290 --> 02:16:58.750
The door of Ijtihad among Sunnis
seems to be somewhat closed,

02:16:58.750 --> 02:17:05.400
although you know not
operationally closed,

02:17:05.400 --> 02:17:07.980
but not theoretically closed.

02:17:07.980 --> 02:17:12.380
This in terms of Shiism allows
the [inaudible] to make judgments

02:17:12.380 --> 02:17:14.870
and to issue rulings
on legal matters

02:17:14.870 --> 02:17:16.270
and to interpret the
[inaudible] of religion

02:17:16.270 --> 02:17:18.450
and the principles of sharia.

02:17:18.450 --> 02:17:22.740
Shiites accept, again there's
a difference between Shiites

02:17:22.740 --> 02:17:24.040
and Sunnis when we talk

02:17:24.040 --> 02:17:30.440
about reforming Islamic law we
should be clearer on those things.

02:17:30.440 --> 02:17:33.930
The Shiites accept only the
interpretation of law based

02:17:33.930 --> 02:17:38.020
on the Sunnah concerning the family
of the prophet and his descendants,

02:17:38.020 --> 02:17:42.160
the successors and not
necessarily the [inaudible],

02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:43.680
the people around the prophet.

02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:47.230
Furthermore, Shiites will accept
the interpretation of law only

02:17:47.230 --> 02:17:50.220
if validated by the imam.

02:17:50.220 --> 02:17:54.790
And one of the pillars of Shiism
is the imamate or the succession

02:17:54.790 --> 02:17:59.660
of the prophet, which is not
really acceptable to Sunnis.

02:17:59.660 --> 02:18:04.580 position:56%
And then you have other Muslims with
varying approaches to Islamic law,

02:18:04.580 --> 02:18:07.960
such as the Ismaili whose
legal system is based

02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:12.380
on the [inaudible] Islam,
the pillars of Islam.

02:18:12.380 --> 02:18:16.850
But they hold that there are
seven not five pillars of Islam

02:18:16.850 --> 02:18:19.070
that includes the [inaudible],

02:18:19.070 --> 02:18:25.060
the devotion to the imam Ja'fari
[inaudible], again he's back.

02:18:25.060 --> 02:18:29.600
[Inaudible] ritual purity, which
somehow [inaudible] the Sunnis

02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:32.220
because they're not
comfortable with the concept

02:18:32.220 --> 02:18:33.520
of an imamate, [inaudible].

02:18:33.520 --> 02:18:41.170
And then there is the [inaudible],
one of the main branches

02:18:41.170 --> 02:18:45.730
of the Muslim [inaudible] who are
to be found in Iman for example,

02:18:45.730 --> 02:18:49.840
as well as in North Africa,
Libya, Algeria, Tunisia.

02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:54.520
We just had a group of
[inaudible] from Algeria came

02:18:54.520 --> 02:18:56.320
and gave us their publications
and told us

02:18:56.320 --> 02:19:00.920
about the work they're doing there,
which I immediately said okay,

02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:05.300 position:56%
you know, bring in your publications
we need to see those as well.

02:19:05.300 --> 02:19:09.740
And [inaudible] also
found in East Africa.

02:19:09.740 --> 02:19:14.730
They also have a concept of the
imamate, but somewhat different

02:19:14.730 --> 02:19:16.400
from that of the Shiites.

02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:19.900
The imam is elected secretly
by council of prominent laymen

02:19:19.900 --> 02:19:22.880
or by sheikhs and then
proclaimed in public.

02:19:22.880 --> 02:19:28.020
Often the eligibility is limited
to a single tribe or even a family.

02:19:28.020 --> 02:19:30.260
However, the concept
of several imams

02:19:30.260 --> 02:19:35.180
in different regions
is also allowed.

02:19:35.180 --> 02:19:38.860
That's interesting when we're
talking about the state for example

02:19:38.860 --> 02:19:42.050
as we were referring to earlier.

02:19:42.050 --> 02:19:47.090
So one is a discussion such
as the one we've had today,

02:19:47.090 --> 02:19:50.320
so important to political
scientists.

02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:53.450
Well first, as it was
pointed out by the speakers

02:19:53.450 --> 02:19:58.430
because Islamic law focuses on
the organization of the state.

02:19:58.430 --> 02:20:01.030
As we have seen concepts
of the caliphate

02:20:01.030 --> 02:20:05.950
and the imamate are critical to our
understanding what Muslim rebels

02:20:05.950 --> 02:20:09.070
such as ISIS or the
Qaeda are calling for.

02:20:09.070 --> 02:20:12.920
They're calling for the
caliphate, but not all of them.

02:20:12.920 --> 02:20:19.540
And Islamic law also focuses
on the organization of society

02:20:19.540 --> 02:20:22.280
and we had Professor
Stilt talk about it.

02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:29.950 position:56%
And we have seen with the discussion
on women and family law and again,

02:20:29.950 --> 02:20:33.940
the ISIS [inaudible]
these groups are claiming

02:20:33.940 --> 02:20:38.850
that they know how society should
be organized that they know.

02:20:38.850 --> 02:20:45.140
And somehow those who fail to
follow the sharia according

02:20:45.140 --> 02:20:47.690
to ISIS should be punished

02:20:47.690 --> 02:20:53.940
and [inaudible] we've seen
quite clearly on television.

02:20:53.940 --> 02:20:57.900
And thirdly, this discussion is
important to social scientists

02:20:57.900 --> 02:21:03.300
because we are discussing change,
reform, modernization as a way

02:21:03.300 --> 02:21:06.030
to address the challenge
posed by these

02:21:06.030 --> 02:21:10.060
and other groups demanding
change in Muslim society.

02:21:10.060 --> 02:21:15.060
So the problem with these
three reasons I've given is

02:21:15.060 --> 02:21:21.610
that there is no single
answer to any of these issues.

02:21:21.610 --> 02:21:25.610
And in fact, there may
be many contradictions.

02:21:25.610 --> 02:21:28.980
So going back to the dichotomy
of sacred versus secular low

02:21:28.980 --> 02:21:35.140
for instance, how can there
be reform or modernization

02:21:35.140 --> 02:21:39.910
or even change of sacred law,
sacred law should be, you know,

02:21:39.910 --> 02:21:44.940
by definition perfect, immutable
if not, how can it be sacred.

02:21:44.940 --> 02:21:48.840
And this is certainly the position
of the most conservative groups

02:21:48.840 --> 02:21:52.340
and of the radical Islamist
groups such as ISIS.

02:21:52.340 --> 02:21:54.620
This is why they do not
want change, it is sacred,

02:21:54.620 --> 02:21:59.170
it is untouchable you
do not make changes.

02:21:59.170 --> 02:22:04.200
Second, when we talk about change
and reform of sharia what exactly,

02:22:04.200 --> 02:22:06.970
what school of jurisprudence
are we focusing on?

02:22:06.970 --> 02:22:11.050
That of the [inaudible],
the Shiites,

02:22:11.050 --> 02:22:14.430
[inaudible] for instance introduce
a number of changes in the concept

02:22:14.430 --> 02:22:19.440 position:56%
of the state and the imamate and the
role of the clergy and the state.

02:22:19.440 --> 02:22:23.440
Are we addressing the Ja'fira
School of Jurisprudence for example

02:22:23.440 --> 02:22:31.880
or are we focusing primarily
on Sunni Islam and if so, why?

02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:42.350
Thirdly, when we discuss
the concept of the state

02:22:42.350 --> 02:22:47.150 position:56%
as you've all been discussing today,
there is really no clear agreement

02:22:47.150 --> 02:22:49.520
of what is the best
form of the state.

02:22:49.520 --> 02:22:52.900
The imamate and the
caliphate are not the same.

02:22:52.900 --> 02:22:56.680
Also the process historically
of selecting Islamic leaders

02:22:56.680 --> 02:23:01.630
as you know has been a very bloody
business and continues to be so.

02:23:01.630 --> 02:23:07.190
There is no agreement across the
Muslim world on either process

02:23:07.190 --> 02:23:10.110
or representation and
I'm saying this

02:23:10.110 --> 02:23:13.960
with qualifications,
but should there be.

02:23:13.960 --> 02:23:17.330
And with regards to social
organization, women, the family,

02:23:17.330 --> 02:23:22.520
as was pointed out with Professor
Stilt, there is so much variation.

02:23:22.520 --> 02:23:28.320
In fact, over the past 1,400 years,
since the beginning of Islam,

02:23:28.320 --> 02:23:32.080
there has not been uniformly
applicable laws throughout the

02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:40.740
Muslim worlds regarding
the family, women,

02:23:40.740 --> 02:23:42.900
social organizations, society.

02:23:42.900 --> 02:23:49.780
In fact, look at societies with
predominantly Muslim populations.

02:23:49.780 --> 02:23:54.190
Indonesia for example,
Nigeria is another example,

02:23:54.190 --> 02:23:58.220
Saudi Arabia have all
very different patterns

02:23:58.220 --> 02:24:01.350
of social organization
and family relations.

02:24:01.350 --> 02:24:06.880
It is tradition, it is
customs, worldviews that seem

02:24:06.880 --> 02:24:11.170
to have had a greater impact in
the final analysis than sharia law.

02:24:11.170 --> 02:24:18.060
Okay, I am sticking my neck out
in all this, but I claim ignorance

02:24:18.060 --> 02:24:21.130
but I'm only a political scientist.

02:24:21.130 --> 02:24:27.840 position:56%
Then again my question is what is it
that we really are trying to change?

02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:33.180
Is it customary law, are we
talking about human rights,

02:24:33.180 --> 02:24:37.740
what part of Islamic sharia,

02:24:37.740 --> 02:24:41.570
which groups are we trying
to affect and to change?

02:24:41.570 --> 02:24:50.920
And as was raised, who is the we, I
mean is it we here, is it we there,

02:24:50.920 --> 02:24:54.250
is it one particular group,
is it one particular country,

02:24:54.250 --> 02:24:56.530
is it one particular authority.

02:24:56.530 --> 02:25:04.620
And I am not going to present any
answer I'm just raising questions

02:25:04.620 --> 02:25:10.490
from one perspective and
I'm leaving it at that.

02:25:10.490 --> 02:25:13.680
So thank you very much and
thank you all for being here

02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:20.160
and this panel was wonderful and
let us give them all a big clap

02:25:20.160 --> 02:25:23.310
because they've done
a fantastic job.

02:25:23.310 --> 02:25:26.960
And thank you Jane for
moderating it so well.

02:37:07.110 --> 02:37:10.460
This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
