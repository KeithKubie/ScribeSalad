Hi I’m John Green.

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.100
This is Crash Course Literature and today
we’ll be doubling, bubbling, toiling and

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.430
troubling as we continue our discussion of
Macbeth.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.290
Today we’ll be looking more closely at the
characters of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth as

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.469
well as discussing the play’s treatment
of gender roles and its downer ending.

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:28.300
INTRO
One of the 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.290
most remarkable things about Macbeth is that
it presents us with a hero who is also a villain.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.220
As we discussed last time, when we first meet
Macbeth he’s helped win a major battle for

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.220
Scotland.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.120
The first time he’s mentioned, a sergeant
introduces him as “brave Macbeth.”

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.020
Being brave and winning battles were two of
the major signs of Great Mandom at the time.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.820
And okay, maybe this Macbeth is a little violent;
he slices an opponent down the middle and

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.670
spikes his head on the battlements.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.450
But he’s definitely the hero of the day
and Duncan, the King, rewards him.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.450
Even if that whole beheading thing seems a
little extreme, at the beginning of the play

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.280
we’re on Macbeth’s side.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.820
And we stay on his side when he has a lot
of second thoughts about his wife’s plan

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.370
to kill the king.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.160
/
His wife has to talk him into it—basically

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.540
she attacks his masculinity, but more on that
later—and I think our sympathies mostly

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.340
stay with him even after the murder.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.171
We worry that someone is going to find him
out, maybe the same someone who knocks so

00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:26.590
unrelentingly on the gate, and hope he gets
away with it, even though it’s horrible.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:36.250
(The fact that it sickens even him is another
way to get us on his side.)

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.340
Once he becomes king, his paranoia kicks in
and so does his cruelty.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.840
He starts ordering more murders, maybe even
some he doesn’t have to order, like that

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.840
of Banquo.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.840
Now he’s the one encouraging murderers,
not his wife--he’s gone from hero to antihero,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.700
a journey that has since been undertaken by
everyone from Walter White to Tony Soprano

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.850
to Pablo Escobar to Don Draper to Jamie Lannister
to that Hannibal Lecter guy in Westworld.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.909
I wonder if it’s a coincidence that all
those dudes are dudes.

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.470
But before we get there, let’s examine how
to understand Macbeth’s choices in the Thoughtbubble:

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.240
Could we argue that Macbeth’s encounter
with the witches has made him evil?

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.410
I mean, there’s no suggestion that they’ve
enchanted him, and they never tell him to

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.170
kill Duncan or even suggest that killing Duncan
is a possibility.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.580
They let Macbeth and his wife figure that
part out for themselves—along with all the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.780
blood and the daggers.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.120
But the witches do light up his ambition with
their prophecies.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.090
Now, maybe Macbeth has been a terrible guy
from the get-go, a Thane who just needed the

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.260
excuse of the witches prophecies to act on
his worst impulses.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.660
As we saw, there are signs of his cruelty
even from the beginning; splitting open opponents

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.490
from neck to belly is not the work of an especially
meek and mild person.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.819
But then if Macbeth is inherently evil, in
the manner of some Shakespeare villains, then

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.810
why do his actions trouble him so much?

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.890
Almost immediately, Macbeth loses the ability
to pray and sleep and he even seems to envy

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.260
Duncan:
“After life's fitful fever he sleeps well.”

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.280
Meanwhile Macbeth is an insomniac.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.690
He also doesn’t seem to enjoy being king,
a job he was literally willing to kill for.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.860
And whether he actually sees Banquo’s ghost
in the banquet scene or just hallucinates

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.760
him, neither suggests a man who is happy in
his life choices.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.599
A sociopathic villain, like I’d argue Iago
is from Othello, just wouldn’t be haunted

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:24.599
in that way.

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.710
But for a guy who maybe isn’t evil to begin
with, he does keep getting a lot of people

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:29.710
murdered.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.599
Or maybe, seeing that the murder of Duncan
has already damned him for eternity, he figures

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.120
there’s no point repenting now.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.120
As he says to his wife...

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.680
“I am in blood/ Stepp'd in so far that,
should I wade no more,/ Returning were as

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.489
tedious as go o'er.”

00:03:44.489 --> 00:04:14.300
Basically, if you’re midway through fording
the River of Blood, might as well cross 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.499
to the other side.

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:21.329
Thanks, Thoughtbubble.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.139
However we understand Macbeth, by the midpoint
of the play, probably around when he orders

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.559
the murder of Banquo and his son, we’ve
stopped rooting for Macbeth and his wife to

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:30.680
get away with their crimes.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.520
Instead, we’re hoping they’ll get their
comeuppance, preferably before Macduff’s

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.900
wife and kids are brutally murdered in front
of us.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:37.900
But alas.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.069
Shakespeare keeps the violence offstage until
that scene, then he allows it full rein, which

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:45.460
should shake anyone who still feels sympathy
for Macbeth.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.110
Even the witches now acknowledge his evil.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.180
The next time he approaches them, they say,
“Something wicked this way comes.”

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.919
And as for nameless Lady Macbeth, Holinshed,
in the play’s source material, describes

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:00.650
her as “verie ambitious, burning in unquenchable
desire to beare the name of a quéene.”

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.680
She’s the one spurring him on to murder
when he’s reluctant or frightened or listening

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.770
to his conscience.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.819
In her opinion, at least early in the play,
stabbing a king is no big deal.

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:11.599
/
She even offers to go frame the guards by

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:15.949
smearing them with Duncan’s blood, saying,
“A little water clears us of this deed.”

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:19.509
It’s interesting to see the opposite effects
the murder has on them.

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:24.860
It hardens Macbeth into a serial murderer,
but it softens Lady Macbeth into a victim.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:31.270
Her mind disturbed, she brings to sleepwalk,
miming washing her hands over, desperate for

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.020
the little water to clear her of her deed.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.550
But she can’t get the spot of blood out--not
even after its visibly gone.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:50.740
Instead her guilt seems to drive her to suicide.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.680
To understand more about this dynamic, let’s
look at how the play treats masculinity and

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.680
femininity.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.139
This tragedy has a particular interest in
what it means to be a man, but we get our

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:07.069
first taste of this by characters who don’t
really seem male or female, the witches.

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:11.499
Banquo says to them, “you should be women,/
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret/

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:12.939
That you are so.”

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:16.699
These are the weird sisters, which may be
a corruption of “the wayward sisters,”

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:20.120
and there’s definitely a suggestion that
characters who aren’t identifiable as either

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.649
male or female are destabilizing and upsetting.

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:27.800
This was a period that oppressed gender fluidity,
even though it’s worth noting that theater

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.650
was a place of gender complexity, since male
actors played female roles, and Shakespeare’s

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.669
characters often play with traditional gender
constructions.

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:40.940
We get another example when Lady Macbeth reads
her husband’s letter and starts worrying

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.469
that he won’t be man enough to get himself
the crown.

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:48.400
Knowing he’ll need her help she calls on
spirits to “unsex her”:

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.090
“make thick my blood;
Stop up the access and passage to remorse,

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:58.330
That no compunctious visitings of nature
Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.029
The effect and it!

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:03.710
Come to my woman's breasts,
And take my milk for gall,”

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:04.710
Okay.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:05.710
Wow.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.800
So Lady Macbeth is saying, stop me from menstruating,
stop me from lactating, basically take everything

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.749
about me that’s liquid and feminine and
pliable and make me harder and crueler.

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:18.369
When Macbeth tells her he’s not going to
kill the king, she tells him he’s unmanly.

00:07:18.369 --> 00:07:21.759
“When you durst do it, then you were a man,”
she says.

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:22.759
Ouch.

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:23.759
And it gets worse.

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:27.050
She says that she’s breastfed children (where
those children have gone is the sort of problem

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:32.369
that gives scholars fits) and loved those
children but that she would happily “have

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:37.669
pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,/
And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:39.929
as you/ Have done to this.”

00:07:39.929 --> 00:07:41.439
Again: Wow.

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:45.409
And just a cool poetic meter note: When they’re
having these kinds of arguments, especially

00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:51.050
the one about killing Duncan, many of Macbeth’s
lines have so-called feminine endings (an

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.020
extra syllable in the line) and hers don’t.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.069
/
Because she’s the one behaving in the more

00:07:54.069 --> 00:07:55.069
traditionally macho way.

00:07:55.069 --> 00:07:58.599
So far the play seems to be suggesting that
there’s something cruel and almost unnatural

00:07:58.599 --> 00:08:01.839
about masculinity, about manning up.

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:05.499
And maybe we can see this as another reason
why Macbeth gets so murder-y.

00:08:05.499 --> 00:08:07.839
/
Having committed to such a hard and unyielding

00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:12.309
vision of masculinity like the kind his wife
offers, he doesn’t really know how to soften

00:08:12.309 --> 00:08:13.309
up again.

00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:16.469
But that’s not the only vision of masculinity
that the play provides.

00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:20.270
There’s a scene between Malcolm and Macduff
where Malcolm tries to brag that he’s really

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.249
evil and greedy and lecherous.

00:08:22.249 --> 00:08:26.979
But then he takes it all back, suggesting
that it’s his innocence and even his virginity,

00:08:26.979 --> 00:08:30.860
his unmanliness, that will actually make him
an honorable king.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.800
In that same scene, Macduff learns that his
wife and all of his children have been murdered

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.160
and nice virginal Malcolm tries to tell him,
Lady Macbeth-style, to man up.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.610
“Dispute it like a man,” Malcolm says.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.470
But here’s the difference between Macduff
and Macbeth.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:49.020
Instead of Macbeth going along with his wife’s
toxic vision of masculinity, Macduff finds

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.020
another way.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.020
He says:
/

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.850
“I shall do so
“But I must also feel it as a man:

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:58.320
I cannot but remember such things were,
That were most precious to me.”

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:03.330
Yes, Macduff is not of woman born so you could
argue that he’s the manliest of anyone in

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.590
this play, but his definition of manliness
is different.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.910
It involves fighting, but it also involves
feeling.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:11.000
And loving.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And mourning.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.930
Not that any of this is going to stop him
from cutting off Macbeth’s head at the end.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.400
Let’s look at that ending.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.440
Before the final battle, Macbeth receives
the news that his wife has died and recites

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.440
a soliloquy saying that at this point life
means nothing.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.440
He says:
/

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.270
“Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:37.820
And then is heard no more: it is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:38.940
Signifying nothing.”

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.740
Those beautifully written nihilistic lines
have resonated through the last four hundred

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.350
years--Faulkner titled his most famous book
after them.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.260
/
And here at the end, Macbeth doesn’t seem

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:52.680
anything like the Thane we met at the beginning
of the play--he doesn’t seem worried or

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.200
brave or ambitious or bloodthirsty--just tired.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.570
/
The dagger, the line of kings, Banquo’s

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:02.400
ghost, even his wife’s death--none of it
matters.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.400
And not really the go-getter we got to know
at the top of the play.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.400
He doesn’t seem worried or ambitious or
bloodthirsty, just really, really tired.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.400
The shadows and illusions he’s witnessed—the
dagger, the line of kings, Banquo’s ghost—don’t

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.400
matter.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.400
His wife’s death doesn’t matter.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.400
Nothing matters.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.400
But that’s not going to stop him from going
on one last murderous rampage before his own

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.400
death.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.360
His humanity seems gone and it’s almost
as though he’d like someone to stop him,

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.550
but he can’t bring himself to commit suicide
and he’s worried that no one equals him

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.550
in battle.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:19.550
But surprise!

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:23.620
Macduff is a C-section baby.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:28.250
Even here, at this revelation, Macbeth is
still worrying about his manliness, saying,

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:32.970
“Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,/
For it hath cow'd my better part of man!”

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:35.390
/
Grieving Macduff is more worried about cutting

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:36.790
off his head.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:37.790
Which he does.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.090
/
He presents them to Malcolm who says a fond

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:45.820
farewell to “the dead butcher and his fiendlike
queen.”

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:52.890
Those words don’t describe the Macbeth and
Lady Macbeth we meet early in the play,

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:53.890
/
/

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:54.890
but maybe they do portray the ones who die
in the final act.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.870
Macbeth is a short play and that’s a lot
of change to compass in a couple of hours.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:01.600
At the end, we still don’t really know if
Macbeth’s fall was inevitable, even divinely

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:10.120
ordained, or whether he brought it on himself
through his choices.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.120
/
/

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.760
But one of the reasons Shakespeare’s plays
have hung around is because the best characters

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:20.150
in them aren’t one thing or another--they
aren’t only good or evil, only ambitious

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:23.550
or meek, only weak or strong.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:25.740
/
Macbeth endures because ambition and its costs

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:31.050
endure, and because we are still asking that
old question: Was I doomed to this, or did

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:32.310
I choose it?

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:33.510
Thanks for watching.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:57.610
See you next time.
