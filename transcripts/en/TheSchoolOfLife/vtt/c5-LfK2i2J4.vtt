00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.241
Missions are things we tend to associate with
astronauts. If someone at a party asked you

00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:10.710
what you did, and you said you were involved
on a mission of some kind, people would look

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.910
at you sort of strangely. But in truth, we’d
all benefit from focusing in on the purpose

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.970
of our lives so that we can refer to them
as missions of one kind or another. When the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.070
entrepreneur Elon Musk was at university,
he asked himself very explicitly what his

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.271
mission in life would be. He began by wondering
what the world needed most urgently, then

00:00:35.271 --> 00:00:41.050
he looked into himself to see what his talents
were and that led him to a list of four possible

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.840
missions: space exploration, electric transportation,
Artificial Intelligence and rewriting the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:55.030
human genome. In the end, Elon Musk chose
the first two. Few of us will ever settle

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.260
on missions as mighty as these, but the notion
of having a mission, rather than a mere job

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.890
or hobby, remains widely applicable. How,
then, can we learn to adopt the mission mindset?

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.240
– Firstly, what matters is to adopt a certain
seriousness about one’s life. The working

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.560
bit will only be, at best, 50 years. So the
challenge is around focus: how can one reduce

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.700
the range of one’s enthusiasms and see that
having so many interests is half the problem.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.259
Talk of a mission forces us to reduce what
we care about down to just a few very big

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.100
things: it privileges precision over breadth.
You give yourself a specific target, aware

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.750
of how much energy it will take to reach it.
– Secondly, a mission is about having a

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.950
plan; and reducing the amount of times that,
because one has no clear goal, one gets swept

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.861
along by the plans of others. – Then again,
a mission is different from an ambition. An

00:01:56.861 --> 00:02:03.020
ambition starts with what you want. A mission
centers around what others need. People with

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.369
missions may well end up making money and
having status, but that isn’t what led them

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:16.000
to the mission in the first place. Missions
are about the intrinsic worth of tasks. – The

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.819
search for a mission requires you to ask:
among all the problems facing humanity, what

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:29.120
are the ones that properly interest me? Be
alive to the small-scale but authentic concerns.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.170
– Having focused on a problem of humanity
that feels right for you, you then need to

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.840
take an honest look at your own aptitutes.
What truly are your talents? What can you

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:46.960
contribute? That may require a lot of introspection,
career counselling and experimentation. – Then,

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.200
where your skills and aptitudes intersect
with the needs of the world, that is your

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.129
distinctive zone: that’s where your mission
lies. – A mission isn’t a mission because

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:05.590
it is grand, but because it is precise. Examples
of modest but crucial missions might be: – a

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.050
mission to improve the care that the elderly
receive at the end of their lives – or a

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.239
mission to teach children music in an engaging
way – or a mission to get the best pizzas

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.650
out to the customers of north Liverpool or
downtown San Diego. – Conceiving of a mission

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.390
requires us to throw off an attitude of inner
serfdom, where we imagine that only other

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.060
people have the right to plan their lives
– and everyone else must just surrender

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:38.360
to accidents and random whims of employers.
– We can and should all have missions. With

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.420
a mission in hand, the next time you’re
at a party, you won’t need to keep the conversation

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.720
at the level of where you’re employed, you
can answer with reference to the underlying

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.200
logic of what you are up to. You can, with
no space helmet to your name, legitimately

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.160
announce that you’re in this earth with
a mission to carry out.
