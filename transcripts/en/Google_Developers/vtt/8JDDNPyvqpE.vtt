[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.060
Thank you for betting with
Google and thank you for

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:07.990
supporting us.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.590
We want to empower people to
use technology, naturally.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.010
One million new Android devices
are activated every

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.010
single day.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.555
Android 4.1, Jelly Bean.

00:00:19.555 --> 00:00:24.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.980
Now you might be asking-- well,
Nick, what comes next?

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.220
And the answer there
lies in mobile.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.240
We have more people
using Google+ for

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.060
mobile than from desktop.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.690
Are we going to get a native
tablet version of Google+?

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.790
Well, your answer is, you're
going to get it today.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.450
Today, we're introducing
Nexus 7.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.680
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.710
And here it is-- music, movies,
books, magazines,

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.410
apps, and games.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.117
All the great content from
Google Play, right at your

00:00:58.117 --> 00:00:58.740
fingertips.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.290
Randall is snapping
some photos here.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.390
And you'll notice that there's
a new animation of the photo

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.140
flying out to the right.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.080
Words appear, even though
I don't have

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.650
a connection period.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.460
Who is the prime minister
of Japan?

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.320
DEVICE SPEAKING: The prime
minister of Japan

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.780
is Yoshihiko Noda.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.400
Watch what happens now when
Randall moves that widget to

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.650
this screen.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.660
We've got this newer Storms game
here that you play with

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.020
your brain waves.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.550
And you just click the
button here and--

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.490
DEVICE SPEAKING: Activity
resumed.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.290
We do a thing called sorting by
agony, which is to say that

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.950
we don't strictly sort by price
because we consider your

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:43.970
time worth something.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.000
It's 12-foot tall animatronic
human face.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.240
These flying vehicles are
collaborating to throw a ball

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.555
up in the air and then
collaborating to

00:01:52.555 --> 00:01:54.005
move and catch it.

00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:55.410
And you can create all different
types of events,

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.140
everything from picnics
and barbecues to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.710
weddings and even concerts.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.700
If I wanted to buy one of these,
can I go buy one today

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.440
at the store?

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.770
We hope to make them
affordable.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.060
As I mentioned, this can
be a $100 robot.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.780
You see the familiar
Google search box.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.200
You also see a beautiful header
that changes based on

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.290
your time and location.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.650
And I can also scroll down
and tap on See Inside.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.270
Once I do, I'm inside the bar.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.400
I've got this nice view.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.770
And for an even better
experience, I can turn on

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:24.770
Compass mode.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.460
So why don't you go ahead
and do that, Randall.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.470
And this is the first device
that ships with Chrome as the

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.830
standard browser.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.590
It's pretty cool that my friends
can now play their

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.590
music in my living room.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.620
We created Glass so that you can
interact with the virtual

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.870
world without distracting
you from the real world.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.490
You have to want to be on the
bleeding edge, and that's what

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.740
this is really designed for.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.155
So tell me now-- who wants
to see a demo of Glass?

00:02:52.155 --> 00:02:54.880
[CHEERS]

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.780
All right.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.330
This is the hangout
from Glass.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.264
Whoa!

00:03:00.264 --> 00:03:01.731
Look at that.

00:03:01.731 --> 00:03:04.176
And they're off.

00:03:04.176 --> 00:03:11.022
[CHEERS AND CLAPPING]

00:03:11.022 --> 00:03:12.272
All right.

00:03:19.335 --> 00:03:21.980
Let's see if we can get
it here in a hurry.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.920
Yeah, woohoo!

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.910
Wait, wait, wait, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa,whoa, whoa!

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:28.530
No, no, no we're on the third--

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.882
OK.

00:03:29.882 --> 00:03:32.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.720
Don't run anybody over.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.980
Please stay in your
seats, folks.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.740
Don't get into the aisles.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.810
Yeah, woo!

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.050
And when your boss comes to you
and says, hey, we're going

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.060
to jump out of an airplane.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.110
We're going to land on the roof
of Moscone and then we're

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.210
going to bike it in, you must
be working at Google.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.340
It was really exciting to see
something that magical.
