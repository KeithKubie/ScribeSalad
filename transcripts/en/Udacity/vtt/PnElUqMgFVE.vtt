00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here's a skydiver with the force of mg down and here's the earth with the force of mg up.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This mg is the exact same size as this mg.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So we want to use the mass of the skydiver, 65 kg.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
When we plug in 65 and 10 for g, we find this at 650 N.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now what acceleration does that correspond to?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
If we want to calculate the acceleration of the earth, let's use F = ma.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This is the mass of the earth by the way with subscript e.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If  we want to calculate the acceleration of the earth, we should use F = ma.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And now, this mass is the mass of the earth and our mass is 6x10²⁴.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
If I divide both sides by this mass, I get an acceleration of 1.1x10⁻²² m/s².

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If I use our tried and true motion equation, assume that the earth's initial velocity upward is 0

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and plug in for a and t, I get an answer of 2x10⁻¹⁷ m.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This is way smaller than even a single atom.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So yes, even though they're equal and opposite forces, the earth is so massive

00:01:03.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that the force any individual person exerts on it is totally negligible.
