00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.469
ARE VAMPIRES REAL
Not the sparkling kind, but the drinking blood

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:04.830
to stay young forever kind?

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:13.119
Well science says maybe…

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:14.959
okay science doesn’t actually say that.

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.360
but science has started to notice that blood,
specifically young blood might have rejuvenating

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.360
properties.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.360
Which is just crazy interesting.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.680
But exactly why that is, no one is certain.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.200
Yet one new study points to a new, unknown
molecule.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.039
In this study published in Nature Communications,
scientists found that young blood could heal

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:32.320
broken bones.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.750
Alright so this gets a little.. um… gross.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.010
but scientists conjoined the circulatory systems
of pairs of mice in a process called parabiosis,

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.980
which means living besides.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.550
Basically scientists stitch together the tissues
of two mice, so an old mouse and a younger

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.870
mouse would share a blood supply.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.820
I know, it totally seems like an antiue thing,
and it’s kind of old.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.600
Clive McCay of Cornell University first pioneered
this technique in the 1950s.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.560
but for some reason it’s experiencing a
resurgence.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.790
Yeah I know… a little too much like frankenstein.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.141
But what’s interesting, besides the whole
sewing together mice thing, is that the researchers

00:01:04.141 --> 00:01:08.861
think this means that young blood cells secrete
some molecule or protein that helps heal the

00:01:08.861 --> 00:01:09.861
body.

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:14.060
And as an organism ages, they lose the ability
to make this molecule.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.750
Previously it was thought that GDF-11 a molecule
that circulates throughout blood was the fountain

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.750
of youth.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.780
But a recent study contradicts that finding.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.970
This new study published in the journal Cell
Metabolism found that as mice aged, the more

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.900
of this molecule circulated in the bloodstream.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.720
And as researchers injected aging mice with
this molecule, the worse their muscles repaired

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.720
themselves.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.720
So who knows…

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.160
But even though scientists are still figuring
that out, other studies show that there is

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.000
really something powerful about young blood.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.920
Other studies like one published in the journal
Nature Medicine found that young blood recharged

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.930
the brains of older mice.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.930
Researchers ran mice through standard laboratory
tests after they received an infusion of plasma

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:51.930
from young mice.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.180
They did much better on the tests than older
mice without young blood coursing through

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.180
their veins.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.060
Curiously, that improvement was gone if the
blood had been heated before hand.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.540
Which again suggest there’s something going
on with the proteins in young blood.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.049
Because heat denatures protein, or basically
when they get heated up, they lose their shape

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:09.229
and don’t work as well.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.310
Kind of like ice cream melting on a summer
day.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.200
Other studies also showed how young blood
pumps up older brains.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.450
In one study published in the journal nature,
after being exposed to young blood, the brains

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.330
of older mice looked more like that of a younger
mouse.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.410
Nerve cells in their hippocampi were better
at forming connections, which is basically

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.010
what learning and memory is.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.080
But wait there’s more.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.980
In a similar Frankensteinian experiment, researchers
stitched together older mice with a young

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:33.980
mouse.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.480
They found that the young blood rejuvenated
the hearts of the older mice.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.750
The older mice suffered from cardiac hypertrophy,
a condition which thickens and swells the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.750
heart.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.120
After four weeks of getting young blood from
the other mouse, their hearts shrank to a

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.430
normal size!

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.000
All of these studies sure make you want to
drink a nice tall glass of young blood eh?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.989
Okay yeah, all these studies have been in
mice, but researchers are already trying to

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.550
see what happens in humans.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.930
In October of 2014 researchers at Stanford
University gave transfusions of blood plasma

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.900
donated by people under 30 to older volunteers
with mild to moderate Alzheimer's.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.900
The results?

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.900
We don’t yet.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:31.360
So maybe Dracula had it right all along, but
I guess you could say… more research is

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:46.640
needed.
