00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:05.908
Okay, so in this case, the answer is Y is not allowed to be passed to the child kernel

00:00:05.908 --> 00:00:10.420
because Y is in shared memory, and shared memory is private to a block,

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.399
which means that the launched kernel possessing different blocks will not be

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:18.225
permitted to have access to that shared memory.

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:23.493
Note, in this case, when I created Z, I allocated it from the heap.

00:00:23.493 --> 00:00:28.465
A heap allocation goes in global memory and is therefore permitted to be passed in.

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:35.195
So, X and Z are both in global memory, X being declared at global scope and Z being allocated,

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:38.378
Y is in shared memory and would need to be copied before it's passed in.
