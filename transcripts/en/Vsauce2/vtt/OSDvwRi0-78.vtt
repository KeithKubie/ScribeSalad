00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.299
Microfossils first discovered in Australia
in 1982 -- then thought to be minerals -- have

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:11.000
been re-examined with new techniques showing
carbon-based life existing 3.5 billion years

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.180
ago. The fossils, which are just ⅛ the width
of a human hair, could suggest the common

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.960
presence of life throughout the universe.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.240
And a baby in Tennessee was just born after
her embryo was cryogenically frozen for 24

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.050
years. Which is not only a record but it means
the baby was conceived only a year and a half

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.420
after her mother was born.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:39.570
Vsauce! Kevin here. This is Mind Blow.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.789
Researchers at Georgia Tech are using ultrasound
and machine learning to develop a new way

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:49.969
of controlling prosthetic limbs. This approach
created highly-detailed maps of muscle movements

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.500
which enable the fine control that most prosthetics
lack -- and it’s so effective it’s already

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.360
being referred to as “Luke Skywalker’s
bionic hand.” You may remember from Mind

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.860
Blow #102 that Georgia Tech was also the source
for a robotic ‘Smart Arm’ capable of responding

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.750
and adapting to a drummer’s actions.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.880
A rare form of blindness caused by gene mutation
could soon be treated using gene therapy.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.470
A trial in which a virus was loaded with a
normal copy of the RPE65 gene and then injected

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.190
into the eye resulted in blind patients navigating
a specially-designed obstacle course more

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.640
effectively. Researchers are optimistic, but
they pointed out that the treatment does not

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.280
represent a cure -- they’re unsure how long
the virus will continue to express the normal

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:43.360
RPE65 gene, and although a price hasn’t
been set, one estimate puts it at $1 million.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.920
But regardless of the challenges, the first
gene therapy treatment approved by the FDA

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.060
is a major milestone.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.270
Nanometer-scale CT imagery has allowed us
to see the leg of a tiny newborn velvet worm

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.850
-- FINALLY. Physicists at the Technical University
of Munich have designed a machine using a

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.830
new type of X-ray tube capable of presenting
3D scans of the smallest biological samples.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.390
That worm’s leg is 400 millionths of a millimeter.
This is so beautiful I just wanted to share

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.240
it with you. So there. Okay that’s enough.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.670
Electrical stimulation of the amygdala can
boost your memory -- for a day. At Emory University

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.500
Hospital, Deep Brain Stimulation administered
along with specific images resulted in 79%

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.810
of subjects recalling those images the next
day with gains up to several hundred percent.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.950
Meaning, they remembered it better. So, maybe
the next generation of cramming for a test

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.550
could involved can brain-shocking your way
to an A.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.280
Autonomous Systems Labs’ Maplab is an advanced
visual inertia mapping framework capable of

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.850
generating highly-accurate renderings of new
and old spaces. Basically, it’s a really

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:07.020
advanced, quick way to map and 3D render locations.
ASL’s robot constructs a model of its environment,

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.150
while a separate process handles localization
-- and multiple data sets can be looped together

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.310
to improve accuracy. It seems to me, potential
future applications of this could include

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:27.090
creating rich, accurate virtual reality experiences
or to map tourist destinations. Like the Louvre.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.210
The iCub humanoid robot is constructed to
be like a 4-year old child -- and now that

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.770
it’s been around for more than 10 years,
it’s getting more sophisticated. The iCub

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.240
can now use stereo vision to estimate the
pose and strategy required to grasp unknown

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:47.300
objects with care, which also enables safe,
gentle interactions with humans. Still no

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:54.110
estimates for a C3P0-level sophisticated droid
will be available. But they're workin' on

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.110
it.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.650
AImotive’s full-stack software suite is
poised to enable self-driving cars in any

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.140
weather or driving condition. The AIdrive
suite combines data from four separate engines

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:13.380
-- recognition, location, motion and control
-- to analyze and adjust self-driving action

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.530
in any situation. So instead of using LIDAR
to scan the surroundings, they’re using

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.900
camera sensors to feed data to software which
they say allows for higher resolution information

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.370
and analysis like differentiating a child
from an elderly person. And really the next

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.770
steps are making the system cheaper and more
energy efficient.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.630
Google’s artificial intelligence has discovered
a planet. It used data from NASA's Kepler

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.810
Space Telescope to find Kepler-90i. Which
circles the Sun-like Kepler-90 star every

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.370
14.4 days, and it was discovered by using
machine learning to analyze changes in light

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.250
readings that happen when distant exoplanets
pass in front of a star. Kepler-90i’s surface

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.710
temperature is about 800F, so… it’s hot.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:09.340
The UK’s National Physical Laboratory has
created the world’s smallest Christmas card.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:16.270
At just 15 x 20 micrometers, it's 200 million
times smaller than a postage stamp. When magnified

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:22.360
5,000x, you can see a snowman and “Season’s
Greetings from NPL,” who used an ion beam

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.680
to slice a silicon nitride membrane coated
with platinum to carve the card with incredible

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.680
precision.

Now I’m gonna leave you with FX-2, a giant
human riding robot -- and as always, thanks

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:23.280
for watching.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:29.360
Map-making in the olden days, was like painting
a masterpiece. A slow, laborious and highly-specialized

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:36.210
task. Requiring the utmost skill and patience.
Map-making today has the speed of our modern

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:43.070
stream-lined methods. But it is still a highly-specialized
occupation. The biggest catch in making roadmaps

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.680
is keeping them up-to-date. Modern mapmakers
have solved this by developing a trick method

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:55.080
of printing. Revised maps can be put out every
two weeks. As a rule, these map detectives

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.851
work in pairs. One man driving the car as
the other plots road changes on a special

00:06:59.851 --> 00:07:05.419
chart book. Notations are carefully checked
against special instruments to ensure complete

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:11.259
accuracy. When all this last minute road information
has been transposed to the overlay sheet,

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:17.479
the sheet is removed and placed in a special
vacuum frame. A huge camera then photographs

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:23.479
the overlay onto a glass negative. This negative
is photographically transferred onto a sensitized

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:28.610
zinc plate. Which after having its face washed
in an acid solution, is ready to be inked

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:34.460
and locked on the press. This press swiftly
overprints the detour symbols onto the latest

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:40.610
standard roadmaps. These, in turn, are automatically
cut and folded to the proper size, ready to

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:49.950
give folks a good steer. Yes, mapmaking has
changed. Has kept pace with a changing America.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:54.430
Modern maps guide us over the modern roads
of the land. Over great super highways such

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:59.900
as the famous new Pennsylvania Turnpike. Modern
maps taking today's motorists where they want

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:05.150
to go, when they want to go. Quickly, comfortably
and safely.
