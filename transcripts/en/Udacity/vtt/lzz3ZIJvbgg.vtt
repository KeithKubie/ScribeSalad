00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.610
Okay, let's do this exercise together.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.370
David, what did you come up with
the labels with the various links?

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.520
&gt;&gt; So, I looked at the vocabulary
we used over here and

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.130
decided to use the same
vocabulary over here.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.430
Just like z was above both x and
y, t is above both s and r.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.790
So, I said t is above s and
t is above r.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.112
Just like y was inside x, s is inside r.

00:00:23.112 --> 00:00:25.213
So I said that s is inside r.

00:00:25.213 --> 00:00:28.162
Over here I saw that s is above r,

00:00:28.162 --> 00:00:33.210
just like y was above x,
so I said s is above r.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.620
&gt;&gt; Now David made
an important point here,

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.950
he said that the vocabulary
he's using here of inside and

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.200
above is the same as the vocabulary that
I had used of inside and above here.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.810
And that's a good point because we
want to have a consistent vocabulary

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.640
throughout the representation for
the class of problems.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.530
So here we have decided that for
representing problems of this kind

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.300
in semantic network we will use
a vocabulary of inside and above and

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.740
we'll try to use it consistently.
