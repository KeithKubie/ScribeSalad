00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.819
Disney has made some of the greatest films
of all time.

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.200
From Mickey Mouse to Marvel to Star Wars,
Disney seems to be behind pretty much everything

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.520
that kids grow up loving to watch.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.400
There are perhaps no Disney characters more
iconic than the Disney Princesses who represent

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.170
all that is good in this world.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.230
There is a lot that is known about these Princesses
but there are some facts that deserved to

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.630

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.829
Elsa
If the words “Elsa”, “Frozen” or “Let

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.620
It Go” doesn’t ring a bell in your mind,
you have probably been living under a rock

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.609
since at least 2013.

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.179
The story follows Elsa and Anna on their snowy
adventures and Frozen is actually the first

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:55.149
movie to feature sibling Princesses.

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.920
Also, Elsa, who is supposed to be 21 in the
movie, is the oldest Disney Princess and the

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.239
only non-teenager of the official lineup.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.250
Elsa’s blonde flowing hair is now a huge
part of her image but it turns out that she

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.140
wasn’t always supposed to looks that way.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.500
Apparently, the concept art for Elsa had her
with short, spiky, black hair that gave her

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.670
a more edgy and alternative look.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.350
In the end, the blonde hair turned out great
and we can’t imagine Elsa any other way!

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.060
Snow White
Released all the way back in 1937, Snow White

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.840
was the first feature length animated Disney
Movie the world got to see.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.320
It comes as no surprise then that Snow White
was the first official Disney Princess but

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.259
what some fans may not know is that she also
remains the youngest Disney Princess of all

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.020
time at the age of only 14.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.720
This young age was less weird in the 1930’s
but looking back now it seems a bit creepy

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:51.649
to have a super young teenager living alone
in the woods and then kissing a prince.

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.009
Sleeping Beauty
Sleeping beauty or Aurora was one of the first

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.380
official Disney Princesses that the world
got to fall in love with.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.819
It seems like the creator of the movie may
have had a weird obsession with the number

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:02.819
eighteen.

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:03.819
What do we mean?

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.149
Well in the film Aurora actually only manages
18 minutes of screen time, the least of any

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.440
Disney Princess.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.940
Additionally, Aurora only speaks 18 lines
of dialogue in the entire film, which is the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.500
least by any lead character in a Disney film.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.720
And would you like to guess how old Sleeping
Beauty is meant to be in her movie?

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.740
If you guessed 18…you are correct.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.100
We’re not sure if this number means anything
but it’s definitely a fun fact!

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.600
Belle
Beauty And The Beast is one of the greatest

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.050
films that Disney has ever made, animated
or otherwise and the whole world is excited

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.020
to see Emma Watson take on the role of Belle
in the 2017 live adaption of the story.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.700
There are a lot of things that make Belle
a unique Disney Princess such as a the fact

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.340
that she is the one to have her film nominated
for the Best Picture Academy Award and she

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.930
is the only Princess who has Hazel eyes.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.850
One secret fact that many fans may not know
about Belle however is that she originally

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.200
had a younger sister, Clarice, who was not
in the final version of the movie because

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:09.590
the writers wanted to place a greater emphasis
on Belle’s loneliness.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.680
Cinderella
Cinderella is one of the more iconic Disney

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.630
Princesses to ever come to the screen and
she was the first Princess to be given a live

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.680
Disney adaption in 2015.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.390
We have heard stories of multiple actors trying
out for an iconic role before but did you

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.660
know that more than 400 actors auditioned
to be the voice of Cinderella for the 1950

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.660
animated film.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.260
In the end Ilene Woods won the role and her
but it looks like Disney could have used some

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.000
of those other actors to help film a scene
that fans never got to see.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.110
In a deleted scene from the film, Cinderella
dreams of an army of Cinderella’s to do

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.020
her chores and we think it could have been
cool to have given them different voices.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.160
Jasmine
In the Disney classic, Aladdin, Jasmine is

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.600
the beautiful and cunning princess that ends
up falling for the street rat.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.560
Jasmine is unique for a few reasons such as
the facts that her main outfit is not a dress

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.730
and that she is the only Princess who’s
name is not the title of her film but something

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.170
a lot of fans won’t know is that Jasmine
was originally going to be named Badroulbadour,

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.960
after the princess who marries Aladdin in
Arabian Nights.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.530
This would have been a nice shout out to authenticity,
but Jasmine seemed like a much easier name

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.880
for kids to remember.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.639
Another interesting fact about Jasmine was
that she was actually the first Disney Princess

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.560
to have separate speaking and singing voice
actors, something that has become common practice

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.940
in the Disney movies ever since.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.250
Merida
Disney released Brave in 2012 and introduced

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.080
the world to the badass archer princess, Merida.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.530
With her fiery red hair and spunky personality
there is no doubt that Merida was designed

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:44.640
by Disney to be a positive and inspiring role
model for young girls.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.640
Need more proof?

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.560
Well, Merida was actually the first Disney
Princess without a love interest in her film

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.700
– talk about making a statement.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.990
Merida’s creation turned out to be just
as complex as her personality as the animators

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:02.140
reported that her iconic curly red hairdo
is made up of 111,700 hairs that were generated

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.140
from over 1500 individually sculpted models.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.570
The movie was a big-time hit, so it looks
like the hard work was worth it!

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.160
Rapunzel
In 2010, Tangled took the world by storm with

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.880
it’s creative and refreshing telling of
the classic Rapunzel fairy tale.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.540
There were new characters and plot points
but the movie made sure to keep the classic

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.710
story aspects intact, such as Rapunzel’s
iconic long hair.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.840
Fans have often wondered just how long the
golden blonde hair really is and Disney has

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.670
released an answer of 70 feet long, easily
the longest hair of any of the Disney Princesses.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.930
An interesting fact about Rapunzel though
is that fter having her hair is cut in the

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.010
film she then becomes the Disney Princess
with the shortest hair of all time, taking

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.430
the spot away from Snow White.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.610
Pocahontas
When Disney dropped the movie Pocahontas in

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.120
1995 they have the world some of the greatest
songs and action in any Disney animated film.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.800
The cool thing about Pocahontas is that she
is the only Disney Princess who was actually

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.650
a real person, even though the film took some
serious liberties with her story and her age.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.170
Many people believe that Pocahontas was the
first Native American princess to be shown

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:13.500
in a Disney film, but those people are unfortunately
forgetting about Tiger Lily from Peter Pan,

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:24.740
who may not be an official Disney Princess,
but is a princess in the film all the same.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.680
Princess Leia
Although she is not on the official Disney

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.210
Princess lineup, Princess Leia is absolutely
a Princess and Disney does now own the rights

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.520
to Star Wars, so why not!

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.860
The late Carrie Fisher was absolutely iconic
in the role and it was an absolute joy to

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.080
see her reprise it in 2015’s The Force Awakens.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.669
But many people don’t know that George Lucas
considered and even tested several dozen actresses

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:48.020
for the part of Leia.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.150
Jodie Foster was an early front-runner, and
everyone from Glenn Close to Meryl Streep

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.620
tried out for the part.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.960
In the end, Fisher landed the role and rest
is history.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.520
Although she has recently passed away, the
world will be lucky enough to see her one

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:10.090
last time as she had already finished filming
her scenes for 2017’s Episode 8.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.480

Disney Princesses that kids should know about!
