00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.700
A new social media site
boasts that its user base

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.080
has increased 47% each
month for the past year.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.926
The number of users on January
1st of last year was 50,000.

00:00:13.926 --> 00:00:15.800
Which expression below
gives the total number

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.430
of new users in thousands
that were added through month

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.124
n of the past year, where 1 is
less than or equal to n, which

00:00:21.124 --> 00:00:22.290
is less than or equal to 12.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.570
And they give us some
choices of expressions

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.900
for the total
number of new users

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.960
that were added through month n.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.090
And I encourage you to
now pause this video

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.250
and try to think about
which of these expressions

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.121
actually show that,
that gives that value.

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:40.620
Well to tackle it, I'm going
to make a little bit of a table

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.510
here.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:50.060
So let's say we have month, and
then we have starting users--

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.110
so users at the
start-- and then let's

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.150
think about the users added.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.810
I want to give myself
some space to work with.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.960
And then users at
the end of the month.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.740
So in month 1, which is
January we can assume,

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.464
we started with 50,000 users.

00:01:10.464 --> 00:01:12.380
They want us to write
the expression in 1,000.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.940
So we started with 50,000 users.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.230
And how many did we add?

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.530
Well we added 47% of 50,000.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.160
So 50 times 47%.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.700
So times 0.47.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.270
So how many do we end with?

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.980
Well 50 plus 50
times 0.47, that's

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:37.120
going to be 50 times-- I'm gonna
do the 50 in green-- that's

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.070
going to be 50 times 1.47.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.760
If this isn't clear,
just think about this.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.550
This you could
rewrite as 50 times 1.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.160
So 50 times 1 plus
50 times 0.47,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.680
that's going to be
50 times 1 plus 0.47.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.070
Or 1.47.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.640
So it's going to be this
thing right over here.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.970
So now let's go to month 2.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.080
We start with what we
ended the last month.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.419
So I could just copy
and paste this actually.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:11.880
Let me just do that.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.770
So copy and paste.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.410
So that's what we start with.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.540
Now what are we going to add?

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.040
Well we're going to add
this, what we started with,

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:30.789
times 0.47.

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:32.330
And so what are we
going to end with?

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.520
Well if you sum these two-- and
you could write it this way--

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:48.680
this is going to be
this thing times 1.47.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.280
Or we could just write this
is 50 times 1.47 squared.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.390
And you might start
seeing a pattern now.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.310
Let's go to month 3.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.130
So month 3: what do we
start the month with?

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.370
We start the month
with this thing.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.640
Let me copy and paste this.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.410
So, copy and paste.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.570
We start with that.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.425
What do we add?

00:03:13.425 --> 00:03:15.660
Well we're going to
take that, and we're

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.340
going to multiply it times 47%.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.674
We're going to
multiply it times 0.47.

00:03:23.674 --> 00:03:25.340
And so what are we
going to end up with?

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.180
We're gonna have this times
1 plus this times 0.47.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:41.800
That is going to be equal
to that times 1.471.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.430
Or we could just write this as
50 times 1.47 to the 3rd power.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.010
So what's the pattern here?

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.620
Well in each month, we're
going to be starting

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.710
with 50 times 1.47 to a
power 1 less than the month.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.410
In the third month,
the power here is 2.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.400
In the second month,
the power here is 1.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.670
In the first month, the
power here-- you don't see it

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.350
but you can view this as
times 1.47 to the 0 power.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.770
So 1st month, 0 power.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.900
Third month, you
have the 1st power.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.494
Third month, you have the
second power over here.

00:04:18.494 --> 00:04:19.910
So if we're thinking
about the nth

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:31.620
month this is going to
be 50 times 1.47 to the n

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.384
minus 1th power, is what we're
going to start the month with.

00:04:37.384 --> 00:04:39.300
Now what are we going
to add in the nth month?

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.050
Well it's going to
be that times 47%.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.660
So it's going to be--
we'll just copy and paste

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.360
that-- so it's going
to be that times 47%.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.494
Times 0.47.

00:04:57.494 --> 00:04:59.160
And then, what are
we going to end with?

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.080
Well when you add
these two things,

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.949
you are going to get
50-- I'll just do it

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.240
in the right colors instead
of copying and pasting it--

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:18.035
you're going to get 50
times 1.47 to the nth power.

00:05:18.035 --> 00:05:19.660
So let's think about
how we can come up

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.590
with the expression for the
total number of new users

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.340
in thousands that were
added through month n.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.430
So there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.480
You could say, well how
many total new users

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.870
did we have at the
end of month n?

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.620
Well at the end of month
n, we had that many.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.130
And then how many did we have
at the beginning of the year?

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.630
Well we have 50,000.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.400
So how many total new users
did we add through month n.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.190
So we finished with this much.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.260
Let me just write it down.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:56.200
So we just finished
with that much.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.020
And let me paste that.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.740
So that's what we finished with.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:07.050
And we started
with 50,000 users.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.750
So this is essentially how
many we added through month n.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.360
Now do any of our
expressions look like that?

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.950
Well, no not quite.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.220
If this one had a minus
50 right over here,

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.790
if that said minus 50, then
that would've done the trick,

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.570
but this doesn't do it.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.484
And none of the others really
seem to either have this form

00:06:23.484 --> 00:06:24.900
or seem to be
something that would

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.600
be very easy to
manipulate in this form.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.240
So that's one way to do it, but
that's not one of our choices.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.120
So what's another way
of thinking about it.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.940
Well, we could literally
just add how many new users

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.460
we added month by month.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.700
So we literally could just
add all of these things

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:40.560
right over here.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:51.480
So let's see, we could literally
just add all of these terms.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.150
But let me simplify
it a little bit.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.790
So what are some common factors
that we see in all of these?

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.410
Well we see they all have a 50.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.480
And they all have something
being multiplied by 0.47.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.520
So let's factor out
a 0.47 and a 50.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.665
So let's factor that out.

00:07:08.665 --> 00:07:10.290
So this is going to
be equal to-- if we

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:19.000
were to sum all this up-- it's
going to be 0.47 times 50.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.550
And then what's left over?

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.420
Times-- so in the first
month, if you factor those

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.390
two things out, you're going
to just be left with a 1.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.780
In the second month if you
factor out the 50 and the 0.47,

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.470
you're left with 1.47.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:38.780
In the third month, if you
factor that and that out,

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.596
you're left with 1.47 squared.

00:07:41.596 --> 00:07:43.720
And we're going to go all
the way to the nth month.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.345
If you factor out
that and that, you're

00:07:45.345 --> 00:07:50.556
left with 1.47 to the
n minus 1th power.

00:07:50.556 --> 00:07:52.430
So which of those
expressions look like that?

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:57.160
Well this is exactly the second
expression right over here.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.930
This is exactly what
we came up with.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.810
And we're done.
