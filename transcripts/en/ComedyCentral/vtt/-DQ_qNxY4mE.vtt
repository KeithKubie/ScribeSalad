00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:05.071
Now, the 2016 Summer Olympics
are in full swing,

00:00:05.104 --> 00:00:07.407
which means sports fans
have lots to celebrate

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.675
and argue about online.
So here to fill us in

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:12.345
on who deserves gold and groans
this week

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:15.882
with another installment
of Hash It Out.

-(bird tweets)

00:00:21.353 --> 00:00:22.522
Thanks, Larry.

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:25.124
This year's U.S. women's
gymnastics team

00:00:25.157 --> 00:00:29.262
made us all proud by taking home
the gold for team all-around.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:32.532
(cheering and applause)

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:35.868
But before we could even start
celebrating this epic win,

00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:38.271
Twitter had a meltdown
because Gabby Douglas

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:40.106
didn't put her hand
over her heart

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:41.441
during the national anthem.

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:43.376
Take a look
at some of these tweets.

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:45.878
"If Gabby Douglas
is not patriotic enough

00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:49.082
"to honor her country then she
needs to find another sponsor

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:50.750
and go home with them."

00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:52.418
Not patriotic enough?

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:54.420
Homegirl literally did
backflips wearing

00:00:54.453 --> 00:00:59.425
our nation's flag
covered in rhinestones.

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:01.494
And I don't care
what you say, sir,

00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:03.496
there is nothing more patriotic

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:06.466
than a choreographed tribute
to the Bedazzler.

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:15.374
"How dare Gabby Douglas
not put her hand on her heart

00:01:15.407 --> 00:01:17.477
"for the American
national anthem!

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.480
#KickGabbyOutOfTheOlympics."

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:21.814
(groaning, laughter)

00:01:21.847 --> 00:01:23.616
Kick her out of the Olympics?

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.853
Ugh, there's no way
this guy could get any worse.

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:29.589
Or so I thought until I saw
his Twitter profile.

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:32.992
(groaning, laughter)

00:01:33.025 --> 00:01:36.329
But I guess I'm not surprised
that a Trump supporter wants

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:39.665
to deport a brown person doing
work he's not qualified to do.

00:01:39.698 --> 00:01:41.634
(cheering and applause)

00:01:45.704 --> 00:01:48.674
Look, she's
completely showing respect

00:01:48.707 --> 00:01:51.477
by standing there proudly
during the national anthem.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.279
How 'bout you show some respect

00:01:53.312 --> 00:01:54.947
for somebody
who made it possible

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.750
for the national anthem to be
playing in the first place?

00:01:57.783 --> 00:01:59.719
(cheering and applause)

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:06.559
And maybe, maybe Gabby's arms
were tired.

00:02:06.592 --> 00:02:08.761
Do you know
how much energy you expend

00:02:08.794 --> 00:02:11.964
doing (bleep) Olympic-level
gymnastics?

00:02:11.997 --> 00:02:16.269
Hell, this is me after walking
up four flights of stairs.

00:02:19.538 --> 00:02:23.042
(applause)

00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:26.646
But the national anthem backlash
wasn't even the worst of it.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.781
Twitter took the gold medal
in petty

00:02:28.814 --> 00:02:31.584
when people started dragging
Gabby for her hair.

00:02:31.617 --> 00:02:35.254
"I just want a black girl to do
Gabby Douglas' hair, bro.

00:02:35.287 --> 00:02:37.590
That's it." Guess what, bro,

00:02:37.623 --> 00:02:40.560
a black girl did Gabby's hair,
Gabby.

00:02:42.628 --> 00:02:45.731
"How does Gabby Douglas' mother
even let her be

00:02:45.764 --> 00:02:49.001
on national television with
those edges looking like that?"

00:02:49.034 --> 00:02:52.538
"Gabby Douglas got money
and them edges horrible!"

00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:55.141
No, what's horrible
is them grammar you got.

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:57.110
(cheering and applause)

00:02:59.511 --> 00:03:01.080
Okay.

00:03:01.113 --> 00:03:03.749
Let me just explain edges.

00:03:03.782 --> 00:03:06.285
"Edges" is another word
for "hairline."

00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:09.288
And when it comes to black women
and hair, edges are a big deal.

00:03:09.321 --> 00:03:11.157
Do you have them?
Did Beyonchés...

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.160
Beyoncé snatch them
with her fierceness?

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:16.295
It's pretty serious stuff.

00:03:16.328 --> 00:03:18.965
So why are people criticizing
Gabby's edges?

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:20.499
Well, according to Twitter,

00:03:20.532 --> 00:03:22.835
they don't look nice enough
for the Olympics.

00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:26.239
Gabby's competing in
the Olympics, not a hair show.

00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:28.274
You try doing
the uneven bars routine

00:03:28.307 --> 00:03:29.909
with a helicopter on your head.

00:03:29.942 --> 00:03:31.844
(laughter, applause)

00:03:31.877 --> 00:03:34.514
It's nearly impossible.

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:38.718
If Gabby...

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:41.787
If Gabby was worried
about keeping her edges laid,

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.222
she wouldn't be at the Olympics.

00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:45.491
She'd be on the couch
talking (bleep) with you.

00:03:45.524 --> 00:03:47.093
(laughter)

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:50.063
(cheers and applause)

00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:57.003
You at home,
she at the Olympics.

00:03:57.036 --> 00:04:00.973
Plus, your hairline's bound
to get a little fuzzy

00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:03.442
when you're breaking a sweat
and breaking world records.

00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:04.944
WILMORE:
All right.

00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:07.146
Franchesca Ramsey, everybody.

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:10.650
-We'll be right back.
-(cheers and applause)
