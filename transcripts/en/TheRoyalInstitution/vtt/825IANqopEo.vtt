00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:18.000
This is Baikonur, the world's first and
largest operational spaceport.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.989
The story of Baikonur begins in the early years of the
20th century when a small village

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:27.980
called Tyuratam was founded to service the
Moscow to Tashkent railway

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.200
This unforgiving corner of the world where
the winters are blisteringly cold,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.150
the summer's searingly hot and even small
breezes can whip up dust storms over

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.400
the endless planes proved to be the
perfect location for the proposed Soviet

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.280
rocket testing facility. This is where
the world's first satellite, sputnik, was

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.379
launched in 1957 where
the world's first space dog Laika

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.390
started her space journey and where Yuri Gagarin made history by becoming the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.859
first man in space. 
While initially no more than a temporary military

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.800
installation, Tyuratam was quickly
built up into a town to support the Cosmodrome.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.940
They built living quarters for the
workers and their families, schools,

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.310
and infrastructure to sustain a growing
population.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.070
The Cosmodrome was named Baikonur after
a small mining town over 400 kilometers

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.600
away from Tyuratam, allegedly to confuse
and mislead their Cold War rivals, the United States.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.509
The rules didn't quite
work as the USA could establish the

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.130
launch location based on the rocket
trajectory and later even found the town

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.100
using an observation jet by simply
following the railroad and seeing where it led.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.460
Nevertheless, the town remained
locked down for decades and has only

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.200
recently opened up to allow admission to
tourists and space aficionados.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.100
But what's next for Baikonur? Russia has an
agreement with Kazakhstan to use the

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.170
Cosmodrome until 2050 but also has plans
to build a new site in Vostochny

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.159
in the Russian Far East by 2018. Kazakhstan Space Agency is hopeful that

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.220
a new development of a launch complex
called Baiterek will revitalize the area

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.830
ensuring the ongoing launch program of
satellites and commercial flights.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.420
The legacy of the world's first and largest
spaceport will live on.
