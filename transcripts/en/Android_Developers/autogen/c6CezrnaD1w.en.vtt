common terminology and for resolution is
closely related to screen density but is

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919
closely related to screen density but is
 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:02.950
closely related to screen density but is
really talking about the total number of

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960
really talking about the total number of
 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.930
really talking about the total number of
physical pixel on the screen so is when

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940
physical pixel on the screen so is when
 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.670
physical pixel on the screen so is when
we talk about screen density and

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680
we talk about screen density and
 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.010
we talk about screen density and
resolution is really there in

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020
resolution is really there in
 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.800
resolution is really there in
proportional so the higher the screen

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810
proportional so the higher the screen
 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.629
proportional so the higher the screen
density the higher the resolution so so

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639
density the higher the resolution so so
 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:21.909
density the higher the resolution so so
what is the problem with pixel um

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919
what is the problem with pixel um
 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:25.059
what is the problem with pixel um

well turn out thanks I'll have many
 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.059
well turn out thanks I'll have many
meanings and what I'm what I really mean

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:46.069
meanings and what I'm what I really mean
 

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:48.610
meanings and what I'm what I really mean
by that is like let's go to the pixel by

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:48.620
by that is like let's go to the pixel by
 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.890
by that is like let's go to the pixel by
the definition of pixel is really based

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900
the definition of pixel is really based
 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.950
the definition of pixel is really based
on a contraction of X which is coming

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960
on a contraction of X which is coming
 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.439
on a contraction of X which is coming
from picture and the eeo is coming from

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:56.449
from picture and the eeo is coming from
 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:01.269
from picture and the eeo is coming from
element so is really element of the

00:07:01.269 --> 00:07:01.279
element so is really element of the
 

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:04.180
element so is really element of the
smallest addressable element of it for

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.190
smallest addressable element of it for
 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.719
smallest addressable element of it for
display but then when we talk about

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:07.729
display but then when we talk about
 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:11.110
display but then when we talk about
printer our pixel can be a an ink

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120

union or carbon particles so as you can
 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.629
union or carbon particles so as you can
see the many different meanings based on

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639
see the many different meanings based on
 

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:20.020
see the many different meanings based on
the context and the in-camera pixel is

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.030
the context and the in-camera pixel is
 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.019
the context and the in-camera pixel is
really represent an image sensor element

00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:23.029
really represent an image sensor element
 

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:27.459
really represent an image sensor element
so so is really am given meaning depends

00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:27.469
so so is really am given meaning depends
 

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:29.980
so so is really am given meaning depends

to know more about the detail of pixel

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:46.490
to know more about the detail of pixel
 

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.659
to know more about the detail of pixel
unit you can go to Wikipedia to follow

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:49.669
unit you can go to Wikipedia to follow
 

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:54.189

even more detail so now we have a

00:07:54.189 --> 00:07:54.199
even more detail so now we have a
 

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:57.610
even more detail so now we have a
density independent pixel so the key

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:57.620
density independent pixel so the key
 

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.300
density independent pixel so the key
here is DP is really a physical length

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:01.310
here is DP is really a physical length
 

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:06.189
here is DP is really a physical length
unit so um just like centimeter or meter

00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:06.199
unit so um just like centimeter or meter
 

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:10.749

so if it had a physical length in in the

00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:10.759
so if it had a physical length in in the
 

00:08:10.759 --> 00:08:15.459
so if it had a physical length in in the
real world um and of course like one

00:08:15.459 --> 00:08:15.469
real world um and of course like one
 

00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:19.839

actually the IP as a shorthand but then

00:08:22.959 --> 00:08:22.969
actually the IP as a shorthand but then
 

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:25.269
actually the IP as a shorthand but then
now is the DP and the IPS from

00:08:25.269 --> 00:08:25.279
now is the DP and the IPS from
 

00:08:25.279 --> 00:08:27.550
now is the DP and the IPS from
interchangeable and and you can still

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:27.560
interchangeable and and you can still
 

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.899
interchangeable and and you can still
find things in in your layout with both

00:08:31.899 --> 00:08:31.909
find things in in your layout with both
 

00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:37.060
find things in in your layout with both
shorthand think so is also a physical

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:37.070
shorthand think so is also a physical
 

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.819
shorthand think so is also a physical
point but then it doesn't have a fixed

00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:39.829
point but then it doesn't have a fixed
 

00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:45.689
point but then it doesn't have a fixed
dimension so it varies depends on a

00:08:45.689 --> 00:08:45.699
dimension so it varies depends on a
 

00:08:45.699 --> 00:08:50.230

so we have a definition or a formula to

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:03.670
so we have a definition or a formula to
 

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:08.500
so we have a definition or a formula to
transfer the translate between pixel and

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:08.510
transfer the translate between pixel and
 

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.710
transfer the translate between pixel and
DP and and in the former is here is a

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:11.720
DP and and in the former is here is a
 

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.639
DP and and in the former is here is a
pixel is equivalent to DP side times the

00:09:15.639 --> 00:09:15.649

things like that and so so that's why it

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:32.600
things like that and so so that's why it
 

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.320
things like that and so so that's why it
depends and that actually makes this

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:35.330
depends and that actually makes this
 

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.240
depends and that actually makes this
coming exercise easy because now

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:38.250
coming exercise easy because now
 

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:43.130
coming exercise easy because now
um I specify the density of this sh t di

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:43.140
um I specify the density of this sh t di
 

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:47.420
um I specify the density of this sh t di
device to 320 and of course the answer

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:47.430
device to 320 and of course the answer
 

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:53.950
device to 320 and of course the answer
here is to pixel oh ok so another

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:53.960
here is to pixel oh ok so another
 

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.230
here is to pixel oh ok so another
exercise so what are the dimensions in

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:57.240
exercise so what are the dimensions in
 

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.730
exercise so what are the dimensions in
DP for the following rectangle so if you

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:01.740
DP for the following rectangle so if you
 

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:06.200
DP for the following rectangle so if you
look at the these are rectangles and if

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:06.210
look at the these are rectangles and if
 

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:10.790
look at the these are rectangles and if
you remember our definition of of a DP

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800
you remember our definition of of a DP
 

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.950
you remember our definition of of a DP
which is a live I actually put the

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:12.960
which is a live I actually put the
 

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.820
which is a live I actually put the
formula up there for convenience and if

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:16.830
formula up there for convenience and if
 

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:22.180
formula up there for convenience and if
you remember on the MDP is the baseline

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:22.190
you remember on the MDP is the baseline
 

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:27.410
you remember on the MDP is the baseline
which is 160 ah the answer is will be

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:27.420
which is 160 ah the answer is will be
 

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:31.760
which is 160 ah the answer is will be
obvious and the answer is for DP and

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:31.770
obvious and the answer is for DP and
 

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:35.600
obvious and the answer is for DP and
because we are in for the for the

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:35.610
because we are in for the for the
 

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:39.050
because we are in for the for the
rectangle for the MTP I we have four

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:39.060
rectangle for the MTP I we have four
 

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:44.300
rectangle for the MTP I we have four
pixels of on each side and and and

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:44.310
pixels of on each side and and and
 

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:46.490
pixels of on each side and and and
because that's the baseline and we have

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:46.500
because that's the baseline and we have
 

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.850
because that's the baseline and we have
four pixels and the answer and then that

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:49.860
four pixels and the answer and then that
 

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:55.810
four pixels and the answer and then that
makes the answer for DP okay so um

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:55.820
makes the answer for DP okay so um
 

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.010
makes the answer for DP okay so um
another thing I want to talk about is

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:58.020
another thing I want to talk about is
 

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.280
another thing I want to talk about is
the DPI ratio because as you can see

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:01.290
the DPI ratio because as you can see
 

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:05.500
the DPI ratio because as you can see
from the formula is really the current

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:05.510
from the formula is really the current
 

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:10.220
from the formula is really the current
density of your device / 160 and and

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:10.230
density of your device / 160 and and
 

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:13.370
density of your device / 160 and and
because of the and there are actually

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:13.380
because of the and there are actually
 

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.850
because of the and there are actually
ratio between all these different

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:15.860
ratio between all these different
 

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:21.110
ratio between all these different
density and just a just a convenient

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120
density and just a just a convenient
 

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.980
density and just a just a convenient
thing to remember this slide is 3 24 26

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:24.990
thing to remember this slide is 3 24 26
 

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:28.940
thing to remember this slide is 3 24 26
28 so you can use on this ratio easily

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:28.950
28 so you can use on this ratio easily
 

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:33.020
28 so you can use on this ratio easily
to do the proper conversion to get a

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:33.030
to do the proper conversion to get a
 

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:37.130
to do the proper conversion to get a
pixel or DPS are based on these logic

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:37.140
pixel or DPS are based on these logic
 

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:44.000
pixel or DPS are based on these logic
ratios okay so let's talk about the

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:44.010
ratios okay so let's talk about the
 

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:48.560
ratios okay so let's talk about the
problem of using pixel r PX in your in

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:48.570
problem of using pixel r PX in your in
 

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:51.950
problem of using pixel r PX in your in
your layout so here is an example

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:51.960
your layout so here is an example
 

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.880
your layout so here is an example
of the effect of divining a two-by-two

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:55.890
of the effect of divining a two-by-two
 

00:13:55.890 --> 00:14:00.050
of the effect of divining a two-by-two
box in pixel in your layout so as you

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:00.060
box in pixel in your layout so as you
 

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:04.070
box in pixel in your layout so as you
can see if you do if you define

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:04.080
can see if you do if you define
 

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.550
can see if you do if you define
something are with pixel in the LDP I

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:07.560
something are with pixel in the LDP I
 

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:13.690
something are with pixel in the LDP I
device it occupies the entire rectangle

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:13.700
device it occupies the entire rectangle
 

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.760
device it occupies the entire rectangle
but in but as as you move to different

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:16.770
but in but as as you move to different
 

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:20.060
but in but as as you move to different
devices you see the graph are the box

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:20.070
devices you see the graph are the box
 

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:24.140
devices you see the graph are the box
actually is shrinking because you define

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:24.150
actually is shrinking because you define
 

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.110
actually is shrinking because you define
things in pixel and and in the higher

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120
things in pixel and and in the higher
 

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.920
things in pixel and and in the higher
density device the pixel is actually

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:30.930
density device the pixel is actually
 

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.790
density device the pixel is actually
smaller and that's the reason why things

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800
smaller and that's the reason why things
 

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:40.130
smaller and that's the reason why things
are not scaled properly in in when you

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:40.140
are not scaled properly in in when you
 

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:44.720
are not scaled properly in in when you
define things in pixel so now let's take

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:44.730
define things in pixel so now let's take
 

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:47.330
define things in pixel so now let's take
a look at about the effect when you

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:47.340
a look at about the effect when you
 

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:51.580
a look at about the effect when you
define things in DP so in this case

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:51.590
define things in DP so in this case
 

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:56.380
define things in DP so in this case
because you define on things in DP and

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:56.390
because you define on things in DP and
 

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.990
because you define on things in DP and
as I mentioned before and hopefully you

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000
as I mentioned before and hopefully you
 

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.290
as I mentioned before and hopefully you
already remember DP is a fee is a

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:03.300
already remember DP is a fee is a
 

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.340
already remember DP is a fee is a
physical or length unit so if you define

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:07.350
physical or length unit so if you define
 

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:14.000
physical or length unit so if you define
something a2dp on the representation

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:14.010
something a2dp on the representation
 

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:17.780
something a2dp on the representation
across different resolution is the same

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:17.790
across different resolution is the same
 

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:21.050
across different resolution is the same
is going to be same um and that's and

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:21.060
is going to be same um and that's and
 

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:24.320
is going to be same um and that's and
that's what we we meant by a resolution

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:24.330
that's what we we meant by a resolution
 

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:30.890
that's what we we meant by a resolution
independent ok so what about big big map

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:30.900
independent ok so what about big big map
 

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.940
independent ok so what about big big map
assets so the android framework actually

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:34.950
assets so the android framework actually
 

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:37.940
assets so the android framework actually
is quite intelligent and it will scale

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:37.950
is quite intelligent and it will scale
 

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:41.180
is quite intelligent and it will scale
bitmapped Horrible's appropriately when

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:41.190
bitmapped Horrible's appropriately when
 

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:45.980
bitmapped Horrible's appropriately when
using DP but there's a big caveat here

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:45.990
using DP but there's a big caveat here
 

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:50.930
using DP but there's a big caveat here
um the this the graphics here is as you

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:50.940
um the this the graphics here is as you
 

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.230
um the this the graphics here is as you
can see if you um it doesn't matter

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240
can see if you um it doesn't matter
 

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.990
can see if you um it doesn't matter
whether you are scaling up or scaling

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000
whether you are scaling up or scaling
 

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.530
whether you are scaling up or scaling
down um because there's no Edward from

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:00.540
down um because there's no Edward from
 

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:03.170
down um because there's no Edward from
actually a perfect algorithm do we

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:03.180
actually a perfect algorithm do we
 

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.960
actually a perfect algorithm do we
produce two scowling images

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:05.970
produce two scowling images
 

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:08.689
produce two scowling images
so if you scale up you will because you

00:16:08.689 --> 00:16:08.699
so if you scale up you will because you
 

00:16:08.699 --> 00:16:11.389
so if you scale up you will because you
don't have enough information you have

00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399
don't have enough information you have
 

00:16:11.399 --> 00:16:15.019
don't have enough information you have
to do interpolation and that will create

00:16:15.019 --> 00:16:15.029
to do interpolation and that will create
 

00:16:15.029 --> 00:16:19.460
to do interpolation and that will create
an image that is not sharp and but at

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:19.470
an image that is not sharp and but at
 

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.429
an image that is not sharp and but at
the same time if you're scaling down

00:16:21.429 --> 00:16:21.439
the same time if you're scaling down
 

00:16:21.439 --> 00:16:25.189
the same time if you're scaling down
your your image our there's a potential

00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199
your your image our there's a potential
 

00:16:25.199 --> 00:16:27.100
your your image our there's a potential
running into something called aliasing

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:27.110
running into something called aliasing
 

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:31.309
running into something called aliasing
which also can make your image not sharp

00:16:31.309 --> 00:16:31.319
which also can make your image not sharp
 

00:16:31.319 --> 00:16:37.610
which also can make your image not sharp
as a tall as also so the conclusion here

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:37.620
as a tall as also so the conclusion here
 

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.610
as a tall as also so the conclusion here
is you should create the map piece of

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:40.620
is you should create the map piece of
 

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.460
is you should create the map piece of
resources from each type of density of

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:43.470
resources from each type of density of
 

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:50.990
resources from each type of density of
device you're targeting on so what is st

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.000
device you're targeting on so what is st
 

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.460
device you're targeting on so what is st
because besides TP there is also SP in

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:55.470
because besides TP there is also SP in
 

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:59.420
because besides TP there is also SP in
android so SP is something we designed

00:16:59.420 --> 00:16:59.430
android so SP is something we designed
 

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:02.960
android so SP is something we designed
specifically for text um in the android

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:02.970
specifically for text um in the android
 

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:04.640
specifically for text um in the android
framework there is a accessibility

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:04.650
framework there is a accessibility
 

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:09.340
framework there is a accessibility
option to allow user to enlarge phones

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:09.350
option to allow user to enlarge phones
 

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:13.250
option to allow user to enlarge phones
even they are specifying defeat so in

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:13.260
even they are specifying defeat so in
 

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:18.409
even they are specifying defeat so in
that case um the formula is really SP is

00:17:18.409 --> 00:17:18.419
that case um the formula is really SP is
 

00:17:18.419 --> 00:17:22.240
that case um the formula is really SP is
really DP times some scaling factor

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:22.250
really DP times some scaling factor
 

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:27.439
really DP times some scaling factor
determined by the user uh what kind of

00:17:27.439 --> 00:17:27.449
determined by the user uh what kind of
 

00:17:27.449 --> 00:17:30.950

phones to the larger ones or smaller
 

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.590
phones to the larger ones or smaller
phones so it is still somehow we expect

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:36.600
phones so it is still somehow we expect
 

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.810

the DP make the text a kind of um

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:40.820
the DP make the text a kind of um
 

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.159
the DP make the text a kind of um
independent of resolution by the same

00:17:43.159 --> 00:17:43.169

time if the user decide to scale it up

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:46.350
time if the user decide to scale it up
 

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:50.590

for our for accessibility reasons are

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:50.600
for our for accessibility reasons are
 

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:55.850
for our for accessibility reasons are
there is an extra scaling factor of four

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:55.860
there is an extra scaling factor of four
 

00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:02.360
there is an extra scaling factor of four
for user about to specify and after all

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:02.370
for user about to specify and after all
 

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:05.770
for user about to specify and after all
these um so I hope by now you have a

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:05.780
these um so I hope by now you have a
 

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.659
these um so I hope by now you have a
kind of a good graphs of what if he is

00:18:08.659 --> 00:18:08.669
kind of a good graphs of what if he is
 

00:18:08.669 --> 00:18:12.279
kind of a good graphs of what if he is
and and because of all these like um

00:18:12.279 --> 00:18:12.289
and and because of all these like um
 

00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:15.770
and and because of all these like um
problem with pixel and and and that's

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:15.780
problem with pixel and and and that's
 

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.930
problem with pixel and and and that's
why we kind of introduce a new size

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:17.940
why we kind of introduce a new size
 

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.370
why we kind of introduce a new size
qualifier

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:19.380
qualifier
 

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:24.730
qualifier
onto to do resource a classification and

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:24.740
onto to do resource a classification and
 

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:29.570
onto to do resource a classification and
and this new qualifiers allows more

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:29.580
and this new qualifiers allows more
 

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.780
and this new qualifiers allows more
control over on different specific like

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:32.790
control over on different specific like
 

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:36.710
control over on different specific like
screen sizes to support an application

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720
screen sizes to support an application
 

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:41.800
screen sizes to support an application
so the O's size qualifier which is a

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:41.810
so the O's size qualifier which is a
 

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:46.190
so the O's size qualifier which is a
small normal medium large extra large

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200
small normal medium large extra large
 

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.780
small normal medium large extra large
and um turns out because of the

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:50.790
and um turns out because of the
 

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:56.480
and um turns out because of the
resolution issue on is no longer good

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:56.490
resolution issue on is no longer good
 

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.360
resolution issue on is no longer good
enough to to classify by things like

00:18:59.360 --> 00:18:59.370
enough to to classify by things like
 

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.930
enough to to classify by things like
tablets so in forum for example or

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:02.940
tablets so in forum for example or
 

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:07.730
tablets so in forum for example or
7-inch tablets as a size large but but

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:07.740
7-inch tablets as a size large but but
 

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.250
7-inch tablets as a size large but but
so that so that makes actually tablet

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:10.260
so that so that makes actually tablet
 

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.930
so that so that makes actually tablet
not necessary equal to an extra-large

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:11.940
not necessary equal to an extra-large
 

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.500
not necessary equal to an extra-large
which is a love which brings along

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:15.510
which is a love which brings along
 

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:19.940
which is a love which brings along
things and by introducing on these new

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:19.950
things and by introducing on these new
 

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.520
things and by introducing on these new
qualifiers so there are three of them so

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:22.530
qualifiers so there are three of them so
 

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:25.030
qualifiers so there are three of them so
one of them we call it a smallest width

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:25.040
one of them we call it a smallest width
 

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:29.450
one of them we call it a smallest width
so there is in Texas way SW and then and

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:29.460
so there is in Texas way SW and then and
 

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:34.220
so there is in Texas way SW and then and
then the number and then fep so um so

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:34.230
then the number and then fep so um so
 

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:36.620
then the number and then fep so um so
the nice things about this smaller width

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:36.630
the nice things about this smaller width
 

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:39.980
the nice things about this smaller width
is you don't need to care about are the

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:39.990
is you don't need to care about are the
 

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:43.400
is you don't need to care about are the
orientation of of your device so all all

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:43.410

honeycomb 3.2 um these qualifier doesn't
 

00:20:56.220 --> 00:21:00.320
honeycomb 3.2 um these qualifier doesn't
make sense right so in that case we

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:00.330
make sense right so in that case we
 

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:04.280
make sense right so in that case we
still recommend developer especially

selecting our tablets are using extra

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:20.340
selecting our tablets are using extra
 

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:23.600
selecting our tablets are using extra
large for example but in this case um

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:23.610
large for example but in this case um
 

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:28.670
large for example but in this case um
there's one problem you can as you can

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:28.680
there's one problem you can as you can
 

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.740
there's one problem you can as you can
see there are two files are actually are

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:32.750
see there are two files are actually are

having the same tablet layout the main

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:35.850
having the same tablet layout the main
 

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:40.850
having the same tablet layout the main
activity XML is actually duplicate so

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:40.860
activity XML is actually duplicate so
 

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:44.750
activity XML is actually duplicate so
how to solve this problem so one thing

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760
how to solve this problem so one thing
 

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.250
how to solve this problem so one thing
you can do is you can abstract out on

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:48.260
you can do is you can abstract out on
 

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:54.080
you can do is you can abstract out on
the tablet layout into intuitive and

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:54.090
the tablet layout into intuitive and
 

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:56.180

they are using a different name or in
 

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.340
they are using a different name or in
this case on coin main activity tablet

00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:58.350

under the are using values you can
 

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:13.070
under the are using values you can
specify layout arm pointing to that

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080
specify layout arm pointing to that
 

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:17.540

particular xml so i understand like the

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:17.550
particular xml so i understand like the
 

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:21.850
particular xml so i understand like the
layout XML is still are duplicates but

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:21.860
layout XML is still are duplicates but
 

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:25.100
layout XML is still are duplicates but
you your content your you're truthful

layout is only define once so which is
 

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:34.040
layout is only define once so which is
the key here um finally let's talk a

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:34.050
the key here um finally let's talk a
 

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:37.190
the key here um finally let's talk a
little bit about our screen support so

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200
little bit about our screen support so
 

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:43.040
little bit about our screen support so
in we have our two tags in in the

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:43.050
in we have our two tags in in the
 

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:44.210
in we have our two tags in in the
android framework to

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:44.220
android framework to
 

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.000
android framework to
to some to allow a multiple screen

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:47.010
to some to allow a multiple screen
 

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:49.460
to some to allow a multiple screen
support so one of them is support screen

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:49.470
support so one of them is support screen
 

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:53.960
support so one of them is support screen
and in this case here I want to filter

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:53.970
and in this case here I want to filter
 

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:58.070
and in this case here I want to filter
out a small and normal screen size so

00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080
out a small and normal screen size so
 

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:02.860
out a small and normal screen size so
this is the kind of the the

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:02.870
this is the kind of the the
 

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:05.690
this is the kind of the the
specification I need to do to set a

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:05.700
specification I need to do to set a
 

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.000
specification I need to do to set a
small screen and a normal screen tip

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:08.010
small screen and a normal screen tip
 

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:12.890

doesn't mean your application will not

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:35.280
doesn't mean your application will not
 

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.370
doesn't mean your application will not
be available but for large and extra

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:37.380
be available but for large and extra
 

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:39.860
be available but for large and extra
large device it just mean that they're

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:39.870
large device it just mean that they're
 

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:41.860
large device it just mean that they're
running in something we call

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:41.870

compatibility mode for these are for

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:45.150
compatibility mode for these are for
 

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:49.940
compatibility mode for these are for
these two form factors so so how to

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:49.950
these two form factors so so how to
 

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:53.180
these two form factors so so how to
filter out a large or extra large screen

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:53.190
filter out a large or extra large screen
 

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:56.990
filter out a large or extra large screen
device then um we have another tag

actually can can really do this so in

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:00.690
actually can can really do this so in
 

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:03.890
actually can can really do this so in
this case here you're using something

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:03.900
this case here you're using something
 

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:07.399
this case here you're using something
called compatibles intact and you have

00:24:07.399 --> 00:24:07.409
called compatibles intact and you have
 

00:24:07.409 --> 00:24:11.210
called compatibles intact and you have
to specify all the screen you you you

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:11.220
to specify all the screen you you you
 

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:13.730

you would like to support so that's the

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:13.740
you would like to support so that's the
 

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:17.120
you would like to support so that's the
one big caveat and and that's end up a

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:17.130
one big caveat and and that's end up a
 

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.270
one big caveat and and that's end up a
ton of the reason why we are not

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:19.280
ton of the reason why we are not
 

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.549

recommending developer to to use this
 

00:24:22.559 --> 00:24:26.450
recommending developer to to use this
because you if you don't specify all the

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:26.460
because you if you don't specify all the
 

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.940

the internet for example Facebook so if
 

00:25:36.779 --> 00:25:40.369
the internet for example Facebook so if
Facebook has a large image say 180

00:25:40.369 --> 00:25:40.379
Facebook has a large image say 180
 

00:25:40.379 --> 00:25:46.159

like 90 DPI anyway to any strategies to

00:25:55.039 --> 00:25:55.049
like 90 DPI anyway to any strategies to
 

00:25:55.049 --> 00:26:00.259
like 90 DPI anyway to any strategies to
like scale them oh so so I think that in

00:26:00.259 --> 00:26:00.269
like scale them oh so so I think that in
 

00:26:00.269 --> 00:26:04.119
like scale them oh so so I think that in
that case is like that is the

00:26:04.119 --> 00:26:04.129
that case is like that is the
 

00:26:04.129 --> 00:26:07.609
that case is like that is the
presentation is if you define your image

scale good that you make up image up for
you but then again you run into the

00:26:18.619 --> 00:26:18.629
you but then again you run into the
 

00:26:18.629 --> 00:26:24.200
you but then again you run into the
issue of our interpolation you may you

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:24.210

general strategy though if you're
 

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:42.289
general strategy though if you're
pulling on in your situation you said

00:26:42.289 --> 00:26:42.299
pulling on in your situation you said
 

00:26:42.299 --> 00:26:43.639
pulling on in your situation you said
you were pulling down assets from the

you were pulling down assets from the
 

00:26:43.649 --> 00:26:45.919
you were pulling down assets from the
net and you might not have you know

00:26:45.919 --> 00:26:45.929
net and you might not have you know
 

00:26:45.929 --> 00:26:49.239

consider whether you you think stretch

00:26:51.759 --> 00:26:51.769
consider whether you you think stretch
 

00:26:51.769 --> 00:26:53.720
consider whether you you think stretch
stretching that image is really the

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:53.730
stretching that image is really the
 

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:56.810
stretching that image is really the
right thing to do and certainly consider

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:56.820
right thing to do and certainly consider
 

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:58.879
right thing to do and certainly consider
whether you want to stretch it to as big

00:26:58.879 --> 00:26:58.889
whether you want to stretch it to as big
 

00:26:58.889 --> 00:27:00.799
whether you want to stretch it to as big
as you can get there might be a middle

00:27:00.799 --> 00:27:00.809
as you can get there might be a middle

00:28:08.419 --> 00:28:08.429
understanding Tony oh yeah so based on
 

00:28:08.429 --> 00:28:10.659
understanding Tony oh yeah so based on
what well what the question doing that

00:28:10.659 --> 00:28:10.669
what well what the question doing that
 

00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:13.460
what well what the question doing that
yeah so what I would suggest is actually

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:13.470
yeah so what I would suggest is actually
 

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:16.010
yeah so what I would suggest is actually
just I mean if you if you're just going

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:16.020
just I mean if you if you're just going
 

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:17.960
just I mean if you if you're just going
to render it in a view just use the like

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:17.970
to render it in a view just use the like
 

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:19.880
to render it in a view just use the like
an imageview just use the properties

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:19.890
an imageview just use the properties
 

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:21.950
an imageview just use the properties
that we provide their that allow that

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960
that we provide their that allow that
 

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.750
that we provide their that allow that
where you can specify whether you want

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760
where you can specify whether you want
 

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:27.350
where you can specify whether you want
it to to stretch to fit or you want to

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360
it to to stretch to fit or you want to
 

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.750
it to to stretch to fit or you want to
descale or you want to do crop there's a

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760
descale or you want to do crop there's a
 

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.600
descale or you want to do crop there's a
couple of options there that you should

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:32.610
couple of options there that you should
 

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:34.789
couple of options there that you should
really have a look at and see what makes

00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799
really have a look at and see what makes
 

00:28:34.799 --> 00:28:37.279
really have a look at and see what makes
sense so in that case the the android

00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:37.289
sense so in that case the the android
 

00:28:37.289 --> 00:28:42.080
sense so in that case the the android
framework is doing the work for you so

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:42.090
framework is doing the work for you so
 

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:46.909
framework is doing the work for you so
just keep in mind however though as I as

00:28:46.909 --> 00:28:46.919
just keep in mind however though as I as
 

00:28:46.919 --> 00:28:50.120
just keep in mind however though as I as
we just said to Constantine that it may

Tony described today yeah um I think the
second question we have on moderator is

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:46.900
second question we have on moderator is
 

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:49.409
second question we have on moderator is
when whenever we read the dimension of

when whenever we read the dimension of
 

00:29:49.419 --> 00:29:53.600

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:00.700
is that value in pixel DP 0 gie so oh
 

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:04.529
is that value in pixel DP 0 gie so oh
well oh my- standings tho those number

00:30:04.529 --> 00:30:04.539
well oh my- standings tho those number
 

00:30:04.539 --> 00:30:08.880
well oh my- standings tho those number
in pixel and and and also another thing

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:08.890
in pixel and and and also another thing
 

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:12.360
in pixel and and and also another thing
is DP and div are the same thing yeah so

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:12.370
is DP and div are the same thing yeah so
 

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:15.000
is DP and div are the same thing yeah so
I think that was a trick question to try

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:15.010
I think that was a trick question to try
 

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:17.539
I think that was a trick question to try

want to comment is when we've talked

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:24.100
want to comment is when we've talked
 

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:27.020
want to comment is when we've talked
about like designing layout in DP is

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:27.030
about like designing layout in DP is
 

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:30.500
about like designing layout in DP is
really what we are talking about is um

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:30.510
really what we are talking about is um
 

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:35.820
really what we are talking about is um
we want experience on on on a particular

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:35.830

physical size consistent regardless of
 

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:43.289
physical size consistent regardless of
resolution so so so we are not saying

00:30:43.289 --> 00:30:43.299
resolution so so so we are not saying
 

00:30:43.299 --> 00:30:48.289
resolution so so so we are not saying
like the using DP in your layout will

00:30:48.289 --> 00:30:48.299
like the using DP in your layout will
 

00:30:48.299 --> 00:30:52.350
like the using DP in your layout will
will will still at properly in different

museum is a misconception so what we are

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:56.710
museum is a misconception so what we are
 

00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:59.630
museum is a misconception so what we are
talking about here is if you design a

00:30:59.630 --> 00:30:59.640
talking about here is if you design a
 

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:04.590
talking about here is if you design a
7-inch layout 47 inch device and if you

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:04.600
7-inch layout 47 inch device and if you
 

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:07.350
7-inch layout 47 inch device and if you
are specifying all these dimension in DP

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360
are specifying all these dimension in DP
 

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.279
are specifying all these dimension in DP
it will guarantee to work on all the do

00:31:11.279 --> 00:31:11.289
it will guarantee to work on all the do
 

00:31:11.289 --> 00:31:16.020
it will guarantee to work on all the do
all the seven inches devices um with

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:16.030
all the seven inches devices um with
 

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:18.720
all the seven inches devices um with
other software solution and that's just

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:18.730
other software solution and that's just
 

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:21.720
other software solution and that's just
the power of TP it's not we are not

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:21.730
the power of TP it's not we are not
 

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:24.539
the power of TP it's not we are not
saying like if it is a 15-7 janeiro

00:31:24.539 --> 00:31:24.549
saying like if it is a 15-7 janeiro
 

00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:26.700
saying like if it is a 15-7 janeiro
using DP it will work in the 10 inch

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:26.710
using DP it will work in the 10 inch
 

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:30.270
using DP it will work in the 10 inch
device that's not true and you have what

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:30.280
device that's not true and you have what
 

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.940
device that's not true and you have what
you should do is you should define a

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:32.950
you should do is you should define a
 

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:33.500
you should do is you should define a
layer

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:33.510
layer
 

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:37.350

factor and you may choose to have like

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:40.570
factor and you may choose to have like
 

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:43.040
factor and you may choose to have like
using more famine or different design

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:43.050
using more famine or different design
 

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:46.500
using more famine or different design
and things should be still done in DP so

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:46.510
and things should be still done in DP so
 

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:51.480
and things should be still done in DP so
that are your layer will work on 10

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:51.490
that are your layer will work on 10
 

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:53.820
that are your layer will work on 10
inches divided with different resolution

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:53.830
inches divided with different resolution
 

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:56.040
inches divided with different resolution
so that's the that's the key to key

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:56.050
so that's the that's the key to key
 

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:58.890
so that's the that's the key to key
concept here yeah might just add to that

00:31:58.890 --> 00:31:58.900
concept here yeah might just add to that
 

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:02.460
concept here yeah might just add to that
Tony and in general I my experience has

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:02.470
Tony and in general I my experience has
 

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:04.470
Tony and in general I my experience has
been that 7-inch devices and 10-inch

00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480
been that 7-inch devices and 10-inch
 

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.810
been that 7-inch devices and 10-inch
devices you can actually reuse the same

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:10.830
layout in general and it and it works
really well and it scales nicely I mean

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:10.840
really well and it scales nicely I mean
 

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.960
really well and it scales nicely I mean

just about all the 7-inch tablets I've
 

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:30.870
just about all the 7-inch tablets I've
seen his portrait mode so that's

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880
seen his portrait mode so that's
 

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.120
seen his portrait mode so that's
something that you should consider as to

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:33.130
something that you should consider as to
 

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:36.630
something that you should consider as to
you know how what you lay out how your

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:36.640
you know how what you lay out how your
 

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.700
you know how what you lay out how your
layer might change between portrait mode

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:38.710
layer might change between portrait mode
 

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:40.950
layer might change between portrait mode
and landscape mode so to me the big

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960
and landscape mode so to me the big
 

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.370
and landscape mode so to me the big
differentiating factor is actually the

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:43.380
differentiating factor is actually the
 

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.870
differentiating factor is actually the
the orientation as opposed to the

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:45.880
the orientation as opposed to the
 

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.540
the orientation as opposed to the
physical size of the screen right anyway

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:48.550
physical size of the screen right anyway
 

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:51.330
physical size of the screen right anyway
I mean like if if you if you do things

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:51.340
I mean like if if you if you do things
 

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:55.980
I mean like if if you if you do things
like right using like silk on our field

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:55.990
like right using like silk on our field
 

00:32:55.990 --> 00:33:00.900

the container so things will flow

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:02.980
the container so things will flow
 

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:05.940
the container so things will flow
properly when you go from a 7-inch the

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:05.950
properly when you go from a 7-inch the
 

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:10.530
properly when you go from a 7-inch the

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:12.600
tens 10 20 10 inch device but the but
one thing to remember is if you specify

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:12.610
one thing to remember is if you specify
 

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:16.380
one thing to remember is if you specify
things in DP those assets or controls

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:16.390
things in DP those assets or controls
 

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:19.940
things in DP those assets or controls
will stay the same size regardless of

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:19.950
will stay the same size regardless of
 

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:25.470
will stay the same size regardless of
the in 7 inch or 10 inch so um but if

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:25.480
the in 7 inch or 10 inch so um but if
 

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.320
the in 7 inch or 10 inch so um but if
you do the container or layer container

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:28.330
you do the container or layer container
 

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:30.900
you do the container or layer container
properly and they will they will give us

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:30.910
properly and they will they will give us
 

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:34.380
properly and they will they will give us
us or doing using percentage and then

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:34.390
us or doing using percentage and then
 

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:39.330
us or doing using percentage and then
we'll things will work fine so yeah so I

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:39.340
we'll things will work fine so yeah so I
 

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:40.440
we'll things will work fine so yeah so I
think that's that's all the questions

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:40.450
think that's that's all the questions
 

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:45.000
think that's that's all the questions
that we had on this this week's topic so

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:45.010
that we had on this this week's topic so
 

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:47.430
that we had on this this week's topic so
Tony thanks for covering DPS the one

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:47.440
Tony thanks for covering DPS the one
 

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.379
Tony thanks for covering DPS the one
we talked about was sort of the

00:33:49.379 --> 00:33:49.389
we talked about was sort of the
 

00:33:49.389 --> 00:33:51.749
we talked about was sort of the
advantages of DP but the big takeaway I

00:33:51.749 --> 00:33:51.759
advantages of DP but the big takeaway I
 

00:33:51.759 --> 00:33:54.149
advantages of DP but the big takeaway I
think developers should really go go

00:33:54.149 --> 00:33:54.159
think developers should really go go
 

00:33:54.159 --> 00:33:56.190
think developers should really go go
back with is don't use pixels in your

back with is don't use pixels in your
 

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.590
back with is don't use pixels in your
layout right don't specify user

00:33:58.590 --> 00:33:58.600
layout right don't specify user
 

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.649
layout right don't specify user
interfaces with pixels because that is

00:34:01.649 --> 00:34:01.659
interfaces with pixels because that is
 

00:34:01.659 --> 00:34:03.269
interfaces with pixels because that is
not going to scale across the wide

00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279
not going to scale across the wide
 

00:34:03.279 --> 00:34:06.110
not going to scale across the wide

you know build scalable user interfaces

00:34:09.119 --> 00:34:09.129
you know build scalable user interfaces
 

00:34:09.129 --> 00:34:11.599
you know build scalable user interfaces
and DPS are certainly one way to do that

00:34:11.599 --> 00:34:11.609
and DPS are certainly one way to do that
 

00:34:11.609 --> 00:34:14.520
and DPS are certainly one way to do that
and the other way of building sort of

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:14.530
and the other way of building sort of
 

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:17.490
and the other way of building sort of
flexible user interfaces is using things

00:34:17.490 --> 00:34:17.500
flexible user interfaces is using things
 

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:21.450
flexible user interfaces is using things
like wrap content or feel parent on on

00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:21.460
like wrap content or feel parent on on
 

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:26.369
like wrap content or feel parent on on
your on your layouts as well all right

00:34:26.369 --> 00:34:26.379
your on your layouts as well all right
 

00:34:26.379 --> 00:34:29.069
your on your layouts as well all right
so we've got three other questions on

00:34:29.069 --> 00:34:29.079
so we've got three other questions on
 

00:34:29.079 --> 00:34:31.379
so we've got three other questions on
here Tony and I'll just take them from

00:34:31.379 --> 00:34:31.389
here Tony and I'll just take them from

this bug was in the known issues for

00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:48.129
this bug was in the known issues for
 

00:34:48.129 --> 00:34:50.270
this bug was in the known issues for
almost a year is there an update I

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280
almost a year is there an update I
 

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.409
almost a year is there an update I
didn't know it was a known issue and

didn't know it was a known issue and
 

00:34:52.419 --> 00:34:55.649
didn't know it was a known issue and
certainly I've played within our billing

00:34:55.649 --> 00:34:55.659
certainly I've played within our billing
 

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:57.510
certainly I've played within our billing
and I haven't had this particular issue

00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520
and I haven't had this particular issue

reason took too long didn't deliver is

00:35:21.569 --> 00:35:21.579
reason took too long didn't deliver is
 

00:35:21.579 --> 00:35:24.900
reason took too long didn't deliver is
um some of the transaction of orders is

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:24.910
um some of the transaction of orders is
 

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:30.349
um some of the transaction of orders is
actually maybe black as as fraud or

00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359
actually maybe black as as fraud or
 

00:35:30.359 --> 00:35:34.980
actually maybe black as as fraud or
anomalous engine and and so so I think

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:34.990
anomalous engine and and so so I think
 

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:37.500
anomalous engine and and so so I think
one thing I developer should have

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:37.510
one thing I developer should have
 

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:40.260
one thing I developer should have
expectation is there there are certain

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:40.270
expectation is there there are certain
 

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:43.440
expectation is there there are certain
percentage of our orders that will be my

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:43.450
percentage of our orders that will be my
 

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:48.599
percentage of our orders that will be my
black ass like potential risk fraud so

00:35:48.599 --> 00:35:48.609
black ass like potential risk fraud so
 

00:35:48.609 --> 00:35:51.599
black ass like potential risk fraud so
and and for those ordering will it will

00:35:51.599 --> 00:35:51.609
and and for those ordering will it will
 

00:35:51.609 --> 00:35:53.730
and and for those ordering will it will
not process go through and and and

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:53.740
not process go through and and and
 

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:56.160
not process go through and and and
that's the result of could be resolved

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:56.170
that's the result of could be resolved
 

00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:56.970
that's the result of could be resolved
that long

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:56.980
that long
 

00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:00.840
that long
to talk too long and it shouldn't it

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:00.850
to talk too long and it shouldn't it
 

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:02.370
to talk too long and it shouldn't it
shouldn't happen in the test after

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:02.380
shouldn't happen in the test after
 

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:04.230
shouldn't happen in the test after
because if he's using he or she are

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240
because if he's using he or she are
 

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.960
because if he's using he or she are
using that sample app it's a you should

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:06.970
using that sample app it's a you should
 

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:09.599
using that sample app it's a you should
be using the package names that are

00:36:09.599 --> 00:36:09.609
be using the package names that are
 

00:36:09.609 --> 00:36:12.800
be using the package names that are
using the the test nomenclature so okay

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:12.810
using the the test nomenclature so okay
 

00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:15.330
using the the test nomenclature so okay
the risk engine side shouldn't come into

00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:15.340
the risk engine side shouldn't come into
 

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.609
the risk engine side shouldn't come into
play but I'd love it so from the day are

00:36:17.609 --> 00:36:17.619
play but I'd love it so from the day are
 

00:36:17.619 --> 00:36:21.060
play but I'd love it so from the day are
they are developers lame are telling

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:21.070
they are developers lame are telling
 

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:23.849
they are developers lame are telling
like some transaction of fouling and so

00:36:23.849 --> 00:36:23.859
like some transaction of fouling and so
 

00:36:23.859 --> 00:36:27.330
like some transaction of fouling and so
may not be this case here but but that

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:27.340
may not be this case here but but that
 

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:30.870
may not be this case here but but that
could be a potential problem sometimes

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880
could be a potential problem sometimes
 

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.790
could be a potential problem sometimes
if you see transaction didn't go through

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800
if you see transaction didn't go through
 

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:37.859
if you see transaction didn't go through
it I hate to say this normal but the but

00:36:37.859 --> 00:36:37.869
it I hate to say this normal but the but
 

00:36:37.869 --> 00:36:40.320
it I hate to say this normal but the but
it does happen I some some transaction

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:40.330
it does happen I some some transaction

myself and I will would we can have a
deeper dive in it I guess we need to see

00:36:56.099 --> 00:36:56.109
deeper dive in it I guess we need to see
 

00:36:56.109 --> 00:36:57.660
deeper dive in it I guess we need to see
a little bit more as to exactly what

00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:57.670
a little bit more as to exactly what
 

00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:00.300
a little bit more as to exactly what
you're doing then we can try and take

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:00.310
you're doing then we can try and take
 

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:03.960
you're doing then we can try and take
from there okay according to the google

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:03.970
from there okay according to the google
 

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:06.540
from there okay according to the google
cloud messaging tutorial wakelock is

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:06.550
cloud messaging tutorial wakelock is
 

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:08.310
cloud messaging tutorial wakelock is
required in order to handle the

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:08.320
required in order to handle the
 

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.200
required in order to handle the
registration action how can the device

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:10.210
registration action how can the device
 

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:12.870
registration action how can the device
handle registration response but in

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880
handle registration response but in
 

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.359
handle registration response but in
sleep mode when sending requests to a

00:37:15.359 --> 00:37:15.369
sleep mode when sending requests to a
 

00:37:15.369 --> 00:37:18.060
sleep mode when sending requests to a
third-party server any other examples of

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:18.070
third-party server any other examples of
 

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:25.770
third-party server any other examples of
services requiring a wakelock I I know

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:25.780
services requiring a wakelock I I know
 

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:29.580
services requiring a wakelock I I know
an example so we have a an open source

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:29.590
an example so we have a an open source
 

00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:33.210
an example so we have a an open source
project or chrome to phone and and and

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:33.220
project or chrome to phone and and and
 

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:35.420
project or chrome to phone and and and
and there should be implementation on

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:35.430
and there should be implementation on
 

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:40.670
and there should be implementation on
the things you described um in terms of

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680
the things you described um in terms of
 

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:45.000
the things you described um in terms of
getting handle reservation responding in

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:45.010
getting handle reservation responding in
 

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:48.320
getting handle reservation responding in
sleep mode and Cardinals do you have any

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:48.330
sleep mode and Cardinals do you have any
 

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:52.440
sleep mode and Cardinals do you have any
insight on this this part no I mean in

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:52.450
insight on this this part no I mean in
 

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:54.480
insight on this this part no I mean in
general I think it's good practice to to

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:54.490
general I think it's good practice to to
 

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:57.210
general I think it's good practice to to
a to acquire the wakelock if you're

00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:57.220
a to acquire the wakelock if you're
 

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.400
a to acquire the wakelock if you're
waiting for a response because these

00:37:59.400 --> 00:37:59.410
waiting for a response because these
 

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:02.160
waiting for a response because these
things your request responses are

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:02.170
things your request responses are
 

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:04.800
things your request responses are
asynchronous in nature so if you

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:04.810
asynchronous in nature so if you
 

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:06.599
asynchronous in nature so if you
actually want to make sure that you are

00:38:06.599 --> 00:38:06.609
actually want to make sure that you are
 

00:38:06.609 --> 00:38:09.670
actually want to make sure that you are
you know awake so to speak

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680
you know awake so to speak
 

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:12.560
you know awake so to speak
for that duration then you should do so

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:12.570
for that duration then you should do so
 

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:14.570
for that duration then you should do so
just be careful in terms of acquiring

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:14.580
just be careful in terms of acquiring
 

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:16.160
just be careful in terms of acquiring
that way clock because you want to try

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:16.170
that way clock because you want to try
 

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:17.690
that way clock because you want to try
and minimize how long you've got it for

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:17.700
and minimize how long you've got it for
 

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:20.540
and minimize how long you've got it for
because of course the the device is not

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:20.550
because of course the the device is not
 

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:22.190
because of course the the device is not
able to sleep at that point in time so

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.200
able to sleep at that point in time so
 

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.340
able to sleep at that point in time so
it's a drain on the battery yeah green

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:25.350
it's a drain on the battery yeah green
 

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:28.310
it's a drain on the battery yeah green
um so the third question last question

00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320
um so the third question last question
 

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:32.380
um so the third question last question
oh you have a question yeah I'd like to

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:32.390
oh you have a question yeah I'd like to
 

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:36.770
oh you have a question yeah I'd like to
add more about this question for example

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:36.780
add more about this question for example
 

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:40.180
add more about this question for example
I have a foreground service which uses

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:40.190
I have a foreground service which uses
 

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:44.740
I have a foreground service which uses
WebSocket connection to the server and

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:44.750
WebSocket connection to the server and
 

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:48.590
WebSocket connection to the server and
definitely the user can push the power

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:48.600
definitely the user can push the power
 

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:52.670
definitely the user can push the power
button to for device to go sleep on does

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:52.680
button to for device to go sleep on does
 

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.530
button to for device to go sleep on does
it mean that I still need to acquire

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:54.540
it mean that I still need to acquire
 

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:58.130
it mean that I still need to acquire
wake look or so so the connection won't

00:38:58.130 --> 00:38:58.140
wake look or so so the connection won't
 

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:06.020
wake look or so so the connection won't
be broken if you want to maintain the

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:06.030
be broken if you want to maintain the
 

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:07.820
be broken if you want to maintain the
persistence of your connection then i

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:07.830
persistence of your connection then i
 

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:11.720
persistence of your connection then i
would recommend yes but I would also ask

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:11.730
would recommend yes but I would also ask
 

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:15.980
would recommend yes but I would also ask
you to really think about whether that

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:15.990
you to really think about whether that
 

00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:17.740
you to really think about whether that
connection needs to be persistent

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:17.750
connection needs to be persistent
 

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:20.450
connection needs to be persistent
persisted throughout and that's that's

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:20.460
persisted throughout and that's that's
 

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:22.340
persisted throughout and that's that's
one of the benefits of google cloud

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:22.350
one of the benefits of google cloud
 

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:25.970
one of the benefits of google cloud
messaging right so you don't have to you

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:25.980
messaging right so you don't have to you
 

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:27.410
messaging right so you don't have to you
don't have to have a wakelock the whole

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:27.420
don't have to have a wakelock the whole
 

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.000
don't have to have a wakelock the whole
time or a connection to your server you

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:29.010
time or a connection to your server you
 

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:31.250
time or a connection to your server you
can have a notification comforter or a

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:31.260
can have a notification comforter or a
 

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:33.980
can have a notification comforter or a
message come through and then you can

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:33.990
message come through and then you can
 

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:36.800
message come through and then you can
spring to action then it's event based

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:36.810
spring to action then it's event based
 

00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:39.290
spring to action then it's event based
rather than you having to maintain this

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:39.300
rather than you having to maintain this
 

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:44.300
rather than you having to maintain this
persistent connection ok all right so

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:44.310
persistent connection ok all right so
 

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:46.850
persistent connection ok all right so
the last last question we have here is

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:46.860
the last last question we have here is
 

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:48.500
the last last question we have here is
can you recommend the best way to

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:48.510
can you recommend the best way to
 

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:50.900
can you recommend the best way to
implement themes in android since you

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:50.910
implement themes in android since you
 

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:53.660
implement themes in android since you
point to cover DPI and other related

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:53.670
point to cover DPI and other related
 

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:55.940
point to cover DPI and other related
topics maybe consider having a mean for

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:55.950
topics maybe consider having a mean for
 

00:39:55.950 --> 00:40:00.440
topics maybe consider having a mean for
about arm about 20 lakhs so first of all

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:00.450
about arm about 20 lakhs so first of all
 

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:02.300
about arm about 20 lakhs so first of all
that's a crystal gestures and I think

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:02.310
that's a crystal gestures and I think
 

00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:06.670
that's a crystal gestures and I think
like that theme itself could be another

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:06.680
like that theme itself could be another
 

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:11.060
like that theme itself could be another
ad out plus presentation so definitely

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:11.070
ad out plus presentation so definitely
 

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:15.440
ad out plus presentation so definitely
will look into that and and hopefully we

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:15.450
will look into that and and hopefully we
 

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:17.380
will look into that and and hopefully we
have another session about themes

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:17.390
have another session about themes
 

00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:21.710
have another session about themes
specifically in the future yep

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:21.720
specifically in the future yep
 

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:25.580
specifically in the future yep
yeah in the meantime though we've

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:25.590
yeah in the meantime though we've
 

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:27.620
yeah in the meantime though we've
actually got a fairly extensive section

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:27.630
actually got a fairly extensive section
 

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:30.710
actually got a fairly extensive section
in the on developer.android.com in the

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720
in the on developer.android.com in the
 

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.170
in the on developer.android.com in the
guide section on styles and themes and I

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:33.180
guide section on styles and themes and I
 

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:35.570
guide section on styles and themes and I
walks walks you through sort of how to

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:35.580
walks walks you through sort of how to
 

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:39.290
walks walks you through sort of how to
style do some basic styling I think

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:39.300
style do some basic styling I think
 

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:41.290
style do some basic styling I think
that's a great place to get started

00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:41.300
that's a great place to get started
 

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:44.270
that's a great place to get started
there there are more sort of

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:44.280
there there are more sort of
 

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.130
there there are more sort of
community-based examples that I've seen

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:46.140
community-based examples that I've seen
 

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:48.560
community-based examples that I've seen
that they go to a larger extent so I'd

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:48.570
that they go to a larger extent so I'd
 

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:51.080
that they go to a larger extent so I'd
seen a community effort for building the

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:51.090
seen a community effort for building the
 

00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:54.349
seen a community effort for building the
holo theme for older Android versions

00:40:54.349 --> 00:40:54.359
holo theme for older Android versions
 

00:40:54.359 --> 00:40:56.660
holo theme for older Android versions
for example so what I'd suggest is start

00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:56.670
for example so what I'd suggest is start
 

00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:58.220
for example so what I'd suggest is start
with this guide and then go have a look

00:40:58.220 --> 00:40:58.230
with this guide and then go have a look
 

00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:59.510
with this guide and then go have a look
at some of these community efforts and

00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520
at some of these community efforts and
 

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.970
at some of these community efforts and
see how people are building and building

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:01.980
see how people are building and building
 

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:06.020
see how people are building and building
advanced theme so to speak but yes

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:06.030
advanced theme so to speak but yes
 

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:07.430
advanced theme so to speak but yes
thanks for the suggestion I think that's

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440
thanks for the suggestion I think that's
 

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.440
thanks for the suggestion I think that's
a good idea for a future topic as well

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:09.450
a good idea for a future topic as well
 

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:13.460
a good idea for a future topic as well
yeah ah ok well anyone else have any

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:13.470
yeah ah ok well anyone else have any
 

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:19.460
yeah ah ok well anyone else have any
questions um I had one yeah yeah go

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:19.470
questions um I had one yeah yeah go
 

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:30.140
questions um I had one yeah yeah go
ahead yeah go ahead be me over ok yeah

ahead yeah go ahead be me over ok yeah
 

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:32.690
ahead yeah go ahead be me over ok yeah
there are no it in you yep and I just

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:32.700
there are no it in you yep and I just
 

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.490
there are no it in you yep and I just
have wife in the chat window that when

have wife in the chat window that when
 

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.680
have wife in the chat window that when
i'm using sort of nine patches do i need

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:36.690
i'm using sort of nine patches do i need
 

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:38.990
i'm using sort of nine patches do i need
to specify a PNG file for each of their

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000
to specify a PNG file for each of their
 

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.180
to specify a PNG file for each of their
different DPI buckets or do i just need

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:41.190
different DPI buckets or do i just need
 

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:43.940
different DPI buckets or do i just need
to have one in my drawer folder that

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:43.950
to have one in my drawer folder that
 

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:49.490
to have one in my drawer folder that
will cover me for everything I think you

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:49.500
will cover me for everything I think you
 

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:50.990
will cover me for everything I think you
could get away with just having the one

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000
could get away with just having the one
 

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.940
could get away with just having the one
I wouldn't put it in the drawable folder

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:52.950
I wouldn't put it in the drawable folder
 

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:55.190
I wouldn't put it in the drawable folder
we actually have one called the drawable

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200
we actually have one called the drawable
 

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.190
we actually have one called the drawable
dash no DPI which is kind of like the

00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:58.200
dash no DPI which is kind of like the
 

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.320
dash no DPI which is kind of like the
explicit one to say that this applies to

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:00.330
explicit one to say that this applies to
 

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:04.099
explicit one to say that this applies to
every bucket and why I mean it will work

00:42:04.099 --> 00:42:04.109
every bucket and why I mean it will work
 

00:42:04.109 --> 00:42:06.589
every bucket and why I mean it will work
but just from a best practices point of

00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:06.599
but just from a best practices point of
 

00:42:06.599 --> 00:42:08.450
but just from a best practices point of
view we recommend using the the no DPI

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:08.460
view we recommend using the the no DPI
 

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:13.300
view we recommend using the the no DPI
non culture cool yeah I think I think

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:13.310
non culture cool yeah I think I think
 

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:17.060
non culture cool yeah I think I think
using nine petrus thought I it can be

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:17.070
using nine petrus thought I it can be
 

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:20.089
using nine petrus thought I it can be
another topic Oh in future I can talk

00:42:20.089 --> 00:42:20.099
another topic Oh in future I can talk
 

00:42:20.099 --> 00:42:21.950
another topic Oh in future I can talk
about you I just want to make sure that

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:21.960
about you I just want to make sure that
 

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.870
about you I just want to make sure that
I didn't need to have sort of a high res

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:23.880
I didn't need to have sort of a high res
 

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:27.050
I didn't need to have sort of a high res
nine patch for high-res devices and a

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:27.060
nine patch for high-res devices and a
 

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:30.589
nine patch for high-res devices and a
sort of low res welfare potentially you

00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:30.599
sort of low res welfare potentially you
 

00:42:30.599 --> 00:42:32.510
sort of low res welfare potentially you
can actually depend how big the images

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:32.520
can actually depend how big the images
 

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:34.439
can actually depend how big the images
right yeah

00:42:34.439 --> 00:42:34.449
right yeah
 

00:42:34.449 --> 00:42:37.809
right yeah
if you're doing it for styling you know

00:42:37.809 --> 00:42:37.819
if you're doing it for styling you know
 

00:42:37.819 --> 00:42:39.999
if you're doing it for styling you know
you I then maybe you can get away

00:42:39.999 --> 00:42:40.009
you I then maybe you can get away
 

00:42:40.009 --> 00:42:42.609
you I then maybe you can get away
without it but if you're doing you know

00:42:42.609 --> 00:42:42.619
without it but if you're doing you know
 

00:42:42.619 --> 00:42:44.559
without it but if you're doing you know
high-res images that you're expecting to

00:42:44.559 --> 00:42:44.569
high-res images that you're expecting to
 

00:42:44.569 --> 00:42:49.479
high-res images that you're expecting to
stretch is back down button just things

00:42:49.479 --> 00:42:49.489
stretch is back down button just things
 

00:42:49.489 --> 00:42:50.829
stretch is back down button just things
like buttons and stuff like that so at

00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:50.839
like buttons and stuff like that so at
 

00:42:50.839 --> 00:42:53.130
like buttons and stuff like that so at
the moment I've been kind of using

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:53.140
the moment I've been kind of using
 

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:55.509
the moment I've been kind of using
defining them in XML using gradients and

00:42:55.509 --> 00:42:55.519
defining them in XML using gradients and
 

00:42:55.519 --> 00:42:57.670
defining them in XML using gradients and
stuff and strokes so that I don't have

00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680
stuff and strokes so that I don't have
 

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.049
stuff and strokes so that I don't have
to have a nine patch instead and that

00:42:59.049 --> 00:42:59.059
to have a nine patch instead and that
 

00:42:59.059 --> 00:43:00.400
to have a nine patch instead and that
seems to work quite well but I was just

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:00.410
seems to work quite well but I was just
 

00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:02.559
seems to work quite well but I was just
thinking if I needed a more fancy button

00:43:02.559 --> 00:43:02.569
thinking if I needed a more fancy button
 

00:43:02.569 --> 00:43:05.079
thinking if I needed a more fancy button
that couldn't be defined using a

00:43:05.079 --> 00:43:05.089
that couldn't be defined using a
 

00:43:05.089 --> 00:43:08.609
that couldn't be defined using a
gradient then am I to use nine pitchers

00:43:08.609 --> 00:43:08.619
gradient then am I to use nine pitchers
 

00:43:08.619 --> 00:43:12.249
gradient then am I to use nine pitchers
yeah you probably I mean ideally you

00:43:12.249 --> 00:43:12.259
yeah you probably I mean ideally you
 

00:43:12.259 --> 00:43:14.140
yeah you probably I mean ideally you
should have you should be building

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:14.150
should have you should be building
 

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:16.390
should have you should be building
assets for each of those really each of

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400
assets for each of those really each of
 

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.920
assets for each of those really each of
those buckets but if it's something

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:17.930
those buckets but if it's something
 

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:19.689
those buckets but if it's something
really small like like your nine patch

00:43:19.689 --> 00:43:19.699
really small like like your nine patch
 

00:43:19.699 --> 00:43:21.699
really small like like your nine patch
is really tiny then you know might be

00:43:21.699 --> 00:43:21.709
is really tiny then you know might be
 

00:43:21.709 --> 00:43:25.179
is really tiny then you know might be
overkill um there is no I don't think

00:43:25.179 --> 00:43:25.189
overkill um there is no I don't think
 

00:43:25.189 --> 00:43:26.859
overkill um there is no I don't think
that it's an exact science so you kind

00:43:26.859 --> 00:43:26.869
that it's an exact science so you kind
 

00:43:26.869 --> 00:43:29.739
that it's an exact science so you kind
of have to use your judgment as to what

00:43:29.739 --> 00:43:29.749
of have to use your judgment as to what
 

00:43:29.749 --> 00:43:32.739
of have to use your judgment as to what
what at what point you should sort of

00:43:32.739 --> 00:43:32.749
what at what point you should sort of
 

00:43:32.749 --> 00:43:34.359
what at what point you should sort of
break the cord and say now I do need to

00:43:34.359 --> 00:43:34.369
break the cord and say now I do need to
 

00:43:34.369 --> 00:43:36.699
break the cord and say now I do need to
build a specific name badges for each of

00:43:36.699 --> 00:43:36.709
build a specific name badges for each of
 

00:43:36.709 --> 00:43:42.370
build a specific name badges for each of
those buckets cool Cheers yes alright

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:42.380
those buckets cool Cheers yes alright
 

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:45.779
those buckets cool Cheers yes alright
we've just had one other person join and

00:43:45.779 --> 00:43:45.789
we've just had one other person join and
 

00:43:45.789 --> 00:43:48.910
we've just had one other person join and
yeah I'm gonna one more question about

00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:48.920
yeah I'm gonna one more question about
 

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:52.839
yeah I'm gonna one more question about
the layout yeah absolutely so going back

00:43:52.839 --> 00:43:52.849
the layout yeah absolutely so going back
 

00:43:52.849 --> 00:43:55.049
the layout yeah absolutely so going back
to my question some question about

00:43:55.049 --> 00:43:55.059
to my question some question about
 

00:43:55.059 --> 00:43:58.749
to my question some question about
images from from that for example if I

00:43:58.749 --> 00:43:58.759
images from from that for example if I
 

00:43:58.759 --> 00:44:06.249
images from from that for example if I
have an image 1 and 80 pixels width so

00:44:06.249 --> 00:44:06.259
have an image 1 and 80 pixels width so
 

00:44:06.259 --> 00:44:09.429
have an image 1 and 80 pixels width so
is it the best option to set the maximum

00:44:09.429 --> 00:44:09.439
is it the best option to set the maximum
 

00:44:09.439 --> 00:44:13.019
is it the best option to set the maximum
width for like g1 devices point DPI

00:44:13.019 --> 00:44:13.029
width for like g1 devices point DPI
 

00:44:13.029 --> 00:44:15.279
width for like g1 devices point DPI
otherwise it will be like more than a

00:44:15.279 --> 00:44:15.289
otherwise it will be like more than a
 

00:44:15.289 --> 00:44:18.779
otherwise it will be like more than a
half screen width and leave it as is

00:44:18.779 --> 00:44:18.789
half screen width and leave it as is
 

00:44:18.789 --> 00:44:25.509
half screen width and leave it as is
480p I devices in the image view so just

00:44:25.509 --> 00:44:25.519
480p I devices in the image view so just
 

00:44:25.519 --> 00:44:27.400
480p I devices in the image view so just
just so I make sure that I understood

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:27.410
just so I make sure that I understood
 

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:29.529
just so I make sure that I understood
your question do you mean whether you

00:44:29.529 --> 00:44:29.539
your question do you mean whether you
 

00:44:29.539 --> 00:44:31.689
your question do you mean whether you
should scale the image down or shrink it

00:44:31.689 --> 00:44:31.699
should scale the image down or shrink it
 

00:44:31.699 --> 00:44:33.370
should scale the image down or shrink it
so that it's not occupying too much

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:33.380
so that it's not occupying too much
 

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:38.049
so that it's not occupying too much
physical space on the device yeah yeah i

00:44:38.049 --> 00:44:38.059
physical space on the device yeah yeah i
 

00:44:38.059 --> 00:44:41.199
physical space on the device yeah yeah i
would i would definitely do that i would

00:44:41.199 --> 00:44:41.209
would i would definitely do that i would
 

00:44:41.209 --> 00:44:43.269
would i would definitely do that i would
shrink it where possible i mean when it

00:44:43.269 --> 00:44:43.279
shrink it where possible i mean when it
 

00:44:43.279 --> 00:44:45.640
shrink it where possible i mean when it
makes sense so there is there is some

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:45.650
makes sense so there is there is some
 

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:47.740
makes sense so there is there is some
work that you need to do if you if you

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:47.750
work that you need to do if you if you
 

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:49.630
work that you need to do if you if you
holding assets from some remote server

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:49.640
holding assets from some remote server
 

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:51.370
holding assets from some remote server
that you you know whose resolution you

00:44:51.370 --> 00:44:51.380
that you you know whose resolution you
 

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:55.390
that you you know whose resolution you
don't have any control over as to what

00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:55.400
don't have any control over as to what
 

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.670
don't have any control over as to what
makes sense for your UI so if it only

00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680
makes sense for your UI so if it only
 

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:00.160
makes sense for your UI so if it only
makes sense for your you know whatever

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:00.170
makes sense for your you know whatever
 

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:01.870
makes sense for your you know whatever
it is to be only thirty percent of the

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:01.880
it is to be only thirty percent of the
 

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:04.200
it is to be only thirty percent of the
width of the screen then that's going to

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:04.210
width of the screen then that's going to
 

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:07.060
width of the screen then that's going to
you know that thirty percent the actual

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:07.070
you know that thirty percent the actual
 

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:10.030
you know that thirty percent the actual
number of the size of it is going to

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:10.040
number of the size of it is going to
 

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.070
number of the size of it is going to
differ regard depending on which device

00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:12.080
differ regard depending on which device
 

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:14.140
differ regard depending on which device
you're running on right so yeah

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:14.150
you're running on right so yeah
 

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:16.720
you're running on right so yeah
absolutely you'd want to scale that it

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:16.730
absolutely you'd want to scale that it
 

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:18.250
absolutely you'd want to scale that it
said you didn't like linear linear

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:18.260
said you didn't like linear linear
 

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:19.900
said you didn't like linear linear
layouts can help there because you can

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:19.910
layouts can help there because you can
 

00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:21.550
layouts can help there because you can
set weights and so on and have it done

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:21.560
set weights and so on and have it done
