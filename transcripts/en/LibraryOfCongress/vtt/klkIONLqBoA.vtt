ideas and energize one another.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.160 position:56%
To distill wisdom from the library's
rich resources and to interact

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.220
with policymakers and the public.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.930
It also administers the Kluge
Prize, periodically conferred

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.840
by the Librarian of Congress to
recognize lifetime achievement

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.720
in the study of humanity.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.310
To learn more about it's
programs and opportunities,

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.470
please visit the center's

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.780
For the past few months, the Kluge
Center has been privileged to have

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.310
in residence Dame Wendy Hall,
who has served as the Kluge chair

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.900
in technology and society.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.170
The chair in technology and society
is a senior scholar position,

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.180
focusing on the impact

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.680
of fast changing technology
on human societies.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.540
The scholar makes use of
rapidly growing digital resources

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.220
of the Library of Congress,
augmented by science

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.960 position:56%
and technology data and
documentation from around the world.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.450
Today's symposium helps mark the
culmination of Wendy's research

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.830
and reflection while at the center.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.820
And we are honored to
have served as her host.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.960
It is now my pleasure to
welcome to the podium,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.450
someone who is intimately familiar
with the management of vast amounts

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.820
of information on a daily basis.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.310
David Mao currently
leads the institution

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.870 position:56%
as the acting Librarian of Congress.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.820
He previously served as the
Deputy Librarian of Congress.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.750
And prior to that he was the
23rd Law Librarian of Congress.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.870
In that position, he expanded
the Law Library's collections,

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.450
especially its rare
books, supported efforts

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.580
to make US public domain legal
materials accessible online

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.080
and brought to the
library a 1215 Magna Carta

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.660
for an historic exhibition

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.950
to commemorate the great
charter's 800th anniversary.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.510
Please join me in welcoming
David Mao.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:59.540
[ Applause ]

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.250
&gt;&gt; DAVID S. MAO: Thank
you so much Janice

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.340
and good morning to all of you.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.030
As Janice said, I have
the privilege as serving

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.570
as the acting Library of Congress.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.720
And one of the joys of
being the acting Librarian

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.420
of Congress is I get
to welcome groups.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.410
And I'm really excited
to be able to welcome all

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.140
of you to the library today.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.530
I understand over the last two days
many of you here have participated

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.760 position:56%
in a datathon here, which Dame Wendy
Hall, along with her colleagues,

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.020
Ian Milligan who is
here and Matt Weber,

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.910
and Jimmy Lynn have
helped coordinate and all

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.880
of you have participated in this
exciting event here at the library.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.580
And it was developed
with the generous support

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.250
from the National Science
Foundation, the Social Sciences

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.850
and Humanities Research Council
of Canada, the Internet Archive,

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.950
Rutgers University, and
the University of Waterloo.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.560 position:56%
So, we thank all of them for helping

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.760
to support this program
here at the library.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.200
We, at the library are
cohosting this event along;

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.140
I'm sorry I should say the
library is hosting this event

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.730
with several cohosts
from within the library.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.390
Janice mentioned the John W. Kluge
Center, but I would like also

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.260
to mention a couple
of other entities here

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.670
at the library that
have participated.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.440
The Law Library of Congress,

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.410
Library's National
Digital Initiative Office

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.490
and the Web Archiving Program.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.180
Now, web archiving is
nothing new to the library.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.740
In fact, we've had a program
here since about 2000.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.320
And over the last 15 or 16 years
we've unmasked quite a bit of data,

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.050
as you can imagine, a lot.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.110
And we're not exactly sure
what we're doing with it,

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.740
in the sense that there is
just a lot of challenges,

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.550
and so it's particularly timely
that we have this datathon,

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.390
and in fact this symposium
today to talk

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.090
about the issues associated
with web archiving.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.880
The datathon yesterday and the
day before provided an opportunity

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.890 position:56%
to explore our cutting-edge research
tools and also the development

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:06.230
of a broad-based consensus on
how we can approach this issue.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.600
And so today you will hear the
culmination of those two days

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.230
of talking and discussing.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.950
And you also hear from a panel of
experts on some additional ideas.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.980
And so hopefully this will just
generate some good thoughts moving

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.970
forward and continue
moving us forward.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.550
And we would not be able to do this
of course without Dame Wendy Hall

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.460
And so it is my pleasure
now to be able

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.150
to provide a brief introduction,

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.730
although I know she doesn't need
an introduction to any of you.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.990 position:56%
We are just very, very honored that
she was able to be in residence here

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.510
at the library for the
last couple of months.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.190
She's brought with her terrific
energy, intellect, good will.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:51.330 position:56%
And we are very, very grateful that
she has spent the time and helped us

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.300
to coordinate this event.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.510
So, the datathon and today's
events I think are a testament

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.040
to your expertise.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.920
Because she's been able to gather
a group of high profile thinkers

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.480
from various disciplines across the
world to talk about saving the web.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.070
And that's really what we
really need to talk about.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.200
And it's a pressing challenge
for us here at the library,

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.910
institutions around the world,
cultural institutions as we try

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:24.080
and think about how we are going to
preserve all of this information.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.850
Just a brief snapshot
of her background.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.930
She's a professor of a computer
science at the University

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.760
of Southampton in England.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.450
She's a pioneer in research
and an early collaborator

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.290
with Tim Berners-Lee on
the development of the web,

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.490 position:56%
which build on the work of Vint
Cerf, who we're very, very delighted

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.910
to be able to welcome
to the Library today.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.300
Her work as been at the
forefront of computer science,

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.160
multimedia and hypermedia.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.900
The semantic web, and
digital libraries.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.070
And she's done this
for quite some time.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.510
Almost 30 years I think.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:03.050
[ Laughter ]

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:08.120
So, here at the Library
she has been working

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.140
on a project titled Internet
Histories and Futures.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:15.140
And on that project, she's been
using the library's collections

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.170
to explore the economic,
social and technical dimensions

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.620
that have contributed to
the development of the web

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.110
as a social technical system.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.350 position:56%
She's been the Senior Vice President
of the Royal Academy of Engineering,

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:32.270
a member of the UK Prime Minister's
Council for Science and Technology,

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.090
a founding member of
the Scientific Council

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.650
of the European Research Council,
a fellow of the Royal Society,

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.770
and most importantly
she is a Dame Commander

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.600
of the Order of the British Empire.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.510
So please join me in
welcoming Dame Wendy.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:56.230
[ Applause ]

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:57.530
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL:
Thank you very much.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.830
Thank you so much, David.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.650
I don't want to take a lot of
your time I want to thank David

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.010
and everyone at the Library of
Congress and the Kluge Center

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:07.790
for making me so welcome.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:13.230
For really helping with this event,
which we hope will be sentinel

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:17.110
in the development of this
world, this new world.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:21.240 position:56%
And I've had a wonderful time and
there will always be a special place

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.750
in my heart now for the
Library of Congress and I hope

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.350
to come back many times and visit.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:30.000
It's my, you'll hear a
bit more from me later.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.750
But it's my privilege now to
not stand very long between you

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.020
and your first keynote
speaker, Vint Cerf,

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:41.970
who doesn't need an
introduction, you have all our bios

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.270
for the speakers today on
the, well except one, Abbie.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.520
But, you have the bio of Vint.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.330 position:56%
Now, here, we wouldn't be here today
talking about this if it wasn't

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.250
for people like Vint
Cerf and Bob Kahn.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:09:00.240 position:56%
And I don't think people realize how
unbelievably seminal their work was

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.330
in creating the open
and free internet.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:09.560
And it's always in parallel
with the different forces on it.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:15.720
And we have to continue to
support the efforts of the people.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:21.180
Still led by Vint and
Bob, who work hard

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:27.070
to keep the internet alive for us.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.570
It's a very short time
in the period of history.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.260
When you look at what's happened,
you know what's here in the library

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:36.300
and other institution libraries
around the world, you know we are,

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.290
it's only decades since
we've had this.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:41.500
This is a blink of the eye in terms
of civilization, and we really,

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:45.120
really have to make sure
that we preserve its openness

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.880
and its freedom for
the future of humanity.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.510
Now, Vint has, because of his
work, is very well honored.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.130
He has received many
awards and metals.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:10:00.070
He's met every president,
every head of state, I think.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:05.180
He can outdo me on name
dropping [laugther] and that's;

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.570 position:56%
I've never met the Emperor of Japan.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:13.180
But, the wonderful thing about
Vint is he's still giving back.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.080
The fact that he's here today,
he's been on the west coast,

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.010 position:56%
we were out there, we've both
recently been presidents of the ACM.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:23.430
We were out there for the big
ACM Council and Awards Banquet.

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:27.470
He only flew back yesterday, and
tomorrow he goes to Barcelona,

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:31.120
and yet he's found time to come
here this morning to talk to us,

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:36.180
because I know on everything else
he does, he's absolutely passionate

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:43.200 position:56%
about preserving the content that is
being put onto this amazing system

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.940
that he and others created.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.510
So, without further ado, it's my
pleasure to introduce Vint Cerf.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:59.330
[ Applause ]

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:00.650
&gt;&gt; VINT CERF: Good morning
ladies and gentlemen.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:04.280
And thank you very much Wendy
for a very friendly introduction.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.450
I always get nervous when people
clap before you've said anything.

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.510
It makes me feel like
I should just sit

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.210
down because it won't
get any better than that.

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:16.600
I have the sad duty to tell
you that Bob Kahn is not going

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.450
to be able to join us today.

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:23.650 position:56%
His sister passed away on Monday
and he is in Cleveland seeing to all

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:25.390
of the things associated with that.

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:28.340
He passes along his
regrets and hopes

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:32.220
that there'll be another
opportunity for him to join us.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:37.430 position:56%
I will try to offer some information
that Bob would have given.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.000
I won't do it with
nearly the same panache

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.910
that bob does, but I'll do my best.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:47.590
So, let me start, assuming I can
get this thing to behave properly.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:51.740
All right for our next
trick ladies and gentlemen.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.180
Let's see.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.480
There we go.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.510
So, I want to introduce
a term digital vellum.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:01.090
And I want to explain that it isn't
just about the physical median.

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:07.170
This is an environment that I
would like to see become real.

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:10.160
And it has a great deal to
do with the preservation

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.500
of information associated with
online and digital content.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:20.570
So, let me begin by observing,
oh maybe it doesn't want to.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:22.670
What does that mean?

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:24.710
It has frozen.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.500
So, that's the end of my talk.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.900
I guess that's it [laugther].

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.200
Let's try.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.540
Wow, this, oh here we go.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.310
Now it's waking up.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:38.110
All right I don't know why the
other little arrows didn't work.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:39.410
But anyway.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:42.630
So, let me first of
all draw your attention

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:46.360
to something you already know and
you've spent 2 days talking about.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.070
And I'm sorry I wasn't
here to participate.

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:53.260
And that's, this is a huge problem,
and the scope is quite dramatic.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.720
For one thing, we have all
these digital structures

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.180
and they're complex, they
have many representations.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:02.290
We need vocabulary in order
to talk about this stuff.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:05.470
We need identifier spaces
in order to make reference

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:09.260
to these digital objects that
we're trying to hang on to.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.960
And we have to resolve
those references

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.380
to the actual object themselves.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:19.400
The irony of the Worldwide Web
is that the domain name system

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.060
and the URLs that are derived

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:24.110
from the domain names are
not necessarily stable.

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:28.020
As you know if you fail to pay
your annual fee for registration

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.300
that domain name may go away,
and all the URLs associated

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.730 position:56%
with it may also become unreachable.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:38.380
Everybody here has experienced
404, you know site not found.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.190
So, we need to do something
about that.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:45.070
Bob Kahn has this digital object
architecture, which I will talk

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:50.090
about later, has the
unfortunate acronym of DOA.

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:53.890
I thought maybe he ought to
come out with something else.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:58.340
But in any case, it's a
very thoughtful mechanism

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:01.810
for preserving identifiers
over long periods of time

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:05.640
that are not changing, that are
not reassigned, they're stable.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:11.070
We plainly need standards in order
to preserve this digital content.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:15.230
And the ingestion process to
bring in digital objects needs

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.140
to be pretty rigorous, because
we have to capture a great deal

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:22.680
of metadata associated
with this to acquisition.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.560
There are also these really
interesting legal questions

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.970
that arise having to
do with copyright,

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:32.520
not only on the objects themselves
or patents on the software used

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.590 position:56%
to render the objects and
licensing and other kinds of things.

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:41.760
I think that the copyright
laws should be amended in order

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.540
to give rights to agencies like
the Library of Congress that are

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.820
in the business of
digital preservation.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.170
We have this fair use
notion here in the US

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:54.870
and I think a preservation
arrangement also ought

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:57.120
to be incorporated
into our thinking.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.560
And finally, we need business
models to retain this vast

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.740
and increasing amount of digital
content over long periods of time.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.470
And here I'm not talking
about decades,

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:09.440
I'm talking about centuries.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.770
And business models for
centuries are hard to come by.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.540 position:56%
I can think of a few, there are some
breweries that have been around for

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.200
about 4 or 500 hundred years.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:22.530
And of course, there's always
the Catholic Church so, anyway.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.800
The other thing which I
find very interesting is

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:30.420
that the OAIS definitions that
I'm sure you're all familiar

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.870
with have this interesting
recursive property

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:37.690 position:56%
that you know you have these digital
representations of the objects

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:42.450
that you're preserving and there
are recursive references to this

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:44.750
until you get down to the point

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:50.330 position:56%
where there's some specific group
whose domain knowledge is sufficient

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:54.100
to correctly interpret the content
that's being preserved and at

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.320
that point has to stop somewhere.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.080
But the problem is the groups

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:02.150
that understand the details
may eventually die out,

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:05.970
in which case we may have to recur
once more in order to make sure

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:09.570
that subsequent users
have enough information

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.670
to correctly interpret the content.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:14.200
So, there's a lot of
formality hiding in here,

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.580
but it's going to be necessary.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:19.690
And of course, we'll have to
have all kinds of specializations

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:23.310
for representations for
particular kinds of data

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:27.370
and I include not simply documents
that you would typically find here

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:30.380
in this library, but also
scientific data, data collection

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.560
from space missions at
NASA and data coming

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.900
from the large hadron collider.

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:40.000
All of that stuff is digital
content worthy of preservation.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.510
So, it needs to by systematic.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:47.780
I'm not necessarily arguing that
the OAIS concepts are the only ones

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.210
that can be applied here.

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:52.460
But, they certainly are
representative of the style

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.720
that I think is necessary.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:00.040
And within our own
research organizations here

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:05.530
in the United States, PCAST and
the OSTP have strongly recommended

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:10.930 position:56%
that research sponsored by the US
government should incorporate saving

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:16.410
of the data, software and metadata
associated with that research

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.430
so that it can be made
available in perpetuity

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:22.630
to the future researchers.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:26.740 position:56%
I also think that if we're going to
build archives, we better build more

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:30.400
than one for the possibility
that only one goes away

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.740
and then everything is lost.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:35.110
So, distributing the information

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:38.910
across multiple archives
strikes me as a wise move.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.700
And finally, we need
policy frameworks

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:45.830
that will provide incentives
for people to build

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.350
and operate these archives.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.080
So, let me switch gears
for a moment.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:54.630
Move into some of the more
substantive questions.

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.900
One of them has to do with
how we archive static content.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.780
Some of you will notice
that there are certain media

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.950
that are blasted for
quite a long time.

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:08.790
By accident in some cases like
these cuneiform tablets that were,

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.570
you know essentially made on clay.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:15.480
Most of them were intended to be
reused, except the fires burned

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.980
down some of the archives and baked
the clay into its permanent form.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.660
Which is why we still
have some of them.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:27.210 position:56%
Now, what I don't like about this is
preservation by accident [laugther].

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:30.490
I think that those of us in this
room should be paying attention

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:35.000
to preservation on purpose and we
should have ways of doing that.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.860
Now, we've also seen
other documents.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.760
Vellum for example is
quite a resilient material.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.740 position:56%
Which is why I thought the term
digital vellum captured a little bit

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.070
of that notion.

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:48.730 position:56%
Unfortunately, I think that to
preserve all the digital information

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:52.280
on real vellum, it would
require a lot of goats and sheep.

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.270
And more than exist
even in New Zealand.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:19:00.760
So, we need to do something
comparable with different media.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.220
And we've all seen the accidental
preservation of [inaudible]

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.610
for example, because it happened
to have been stored in a cave

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:09.950
in a dessert where it was dry.

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:13.320
But, again, I don't want
preservation by accident.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:18.000
Now, when digital technologies
emerged over the past 70 years,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.500
people got very excited
because bits seemed

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.900
to have this ethereal
ability to just live forever.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.190
After all, they're just
logical bits, right?

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.960
But they actually have
physical manifestations.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.000
And I will tell you showing up here
at the Library of Congress a decade

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.950
and a half ago with some CD-ROMs,

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:39.900
thinking look at all
the data we can store

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.460
on such a small amount of space.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.520
I'm so proud of myself.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:49.610
And one of the librarians here
came back with a vellum manuscript.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:54.570
It was 1000 years old, and still
as readable today as it was then.

00:19:54.570 --> 00:20:00.190
And if you happen to speak, you
know in ancient Greek, etcetera.

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:06.410 position:56%
And she said to me, and how long
will your polycarbonate CD-ROM last?

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:09.500
And of course, I didn't have
a very good answer for that.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.660
It might only be 20 years
before it delaminates.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.090
But the more severe
problem is that the reader

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.620
for it might not be
available for it either.

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.270
Not even in the Smithsonian,

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:21.370
or if it is it might
not be in workable form.

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:27.250
So, you see all these examples
of media that have come and gone.

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:29.970
If you buy Macintosh
equipment like I do,

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:31.550 position:56%
you might have regretted discovering

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:34.460
that the latest versions don't
have a CD-ROM reader in them

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.870
at all to save space I guess.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.730
But it means that my stack of media

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:41.780
that I carefully accumulated
is no longer useful

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.150
because I can't read it.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:44.450
So, that's a serious problem.

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:45.750
And it gets worse.

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:49.020
I mean we have all these
other media, like YouTube,

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.680
and Flickr and Picasa and so on.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.460
All these online media.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:56.440
So, what I tell other audiences,
you know this as well as anyone,

00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.100
but I try to give them a sense
for why this is important.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.420
So, those of you, I hope who
have read, "A Team of Rivals"

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:08.590
by Doris Kearns Goodwin will have
noticed how well she reproduced the

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:10.150
conversations of the time.

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:12.650
It felt like she had
been a fly on the wall,

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:15.420
although we knew she
wasn't there in the 1860s.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:16.720
So, how did she do that?

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.980
Well she ran around to I
don't know how many libraries.

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.580
I put 100 down here
just as a placeholder.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:26.070
But she got the correspondence
of the principles in this story.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:27.660
So, she knew what they
were talking about

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:31.070
and how they expressed themselves,
and what positions they took.

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:33.950
And she was able to
reproduce the conversations

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:36.370
in what I thought was
a very credible way.

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:40.070
So, imagine that you're a 22nd
century Doris Kearns Goodwin

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.810
and you're trying to
reproduce the tenner

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.680
of the times in the 21st century.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.110
What will she find.

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.230
You know will the National
Archives have anything useful

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:51.530
to share with us?

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:53.290
What about all the
emails and the Tweets,

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:55.770
and the blogs and everything else.

00:21:55.770 --> 00:22:00.650
Will any of that be
render-able in the 22nd century.

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:02.470
And the answer is we don't know.

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:05.950
And I think that we don't have
very good answers at this point.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:07.670
And it gets even more complicated.

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:12.250
When you think about executable
content, this is not static stuff.

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:14.720
This requires interpretation
by software.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.030
People are interacting with it.

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:17.540
It's not just games.

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:21.070
I mean there are other
kinds of applications too.

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:25.560
Things like spreadsheets and so on,
which are things you interact with.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.030
A static version of the
spreadsheet is typically a snapshot

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:30.330
of its current values.

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:33.390
But the value of the spreadsheet is
the ability to put different values

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.880
in and have software run.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.630
So, we have this executable
content that we have to think

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:44.000
about in the archival context.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.580 position:56%
So, there are a bunch of challenges.

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:49.080
And I suppose over the last
few days, you've been talking

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.320
about these and others,
but I will remind you

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.290
of the ones that come to my mind.

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:55.900
One is figuring out what
the bits mean at all.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.140
The second one is the
metadata capture.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:01.590
The third is hanging on to
executable code or source code

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:04.210
if we can get it and
then it's this question

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:07.510
of how do I figure out
how to run old code.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:12.650
And I've been using kind
of sort of a metaphor here.

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:16.160
If you could take a
digital x-ray of a computer

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:20.900
when it has the operating system,
the application, the actual files

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.450
that its working on
plus the hardware,

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:27.310
and you could take a snapshot of
all that and then re-instantiate it

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.530
by emulating the hardware and
running the old operating system

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:32.420
and putting the application on it.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:35.510
You might actually be able
to preserve the capability

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:38.470
to run all this old software
over long periods of time.

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:41.970
Of course, you also have to have a
place to store all of this stuff.

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:47.880
So, we have to have
affordable large scale memory.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:52.450
Now, unfortunately, we live in a
world which is filled with change.

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:53.750
And one of the things is

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:55.710
that companies don't
necessarily last forever.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:57.380
So, they go bankrupt.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.760
And some of their assets
turn out to be things

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.060
that get sold to other people.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:04.680
So, if a company goes bankrupt
that made the application software

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.910 position:56%
that you use to produce new content,

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:10.960
and you say after the company
goes bankrupt, can I have a copy

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.920
of the program, can I
have the source code?

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.220
And the bankruptcy judge
says no unless you want

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:18.520
to pay $6 million for this asset.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.940
So, or you have companies that just
say I can't support this anymore.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.480
I'm not going to make it run.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:28.130 position:56%
It, being an application, run on
the current day's operating systems,

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.580
or next year's operating systems.

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.180
And now you're stuck,
because either you have

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.240
to keep using the old operating
system to use the old application,

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.310
or you have to hope somebody
can translate the documents

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:42.510
that you've produced, or the
object you produced into something

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:44.470
that het new software
will interpret.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:46.770
And we know that not everybody
is going to pay attention

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:48.720
to backward compatibility.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.240 position:56%
So, there are really tough problems.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:56.370
So, there's questions about who
owns the software in addition

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:58.290
to who owns the digital objects.

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:02.620
And under which circumstances
you have access to that software.

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.580
And so again I keep thinking
we need legal frameworks

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:08.920
that provide exceptions
for preservation purposes.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:12.380
So, there is a project at
Carnegie Mellon, which I hope some

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.530
of you may already know
about, called Olive,

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:18.070
which is like the thing you
put in your cocktail glass.

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:22.000
This is being run, or was
run under in a self-support

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.890
by Mahadev Satyanarayanan.

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:27.530
We call him Satya for
obvious reasons.

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.760
And this was a very
successful effort

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.100
to essentially emulate old hardware

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.770
and run old operating
systems on the system.

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:38.230
Now, this is not easy.

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:40.100
It might sound like
it's easy, but it's not.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.750
There's a whole lot of thing
that have to be emulated

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.830
or correctly identified
in order to make it work.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:48.540
One of them is making sure you
understand exactly how the old

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:51.980
hardware works so you
can emulate exactly how

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:56.880
that hardware executes instructions
on a virtual environment.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.110
Then you have to be able to
bring in the operating system

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:01.120
and the applications and so on.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:05.080 position:56%
And that includes all the library's
executable libraries that are needed

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.060
to make the applications work.

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.410
So, it just goes on and on.

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:10.740
Language settings have to
be known I mean like what

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.930
if this is an application
that was you know written

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:17.140
for Bulgarian instead of English
or French, or something else.

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:20.530
So, there's a whole lot of
details that have to be remembered

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:23.810
and replicated in order
to make this stuff work.

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:27.950
And that's why this term digital
x-ray seemed so attractive.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:32.060
Now, what was very interesting
is that he said well, all right.

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:38.720
So, I'm going ingest into
this space of preservation all

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:42.200
of the description of hardware,
all of the operating system,

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.370
all the executable libraries,
all of the application.

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:49.070
Plus, the actual object that's
being interpreted and incorporate

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:52.300
that into a great big bundle
and run it as a virtual,

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.950
in a virtual machine environment.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:59.690
And in his first work he did
this on laptop, that was capable

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:01.820
of emulating other hardware.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:06.840
But he had an idea that this is so,
these virtual machines are so big,

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.790
that he ought to find
some alternative way

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:12.300
of running the software and
then having to draw it all

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.410
into one box all at once.

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:18.910
So, he got this idea about
using this streaming video,

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:23.250
which all of us see on YouTube and
other applications as a metaphor

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:26.140
for pulling only that
which is needed

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:30.070
from this gigantic virtual machine
into the executing environment.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:35.840
And so, it's sort of like a paging
system in a time-shared machine.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.900
So, it's actually not
too easy though.

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:41.640
In the case of streaming video,
it's pretty well ordered.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.150
You just pull in the next frame.

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:44.750
And if you want to get a
little ahead of the game,

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:47.510
you pull in a few more
frames ahead of time so that

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:51.400
if there's some stuttering in the
network you don't see a flicker

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.580
in the video or a stutter
in the audio.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:59.320 position:56%
But in the case of a virtual machine
execution, if you're taking pages

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:02.450
of software in, the
program jumps around.

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:05.210
And so, the pages that are
needed are not necessarily just

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:06.840
in simple sequential order.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.680
So, you have to be pretty
clever about drawing in pieces

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:14.470
of the virtual machine as
needed in order to execute that.

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:18.690
So, he basically uses demand
paging, which is to say

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:21.980
if you're executing a piece of code
and it needs to get to another part

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:25.920
of the executable program, you just
pull the page in when it's needed,

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.360 position:56%
but then you try to watch what the
patterns are and you pre-fetch pages

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.080
to avoid delay in order
to make this work.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.630
So, I know that you don't want
to dive, I assume you don't want

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:36.690
to dive too deep into all this.

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:39.870
So, I'm not going to talk
about every single layer

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:41.800
in this architecture,
except to say that it's

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.550 position:56%
like any other conventional machine,

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:46.360
except you run a virtual
machine kernel

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:50.330
so that it can emulate
the hardware of machines

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:51.630
that are no longer available,

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:55.040
and then you run the operating
system inside of that environment

00:28:55.040 --> 00:29:00.940
and then run the application so
the virtual machine image has all

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:04.600
of this stuff that's needed
and it's expressed in XML

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.210
so this looks like
a web application.

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:10.740
So, you can imagine simply
running on a computer connected

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.990 position:56%
to the internet something that looks
like it's connected to a server

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:17.530
on the Worldwide Web and
it's pulling in XML pages,

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:21.740
but in fact what it's doing is
running this virtual machine.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:25.670
So, this is sort of an
image of what it looks like.

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:31.760
He's using the QEMU, QEMU
KVM kernel virtual machine.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.600
And then, for example, he
was running Microsoft Windows

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.410
and he was running an
app on top of that.

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:40.400
He has a cache which
is the clean cache,

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:44.370
which hasn't experienced
any execution.

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:48.690 position:56%
And then as the program runs, he
has to keep track of what's changed.

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:50.640
And he goes out and pulls stuff in.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:54.750
So, the way this tends to work
is that you can even run this

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:57.100
in such a way that the
virtual machine is not even

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.120
on your desktop or laptop.

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:03.320
It's actually running in the cloud.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:10.500
And the only thing that you
present to the client is the image.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.170
Some of you may even remember
something called X Windows

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:17.350
that was developed at MIT, which
had a similar kind of notion,

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:20.990
you just displayed the bits that
were appropriate on the screen.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:23.800
And all the other execution,
including the generation

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.730
of the display was done
back in the server.

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:30.200
So, we can certainly
consider doing that as well,

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:34.060
in order to limit was is
needed on the client side.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:38.350
So, we still have a long way
before we're done with all of this.

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:42.520
For one thing, actually handling
this increasingly large virtual

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:47.050
machine structure is not so
easy, and yet we are expanding,

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:51.780 position:56%
those of us who build cloud systems,
Google and Microsoft, and IBM,

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:56.890
and elsewhere, Amazon, are building
larger, and larger capacity systems

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:59.860
with multicore processors
and more and more memory.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:03.210
But the hardest part seems to be
getting precession in the emulation

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:08.070
of the hardware, including mistakes
that have been made I the hardware

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:10.650
that the application
actually relied on,

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:12.900
even though it was a bug
in the hardware design.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.310
And so, getting that
accurately is tricky.

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:19.060
And not all machine designers
are necessarily willing to hand

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:22.890
out to you the details of
their hardware instruction set.

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:26.340
And so, here's another example of
a kind of exception one would look

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.640
for for preservation purposes.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:35.490 position:56%
I think just I won't go through this
list completely but the idea here is

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:40.010
for us to recognize that
we're going to need expertise

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:43.990
in the hardware space and
the operating system space.

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:47.260
And if we're going to make
this a general-purpose notion,

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.510 position:56%
we have to ask ourselves will people

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:51.530
who write operating
systems be willing

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:53.510
to part with the source code?

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:56.940
Will they be willing to make
available executable object code?

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.250
Will they be willing to
do this on a regular basis

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:00.940
for purposes of preservation?

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:05.430
Will they allow execution
of the emulated hardware

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:08.840
and the emulated operating
system for thousands of people

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:11.250
and not necessarily
get paid for that.

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:15.990
At some point the patents
expire, the other rights expire

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:20.260
and the general public needs to
have access to these executables

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:24.810 position:56%
if they're going to be able to
reference material which doesn't run

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:26.570
in any other environment.

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:30.620 position:56%
This should be of personal concern
to those of you who produce content.

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:36.000 position:56%
Because if you experience, like I
have material produced 20 years ago,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.230
that no longer is accessible.

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:41.380
I have PowerPoint slides from 1997

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:43.870
that don't run on today's
PowerPoint.

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:47.160
And this is not a gratuitous dig at
Microsoft, I'm not expecting them

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.690
to be able to run backward
compatibility for 20 years.

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:53.730
But it's really a shock
when you pull up something

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:58.030
that you worked hard on and realize
that it's not available anymore.

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:00.630
And its content has been lost.

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:06.360
And so, I actually kept an old IBM
ThinkPad around running Windows XP

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.040
and an old version of
Microsoft, that just happens

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:12.440
to reach far enough back
to pick up those pages,

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.640 position:56%
but I've had to reproduce the pages.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:18.570
So, I want to turn now, so
this is one part of the story.

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:21.510
And it's using virtual
machine technology in order

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:24.750
to preserve executability
over a long period of time.

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:27.940
But I want to turn now to
the self-archiving web idea.

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:35.460
This notion was first introduced
to me last year by Tim Berners-Lee

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.460
and David Reid and Brewster Kahle.

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:43.600
And their idea was that the
web is this femoral thing.

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:47.000
We all realize that the web
is what it is in the instant.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.510
It doesn't automatically
archive itself,

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:52.110
it doesn't remember previous pages.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:57.090
And so, all we see when we
go online is today's web.

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:00.290
We don't see yesterday's
web or yester year's web.

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:01.590
And that's a pity.

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:04.080
Because seeing things over a period

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:07.730
of time can often be
extremely illuminating.

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:13.660 position:56%
I've been told more than once that
content that might be very important

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:17.160
to understanding our
history may not appear

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:19.630
to be important for
quite a long time.

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:21.500
A hundred years, two hundred years.

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:26.830 position:56%
Until finally we realize looking
back, this document, that decisions,

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:31.010
this website marked an
important moment in our history,

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:32.650
but we didn't know that at the time

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:34.850
because we didn't have
enough perspective.

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:39.200
And so, preservation of this
content is really important.

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.250
So, I've been thinking
a lot about this.

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:43.180
And I think the success

00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:46.790
of the internet might teach
us a few lessons about how

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:49.670
to approach a self-archiving
web design.

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:53.390
One of them is that collaboration
and cooperation were essential

00:34:53.390 --> 00:34:54.890
to the internet's evolution.

00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:57.470
Bob Kahn and I may
have started all this.

00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:00.590
But believe me it took millions
of people and still does

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:06.980 position:56%
to keep the network going, and
growing, and changing, and evolving.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:10.710
And the atmosphere around
its creation invited that.

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:12.530
It's a very open design.

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:16.360
Anyone with an idea was free
to express that idea and try

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:18.870
to persuade others that they
should adopt those ideas.

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:21.420
And in the internet
engineering task force

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:24.840
where the standards are
made, that process continues.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:29.270
Arguments are based on merit
not based on anything else.

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:32.220
And if your ideas are
accepted they get implemented.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.520
And if they aren't they don't.

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:36.690
But the other thing
that was important is

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:40.940
that we published the design
openly, without any restrictions,

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:44.680
which is kind of amazing when you
consider this was done in 1973

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.540
in the middle of the Cold War.

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:50.630 position:56%
And we just published the details of
the architecture and the protocols.

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:55.220
People have asked us how did
you get permission to do that?

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:57.290
And the answer is,
well we didn't ask.

00:35:57.290 --> 00:36:00.240
But we had a rationale for it.

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.090
We said, okay we want
this to be available

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:05.760
to the American Defense
Department so they don't have

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.710
to buy a particular brand of
machine in order to network them.

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:14.690
Because back then we had SNA for
IBM, we had DECnet for digital.

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:17.050
But we didn't think the Defense
Department should be forced

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:19.860
into buying only one brand
of machine to have network.

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:23.020
So, we said let's do a
nonproprietary design.

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:26.960
And then we said, our allies will
probably need access to this too,

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:29.540
because we'll want them to be
able to interwork in a command

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:31.900
and control system built on top.

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.030
Then we said, well okay,
so who are our allies?

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:37.020
And well, we could answer
that question in 1973.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:40.120
But we said, well who will
they be 25 years from now?

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.420
And we weren't sure.

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.580
We looked back 25 years and
realized that the allies of today,

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:49.680
that is '73, were different from
the ones, you know 25 years ago.

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:53.850
So, we assumed that we would not
know who our allies were 25 years

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:55.330
from now and since
this needed to work,

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:57.210
we said everybody has
to be able to do it.

00:36:57.210 --> 00:37:00.060
So, we just published openly
and said, if you can build stuff

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:02.270
that works this way
and find somebody

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:04.170
to connect to, it should work.

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:07.270
And so, the internet grew in
a very organic way precisely

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:08.670
for that reason.

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:11.960
We also said, we didn't care
what the business model was.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:14.320
And so, we said just,
it has to work this way,

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.980
but we don't care what
your business model is.

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:19.200
So, we have nonprofit networks
and we have for profit networks,

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.590
government operated
networks, private networks

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:25.170
like the ones you run at home with
your Wi-Fi service that connect

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:26.470
into the rest of the internet.

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:31.350
We were also very conscious of
hiding information among the layers

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:34.240
of the architecture,
so that the IT packets

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:36.040
or the internet protocol
packets didn't have

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:37.910 position:56%
to know how they were being carried.

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:41.680
So, new technology could be swept
in without changing that protocol.

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.980
We also said that the little
internet package should be

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.280
pretty stupid.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.580
They don't know what
they're carrying.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.640
All they know is they're
carrying bits.

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.010
They don't know what the bits mean.

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:52.630
And that was good because if
you added a new application,

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:55.880
all you had to do was reinterpret
the bits at the edges of the net.

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.250
You didn't have to
change the network,

00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:59.580
because the network didn't
know and it didn't care.

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:01.290
And so, this kind of modularity

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:04.210
and information hiding
has been vastly helpful

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:07.580
in allowing new applications
to be built on the network.

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:12.040
And so of course out of many
one that is the internet.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:17.630
So, I gave a version of this
talk out at the Internet Archive,

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:20.530
Brewster Kahle's operation,
which you should visit

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:23.480
because it's an old
Christian Science Church,

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:26.320
and he even has the
pews are still there.

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:29.190
And in the back, he has
all the petabytes of memory

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:31.480
that are stored away
with the flashing lights.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.570
And he has a whole
bunch of mannequins

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:36.080
that are sitting on the pews.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.870
He moved them off to the right and
left so that we had our meeting,

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:42.310
you know live people could
be sitting in the pews.

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:44.830
I only accepted questions
from the mannequins

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:46.520
on the left and the right.

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.360
Safety measure.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:52.290
So, I've been thinking a
little bit about what kinds

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:55.180
of technology we have to
incorporate into our thinking

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:57.130
for our digital preservation.

00:38:57.130 --> 00:39:00.090
Compression schemes, in
order to use the, you know,

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:06.390
lease amount of space, tarball
thing like that, which are common.

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:13.380
And we need to store and
recover, up until now,

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:14.680
this notion of compression

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.790
and everything else involves
particular objects that get stored

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:19.640
and then fully recovered.

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.430
But the Worldwide Web is
a much more complex thing,

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:24.700
because it's got pages
that point to other pages.

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:27.140
It's a complex, it's a web.

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:32.800
And so, figuring out how to
retain that part in addition

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.140
to the particular objects
is important.

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:39.980
So just preserving the webpage with
this HTML without the ability to go

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:44.290
where the links went, or to
go to a place that replicates

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:47.700
where the links went, means what we
have a very static representation

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:50.710
of the net, we don't
understand its connectivity.

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:55.880 position:56%
And we obviously have to think about
webpages that change over time.

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.590
So, how do we keep track of
which versions we're looking at?

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:02.160
The programmers do this all the
time with programmers' workbench

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.860
and things of that sorts.

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:07.740
So, this Worldwide Web is a
really complex reference structure

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:10.420
so we have to deal with that.

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:14.990
So, Brewster, Brewster Kahle has
been running the Internet Archive

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:18.520
for at least 15 years,
maybe more, 20?

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:25.610 position:56%
And it's taking snapshots of the
Worldwide Web and storing them away.

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:27.050
It's indexed in time.

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:30.950
So, he has a way back machine that
lets you see what the web looked

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:34.280
like at a certain year,
or a certain month.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:37.160
He also has to do something
with the hyperlinks.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.710
Because it's pretty clear
that if you just copy the page

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:43.590 position:56%
and its hyperlinks, 10 years from
now, or maybe even tomorrow clicking

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:47.800 position:56%
on the link might fail because the
destination isn't available anymore.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.960 position:56%
So, he has to convert the hyperlinks
into something that he can point

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:55.810
to inside the space of
his internet archive.

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:59.750
So, he has to essentially
virtualize all of that.

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:02.540
So, it's a self-contained system.

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:05.770
And he has to be crawling the
web constantly, just like we do

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:07.940
at Google to create the index.

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:12.990
And then there's this
question of when is a page new?

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:15.130
And you certainly wouldn't
want pages

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:17.710
to be snapshot every time
you change one character.

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:21.820
So, we have to have some kind of a
notion about publishing of a page,

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:25.510
saying I know what this page
version to be seen by everybody.

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:28.580
So, that's an instant in time
that should mark when you want

00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:31.500
to capture the web, that webpage.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:35.530
And then I keep thinking about
trying to capture everything that's

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:38.940 position:56%
on the web, and I thought about that
philosophical problem do the set

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:42.200
of all sets contain itself,
and I decided not to think

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.920
about that anymore, because
it gave me a headache.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:48.840
So, I'm sorry you might
want to get a cup of coffee.

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:52.450
So, I worry also about the
amount of space required

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:56.160
to retain the evolving
web, it's history,

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:59.070
because it can barely
contain itself as it is.

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:01.240
I mean there's you know
all this space is taken

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.600
up by all these webpages.

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:07.190
And so, there's this idea of
lots of copies keep things safe,

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:12.620
but I'm kind of worried about how
much storage we actually can afford

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:14.550 position:56%
to retain over long periods of time.

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:17.910
So, we have to be thoughtful
about that.

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:20.170
I'll come back to digital
object identifiers

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:23.810
when I give me Vint Cerf
version of outcomes talk.

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:28.260
And then there is this
other question about HTML,

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:31.800
which itself has been evolving,
it's gone from the original HTML

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:36.590
to various versions, to
XML, to HTML 5 and so on.

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:38.410
It's going to keep changing too.

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:42.100
And so, whatever we do in terms of
archiving is going to have to take

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:46.410
that into account because the
HTML of the webpage is just going

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:51.350
to change over time and our ability
to interpret that is going to have

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:55.450
to keep up with that evolutions,
and then I relay it back

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:57.900
to permissions and access control.

00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:01.430
Some contents may be
access controlled now

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:05.050
for copyright reasons,
or for monetary reasons.

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:09.980
And yet 100 years from now those
constraints may no longer be valid

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:12.180
and we have to understand
when it's going

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:14.880
to be okay to make access open.

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:17.860
And so, this creates a
fairly complex environment,

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:22.680
where we literally have to keep
track of the access controls

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:28.320
and rights of every one of the
objects pointed to in the archive.

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:34.240
So, I keep thinking about how
to make this more automatic.

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:38.440
And one possibility is that
while you're creating webpages,

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:44.880
and launching them by saying I want
to publish, is that the environment

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.510
that we use to say, oh and by
the way this page now needs

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:50.500
to be archived.

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:54.800
And can we make that kind of a
standard and cooperative practice?

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:58.320
I keep thinking about Google Docs
and one of the interesting things

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:01.130
about Google Docs is
that we replicate these

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:05.180
across our multiple data centers
to keep from losing anything.

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:08.920
We actually also allow multiple
parties to edit these documents

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.880
at the same time, which
is absolutely amazing.

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:14.280
We don't get confused
and lose things.

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:15.730
But the idea of replicating

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:19.420
over multiple storage environments
is going to have to be part

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:23.220
of this archival process as well.

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:28.570 position:56%
Then, we have this problem of making
references to the various objects.

00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:33.530
And so, the web archiving
entities whoever they are may need

00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:38.940
to have some common reference space
so that each of them can ingest

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:43.500
and correctly regurgitate
pages on demand.

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:46.900
So, if they don't have a
common reference frame,

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:51.120
reference terminology, and
reference space, that won't work.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.070
And so, I keep thinking,
that Google,

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:55.490
you know does this sharding
thing where we take objects

00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:58.650
and we break them all up and
spread them across multiple sites

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:01.850
in the Google Drive and I'm
hoping that I can convince some

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:06.180
of the Google executives that we
should be a party to this as well.

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:08.460
So, here's some more
thinking out loud.

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.350
Some of you will be
familiar with publish

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:12.330
and subscribe protocol regimes.

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:16.520
And this feels to me like
it might be a place where,

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:20.320
that notion could be used as
part of the archiving process.

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:23.500
You know I declare this
webpage now archivable.

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:28.800
And so please publish that fact
to the archiving community.

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.880
Some of them may ingest
the pages, some may not.

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:36.640
They may choose to ingest pages of
certain type or certain content.

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:41.680
We want that to be flexible so
that we don't force every archive

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:46.350
to archive everything, but
we want it to be rich enough

00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:50.780
that we can archive almost
everything over the sum of all

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:53.060
of the archiving processes.

00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:56.190
Plainly, we need a lot of
metadata and so we'll have

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:57.610
to have a way to express that.

00:45:57.610 --> 00:46:00.900
We'll have to have agreements
about how that gets captured

00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:02.890
and how it gets interpreted.

00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:05.980
And then there's this rending
of the digital objects.

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:10.190
And whether it's just presenting
them or interacting with them,

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:13.430
we have to have all the software
that's needed in order to do that.

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:16.630
And that has to be preserved
over a period of time again,

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:19.650
and back to the virtual
machine notion.

00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:22.560
And then there's this
permission to use question.

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.860
How do we represent that?

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:27.620
How do we validate parties
who are accessing the content?

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:30.620
At which point can we say the
content is no longer controlled

00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:33.320
and protected because its
copyrights have expired

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:36.600 position:56%
or other rights are no longer valid?

00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:44.920
So, if we're trying to surf the
self-archiving web, one question is

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:50.670
which of the archives do we go
to when we make a page reference.

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:53.760
And figuring out how to resolve

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:58.280
to multiple targets is
another part of this problem.

00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:00.060
Because there should
be multiple targets.

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:04.020 position:56%
If I go to a particular webpage that
I'm trying to get to, I should have,

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:09.060
the resolution system should
give me different choices

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.980
because there should be multiple
places where I can go to get

00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:14.860
that content, otherwise
we're back at risk

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:19.470
that that one place goes away.

00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:24.970
This, you know how newspapers, and
magazines and books are snapshots

00:47:24.970 --> 00:47:27.620
of a particular work in time.

00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:31.710
We have editions of newspapers;
we have editions of magazines.

00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:37.340
I kind of wonder at what rate
we should be snapshotting the

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:38.700
Worldwide Web.

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:40.310 position:56%
And I don't know the answer to that.

00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:41.610
Probably part of it is the rate

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:44.750
at which things are changing
determine how often we

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:46.050
should snapshot.

00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:48.360
But I'd really rather have a clue

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:50.230
that something is worth
snapshotting,

00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:52.170
as opposed to simply
taking a million pictures

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:55.370
and hoping some of
them are appropriate.

00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:56.670
So, what else?

00:47:56.670 --> 00:48:00.480
Well, properties that would be
attractive, automatic archiving

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:03.160
when you declare that
you're publishing.

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:06.810
Is it a service that
you sign up for?

00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:09.550
How is that funded?

00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:13.020
What about registering
the software that's needed

00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:18.910 position:56%
to interpret the webpages, and a
permission system that goes with it.

00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:23.660
And now what do we do about stuff
that turns out to be malware?

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:27.990
Do we want to archive that and
if we do, if we archive it,

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:31.210
do we have a way to mark it so that
if you're going in the archive,

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:34.730
you don't accidentally ingest
a serious virus or something

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:38.450
because you were out there
in the digital stacks?

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:41.390
So, we may want that, you
know for history purposes

00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:44.170
to understand what the threats
were in this online environment,

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:46.140
but we also have to protect people.

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:48.470
So, we have to recognize
what we're going.

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:52.310
And then there's this
fidelity of the experience

00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:53.700
in the online environment.

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:56.410
You know, one thing is just
to look at the webpage itself

00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:59.690
without actually being able
to execute any of the links.

00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:02.920
But something deeper
than that is the ability

00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:05.120
to actually exercise the webpage

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:09.030
as it would have been
when it was running.

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:16.990
So, what happens once
a page is archived?

00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:18.950 position:56%
Do we make sure that it's indelible?

00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:23.850 position:56%
Do we do digital signatures on it to
make sure that it can't be changed?

00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:25.500
That might turn out to be important

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:28.480
because in a court case you
don't want somebody to say,

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:34.020
my webpage had the following
things on it in 1997, or 2005.

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:35.800
But you can change it in order to,

00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.500
you know modify the
court's decisions.

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:41.830
You don't want that to happen
if you're going to attribute

00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:45.630
to the storage system
legal validity.

00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:51.830
What about if we make the
self-archiving web work,

00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:54.310
will some of the records be
considered official records

00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:57.770
like the ones that go
into the National Archive?

00:49:57.770 --> 00:50:00.430
What happens if the
content's encrypted?

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:01.730
So, now we have some problem

00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:04.000
because we can't see it
unless we have the keys,

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.750
but where do we store the keys?

00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:09.190
And who's responsible for
key management, and you know,

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:11.980
anybody who's ever
forgotten their password,

00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:14.440
will appreciate how
hard it is to keep keys

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:17.700
around for decrypting content.

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:20.320
And then there's this
access control question

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.980
that keeps coming up all the time.

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:28.070
So, some of you will have some
familiarity with the notion

00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.190
of containers that's
starting to come along

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:33.550
in online cloud environment.

00:50:33.550 --> 00:50:38.560
Containers are actually kind of
interesting because they are a way

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:41.980
of boxing together everything you
need in order to execute something.

00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:44.500
So, this is very much like
the digital realm environment

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:46.810
that I imagine.

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:50.360
And so, it could be that we have
in our hands some technology

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:55.980
that will help us do this automatic
archiving and rendering of the web

00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:58.480
over time because the
container has everything

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.490
in it that we need to do that.

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:03.890
There are some other projects
that you all know about

00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:06.120
and we've already mentioned
some of them anyway,

00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:08.690
that the internet archive
being obvious.

00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:11.550
The Library of Alexandria
in Alexandria Egypt is one

00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:13.630
of the backup sites for
the internet archive.

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:15.710
And I think there's something
delicious about that.

00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:17.490
It seems very appropriate.

00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:21.090
Ismail Serageldin is
the librarian there.

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:23.770
Soon to retire he says.

00:51:23.770 --> 00:51:26.020
A big lose in my view.

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:28.950
But it's important
that whatever we do

00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:31.940
that we have multiple
archives for this content.

00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:35.480
The Computer History Museum has
been saving the software as well

00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:39.440 position:56%
as computing artifacts, software is
being saved in the internet archive.

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.660
Google has been scanning books

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:45.670
and the cultural institute has
been capturing images from many,

00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:47.850
many museums around the world.

00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:51.110
And then finally, there's the
digital object architecture

00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:52.690
that Bob Kahn's worked on.

00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:55.950
And with permission, I'd like
to give you a brief rendering

00:51:55.950 --> 00:52:02.540
of that process, because I believe
it can play a very important role

00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:06.050
in the implementation of
the self-archiving web.

00:52:06.050 --> 00:52:14.680
So, in order to do that, I need
to go pick up these slides.

00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:24.820
Now, I should warn you that this
is me trying to channel Bob Kahn.

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:29.410
And so, I'm not sure that I will do
this beautifully, but I will try.

00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:34.320 position:56%
So, the first thing is that this
digital object architecture uses the

00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:35.670
term handle system.

00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:37.950
Its handles are kind
of like domain names.

00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:41.010
They're references
to digital objects.

00:52:41.010 --> 00:52:46.000
And once you have this handle, when
you resolve it, it takes you to,

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.900
or points you to that
digital object.

00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:50.420 position:56%
So, the handle is a permanent thing.

00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:52.670
That's a sign, it doesn't
get changed.

00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:54.790
Never gets reassigned
to anything else.

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:56.870
And in theory doesn't disappear.

00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:58.520
This stuff is in use.

00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:02.040
So, I am not speculating at
this point, I am telling you

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:05.440
about something which is
actually functioning and in use

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:08.880
and you can see a list here,
which I won't read to you.

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:12.640
So, the important part
here is that stuff

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.440
that works is really important.

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.660
I mean it's sort of
like the internet.

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:18.710
Things that work persist.

00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:20.830
And I'm hoping that the
handle system will have

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:23.080
that property as well.

00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:25.440
So, there's pieces
in this architecture.

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.620
There's the client that's
trying to get access

00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:30.880
to an object by way of a handle.

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:34.140
There is discovering what
resources are available

00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:35.600
down in the lower left.

00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:37.110
You know where can I go?

00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:38.950
In order to get things.

00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:41.190
Where, how do I find something?

00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:46.180
So, I need a resolution system
in the lower right for you.

00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:48.680
And then finally, you
want to go to a place

00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:50.190
where the objects are located.

00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:54.100
And so, this very simple,
conceptual architecture made

00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:57.370
up of these four components.

00:53:57.370 --> 00:53:59.500
So, here's an object.

00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:02.040
It's in the architecture.

00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:04.980
The digital object is
in the architecture

00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:08.770
as a first-class citizen
in the internet.

00:54:08.770 --> 00:54:13.030
So, the notion of digital object
becomes a first-class concept.

00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:16.360
So, we want to be able to
take these objects as objects,

00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:19.120
move them around, store
them away, recover them,

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:21.160
interpret them, and so on.

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:23.280 position:56%
These things could be quite complex.

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:25.620
They can have all different
kinds of content in them.

00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:28.300
Could be video, could be
audio, could be a mix of that.

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:30.110
Could be executables.

00:54:30.110 --> 00:54:32.870
Virtually anything you
can digitize should be,

00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:36.040
you know implementable
as a digital object.

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:40.060 position:56%
And the whole idea behind the handle
system is that it helps you find

00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:43.250
where is it and what am
I allowed to do with it.

00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:44.630
So, here's the digital object.

00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:46.010
It has information in it.

00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:47.480
It has the type of content.

00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:51.100
It has the unique identifier
and it responds to requests

00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:53.090
to render itself, for example,

00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:59.630
or to deliver some content
and it gets distributed.

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:02.870
So, here's an example, here's
"Hamlet" which is a work.

00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:05.730
And it's got data elements in it.

00:55:05.730 --> 00:55:07.160
It's got content types.

00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:10.520
And they're all interconnected
with each other.

00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:14.080
They could be rendered as print,
they could be rendered as,

00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:16.620
well I guess Bob intended, scrolls?

00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:19.640
I don't know, can you imagine
reading "Hamlet" on a scroll?

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:22.690
Okay. Doing somebody
else's slides is sort

00:55:22.690 --> 00:55:24.780
of like delving into
their psychology.

00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:27.510
That's why I never let
anybody read my code,

00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:30.010
right because they can tell
everything about my head

00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:32.210
by looking at how I write software.

00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:35.280
So, we have this unique identifier,

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:39.280
they reference sequences
of typed bytes.

00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:42.790
So, there's types associated with
the digital content of the objects.

00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:46.490
And it might have more
than one content type.

00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:48.700
So, there's an identifier.

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:53.650
An identifier has a
bunch of content in it.

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:59.450
The handle service helps us find
it in a repository somewhere.

00:55:59.450 --> 00:56:04.500
And that's basically
all there is to it.

00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:05.800
Well, there's more.

00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:09.170
This is theorem number 206,

00:56:09.170 --> 00:56:12.320
which reads everything
is more complicated.

00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:17.150 position:56%
And the closer you look at anything,
the more complicated it gets.

00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:21.720
So, this is sort of the full
rendering of the handle service,

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:25.530
which is helping you
find the objects,

00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:28.090
and maybe even search by type.

00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:30.760
You know you might only want to
look for video, you might only want

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:34.470
to look for print material
and so on.

00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:38.190
So, here's the kind of, that's
probably not even readable it's

00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:42.870
so small, but the idea here is
to take that webpage for example

00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:46.840
and capture all of
its data and metadata

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:50.950
and store it away as
a digital object.

00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:56.280
So, when the publisher produces
content, it gets stored away.

00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:57.850
Oh, it is presented

00:56:57.850 --> 00:57:01.780
to the collection service
along with its metadata.

00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:05.050
Handle data is generated and
stored away in the handle system

00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:06.970
so you can find it again.

00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:09.900
Metadata gets stored away elsewhere

00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:13.760
and the handle system can
help you find it after that.

00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:19.240
So, a repository is where
you store this stuff.

00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:23.210
It provides for dynamic
acquisitions and things can come

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:27.230
into the repository and
an execution capability.

00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:31.020
So, the code that implements
the different kinds

00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:36.230
of content rendering can be
executed in that environment.

00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:40.690
And it has an access protocol
called repository access

00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:42.450
protocol surprisingly.

00:57:42.450 --> 00:57:44.580
And that's a standard.

00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:47.960
And so, this allows multiple
repositories to be created

00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:52.480
and to be part of the environment.

00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:57.180
So, there's the client rapping
with the repository so to speak.

00:57:58.970 --> 00:58:02.360
So, the handle system
itself is distributed.

00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:05.160 position:56%
So, this is the thing that takes
the handle resolves it and tells you

00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:08.260
where to go and what to do.

00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:10.980
And there are a variety of
different transformations.

00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:14.200
A handle could turn into a domain
name for example, or it could turn

00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:17.730
into something that points
directly into a repository.

00:58:17.730 --> 00:58:25.820
It's all well-define and so, the
client goes to the handle services,

00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:28.780
there's a global handle
resolution system

00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:30.590
and local handle resolution system.

00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:34.020
So, you can have handles
resolve locally.

00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:36.030
And if they don't know what
to do locally then they go

00:58:36.030 --> 00:58:39.040
to the global handle
resolution systems in order

00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:41.930
to get further data, it's a
little bit like the root system

00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:44.510
in the domain name environment.

00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:48.030
So, you can see these
things distributed.

00:58:48.030 --> 00:58:52.120
Local handle resolution
system can also be replicated

00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:54.220
in multiple sites.

00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:56.640
And finally, you know
we get actual objects

00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:58.630
that are part of that system.

00:58:58.630 --> 00:59:04.960
So, here's an example of a
handle might contain information

00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.260
in that's of URL type.

00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:10.660
And the data is familiar
URL, but there are lots

00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:13.170
of other possibilities here.

00:59:13.170 --> 00:59:16.350
One of them might be the digital
library system type of data

00:59:16.350 --> 00:59:21.050 position:56%
which has a reference which is
different from domain names or URLs.

00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:23.400
Our handle system administration
system.

00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:24.760
So, you have a variety

00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:27.650
of possibilities here,
including extensions.

00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:30.190 position:56%
So, it could be x, y, z handle type.

00:59:30.190 --> 00:59:33.200
And it has a certain
binary representation,

00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:37.150
and it gets interpreted on a
basis of what that handle type is.

00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:42.360
So, some libraries that actually
implement this stuff will be

00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:46.820
reachable through the web
for example, or more directly

00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:50.970
from digital library services using
the repository access protocol.

00:59:50.970 --> 00:59:56.880 position:56%
So, the library could be first-class
object in this repository system,

00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:00.890
or it might be reached through the
Worldwide Web, through a webserver,

01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:05.040
which knows how to
talk to a repository.

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:09.060
And then the repository
responds with content.

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:13.190
And that actually was the
last slide believe it or not.

01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:15.750
So, I'm happy to just stop here.

01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:18.650
I realize that I may have
even overstayed my welcome,

01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:20.470
because it's after 10 o'clock.

01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:23.900
What does one mean?

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:25.370
I can have one question?

01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:26.670
No.

01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:28.330
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:00:28.330 --> 01:00:31.770
Oh, okay well I'll tell you
what if you have questions,

01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:33.810
I will do my best to answer them.

01:00:33.810 --> 01:00:36.550
Do we have roving microphones,
or do I run around?

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:40.960
Okay. So, let me warn you that
I'm hearing impaired and what

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:43.600
that means, I'm not the guy that
came to talk and wouldn't listen,

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.790
that's not my problem [laugther].

01:00:45.790 --> 01:00:51.280
But I may have to run around
to lipread if necessary.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:55.520
So, let's try and if I'm having
trouble hearing the question I may

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:57.640
leap off the stage,
in which case the guys

01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:01.140 position:56%
who are videotaping this will have a
great time trying to figure out how

01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:03.430
to find me hiding behind
the columns here

01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:07.960
in this perfectly structured
room for lectures.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.610
Okay. So, are there?

01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:12.670
There's a question over here, but
the microphone is over that way.

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:13.970
So, we'll get you.

01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:15.720
You're number 2, just
remember your number.

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.020
First question.

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:18.320
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:19.660
That was very interesting.

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:22.420
I was going to ask about
portable data in the role of that.

01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:27.970
I mean right now you can't dump
everything you've ever posted

01:01:27.970 --> 01:01:33.210
on Facebook, or like all your
emails from Gmail into a folder,

01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:35.070
or perhaps transfer
to another service.

01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:36.370 position:56%
&gt;&gt; VINT CERF: Wait, wait let's stop.

01:01:36.370 --> 01:01:38.650
Because I'm getting
about 40% of this.

01:01:38.650 --> 01:01:40.950
Hold on. I'm sorry.

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.730
Yeah, yeah go ahead.

01:01:48.730 --> 01:01:51.010
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: Portable data,
what's the word of portable data

01:01:51.010 --> 01:01:53.830
and basically transferring your
data from one service to another

01:01:53.830 --> 01:01:56.340
and backing it up on hard drive.

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:09.600
[ Laughter ]

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.950
&gt;&gt; VINT CERF: Somehow this isn't
working the way I was expecting it

01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:14.070
to work.

01:02:14.070 --> 01:02:15.940
Okay, this is part
of my health plan.

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:17.690
I think everybody understands that.

01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:21.510
So, you know storing all
of the data that you have,

01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:23.880
first of all we don't have
common standards across all

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.990
of those various services,
which is a pity.

01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:27.290
I mean, I think we should.

01:02:27.290 --> 01:02:28.590
But we don't.

01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:29.890
And so, pulling all that stuff

01:02:29.890 --> 01:02:32.610
into your own hard drive
gives you the problem

01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:35.260
that you don't have
enough room to store it.

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:39.430
So, this leaves you with
a couple of possibilities.

01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:42.280
One is you ingest all these stuff.

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:46.630
And then you push it in
opaque form into some,

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:49.550
you know cloud based storage
system, whether it's you know AWS,

01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:52.120
or Google, or something else.

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.970
That has to be the
worst possible outcome.

01:02:54.970 --> 01:02:57.010
Because it's not structured.

01:02:57.010 --> 01:03:00.240
It's not properly curated.

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.060
It's just there in an opaque form.

01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:04.040
And only you can retrieve it.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.630
That might be great for privacy,

01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:09.480
but it's not a good thing
for historical purposes.

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.560
And so, now we could
argue whether all

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:15.390
that stuff is worth saving or not.

01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:18.660
And some people will say,
it isn't worth saving

01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:20.740
and so stop worry about it.

01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:26.030 position:56%
But I would argue two things; one,
if you think it's important to save,

01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:27.860
you should have mechanisms
for saving it

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:31.650
in a way that's useful,
possibly for historians.

01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:33.900
And second observation, again is

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:37.500
that we don't always know
what's important and what isn't.

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:40.530
So, again though I think if
you're the creator of content

01:03:40.530 --> 01:03:42.630
in a sense you should
have the choice

01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:44.830
of whether it gets saved or not.

01:03:44.830 --> 01:03:48.250
Once you publish it though in
an environment which is open,

01:03:48.250 --> 01:03:53.310 position:56%
which is true of much of the web
today, and I hope it stays that way,

01:03:53.310 --> 01:03:57.480 position:56%
you've sort of committed yourself to
history whether you like it or not.

01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:00.210
And I think that has
to be thought about.

01:04:00.210 --> 01:04:03.580
Once we demonstrate the
capability to archive this,

01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:05.920
people who produce content
should be well aware

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.220
that it might be archived.

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:09.530
And maybe that will cause
people to think twice

01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:11.210
about what they put up on the net.

01:04:11.210 --> 01:04:12.510
Okay. We have time for one more?

01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:13.810
Do you think?

01:04:13.810 --> 01:04:16.760
Okay, this gentleman over here,
no actually the guy behind you.

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:20.240
Yeah, I'm sorry he was number two.

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.220
He had his hand up first.

01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:25.840
I'll take a third question
whether Wendy wants me to or not.

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:27.140
Yes? Okay, go ahead.

01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:28.570
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 2: Thank you very much.

01:04:28.570 --> 01:04:32.670
So, you made a really, really
nice point is that we need;

01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:36.340
I'll wait for him to
do the mic [laughter].

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:44.340
So, we need multiple.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:52.730
I just have a one to one.

01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:54.030
&gt;&gt; VINT CERF: I need a microphone.

01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:57.180
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 3: All right
here's another microphone.

01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:00.530
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 2: Okay so, we need
multiple, like you said, archives.

01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:02.410
And that's the kind
of future potentially.

01:05:02.410 --> 01:05:03.710
We're going to be doing it.

01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:05.240
Everyone's going to be archiving.

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:06.900
But what's the kind of mech?

01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:11.120
Do you perceive a mechanism to
emerge from these multiple archives

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:15.300
to allow the kind of distributive
approach to discover them?

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.050
Is this something that
is going to be organic?

01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:19.670
Or is this something that is
going to be a top down kind

01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:23.340
of layer that's going to
be enforced by someone.

01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:24.640
&gt;&gt; VINT CERF: It would be.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:26.160
I guess I can do it
this way now, okay.

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:28.600
Except I'm hiding from the camera.

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.080
Okay, all right [laughter].

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:36.010
So, first of all, it
would be a pity if we were

01:05:36.010 --> 01:05:38.510
to rely on some top down thing.

01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:42.000
It works so much better when you
have an architecture and a set

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.840
of protocols and design that
allows people who wish to commit

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:48.700
to this, to be able to do so.

01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:52.700
And so, I'm must more interested
in getting the technology

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:57.410
into people's hands, maybe build
in as part of the web environment.

01:05:57.410 --> 01:06:00.820
That's why this self-archiving
web notion is so appealing to me.

01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:04.080
You don't think about it, it just
archives itself automatically.

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:07.330
But you need to say
whether you are turning on

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:10.400
or turning off the
archiving mechanism.

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:14.280
Business models are going
to be really important here.

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:20.000
I have an acquaintance who is
starting a company called emortal

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.820
and it's all about trying
to preserve digital content

01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:27.440
for families in the future.

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:30.300
And he was trying to figure
out a business model for this.

01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.930
And he came up with a
very interesting idea.

01:06:32.930 --> 01:06:35.130
You all know about
life insurance, right?

01:06:35.130 --> 01:06:38.880
You know how this works,
you pay until you're dead.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:42.120
I don't know of any other
product that has that property,

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:44.880
maybe some of the drug
companies have that.

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:48.790
So, what if you had a kind
of data life insurance thing,

01:06:48.790 --> 01:06:52.570
where you pay to save your
data over a period of time

01:06:52.570 --> 01:06:59.180
and you accumulate what
is needed in order to,

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:02.100
what's the right word for this?

01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:05.740
Endow the archival process.

01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:08.220
So, that it can be paid
for over a period of time.

01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:12.250
Now, I have no idea if that idea
is actually going to work or not.

01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:17.780
But, this notion of providing a
business model is pretty important.

01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:22.200
Again, I don't think we want to
save information by accident.

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:27.940
We want to have mechanisms that are
self-supporting over the long term.

01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:29.960
Okay, maybe one more and that's it.

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.910
Yeah? Okay.

01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:34.870
Okay go for it.

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:51.690
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 4: So, you talked a lot
about technologies of preservation

01:07:51.690 --> 01:07:58.240
and yet, they would really depend
on kind of a social infrastructure

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:09.240
to organizations, institutions
that care about preservation.

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:19.780
You have a few of them here,

01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:26.350
the Library of Congress,
the British Library.

01:08:26.350 --> 01:08:41.010 position:56%
And yet there's too thin on the
ground perhaps for us to do the job.

01:08:41.010 --> 01:08:57.050 position:56%
And it seems to me that on the whole
society cares about preservation

01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:58.820
after we've lost something.

01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:01.060
Instead we ought to prevent it.

01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:05.410
And I just wonder where
that conundrum comes,

01:09:05.410 --> 01:09:07.830
because where we have a prime
institution that attempts

01:09:07.830 --> 01:09:11.800
to resurrect information to
preserve it, I take example

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:16.660
of the Google Books for
example, then other stakeholders

01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:22.140
who see value, potentially,
start to fight back

01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:23.960
against the preservation of it.

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:27.460
So how do we address this
conundrum, that we care,

01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:28.890
but not care enough to [inaudible].

01:09:28.890 --> 01:09:31.270
&gt;&gt; VINT CERF: So, in fact
the answer may very well be

01:09:31.270 --> 01:09:32.620
that we don't do that.

01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:33.920
Let me explain.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.840
Let's imagine for the
sake of argument,

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:40.030
that the Worldwide Web becomes
a self-archiving system.

01:09:40.030 --> 01:09:42.460
What is the implication of that?

01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:45.560
The implication is that the
same parties that provide you

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:47.540
with the method for producing
your, you know Twitter pages

01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:48.980
and your blogs and all these
other things are also engaged

01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:50.280
in the archiving process.

01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:51.580
You know think for a minute,
they have a business model,

01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:52.880
that whether it's advertising,
or you pay, or something else.

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:54.180
And so, the question is whether
we could induce into the system,

01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:55.550
the archiving process as the
normal part of the way it works,

01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:56.990
as opposed to separating it
as an act that's distinct.

01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:58.290
And you know the more
we keep thinking

01:09:58.290 --> 01:09:59.630
about it's an act that's distinct,
the harder we make the problem.

01:09:59.630 --> 01:10:01.010
But if we incorporate this
into the normal process

01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:02.990
and replication becomes part of the
normal process, we may actually end

01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:04.760 position:56%
up with a self-archiving environment
that works and is supported.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:06.230
Because there's already a
business model for the generation

01:10:06.230 --> 01:10:08.320 position:56%
of the data, why not incorporate
into that this preservation as well.

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:11.740
Now, I just said something
that might be really hard

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:14.340
to implement, but it's not crazy.

01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:17.700
Because if you think about it,
none of the things that are

01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:22.020
on the web today were there before
until somebody decided they wanted

01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:25.130
to make a business of doing it.

01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:29.610
And so, let's see if we can't
build preservation into the norm,

01:10:29.610 --> 01:10:34.360
as opposed to making it a special
action of only a few parties.

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:35.660
End of story.

01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:37.460
Okay.

01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:43.100
[ Applause ]

01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:46.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: I wanted to say,
I wanted to lead the applause here.

01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:49.860
But, before we let Vint go, we're
going to have a coffee break now.

01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:54.660
We'll be back here at 10:45 to
start the panels and presentations.

01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:57.740
And there is, if you're standing at
the back, there's a room downstairs

01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:00.290
with the webcast going with seats.

01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:02.720
So, feel free to use
that if you want to.

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:05.400
I just want to say a
big thank you to Vint

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:07.480
for making the effort
to come here today.

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:11.290
And as ever, I'm blown over
by some of the things he says.

01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:13.600
He, I mean I think I'm
immersed in this world.

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:16.500
And he just has so much insight.

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:19.550
Digital vellum is now
my favorite phrase,

01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:21.550
you haven't trademarked
it, have you?

01:11:21.550 --> 01:11:22.850
No.

01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:24.150
&gt;&gt; VINT CERF: No.

01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:26.110
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: And I'm
not going to, it's all right.

01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:30.670
It's just and also the idea
of the self-archiving web.

01:11:30.670 --> 01:11:34.880
I think this is an amazing
way of capturing everything

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:36.180
that we're trying to talk about.

01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:40.180
And the fact that Vint is still
coming up with all these new ideas

01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:44.950
that leave the rest of us
just completely gob smacked is

01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:46.250
quite amazing.

01:11:46.250 --> 01:11:49.510
So, let's once more thank Vint
very much for just being Vint.

01:11:49.510 --> 01:12:03.630
[ Applause ]

01:12:03.630 --> 01:12:04.930
&gt;&gt; VINT CERF: Thank you.

01:12:04.930 --> 01:12:07.010
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: Now is the
time to hear about what happened

01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:10.100
at the hack-a-thon, or I like
to called them datathons.

01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:11.400
Doesn't really matter.

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:15.690
Well they're now forever called
Archives Unleased in this context.

01:12:15.690 --> 01:12:18.490
And we had a wonderful two
days with people from all

01:12:18.490 --> 01:12:21.430
over the world actually who
came to work with the data.

01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:22.730
I'm not going to tell you about it.

01:12:22.730 --> 01:12:26.710
I'm going to introduce you
to the team who run it.

01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:31.330
You've got their bios in the
pack to Ian Milligan, Jimmy Lin

01:12:31.330 --> 01:12:35.370
and Matt Weber, my
co-host for today as well.

01:12:35.370 --> 01:12:38.100
So, Ian I think you're first up.

01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:40.720
Ian, over to you.

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:42.520
Round of applause for Ian.

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:46.080
[ Applause ]

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.380 position:56%
&gt;&gt; IAN MILLIGAN: I'll just start by,

01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:50.350 position:56%
could we get our four other speakers
up, we'll just make them sit

01:12:50.350 --> 01:12:52.750
in these bright lights at the
front of the stage [laughter].

01:12:52.750 --> 01:12:55.480
And that way we can
be a bit quicker.

01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:57.510
I think we'll need
Dan as well up here.

01:12:57.510 --> 01:13:01.230
Hi. My name is Ian Milligan, I'm
an assistant professor of history

01:13:01.230 --> 01:13:02.650
at the University of Waterloo.

01:13:02.650 --> 01:13:06.520
And Jimmy, Matt, myself, and a few
other organizers, I'll show you,

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:09.500
just spent the last few
days running a datathon here

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:12.160
at the Library of Congress.

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:14.010
The first question I want to do,

01:13:14.010 --> 01:13:16.990
before we get into the nitty gritty
is just rhetorically talk a little

01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:20.670
bit about why I think these
sorts of events are important.

01:13:20.670 --> 01:13:24.000
And the question I like to ask
is why is a historian helping

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.660
to organize a datathon
around web archives.

01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:31.600
And I think it's because in short,
as we've heard earlier today

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.860
from Vint and we'll
be hearing today,

01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:38.220
we have a problem facing our
collective cultural heritage.

01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:40.540
This is a big issue that
we need to be involved in.

01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:44.710
And when I go on talks and
try to sum it up to audiences,

01:13:44.710 --> 01:13:48.130
I like to encapsulate the problem
and the opportunity facing us

01:13:48.130 --> 01:13:52.780
in something as innocuous as
this, a page from GeoCities.com.

01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:57.410
GeoCities.com, founded
in 1994, deleted in 2009;

01:13:57.410 --> 01:14:01.690 position:56%
saved thanks to web archivists, was
the kind of place where you could go

01:14:01.690 --> 01:14:05.800
and create your own website about
anything that you so desire.

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:09.360
You'd go to GeoCities.com,
type in your email address,

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.640
get your free megabyte,
two megabytes,

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:14.430 position:56%
eventually ten megabytes of content.

01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:16.380
Whippy. And it was a big deal.

01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:19.030
And you could create a site
about anything that you wanted.

01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:22.260
You could create your love site
to "Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"

01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:26.630
your lamentation about the Toronto
Maple Leaf, your family tree,

01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:30.020
your love of Winnie the Pooh
if you're a 12-year-old child.

01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:32.530
And people took that to an extreme.

01:14:32.530 --> 01:14:35.740
And people jumped on
board with such aplomb.

01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:37.220
And I love this visualization

01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:41.010
because it shows just how quickly
people took to creating content

01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:44.220
and leaving it behind
on the Worldwide Web.

01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:48.670
GeoCities.com had its first
10,000 users in October of 1995,

01:14:48.670 --> 01:14:51.780
100,000 in August of 1996.

01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:54.660
A million in October 1997.

01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:56.960
And by its deletion in 2009,

01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:02.070
some 7 million people had
created webpages on GeoCities.com.

01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:05.460
And when today we want to go
through and see how many URL exist,

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:09.640
it's something like
186 million URLs.

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:13.010
GeoCities.com, a tiny slice
of the web of the nineties

01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:16.810
and the two thousands accounts
for this much information.

01:15:16.810 --> 01:15:19.480
And as a historian,
that fascinates me.

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:20.900
It boggles the mind.

01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:23.700
It means that we are
operating on a different scale

01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:27.370
of the preservation
of everyday people.

01:15:27.370 --> 01:15:29.740
The example I like to make
just to bug my colleagues

01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:33.170
who do British history mostly,
is to say let's take your golden,

01:15:33.170 --> 01:15:36.150
you know your treasure trove
of historical information,

01:15:36.150 --> 01:15:39.240
if you want to study the 19th
century or the 18th century

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:42.710
and see what it was like to be
an everyday person say in London,

01:15:42.710 --> 01:15:45.160
you have almost no information.

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:47.670
You only have information
when people come into contact

01:15:47.670 --> 01:15:50.520
with the state, or the church,
or if an accident happens

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:52.670
and something is left behind.

01:15:52.670 --> 01:15:55.770
And so, for many historians, they
reconstruct that sort of life

01:15:55.770 --> 01:15:58.620
through court transcripts,
like the "Old Bailey Online"

01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:04.690
which between 1674 and 1913
collected 197,000 trials.

01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:08.290 position:56%
They just, the describe their site
as quote, unquote, "the largest body

01:16:08.290 --> 01:16:11.720
of sources ever created
by nonelite people."

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:15.470
And that's true until
something like GeoCities.

01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:18.880
In short, historians are
moving from scarcity,

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:21.530
where we used to have no
information about the past,

01:16:21.530 --> 01:16:24.540 position:56%
to abundance where we have too much.

01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:28.080
That I like to present this as the
problem with the "Old Bailey" was

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:31.000
that you always wished you had
more information and the problem

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.360
with GeoCities is that
you wish you had less.

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:37.720
And so, that's why we
do these datathons.

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:41.410
Our animating statement is
that web archives are great,

01:16:41.410 --> 01:16:44.330
they present a tremendous
opportunity just,

01:16:44.330 --> 01:16:47.720
it makes my skin chilled when
I think about them, but access

01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:53.940 position:56%
and usage of web archived content
remains a very considerable problem.

01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:56.850
And so, we bring people
together to run these datathons.

01:16:56.850 --> 01:17:00.350 position:56%
Over the last few days we brought
together and introduced plenary team

01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:03.320
to bring together international
participants here.

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:06.990
And it's a team of a historian,
a communications study scholar,

01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:08.790
Natalie who you'll
hear from shortly.

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:11.840
A computer scientist, Jimmy
who's in this room, Matt Weber,

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:14.670
who you'll be hearing from this
afternoon, and Nicholas Worby,

01:17:14.670 --> 01:17:17.610
a librarian who, selfishly
is getting married tomorrow

01:17:17.610 --> 01:17:19.800
and had to go back to Toronto.

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:23.460
But we'll send him our
congratulations from afar.

01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:26.400
What did we aim to accomplish
over the last three days?

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:28.250
Well, we wanted to build community.

01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:30.660
Community of people who
could use web archives

01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:34.270
to answer interesting questions
about the past and today.

01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:35.970
We wanted to articulate
a common vision

01:17:35.970 --> 01:17:39.260
of web archiving development
and tool development.

01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:41.680
We wanted to avoid the black
boxes of search engines

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:43.670
that we don't understand.

01:17:43.670 --> 01:17:46.700
We don't want to design search
engines where I type in a keyword,

01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:50.270
and it goes through billions
of files and gives me 10

01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:52.030 position:56%
and I don't know why I got those 10.

01:17:52.030 --> 01:17:55.350
And most importantly we want
to equip us as a collective,

01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:58.600
and that's the people
in the room datathoning,

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:01.210
and also I think our society.

01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:06.480
To deal and work with born
digital, cultural resources.

01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:08.880
So, datathons are tricky.

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:11.910
And we call them datathons, it's
a bit less scary than hack-a-thon.

01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:14.570
But, we really try to bring
together diverse perspectives.

01:18:14.570 --> 01:18:16.990
We try to bring together
people who can hack,

01:18:16.990 --> 01:18:21.000
who have the technical chops to
write code, make dreams a reality,

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.360
but also those with
theoretical ideas.

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:25.380
They want to talk,
have conversations,

01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:28.180
think about the ethics,
the standards, etcetera.

01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:31.080
And so, a datathon really tries
to balance the perspectives

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:33.610
of humanists, like myself,
and computer scientists,

01:18:33.610 --> 01:18:36.300
and social scientists
who are also in the room.

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:38.980
What did we do, in a
very quick nutshell?

01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:41.150
Well, on Monday, it's hard
to believe that was Monday,

01:18:41.150 --> 01:18:44.870
we gathered at George Washington
University Library to form teams.

01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:46.550
A great Sticky Note
exercise thinking

01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:50.170
about datasets people wanted to
use, questions they might have.

01:18:50.170 --> 01:18:52.180
We framed the problem,
we socialized.

01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:55.610
We do a lot of socializing if
you come to our hackathons.

01:18:55.610 --> 01:18:58.140
Then, in this room on
Tuesday at the Library

01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:00.430
of Congress we had
quick presentations,

01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:03.690
we solidified our teams, and
really we just started datathoning.

01:19:03.690 --> 01:19:06.810
It was just a buzz of
activity as people worked away.

01:19:06.810 --> 01:19:08.110
We had incredible catering.

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:10.400 position:56%
If you want to run an event, this is
a plug for the Library of Congress,

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.400
the are the best event staff ever.

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:13.830
You've got like a bucket
of M&amp;M's here.

01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:17.150
I don't know if that's
healthy, but it was good.

01:19:17.150 --> 01:19:18.660
Mostly it was just quiet work.

01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:21.200
Hacking, data flowing,
and some awesome results

01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:24.010
that I'm really happy to be able to
share with you in a just a minute.

01:19:24.010 --> 01:19:27.900
And then of course, today
we're here wrapping it all up.

01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:31.060
The projects, we had
basically eight major projects,

01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:32.360
which I'll talk about.

01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:35.590
We didn't have time to bring
all eight teams up here

01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:36.890
to share their results,

01:19:36.890 --> 01:19:38.260
unfortunately due to
time constraints.

01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:41.280 position:56%
So, I'm going to talk about four and
then we have these four pour people

01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:43.430
in the hot seats who are
going to share their projects

01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:46.400
with very strict three-minute
time limits.

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:49.780
But I have the pleasure to talk
about a few quick projects.

01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:53.150
So, one team here looked at Twitter
and they took a large data dump

01:19:53.150 --> 01:19:56.110
of Twitter and asked, what is
the source of the narratives

01:19:56.110 --> 01:19:59.040
in election related Tweets.

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:02.730
And so, here we're seeing they
took 327,000 Tweets hashtag

01:20:02.730 --> 01:20:04.950
with election 2016.

01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:09.220
The real Donald Trump of Hillary
Clinton account, 7,000 URLs.

01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:13.310
And we can see topics relating
to the Russian DNC hack,

01:20:13.310 --> 01:20:15.900
the Trump revoking "The
Washington Post" credentials,

01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:19.350
and the case of Omar Mateen's
wife after the Orlando shooting.

01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:22.790
And we're just seeing those
surges of activities over time.

01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:27.130
The team took the IMLS museum
datasets, this monumental sort

01:20:27.130 --> 01:20:31.130 position:56%
of terabytes or terabytes of
American museums and tried to figure

01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:34.840
out what you could do with
[inaudible] files that drive it,

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:38.260
the CDX files that give
context to web archives.

01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:39.990
And it was amazing.

01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:44.910
I mean here we're seeing a domain
map of the American museum space,

01:20:44.910 --> 01:20:46.730
and we also saw interesting
things looking

01:20:46.730 --> 01:20:50.740 position:56%
at which different file formats
speak to different types of content.

01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:53.530
There was a team called the
Supremes, it was a great name.

01:20:53.530 --> 01:20:57.100
And they used the Library of
Congress web archiving collection.

01:20:57.100 --> 01:21:00.910
They used websites collected
around the nomination of Alito,

01:21:00.910 --> 01:21:03.730
and the nomination
of Justice Roberts.

01:21:03.730 --> 01:21:08.290
Took those websites and did things
like extracted the links and seeing

01:21:08.290 --> 01:21:10.810
which websites link
to other websites.

01:21:10.810 --> 01:21:13.050
Who do discussions
on the senate link

01:21:13.050 --> 01:21:16.110
to where do discussions
on the house link to.

01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:19.450
And also, did quite a bit of
content analysis taking the text

01:21:19.450 --> 01:21:21.650
and visualizing in new ways.

01:21:21.650 --> 01:21:24.230
Their take-home they wanted me
to emphasize was know your data.

01:21:24.230 --> 01:21:25.530
What are your assumptions?

01:21:25.530 --> 01:21:28.720
They generated this great graph,
it shows yea, that's about Roberts.

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:30.670
I told them to lie, that's
a great visualization

01:21:30.670 --> 01:21:33.200
because he was confirmed, and
they tell me it was actually,

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:35.510
they were scraping in the
Library of congress tons and tons

01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:36.850
of yeas and nays roll calls.

01:21:36.850 --> 01:21:39.570
So, their message was you
have to know your data.

01:21:39.570 --> 01:21:43.820
And then finally there was
a team Campaign Origins,

01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:45.340
the research question,
where do the topics

01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:47.940
in election-related Twitter
conversations originate?

01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:51.540
And they grabbed, they
topic modelled

01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:53.950
in this case Donald Trump's
information and we saw

01:21:53.950 --> 01:21:56.230
that it was his birthday
a few days ago.

01:21:56.230 --> 01:21:58.560
And, those were our
quick little teams.

01:21:58.560 --> 01:21:59.980
I might be missing one.

01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:02.540
And then, I'm just going
to turn us over here

01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:04.130
to our four lightening talks.

01:22:04.130 --> 01:22:07.060
So, we have them in
order, Team Mojitos,

01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:10.560
Team I Know What You Hid
Last Summer, Team Turtle,

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:12.630
and then Team Counter Terrorism.

01:22:12.630 --> 01:22:13.930
So, we'll go in that order.

01:22:13.930 --> 01:22:15.460
And I'll get my little timer out.

01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:17.510
So, thank you very much.

01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:26.340
[ Applause ]

01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:27.710
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 5: Good
morning everybody.

01:22:27.710 --> 01:22:31.510
Our team worked with a
dataset of websites collected

01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:34.480
from the Cuban domain
by the internet archive,

01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:36.300
we studied with big expectations.

01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:38.940
We wanted to work on
a period of 14 months,

01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:42.440
and detect all media
events in this dataset.

01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:46.310
In the end, we worked
on one day, one event.

01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:49.620
But we had lots of fun solving
the problem, the many problems

01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:50.920
that we were confronted with.

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:53.400
So, we decided to work

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:56.430
on understanding how
Barrack Obama's visit

01:22:56.430 --> 01:23:00.990
to Cuba last March was
covered in the news in Cuba.

01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:07.770
And compare pro-Cuban regime
media with Cuban media in exile.

01:23:07.770 --> 01:23:12.040
So, we decided to also
narrow down our sample

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:17.560 position:56%
to the major Cuban newspaper called
"Granma" which is the official voice

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:22.360
of the communist party assuming
that, in the context of freedom

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:28.010 position:56%
of the press in Cuba, the other news
outlets would likely repeat the same

01:23:28.010 --> 01:23:30.570
arguments as "Granma."

01:23:30.570 --> 01:23:35.630
And the other news source that
we used is a newspaper called

01:23:35.630 --> 01:23:39.270
"el Nuevo Herald" which
is based in Miami.

01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:46.850
So, we started to work with WARC
files, which are very heavy files

01:23:46.850 --> 01:23:49.560
and we encountered
technical problems doing that,

01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:55.340
so we find another solution which
is that we scraped from the web all

01:23:55.340 --> 01:23:59.470
of the webpages that we
wanted from these two sources,

01:23:59.470 --> 01:24:05.310
and we organized them in
a database that allowed us

01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:07.950 position:56%
to do some text processing analysis.

01:24:07.950 --> 01:24:12.720
Except it didn't work
so well, of course.

01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:15.750
We had problem with
collecting dates.

01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:19.990
So, for "Granma" it was very easy
because the date was in the URL,

01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:21.940
so that was very plain and simple.

01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:25.900
But with "el Nuevo Herald"
the date was not in the URL,

01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:28.330
so we thought we were going to
crawl the text and, oops sorry,

01:24:28.330 --> 01:24:31.620
and then find the, and then assume

01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:34.190
that the date will be
always on top of the title.

01:24:34.190 --> 01:24:37.000
But it was not the case, the
date was moving on the page,

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:43.030
so we had to find a way to
find the pattern of the date

01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:47.540
in the HTML that we extracted.

01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:52.970
So, okay. So, then we
worked on entity linking

01:24:52.970 --> 01:24:55.320
to find semantic similarities.

01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:59.720
Text processing to find mentions
and co-occurrences of words,

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:03.050 position:56%
such as US, Cuba, Obama, and Castro.

01:25:03.050 --> 01:25:06.980
And we used Gephi to visualize the
results in the form of a graph.

01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:09.980
And then we managed
to produce one graph

01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:12.730
that is a final graph
on the left here.

01:25:12.730 --> 01:25:20.590
And instead of taking a top down
approach of trying to impose a set

01:25:20.590 --> 01:25:23.100
at least of words that
we wanted to find,

01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:27.890
we favored an adaptive bottom-up
approach, because we wanted

01:25:27.890 --> 01:25:30.330
to let the data talk to us.

01:25:30.330 --> 01:25:34.540
So, we defined the
event of the visit

01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:39.860
as a co-occurrence graph centered
around prominent entities.

01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:41.540
And one of the other challenge.

01:25:41.540 --> 01:25:42.840
One minute?

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.140
Okay. Huh?

01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:45.440
Zero. Okay.

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:49.560
And this is what we would have
liked to do, which is a timeline,

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:53.440 position:56%
and we wanted to detect similarities
in events over a period of time.

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:55.240
Thank you very much.

01:25:55.240 --> 01:26:01.340
[ Applause ]

01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:03.180
&gt;&gt; IAN MILLIGAN: It's incredible
what they can do in two days

01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:04.510
and what they can do
in three minutes.

01:26:04.510 --> 01:26:08.490
So, our next team here, I
Know What You Hid Last Summer.

01:26:09.810 --> 01:26:13.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 6: Well, so for our
project we came together around sort

01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:16.110
of the nebulous concept of what
are the ethical implications

01:26:16.110 --> 01:26:18.850
of using web archives and
working with web archives,

01:26:18.850 --> 01:26:21.000
and then we realized we had
two days, and we realized

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.780
that we also wanted
to work with data.

01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:24.910
So, our story is as
much about the process

01:26:24.910 --> 01:26:26.870
and the interdisciplinary
work, and what happens

01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:31.690
when an information scientist,
communications, web sciences,

01:26:31.690 --> 01:26:35.960
computer science comes together
and tries to make a project.

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:41.080
So, instead of sort of having a
more of a theoretical expression

01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:43.750
of our project we decided to sort
of express the ethics and sort

01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:45.050
of our approach to our project.

01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:50.410
So, what we started, we used the
UK elections, 2015 Twitter dataset

01:26:50.410 --> 01:26:57.160 position:56%
with the hashtags GE 2015 and GE
from February 27th to May 8 of 2015.

01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:59.630
And we limited the dataset
specifically to members

01:26:59.630 --> 01:27:03.320
of parliament in the UK who
were tweeting during that time,

01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:07.080
because we felt that this concept
of publicness of a public official

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.440
and the publicness of
their content, right?

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:12.910
And believing that sort of
an appropriate place to look.

01:27:12.910 --> 01:27:15.860 position:56%
And we're taking an ethical
stance, a clear ethical stance here,

01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:18.640
in that the general population,
are we allowed to use their data,

01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:20.670
what are the ethical
implications of that?

01:27:20.670 --> 01:27:23.460
So, we're actually
specifically making that choice.

01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:25.030
So, what we did was
we grabbed these,

01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:26.810
we had this collection of tweets.

01:27:26.810 --> 01:27:28.980
We sort of, we went
through and parsed them.

01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:30.920
We extracted all the
URLs that were linked.

01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:32.750
Because what we wanted
to do is see what happens

01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:35.280
when we take a Twitter
dataset and then we layer

01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:37.320
on top of that a web archive.

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:40.710
How do those connect, what's
the sort of flow on top of that?

01:27:40.710 --> 01:27:43.940
So, then once we grabbed those URLs
we looked at the current status,

01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:45.240
are those currently available?

01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:46.540
Not currently available?

01:27:46.540 --> 01:27:48.880
And then we searched the
internet archive for these URLs

01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:50.270 position:56%
to see were these actually archived?

01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:55.070 position:56%
So, you can think of this as kind
of the process the sort of top line,

01:27:55.070 --> 01:27:58.760
you'll see from the 27th to the
8th of May, that sort of green line

01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:01.170
with the floating tweet flag,
that's when the tweet happened,

01:28:01.170 --> 01:28:03.240
but you'll see that some of
these pages were archived.

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:04.810
And you'll see that there
are various archives,

01:28:04.810 --> 01:28:06.190
which are those red dots.

01:28:06.190 --> 01:28:09.320
So, a tweet happened and the URL
might have been archived 20 days

01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:10.620
before that.

01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:12.290
It might have been archived two
days after that, another three

01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:13.890
or four days, another
five days, right?

01:28:13.890 --> 01:28:16.360
So, we have multiple
copies of that archive.

01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:21.380
So, we had, of the tweets,
we started with 2.9 million,

01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:26.340
and we ended up with 12,357
tweets by members of Parliament.

01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:30.910
Of that, 7,818 tweets had URLs.

01:28:30.910 --> 01:28:33.710
We de-duplicated and
that's about 6700.

01:28:33.710 --> 01:28:36.140
There are lots of get
out to vote tweets.

01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:37.440
Come out and vote, right?

01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:41.890
Of those, about 1335 were
currently accessible.

01:28:41.890 --> 01:28:49.100
About 113 of those were 404'd
and so, what that sort of means

01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:53.220
in our work, is that while linking
is a pervasive practice on Twitter,

01:28:53.220 --> 01:28:56.560
and it's a pervasive
practice within UK MPs.

01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:00.210 position:56%
Also, we did a qualitative
analysis, about 10% of that content,

01:29:00.210 --> 01:29:02.880
and what MPs are linking
to are the part page,

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:06.120
the party Twitter account, or
pages supporting a specific agenda.

01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:08.270
So, part of this sort
of documentation of as

01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:10.400
that agenda changes,
that's one of the cases

01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:12.200
where archives could
become very important.

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:14.370
And we felt that a URL
is an integral part

01:29:14.370 --> 01:29:15.670
of a social media post.

01:29:15.670 --> 01:29:16.970
So, if you read the
social media post

01:29:16.970 --> 01:29:19.110
without the link, that's
problematic.

01:29:19.110 --> 01:29:20.830
I'm done [laughter].

01:29:20.830 --> 01:29:22.630
All right.

01:29:22.630 --> 01:29:27.090
[ Applause ]

01:29:27.090 --> 01:29:30.570
&gt;&gt; IAN MILLIGAN: So, now we have
Team Turtle to share their results.

01:29:30.570 --> 01:29:32.040
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 7: All right so
there's a couple of jokes

01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:33.930
for why we're named Team Turtle.

01:29:33.930 --> 01:29:35.230
We work slow.

01:29:35.230 --> 01:29:36.530
But we're steady.

01:29:36.530 --> 01:29:39.740
And we also work in the shell,
as my colleague mentioned.

01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:41.310
That's a programming joke.

01:29:41.310 --> 01:29:45.640
So, but I'll just dive
right into it.

01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:49.590
So, we actually received 145 arc
files from the Library of Congress.

01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:52.070
And they told us right away
that this was really messy data.

01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:56.590
And that we're going to have a lot
of trouble, so good luck with that.

01:29:56.590 --> 01:30:00.060
The research question that we
wanted to tackle was which places

01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:04.530
and topics the two candidates in
the 2004 election talk about most.

01:30:04.530 --> 01:30:08.100
And did this actually correlate
with the election results.

01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:12.160
So, our methodology was first we
cleaned up these messy arc files,

01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:17.360 position:56%
using the WARC-based platforms and
then we extracted the named entities

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:19.830
through the candidate
names and the state names.

01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:23.050
And then we applied the
topic modelling, LDA, TF-IDF.

01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:26.200 position:56%
And we also had a semantic web
extension using the Google knowledge

01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:31.230
graph API and also further
applications to Wiki data.

01:30:31.230 --> 01:30:33.790
So, this is kind of our result.

01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:37.450
The size of the circles represent
how often the candidate would talk

01:30:37.450 --> 01:30:39.830
about this state or this locale.

01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:44.030
And actually, if you hoover over
it you can actually see the topics

01:30:44.030 --> 01:30:45.400
that were talked about most often.

01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:48.470
So, hovering over there,
it shows Iraq was talked

01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:50.930
about very frequently
by that candidate.

01:30:50.930 --> 01:30:55.170
And extended this further, because
we're using topic modelling,

01:30:55.170 --> 01:30:58.840
we can actually hook into all the
knowledge in the knowledge graph

01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:00.990
and the related semantic web data.

01:31:00.990 --> 01:31:03.690 position:56%
So, what we created was a Python CLI

01:31:03.690 --> 01:31:06.850
where we could query the
Google knowledge graph

01:31:06.850 --> 01:31:10.500
and then what we got back was
actually this unique identifier,

01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:12.160
which is the free-based nid.

01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:14.760
And this is actually
the same graph database

01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:17.120
that powers all those queries
you can send to Google,

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:20.490
such as where is the Library of
Congress and it can tell you.

01:31:20.490 --> 01:31:23.750
This is the same data
that we're querying

01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:27.400
and because free base is shut down
and we can't access it anymore,

01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:30.360
the best alternative right
now is to access wiki data

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:32.380
and query the graph database there.

01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:35.720
So, this is our project
in three minutes.

01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:37.520
Thank you.

01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:44.120
[ Applause ]

01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:45.660
&gt;&gt; IAN MILLIGAN: That was actually
two minutes, which is outstanding.

01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:48.200
So, and don't worry we're
going to put this up on the web

01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:49.500
and I'll let you all know soon.

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:52.200
So, then last, but not least
we have our winning team,

01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:53.740
Team Counterterrorism.

01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:56.170
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 8: Thanks.

01:31:56.170 --> 01:32:03.260
So, as Vint Cerf told us, the
internet was designed in 1973

01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:09.010
to be able to allow anybody
who can follow the protocols

01:32:09.010 --> 01:32:13.280
to play whether they're
a future friend or foe.

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:15.300
So, it's basically
viewpoint neutral.

01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:16.900
So, packets don't really
care, you know,

01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:19.610
what your intent is with that data.

01:32:19.610 --> 01:32:22.280
And you could argue maybe
preservation should also be

01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:25.740
viewpoint neutral and I assume is.

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:29.670
So, everyone in here is obviously
using the internet for the good.

01:32:29.670 --> 01:32:33.660
But there are folks out there who
are using it to try to recruit

01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:36.780
for violent extremist
groups across the globe.

01:32:36.780 --> 01:32:41.400
So, when I discovered
a shared interest

01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:43.740
with another collaborator here.

01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:48.130
So, this is what you get when you
put together a political scientist,

01:32:48.130 --> 01:32:50.980
a software developer and a
librarian, only in two people.

01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:58.340
So, what we did was, so my
collaborator, Emily from University

01:32:58.340 --> 01:33:01.460
of Washington brought her
great archives as well

01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:04.590
as an ideology classifier
that had been used to try

01:33:04.590 --> 01:33:09.710
to categorize all the cacophony
of different groups in Syria based

01:33:09.710 --> 01:33:13.840
on text from their web
and radio transcripts.

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:16.870
And I had a set of tweets
that we'd been collecting

01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:20.680
at GW using a social feed
manager, on behalf of the program

01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:28.420
on extremism that is following
300 American and US based,

01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:30.140
suspected ISIS sympathizers.

01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:33.480
So, it's a pretty large
body of tweets.

01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:34.930
There are a lot more
accounts than people,

01:33:34.930 --> 01:33:36.700
because these folks
tend to jump around.

01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:41.240
So, that presents its own
challenges in doing analysis.

01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:43.410
So, what we did was we tried

01:33:43.410 --> 01:33:48.630
to apply the ideology
scoring methodology

01:33:48.630 --> 01:33:51.510
to this body of data of tweets.

01:33:51.510 --> 01:33:55.040
And we were able to get
that to work on a small set,

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:59.260
but I think we need a little more
power to crunch through more data.

01:33:59.260 --> 01:34:02.390
So, the other thing we did
was we used some basic,

01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:08.270
just Python scripting to extract
the user mentions from those tweets

01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:15.550
and output that as CSV of
edges based on graph theory.

01:34:15.550 --> 01:34:19.660
So, if somebody is mentioning in
their tweets a couple other people,

01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:21.300
so you have two edges right there.

01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:27.090
And what we wanted to do was see if
similarity of ideology is related

01:34:27.090 --> 01:34:29.910
to the likelihood that
they'll interact.

01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:32.830
And that can help us understand the
relationships between these people

01:34:32.830 --> 01:34:36.040
and how they're using
Twitter to try to recruit.

01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:38.840
So, we fed those through
some R scripts.

01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:43.270
And what we were hoping
to do was get to be able

01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:45.830
to evolve the network over time.

01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:49.190
I had a little fight with Gephi
it was just there's too much data

01:34:49.190 --> 01:34:53.200
for one afternoon, we had about a
half a million edges in a graph.

01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:57.350
And there's also the issue that
one account is not one person.

01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:59.890
So, what we did was we
fed it into R and took

01:34:59.890 --> 01:35:02.070
at least one snapshot to show you.

01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:05.890
And it actually validated
what our colleagues

01:35:05.890 --> 01:35:09.430
on the program extremism
have noticed anecdotally,

01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:11.400
which is that there
are really two types

01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:15.590 position:56%
of users involved in these networks.

01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:19.590
Which are, there are a few data
who are originating content

01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:22.360
and a lot of basically amplifiers.

01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:25.830
So, we'd like to follow up
and do this on a larger scale.

01:35:25.830 --> 01:35:28.410
And you can see some of the
other things we'd like to do.

01:35:28.410 --> 01:35:30.510
But we feel there's a
lot of potential here.

01:35:30.510 --> 01:35:37.830
[ Applause ]

01:35:37.830 --> 01:35:39.720
&gt;&gt; IAN MILLIGAN: More
importantly, this is just a flavor.

01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:41.600
So, we're going to
put all the projects

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:44.530
up at ArchivesUnleased.com,
but that in your notes.

01:35:44.530 --> 01:35:47.080
We're going to have all those
projects up very shortly

01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:50.800
and you can get to know the people
who were involved in the projects,

01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:53.840
what they were able to achieve
and I was thinking there's someone

01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:55.500
from Wiki Media taking
photos in there.

01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:58.880
Because he said, you know you don't
have a photo of young Einstein.

01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:00.880
Well, there's a bunch of young
Einsteins here at this datathon.

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:04.510 position:56%
So, if you're looking for great
people, you know where to find them.

01:36:04.510 --> 01:36:07.150
Just before we turn it over we
might have time for one question,

01:36:07.150 --> 01:36:09.730
I just have to do some
very important thanks.

01:36:09.730 --> 01:36:12.170
So, none of this would have been
possible without the Library

01:36:12.170 --> 01:36:14.220
of Congress for their
logistical support,

01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:16.530
for their beautiful
facilities and room.

01:36:16.530 --> 01:36:19.410
For their data, for
everything basically.

01:36:19.410 --> 01:36:22.150
The National Science
Foundation generously supported

01:36:22.150 --> 01:36:24.920
and made it possible for us to
bring in graduate students from all

01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:27.600
over the United States to
come and attend the datathon.

01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:30.770
Very important to develop
the junior scholars.

01:36:30.770 --> 01:36:33.030
And the Social Sciences and
Humanities Research Council

01:36:33.030 --> 01:36:37.320
of Canada provided travel funding
and food for graduate students

01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:40.530
and post doctorial fellows to
come from Canada and from places

01:36:40.530 --> 01:36:42.530
that are not the United States.

01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:44.410
So, it really takes a whole Army.

01:36:44.410 --> 01:36:47.630
You can see it on this slide
here, you know internet archive,

01:36:47.630 --> 01:36:49.560
George Washington University,
Computer Canada,

01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:54.170
The Web Science Trust, Rutgers,
the University of Waterloo.

01:36:54.170 --> 01:36:56.690
It really did take a village
to make this possible.

01:36:56.690 --> 01:36:57.990
So, thank you very much.

01:36:57.990 --> 01:36:59.960
Do keep your eye on
these scholars it's going

01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:02.290
to be an incredible few
years ahead, I know.

01:37:02.290 --> 01:37:04.090
So, thank you.

01:37:04.090 --> 01:37:11.040
[ Applause ]

01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:13.440
Yeah, I think we have five minutes
until I get kicked off stage.

01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:17.210
So, questions for me, but also
questions for our friends on stage.

01:37:23.050 --> 01:37:25.350
So many mics.

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:32.390
&gt;&gt; VINT CERF: This is partly
a question and partly a kind

01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:34.280
of statement for your reaction.

01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:40.000
I am so impressed by
what you are able to do

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.150
with information in digital form.

01:37:42.150 --> 01:37:44.700
I know that sounds kind
of stupid coming from me.

01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:48.720
But it's so different from
picking up a book and reading it.

01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:52.230
And your ability to process
this information differently

01:37:52.230 --> 01:37:56.370
from any other way we've done in
the past seems almost dramatic.

01:37:56.370 --> 01:37:59.950
And so, I'm actually curious to
know whether you feel the same way,

01:37:59.950 --> 01:38:05.720
that this is a completely new way
of understanding our knowledge.

01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:11.660
&gt;&gt; IAN MILLIGAN: Any of
you want to take that?

01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:12.960
Yeah [laughter].

01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:15.180
Yeah, I mean I'm blown
away by what we can do

01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:16.940
and what we can uncover
about the past.

01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:20.440
And you know to me it underscores
the importance of the message

01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:23.170
that you bring, that we need
to preserve this information

01:38:23.170 --> 01:38:26.090
because if we have it we can
do incredible things with it.

01:38:26.090 --> 01:38:27.760
So, complete agreement.

01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:36.000
I think we have one over here.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.410
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 2: So, Les Carr
[assumed spelling] again.

01:38:37.410 --> 01:38:40.850
I run a doctoral training
center with lots of,

01:38:40.850 --> 01:38:45.100 position:56%
you know with about 50 PhD students,
and we're trying to train them

01:38:45.100 --> 01:38:48.140
up in these methods
with access to data.

01:38:48.140 --> 01:38:54.990
What role, how can a body like
the Library of Congress be useful,

01:38:54.990 --> 01:39:01.380
or the British Library, how can
they help us to train students.

01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:03.470
How can they help students
to research?

01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:06.520 position:56%
What do you see their role as being?

01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:09.020
&gt;&gt; IAN MILLIGAN: Yeah,
that's a great question.

01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:10.910
Yeah, so I thought they were going

01:39:10.910 --> 01:39:14.660
to answer all the questions,
but now I am.

01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:16.350
I think, I mean the role I think

01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:19.720
that they can provide is
really I've become a proponent

01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:21.020
of in-person training.

01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:23.200
So, there's lots of stuff
online, lots of training sites.

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:24.880
And you can run through scripts.

01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:26.890
But nothing replaces the
ability to go to a place

01:39:26.890 --> 01:39:30.500
like the British Library, which
has data onsite, has, you know,

01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:33.100
British Library has
incredible staff who can help,

01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:34.520
you know bring these
things together.

01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:37.950 position:56%
Provide computing resources, provide
people together and let these sort

01:39:37.950 --> 01:39:40.410
of interdisciplinary hubs form.

01:39:40.410 --> 01:39:42.290
I think you have that
at Southampton,

01:39:42.290 --> 01:39:45.260
but most of us historians are
stuck talking to other historians.

01:39:45.260 --> 01:39:47.710
Computer scientists are talking
to other computer scientists.

01:39:47.710 --> 01:39:49.590
Librarians are talking
to other librarians.

01:39:49.590 --> 01:39:54.340
And by doing things onsite,
bringing together excellence,

01:39:54.340 --> 01:39:55.670
we can do things.

01:39:55.670 --> 01:39:59.600
I mean the checklist to make these
events successful has really been,

01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:01.380
you know food is always
important [laughter],

01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:03.040
socializing is always important.

01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:05.480 position:56%
But you know really having machines,
like virtual machines to spin up.

01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:08.050
Someone has a question, they don't
have to flux around with Amazon,

01:40:08.050 --> 01:40:09.980
we can like, here's
the keys to a machine,

01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:12.030
you know don't let
that limit your dream.

01:40:12.030 --> 01:40:14.410
They're having a problem with
Gaphi getting a network going.

01:40:14.410 --> 01:40:15.710
Here's a network scholar.

01:40:15.710 --> 01:40:17.590
And just having that ability
for them to watch someone do it.

01:40:17.590 --> 01:40:19.690
And you just see the
gears click in their mind.

01:40:19.690 --> 01:40:21.440
And they can go back
to their home campus,

01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:23.350
and eventually they'll
run their own datathon.

01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:25.450
And it's like this virus that
will spread around the world.

01:40:25.450 --> 01:40:27.330
So, that's my dream.

01:40:27.330 --> 01:40:29.600
Yeah. Go ahead.

01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:35.110
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 6: I think also, there's
part of, institutions provide sort

01:40:35.110 --> 01:40:38.100
of indorsement in some ways of
our work and legitimize some

01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:40.570
of the exploratory work that
we're doing that some chunks

01:40:40.570 --> 01:40:44.110
of our field might see as
unimportant or legitimate.

01:40:44.110 --> 01:40:47.240
I also think that the view that
institutions like the Library

01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:50.150 position:56%
of Congress and the British
Library and such bring the long view

01:40:50.150 --> 01:40:55.260
of contextualizing, provenance,
preservation, the connectedness

01:40:55.260 --> 01:40:59.420
and also maybe help decrease
some of the sort of fetishizing

01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:02.410
of the technical and also help us
sort of contextualize and center,

01:41:02.410 --> 01:41:06.280
so I think there's a grounding
that these institutions can provide

01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:09.690
that I think is really helpful that
as we innovate, it's also important

01:41:09.690 --> 01:41:12.210
for us to get some of the
grounding from the institutions.

01:41:12.210 --> 01:41:17.550
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 8: I think one of the
other things that institutions

01:41:17.550 --> 01:41:21.720
like the Library of Congress
and your institution can do are

01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:25.670
to take the lead in helping to
resolve some of the gray areas

01:41:25.670 --> 01:41:29.320
of the ethical and legal
issues in preservation,

01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:32.120
or sharing this type of data.

01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:36.430
So, I that role, you know
these institutions can do it.

01:41:36.430 --> 01:41:40.900
A good example is what internet
archive also has done in some

01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:42.930
of the areas that a few
years ago were gray areas

01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:45.230
and they've just done it
in terms of taking lead

01:41:45.230 --> 01:41:47.280
and going ahead and preserving it.

01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:54.460
So, I think that's a role that also
the LOC and British Library can do.

01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:55.880
&gt;&gt; IAN MILLIGAN: Well,
I think we're at 11:15.

01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:57.730 position:56%
And we're going to be on time today.

01:41:57.730 --> 01:42:00.510
So, thank you very much give
them all a round of applause.

01:42:00.510 --> 01:42:35.640
[ Applause ]

01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:37.530
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: You're
not taking this down?

01:42:37.530 --> 01:42:38.830
You're leaving this here?

01:42:38.830 --> 01:42:40.130
Yeah. Okay.

01:42:40.130 --> 01:42:42.430
Okay then.

01:42:44.230 --> 01:42:49.510
So, we move seamlessly onto
our first panel of the day.

01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:51.810
Do you need?

01:42:51.810 --> 01:42:54.110
Okay.

01:43:01.330 --> 01:43:04.600
We move seamlessly onto our
first, I want to thank Ian

01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:08.320
and Jimmy and Matt for that.

01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:10.620
I think this is, we
were really pleased

01:43:10.620 --> 01:43:14.790
that we could run the datathon
back to back with this event.

01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:16.090
It's worked so well.

01:43:16.090 --> 01:43:19.570
And I think it's so important
that as well as hearing

01:43:19.570 --> 01:43:23.520
from the wise ones, we
get the next generation.

01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:24.820
These are the future.

01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:29.610
And these are the people that will
actually carry the banner forward

01:43:29.610 --> 01:43:32.180
and do the most amazing things

01:43:32.180 --> 01:43:35.150
with the data that's coming
out of these archives.

01:43:35.150 --> 01:43:37.640
And that's so, so important.

01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:40.980
And as we keep saying, it is
institutions like the libraries

01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:42.650
that will be here,
and the universities

01:43:42.650 --> 01:43:44.530
that will be here for
many years to come.

01:43:44.530 --> 01:43:47.400
When we were at George
Washington University on Monday,

01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:51.800 position:56%
they made the point of how difficult
it is to do interdisciplinary work

01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:54.520
and you know we've really forged
ahead with this at Southampton

01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:57.510
and it's really difficult
in universities to get

01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:59.520
to bring different
disciplines together

01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:01.920
and this type of event can do that.

01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:05.560
So, without further ado, I'm doing
to introduce one of my co-hosts

01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:08.340
for the day, David Lazer
from Northeastern University,

01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:09.710
who's going to chair this panel.

01:44:09.710 --> 01:44:11.510
David.

01:44:11.510 --> 01:44:18.790
[ Applause ]

01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:23.400
&gt;&gt; DAVID LAZER: Thank you Wendy
and thank you to the library,

01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:26.600
I think this is truly
an awesome place,

01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:30.090
by which I mean it
truly does inspire awe

01:44:30.090 --> 01:44:34.000
about the possibilities
of human knowledge.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:37.180
And, I'm just going
to say a few words.

01:44:37.180 --> 01:44:41.520 position:56%
I'm going to keep it short and sweet
and then I'll introduce our panel,

01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:46.810
or I'll introduce panelist
by panelist.

01:44:46.810 --> 01:44:53.200
You know, I think a motivating
example might be the election

01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:59.940
of 2016, right, which is
an extraordinary election

01:44:59.940 --> 01:45:02.360
and if one were to write
up what has happened,

01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:07.130
I think you would just say it was
implausible as a piece of fiction.

01:45:07.130 --> 01:45:12.320
And you know that there will
be a best-selling book in 2116

01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:15.550
when everyone has forgotten this
election to say, you're not going

01:45:15.550 --> 01:45:19.190
to believe what the election
of 2016 was like, right?

01:45:19.190 --> 01:45:23.980
And it is inconceivable that
one could write such a history

01:45:23.980 --> 01:45:29.550
without extensive use of
what is happening on the web,

01:45:29.550 --> 01:45:31.610
what has manifested,
what is recorded.

01:45:31.610 --> 01:45:35.720
And indeed, the amount of
information and possibilities

01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:37.990
that you have access
to are incredibly more

01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:39.290
than one would have access

01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:43.470
to in let's say the
election of 1860, today.

01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:51.280
And so, in part, the
interesting challenge then becomes

01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:52.790
that we can't really
save everything,

01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:56.470
in fact in some sense we can
only save a timely fraction

01:45:56.470 --> 01:45:58.040
of everything.

01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:02.850
And you know I think because
I'm a political scientist,

01:46:02.850 --> 01:46:07.520
so I'm not the historian, and
I'll be long forgotten come 2116,

01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:11.290 position:56%
but for me as a political scientist,
I think, wow we can watch,

01:46:11.290 --> 01:46:14.020
literally in principle watch
things spread real time,

01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:16.860
but we can watch snippets of texts

01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:20.240
of ideas spread through
the internet.

01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:24.920
And so, but that's not something
necessarily that can be done

01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:28.770
if you don't record the right kinds
of information in the right places,

01:46:28.770 --> 01:46:31.050
at the right temporal granularity.

01:46:31.050 --> 01:46:35.270
And so, part of the question and
part of why I hope we engage today

01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:41.180
in some fashion is the need for
preservation, but the preservation

01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:43.360
of what, for what questions,

01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:47.720
which is an incredibly impossible
question really in a way.

01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:53.120
Because we can't even anticipate
what the conceptual questions will

01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:56.900
be two years from now, ten years
from now, 100 years from now.

01:46:56.900 --> 01:47:00.910
We can't anticipate the analytic
machinery that will be available,

01:47:00.910 --> 01:47:02.480
the development of theory.

01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:07.140
I think that to address
Cerf's question earlier,

01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:09.870
you know how does the digitization
of things change things,

01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:12.100
it changes everything right?

01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:18.830
Because and I don't think we
can even imagine, for example,

01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:21.800
for me as a social scientist,
what the social sciences

01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:26.820
of a decade will look like because
we can see different things,

01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:29.610
we will be able to
imagine different things.

01:47:29.610 --> 01:47:34.090
And imagine and construct
theories in a way that's so removed

01:47:34.090 --> 01:47:39.070
from social sciences
before the present.

01:47:39.070 --> 01:47:43.800
And so, that's really the
intellectual possibilities.

01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:49.990
I think I do want to throw out
just one more notion of archiving,

01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:53.790
just while we're throwing
out just sort of the notion

01:47:53.790 --> 01:47:57.200
of capturing what is out there

01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:07.620
on the web is how do we capture
the experiences of individuals.

01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:10.740
And I think that there
is the opportunity,

01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:14.260
perhaps for what one might
call citizen archiving.

01:48:14.260 --> 01:48:16.620
And we've touched a
little bit on this.

01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:23.800
But you know, what are
people reading online that is

01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:26.410
if you capture what is online,

01:48:26.410 --> 01:48:29.060
doesn't actually capture
what people are looking at,

01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:30.870
and who is looking at that.

01:48:30.870 --> 01:48:34.660
And so, part of what I'd like
to throw out there is the notion

01:48:34.660 --> 01:48:41.660
of a couple of notions, one is
how do we interrogate people's

01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:49.740 position:56%
experiences of the web in a way that
is then captured in doing fashion.

01:48:49.740 --> 01:48:52.750
And some of that may
literally be asking people

01:48:52.750 --> 01:48:54.710
about their experiences, but a lot

01:48:54.710 --> 01:48:59.960
of that may be also capturing
just the digital traces

01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:03.860
of individuals' experiences
on the internet.

01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:06.490
You know do the people who look

01:49:06.490 --> 01:49:09.550
at "The New York Times" are the
same people who watch "Fox News?"

01:49:09.550 --> 01:49:11.270
Probably not, right?

01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:13.460
But how do we know that.

01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:20.110
And how do we separate and sift
through everything in a way

01:49:20.110 --> 01:49:24.970
that captures our contemporary
understanding

01:49:24.970 --> 01:49:29.060
of where's the noise
and where the signal is.

01:49:29.060 --> 01:49:31.290
Because we know, like with Twitter.

01:49:31.290 --> 01:49:33.660
I'm a big fan of Twitter
as a resource.

01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:34.960
But it's mostly garbage.

01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:39.190
I mean, you know, it's you know
is bots, it's heterogenous.

01:49:39.190 --> 01:49:43.700 position:56%
It's a lot of the analysis that look
out there, basically pools together,

01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:51.640
you know humans; regular people,
journalists, politicians, and tons

01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:53.410
and tons of bots, some of many,

01:49:53.410 --> 01:49:55.420
most of whom you don't
know are bots, right?

01:49:55.420 --> 01:49:57.360
And then just sort of
aggregating the analysis

01:49:57.360 --> 01:49:59.410
like those are all
comparable things, right?

01:49:59.410 --> 01:50:00.710
It's a problem.

01:50:00.710 --> 01:50:02.010
Right?

01:50:02.010 --> 01:50:07.420
And so there maybe things we
can do today in terms of sorting

01:50:07.420 --> 01:50:09.950
through this, that will be
impossible to do tomorrow.

01:50:09.950 --> 01:50:15.500
And so, how do we build the tools
that allows us to separate the read

01:50:15.500 --> 01:50:19.230 position:56%
from the chat, when there's you
know such a bad ratio to begin with.

01:50:19.230 --> 01:50:25.260
So, I sort of like
the notion of someway

01:50:25.260 --> 01:50:30.820
of interactively capturing people's
experiences and saving that.

01:50:30.820 --> 01:50:33.180
Of asking people about
their experiences,

01:50:33.180 --> 01:50:35.480
and a lot of this is
sort of a mashup

01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:38.880
of archiving old school
social science methods.

01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:47.790 position:56%
And so, I'm just going to throw that
out as something to contemplate.

01:50:47.790 --> 01:50:51.810
But, you know I'm going to now
shift to introducing, well,

01:50:51.810 --> 01:50:55.070
I'll introduce our first
panelist, Jeff Bailey.

01:50:55.070 --> 01:50:58.070
I think Jeff represents
the internet.

01:50:58.070 --> 01:50:59.370
&gt;&gt; JEFFERSON BAILEY: Jefferson.

01:50:59.370 --> 01:51:00.670
&gt;&gt; DAVID LAZER: Jefferson.

01:51:00.670 --> 01:51:01.970
I'm sorry.

01:51:01.970 --> 01:51:03.270
&gt;&gt; JEFFERSON BAILEY:
It's on the program.

01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:07.370
&gt;&gt; DAVID LAZER: I realized that,
as soon as I said that but.

01:51:07.370 --> 01:51:09.360
And now that it's been
taped, and will be put

01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:11.580
up on the internet,
it will be archived.

01:51:11.580 --> 01:51:12.880
&gt;&gt; JEFFERSON BAILEY: It's
in the historical records.

01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:14.180
&gt;&gt; DAVID LAZER: That's right.

01:51:14.180 --> 01:51:19.160
So, this goes to the point
of noise being recorded.

01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:21.140
So, Jefferson Bailey
and I knew that as soon

01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:22.830
as I said it to my apologies.

01:51:22.830 --> 01:51:25.330
Since my last name is
always mispronounced,

01:51:25.330 --> 01:51:26.840
even by friends of decades.

01:51:26.840 --> 01:51:29.460
But Wendy did pronounce
it correctly.

01:51:29.460 --> 01:51:30.760
So, thank you.

01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:35.990
But Nasha always gets it wrong so.

01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:42.690
Jefferson flew out
here from California,

01:51:42.690 --> 01:51:46.750
from the Internet Archive, where
he's been working since 2014,

01:51:46.750 --> 01:51:50.230
and as has already been mentioned,
our legion archive is one

01:51:50.230 --> 01:51:53.190
of the leading institutions
for doing this.

01:51:53.190 --> 01:51:55.950
It was way ahead of the curve.

01:51:55.950 --> 01:52:01.580
And his work involves managing
numerous web archiving services.

01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:05.970
And before that he was
involved in many initiatives

01:52:05.970 --> 01:52:10.540
around digital preservation
in a variety of institutions

01:52:10.540 --> 01:52:14.870
and libraries which is
enumerated in the biographies here.

01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:18.650
So, I'm going to shift
the mic to Jefferson.

01:52:18.650 --> 01:52:21.510
So, thank you.

01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:27.010
[ Applause ]

01:52:27.010 --> 01:52:28.310
&gt;&gt; JEFFERSON BAILEY: All right.

01:52:28.310 --> 01:52:29.610
Thanks, David.

01:52:29.610 --> 01:52:30.910
Okay cool.

01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:32.210
It works. So, hi everyone.

01:52:32.210 --> 01:52:33.510
I am Jefferson Bailey
director of web archives

01:52:33.510 --> 01:52:34.880
and programs and internet archives.

01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:37.320
And first, obviously, I
just want to thank Wendy

01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:39.040
for putting on this awesome event.

01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:41.610
Kluge and LOC for hosting.

01:52:41.610 --> 01:52:45.190 position:56%
And also, of course, Ian and Matt
and the whole Archives Unleased team

01:52:45.190 --> 01:52:48.180
for doing the datathon, actually
the second one we've done

01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:50.980
and it was really amazing over
the course of the datathon

01:52:50.980 --> 01:52:55.840
to see researchers actually using
these web archives that often,

01:52:55.840 --> 01:52:59.000
some of them I have crawled
myself entirely on a whim.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:05.480
So, the historical record often
is determined by areas of interest

01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:07.480
and I was like, let's
crawl every museum site

01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:09.980
and people did some awesome
stuff with the museum data.

01:53:09.980 --> 01:53:13.260
So, Wendy sort of challenged
us to do a little history,

01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:16.320
a little method, and then
a little big picture stuff

01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:17.620
in a very short time frame.

01:53:17.620 --> 01:53:19.530
So, I'm going to try to run
through it pretty quickly.

01:53:19.530 --> 01:53:22.280
So, folks that don't know
the Internet Archive,

01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:23.580
we are a nonprofit library.

01:53:23.580 --> 01:53:25.060 position:56%
We are in a church in San Francisco.

01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:26.360
It's open to the public.

01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:27.820
Please come by if you're in town.

01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:30.210
And we have been around, this
is our 20-year anniversary.

01:53:30.210 --> 01:53:32.230
So, there will be some big
events later in the year.

01:53:32.230 --> 01:53:35.620
And our mission is universal
access to all knowledge.

01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:38.270
So, we are not just an
archive of web material.

01:53:38.270 --> 01:53:40.540
We actually have lots
of digital content.

01:53:40.540 --> 01:53:42.120
You'll see all the stats there.

01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:46.190 position:56%
The one, of course, most relevant
to our talk today is our web archive

01:53:46.190 --> 01:53:49.730
which is about to hit
50 billion captures.

01:53:49.730 --> 01:53:53.880
So, we've been doing it
since the beginning in 1996.

01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:57.790
We get about a billion captures,
a capture is just a web resource,

01:53:57.790 --> 01:54:00.620
per week, and a little
over a petabyte per year

01:54:00.620 --> 01:54:02.310
in web data specifically.

01:54:02.310 --> 01:54:07.170
So, we do have 25 petabytes of
unique information of all variety,

01:54:07.170 --> 01:54:10.850
and a little over a half of
that is the web material.

01:54:10.850 --> 01:54:13.650
So, here's sort of how
our crawling and capture

01:54:13.650 --> 01:54:16.120
for web content has
gone over the years.

01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:17.960
Obviously scaled up.

01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:20.990
I didn't actually put YouTube
on there, but YouTube should be

01:54:20.990 --> 01:54:24.940
on this slide somewhere since it of
course, audio video, it's migration

01:54:24.940 --> 01:54:29.900
to the web has really expanded
storage needs for all web archives.

01:54:29.900 --> 01:54:34.630
So, our crawling I think
sometimes strikes people as being,

01:54:34.630 --> 01:54:38.170 position:56%
it's one big crawl, and the internet
archive just crawls everything.

01:54:38.170 --> 01:54:41.560 position:56%
And it's actually much more dynamic.

01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:45.760
It's much more, I have this sort of
constellation metaphor in my talk.

01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:48.560
And I'll cover a couple
of the different methods,

01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:52.120
but it's actually, I call it
multimodal crawling strategy.

01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:55.610
So, we capture in many different
ways, not just ourselves,

01:54:55.610 --> 01:54:58.400
but also working directly
with partners.

01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:02.910
We do run big global crawls, both
at a very wide and shallow level,

01:55:02.910 --> 01:55:06.620
and at a very deep and
sort of well-scoped level.

01:55:06.620 --> 01:55:07.920
So, there are global crawls.

01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:11.120
But, other things we do are
work with national libraries

01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:15.310
to capture country level
domains, so, CCTLDs.

01:55:15.310 --> 01:55:19.460
So, we worked over the years with
at least a dozen national libraries

01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:22.270
to get dot something, something.

01:55:22.270 --> 01:55:26.190
To get sort of a big capture of
a specific country's web domain.

01:55:26.190 --> 01:55:29.390
We have collaborative collections,
a couple of which I mentioned here.

01:55:29.390 --> 01:55:32.610
End of Term Web Archive, that we
do with LC and a number of others,

01:55:32.610 --> 01:55:34.320
which is capturing a snapshot

01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:37.320
of the entire US Federal
Government web domain at every,

01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:40.150
before and after every
presidential transition.

01:55:40.150 --> 01:55:41.960
We capture things like
orphan domains.

01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:44.500
People talked about the Cuba
collection, we just decided

01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:46.880 position:56%
to crawl .cu, just because we could.

01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:50.330
Spontaneous events, of
course, we're doing crawling

01:55:50.330 --> 01:55:54.360 position:56%
around the pulse event and have done
it for all sorts of global events.

01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:58.310
And the of course we work directly
with researchers, K12 institutes

01:55:58.310 --> 01:56:01.340
and partnerships with
educational programs.

01:56:01.340 --> 01:56:06.120 position:56%
And those are both to get subject
experts to contribute seeds and URLs

01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:08.220
for us to crawl and
also of course to work

01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:10.120
with them I use of our archives.

01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:14.490
Another thing I was really
enamored events talk about the need

01:56:14.490 --> 01:56:17.870
for business models, and
especially sustainability

01:56:17.870 --> 01:56:19.740
around web archiving programs,

01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:23.500
internet archive does have a quite
possible web archiving subscription

01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:28.400
service that's used by almost 500
institutions, mostly libraries

01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:32.840 position:56%
and archives, in the academic realm
to create curated special collection

01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:35.810
of archives that they
can then of course store

01:56:35.810 --> 01:56:39.910
and preserve locally themselves, as
well as provide access through IA.

01:56:39.910 --> 01:56:42.420
So, those are capture
methods, access methods.

01:56:42.420 --> 01:56:44.200
Of course, most people
are going to be familiar

01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:45.810
with the Wayback Machine.

01:56:45.810 --> 01:56:49.160
You can enter a URL and see
its capture rate over time.

01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:51.610
Of course, the obvious example is
an early capture of the Library

01:56:51.610 --> 01:56:54.080
of Congress website from 1999.

01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:56.820
It actually holds up in
this sort of web design way.

01:56:56.820 --> 01:56:59.250
So, props to LC.

01:56:59.250 --> 01:57:02.010
Of course, there's other
types of collections too.

01:57:02.010 --> 01:57:05.770
So, not just websites,
but type of web content

01:57:05.770 --> 01:57:07.400
that you can then aggregate.

01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:09.950
So, this is of course,
we just extracted a bunch

01:57:09.950 --> 01:57:12.110
of animated GIFs of puppies.

01:57:12.110 --> 01:57:15.350
Because I really truly believe that
the web would not be what it is

01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:18.010
without the ability
to share dog photos.

01:57:18.010 --> 01:57:21.180
But it also, sort of is indicative

01:57:21.180 --> 01:57:23.250
of the creative expression
that's also on the web,

01:57:23.250 --> 01:57:28.080
that we sometimes forget about when
focusing on the scholarly record.

01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:29.830
Other access models
like the hack-a-thon,

01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:32.780
or research partnerships
to get our data out there

01:57:32.780 --> 01:57:34.900
and get people using
it in different ways.

01:57:34.900 --> 01:57:36.610
So, that's access methods.

01:57:36.610 --> 01:57:39.610
And then sort of technology
and infrastructure methods,

01:57:39.610 --> 01:57:42.280
we are of course dedicated
to open source software.

01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:45.350
Heritrix as a crawler, Wayback
as the piece of software.

01:57:45.350 --> 01:57:49.200
And we are developing new methods
of crawling technology to deal

01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:52.530
with the dynamic web
in java script as well

01:57:52.530 --> 01:57:57.420 position:56%
as more API based infrastructure for
interoperability of cross systems.

01:57:57.420 --> 01:58:00.240
And so, when thinking about
opportunities and challenges,

01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:02.130
we have this thing called
the do we have it at API.

01:58:02.130 --> 01:58:05.650
And it's basically just a big
dump of all sorts of identifiers

01:58:05.650 --> 01:58:08.200
from catalogs and ISBNs and things.

01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:11.400
And we can just hit it and see
whether we have it in the archive.

01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:13.150
And I thought that was an
interesting model for thinking

01:58:13.150 --> 01:58:16.570
about what we have and what we sort
of accomplished in web archiving.

01:58:16.570 --> 01:58:19.040
And what we don't have and what
are the current challenges.

01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:22.970
So, we are content agnostic for
acquisition of web material.

01:58:22.970 --> 01:58:28.220
It's print, it's audio video, it's
code, it's CSS all kind of thing.

01:58:28.220 --> 01:58:31.950
The web has consumed
basically all methods

01:58:31.950 --> 01:58:33.970
of digital information delivery.

01:58:33.970 --> 01:58:37.980
So, things that were not ever on
the web, printed in digital form

01:58:37.980 --> 01:58:39.430
and now just going
straight to the web.

01:58:39.430 --> 01:58:42.870 position:56%
The legal issues, I think they still
exist a little bit, but have been,

01:58:42.870 --> 01:58:46.070
I think we've made incredible
progress, the whole community

01:58:46.070 --> 01:58:49.790 position:56%
over the years on this when internet
archives started, before my time,

01:58:49.790 --> 01:58:52.560
but people were like, 'oh my
God, you can't capture it.'

01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:54.210
And, 'oh my God, you
can't even replay it,

01:58:54.210 --> 01:58:56.210
how could you do that,
it's not yours.'

01:58:56.210 --> 01:58:58.780
But it is of course a
public publishing platform.

01:58:58.780 --> 01:59:02.720
And I think advocacy around access
has really grown over the years.

01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:04.100
Time travels.

01:59:04.100 --> 01:59:06.770
Obviously, we have been building
time travel into the web.

01:59:06.770 --> 01:59:10.290
There are lots of browser
plugins and methods for looking

01:59:10.290 --> 01:59:15.780
at archival replays of web
content over time in a way

01:59:15.780 --> 01:59:18.420
that is very familiar to
browsing the live web.

01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:21.200
Collaborative models,
some technical stuff.

01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:23.840 position:56%
We do de-duplicate content in cases.

01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:27.130
We do actually do and crawl
RSS feeds, every link added

01:59:27.130 --> 01:59:29.590
to Wikipedia, every blogger entry.

01:59:29.590 --> 01:59:33.390
Lots of other methods that
we get automatic URL feeds

01:59:33.390 --> 01:59:35.230
that go right into the crawlers.

01:59:35.230 --> 01:59:37.690
And lots of automation
around crawling activities.

01:59:37.690 --> 01:59:40.760
So, the web has become much more
dynamic, interactive, scrolling,

01:59:40.760 --> 01:59:43.320
clicking, and we're of
course trying to build bots

01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:45.700
to do that behavior at scale.

01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:48.230
And then emulation which
Vint also talked about.

01:59:48.230 --> 01:59:49.790
What have we not been
doing so great?

01:59:49.790 --> 01:59:51.880
The web has been moving
of course more and more

01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:53.180
to a programming environment.

01:59:53.180 --> 01:59:54.720
It's not static documents.

01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:57.980
It's interactions, it's
replay, it's behaviors.

01:59:57.980 --> 01:59:59.790
And those are very
challenging to capture

01:59:59.790 --> 02:00:03.230
with our traditional
archival methods.

02:00:03.230 --> 02:00:05.940
APIfication, Wild Gardens,
Cloud Computing.

02:00:05.940 --> 02:00:08.700
These are all mostly
inaccessible except

02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:13.270
for with human intermediation,
or passwords or other methods.

02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:14.740
So, that could really
limit the amount

02:00:14.740 --> 02:00:16.260
of content we're able to capture.

02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:18.090
Interoperability, we're
getting there,

02:00:18.090 --> 02:00:20.450
but a lot of web archiving
systems don't necessarily talk

02:00:20.450 --> 02:00:24.870
to each other very well, or require
very centralized infrastructure

02:00:24.870 --> 02:00:26.370
to operate.

02:00:26.370 --> 02:00:29.780
And then bulk access is challenging
at the scale in which we operate,

02:00:29.780 --> 02:00:32.060
which is the multi petabyte scale.

02:00:32.060 --> 02:00:35.430
And making resources available
for training and education,

02:00:35.430 --> 02:00:39.030
and how things were captured
or how you can work with them.

02:00:39.030 --> 02:00:42.310
So, in looking at these sorts
of areas of archival activity.

02:00:42.310 --> 02:00:45.410
So, I come from an archiving
background, and I always try

02:00:45.410 --> 02:00:48.770
to think of web archiving within
the traditional archival endeavor.

02:00:48.770 --> 02:00:52.080
And you sort of have these three
modes of Selection, capture

02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:54.980
and management, and access
which have not just code

02:00:54.980 --> 02:00:58.320
and technology involved, but
of course communities as well.

02:00:58.320 --> 02:01:01.890
And so, when you sort of
think about networking

02:01:01.890 --> 02:01:04.780
between these different
areas of operation,

02:01:04.780 --> 02:01:08.570
and maybe prescript your slide with
a certain model, it actually starts

02:01:08.570 --> 02:01:14.050
to look quite similar to the
original technical diagram of TCP.

02:01:14.050 --> 02:01:17.570
So, I've been thinking a
lot as a web history nerd,

02:01:17.570 --> 02:01:19.780
of sort of the successes
of the internet

02:01:19.780 --> 02:01:23.340
and Vint spoke much more
eloquently to this than I will.

02:01:23.340 --> 02:01:26.580
But what made the internet such
the incredible amazing thing

02:01:26.580 --> 02:01:29.220
that has just sort of
conquered the world.

02:01:29.220 --> 02:01:32.430
And what can we, when building web
archiving, web organic programs

02:01:32.430 --> 02:01:36.160
and technologies take some
of those key themes out.

02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:38.640
And so, Vint talked
about the modulization,

02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:42.370 position:56%
the distributed nature, the
portability and flexibility of a lot

02:01:42.370 --> 02:01:44.740
of the technical systems
and protocols.

02:01:44.740 --> 02:01:46.430
I think the social construction

02:01:46.430 --> 02:01:48.830
of the internet's evolution
was very important.

02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:54.710 position:56%
It was not just producers creating
for users, the producers were users.

02:01:54.710 --> 02:01:57.780
And that innovation was dispersed
around a social community

02:01:57.780 --> 02:02:01.660
that was both informal and
you know very feedback driven.

02:02:01.660 --> 02:02:04.570
And of course, it was
built for scalability

02:02:04.570 --> 02:02:06.650
for gateway between networks.

02:02:06.650 --> 02:02:08.630
And for great fault tolerance.

02:02:08.630 --> 02:02:11.270
And we can sort of adapt some
of these to web archiving.

02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:14.440
We are trying to modularize
crawling, not just in the global

02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:18.200
and little special,
and domain style,

02:02:18.200 --> 02:02:20.150
but also the methods of capture.

02:02:20.150 --> 02:02:24.890
Proxy browsing, traditional
crawling, user interaction,

02:02:24.890 --> 02:02:29.650
archival replay, and capture
while you actually browse.

02:02:29.650 --> 02:02:33.200
Making WARCs and metadata
more portable between systems.

02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:36.470
The work is something of
a heterogenous format.

02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:39.630
But then also building on
the lessons of the early net

02:02:39.630 --> 02:02:43.610
for social construction, community
models, coordinated collecting,

02:02:43.610 --> 02:02:46.990
collaborations with K
through 12 programs as well

02:02:46.990 --> 02:02:51.100
as academic researchers, and
then systems of interoperability

02:02:51.100 --> 02:02:53.510
and multiplicity of access models.

02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:56.190
And so, I always try to
close talks with sort

02:02:56.190 --> 02:02:58.430
of what are the big
preservation imperatives.

02:02:58.430 --> 02:03:01.450
I think we wanted to go big and
keep in mind for this conference

02:03:01.450 --> 02:03:05.120
at least, if we're going to
work to save the web at scale,

02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:07.850
what are sort of our
motivating factors.

02:03:07.850 --> 02:03:10.450
And I do think, obviously,
I think as most of us do,

02:03:10.450 --> 02:03:14.230
the web is the most significant
communication platform of our era,

02:03:14.230 --> 02:03:17.570
so we are living in a very unique
historical moment that has a piece

02:03:17.570 --> 02:03:23.120 position:56%
of technology that has changed a lot
of how, not just how we buy things

02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:25.400
and interact and socialize,

02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:29.190
but really the whole sort
of landscape of society.

02:03:29.190 --> 02:03:32.710
It also marks an unprecedented
confluence of ease of publication

02:03:32.710 --> 02:03:34.710
and ease of archival acquisition.

02:03:34.710 --> 02:03:37.830
So, archives used to have to go out
and get things, or pay for them,

02:03:37.830 --> 02:03:42.030
or work with donors to get them,
and it was very action driven.

02:03:42.030 --> 02:03:46.250
And things were published and they
were sort of in some remote world.

02:03:46.250 --> 02:03:49.200
But we're in this unique moment
where you can both make a blog

02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:52.060
and you can archive it
within seconds essentially.

02:03:52.060 --> 02:03:54.950
So, that's a very unique
characteristic

02:03:54.950 --> 02:03:56.250
of our moment of time.

02:03:56.250 --> 02:03:59.440
It also, I think as David
and Ian both spoke to,

02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:03.030
allows for this unprecedented
plurality of representation

02:04:03.030 --> 02:04:05.330
within the historical record.

02:04:05.330 --> 02:04:08.510
You know, traditionally,
archives were very much motivated

02:04:08.510 --> 02:04:12.280
by power, or wealth.

02:04:12.280 --> 02:04:18.540 position:56%
So, the folks captured in the
archives were often people that were

02:04:18.540 --> 02:04:21.350
of power and wealth
and of a certain class.

02:04:21.350 --> 02:04:23.840
And it was very difficult to
necessarily capture the day

02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:27.680 position:56%
to day lives of average citizens and
that's really changed with the web.

02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:30.900
And then the last one is just the
sort of great motivating factor,

02:04:30.900 --> 02:04:34.880
that as Wendy also mentioned
are our moment in time,

02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:36.700
where we can archive its scale

02:04:36.700 --> 02:04:40.130
and get this amazing
diverse record will be very,

02:04:40.130 --> 02:04:43.500
very brief in the soft
of technological arc.

02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:44.800
And that's it.

02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:46.600
Thanks, everyone.

02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:56.000
[ Applause ]

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:59.600
&gt;&gt; DAVID LAZER: Just trying
to get it right this time, so.

02:04:59.600 --> 02:05:03.140
It's my pleasure to introduce
Richard Marciano of the University

02:05:03.140 --> 02:05:06.710
of Maryland who has
been leader, a thinker,

02:05:06.710 --> 02:05:15.070
and doer in developing models for
the preservation and dissemination

02:05:15.070 --> 02:05:17.640
of human records on the internet.

02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:22.440 position:56%
And thinking about developing proper
cyber infrastructures for that.

02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:27.340
And in his current role, he wears
the hat of a center dedicated

02:05:27.340 --> 02:05:31.190
to exactly those questions.

02:05:31.190 --> 02:05:36.230
The newly formed digital
curation innovation center.

02:05:36.230 --> 02:05:39.980
So, looking forward to
hearing about those efforts

02:05:39.980 --> 02:05:45.510
and his thoughts on the subject.

02:05:45.510 --> 02:05:53.590
[ Applause ]

02:05:53.590 --> 02:05:55.480
&gt;&gt; RICHARD MARCIANO:
Can you hear me?

02:05:55.480 --> 02:05:56.780
Okay. And I'll put my timer

02:05:56.780 --> 02:06:00.340
on because we're I think
there's a crunch here as well.

02:06:00.340 --> 02:06:03.840
We don't have three minutes,
but we have a little more.

02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:05.880
Oh, I forgot the clicker.

02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:08.360
Thank you.

02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:12.770
Okay. So, can't see
it on this screen.

02:06:12.770 --> 02:06:16.180
Can I also see the
slides on the laptop, or?

02:06:16.180 --> 02:06:17.690
Just over here.

02:06:17.690 --> 02:06:21.010
Okay. So, my name is
Richard Marciano.

02:06:21.010 --> 02:06:23.090
I've been at the University
of Maryland

02:06:23.090 --> 02:06:25.440 position:56%
for a little over a year and a half.

02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:30.050
And in my prior life
I spent over a decade

02:06:30.050 --> 02:06:31.840
at the San Diego Super
Computer Centers.

02:06:31.840 --> 02:06:36.130
I'm a computational type person,

02:06:36.130 --> 02:06:40.020
working on interdisciplinary
projects and had a stent of five

02:06:40.020 --> 02:06:41.640
or six years at the University

02:06:41.640 --> 02:06:44.300
of North Carolina Chapel
Hill in the I school.

02:06:44.300 --> 02:06:50.950
So, the theme I wanted to
tease a little bit relates

02:06:50.950 --> 02:06:56.930
to almost everything we've heard so
far, the notion of scale, and size,

02:06:56.930 --> 02:07:02.340 position:56%
and plenty, and the challenges, and
opportunities that result from that.

02:07:02.340 --> 02:07:05.550
So, I'm going to talk a
little bit about what it means

02:07:05.550 --> 02:07:09.820
to preserve in the age of big data.

02:07:09.820 --> 02:07:13.250
So, don't know if I can
pull all these things off

02:07:13.250 --> 02:07:18.060 position:56%
in the few minutes I have but this
is a little flow here, looking down.

02:07:18.060 --> 02:07:22.480
So, I'll give you a little bit
of background on a little context

02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:26.520
on this new center,
collaborative center we created,

02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:31.040
what its goals are, what we're
trying to achieve in terms

02:07:31.040 --> 02:07:35.920
of preservation, what some of the
connections are with web archiving.

02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:40.690
I'll talk next about a particular
project that's driving a lot

02:07:40.690 --> 02:07:42.500
of the cyber infrastructure
development,

02:07:42.500 --> 02:07:45.450
which is National Science
Foundation Project.

02:07:45.450 --> 02:07:48.900
It's one of these new
big data programs.

02:07:48.900 --> 02:07:51.400
This one's called DIBBs.

02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:53.360
Data Information Building Blocks.

02:07:53.360 --> 02:07:57.200
So, it's a software
development effort that tries

02:07:57.200 --> 02:07:59.910
to build preservation
services in the cloud.

02:07:59.910 --> 02:08:02.350
And I'll say a little
bit about that.

02:08:02.350 --> 02:08:07.400
And then since we're part of this
session that's worded as the need

02:08:07.400 --> 02:08:10.200
for preservation, I wasn't sure
if there was a question mark

02:08:10.200 --> 02:08:15.990 position:56%
or if it was a given [laughter], or
if we had to challenge the audience.

02:08:15.990 --> 02:08:21.580
So, I'll say a few things
about how I've tackled that

02:08:21.580 --> 02:08:25.300
and what's been funded, at
least in my spaces in the past.

02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:31.530
I'll talk about a recent
workshop that was held in April

02:08:31.530 --> 02:08:35.800
that captures a lot of this energy
and an upcoming future workshop

02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:38.800
in December if any of you are
interested in the DC area.

02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:44.500
And we'll end with just
an exploration of some

02:08:44.500 --> 02:08:50.510
of the federal research,
federal R&amp;D guidance and sort

02:08:50.510 --> 02:08:55.100
of future directions that
were recently formulated

02:08:55.100 --> 02:08:57.020
through several documents.

02:08:57.020 --> 02:09:01.720
They don't directly address these
notions out of visual curation,

02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:07.150
but if we deconstruct that and
try to pull it apart a little bit,

02:09:07.150 --> 02:09:10.540
I think we'll find a lot of
really exciting terminology

02:09:10.540 --> 02:09:16.210
that we can pull back and claim and
use to drive some of these agendas.

02:09:16.210 --> 02:09:20.050
So, it's kind of looking at
the past, looking at the future

02:09:20.050 --> 02:09:23.840
and formulating a few questions for
the audience, research questions.

02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:26.160
So, the goal is to get to
those questions and depending

02:09:26.160 --> 02:09:27.460
on how we're doing with time,

02:09:27.460 --> 02:09:32.230
I'll zip through this thing
and we'll get to that.

02:09:32.230 --> 02:09:35.500
So, this is a new center we
started at the University

02:09:35.500 --> 02:09:38.930
of Maryland it's called Digital
Curation Innovation Center.

02:09:38.930 --> 02:09:43.650
It looks at big records
and archival analytics.

02:09:43.650 --> 02:09:46.210
There's some 50 people
involved so far.

02:09:46.210 --> 02:09:50.290 position:56%
Lots of students, lots of colleagues
interested in these issues.

02:09:50.290 --> 02:09:55.250
External researchers with former
colleagues from the Library

02:09:55.250 --> 02:10:00.220
of Congress, National
Archives, NEH, IMLS.

02:10:00.220 --> 02:10:02.610
Several of whom are in the
room, who are all contributing

02:10:02.610 --> 02:10:07.130
to this visual curation
network we're trying to build,

02:10:07.130 --> 02:10:09.390 position:56%
which is both educational, research,

02:10:09.390 --> 02:10:12.990
and also has an infrastructure
dimension.

02:10:12.990 --> 02:10:16.550
So, one of the pieces of
infrastructure I wanted

02:10:16.550 --> 02:10:20.170
to highlight is something
we're calling the dataCave.

02:10:20.170 --> 02:10:23.050
Not as big as the Internet
Archive, just a small thing,

02:10:23.050 --> 02:10:28.700
but it's a peta scale archival
storage and analytics facility.

02:10:28.700 --> 02:10:33.650
It's powered by MetOp
storage, Dell computing.

02:10:33.650 --> 02:10:37.180
And one of the innovations
there is we're building.

02:10:37.180 --> 02:10:39.720
It's part of commercial start up.

02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:44.820
We're building an open source
archival piece of software,

02:10:44.820 --> 02:10:47.750
it's brand new it's
something called Indigo.

02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:55.210
It leverages no SQL platform
called Apache Cassandra.

02:10:55.210 --> 02:10:59.000
And it's being explored for
long term archival storage

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.020
and preservation purposes.

02:11:01.020 --> 02:11:04.160
So, the connection with web
archives is that we're using

02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:06.930
that platform testing
and building it.

02:11:06.930 --> 02:11:10.210
And we have some really
interesting collections,

02:11:10.210 --> 02:11:16.420
about 100 million files,
some 72 terabytes of data.

02:11:16.420 --> 02:11:19.160
This is work that was largely
done with the National Archives

02:11:19.160 --> 02:11:20.780
and continues in other directions.

02:11:20.780 --> 02:11:26.970
But, we've collected records
from over 150 federal agencies.

02:11:26.970 --> 02:11:31.890
So, records of all ILC, historical
records, contemporary records.

02:11:31.890 --> 02:11:37.270
A lot of these were collected
through crawling processes.

02:11:37.270 --> 02:11:41.460
Very often very targeted
crawling processes.

02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:43.350
We can come back to that later.

02:11:43.350 --> 02:11:44.650
So, that's our test bed.

02:11:44.650 --> 02:11:49.340
And the idea is that it's highly
un-curated, it's structured,

02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:52.830
it's hierarchical, but
it's highly un-curated

02:11:52.830 --> 02:11:56.010
and it's extremely
heterogenous and diverse.

02:11:56.010 --> 02:12:02.980
So, it's a big bag of
miscellaneous things with thousands

02:12:02.980 --> 02:12:07.840
of file formats from obviously
textual stuff, satellite imagery,

02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:13.110
data bases, desktop, photos.

02:12:13.110 --> 02:12:14.820
Name it, it's all in there.

02:12:14.820 --> 02:12:18.370
So, that's kind of our reference
collection and we're using

02:12:18.370 --> 02:12:22.570
that as a pretext to develop
computational archival approaches

02:12:22.570 --> 02:12:25.950
and do some of the things you heard
about in the hack-a-thon that have

02:12:25.950 --> 02:12:31.700
to do with automation
and doing that at scale.

02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:33.730
So, a couple of words
on Indigo [siren].

02:12:33.730 --> 02:12:36.310
Let me look at my clock here.

02:12:36.310 --> 02:12:39.140
Hope that siren is not related.

02:12:40.330 --> 02:12:45.970
So, built on Apache Cassandra,
it was originally developed

02:12:45.970 --> 02:12:49.930
by Facebook, it's used by a
plethora of companies from Adobe

02:12:49.930 --> 02:12:53.030
to Travelocity, T-Mobile, etcetera.

02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:58.910
Highly scalable so it scales to
petabytes of hundreds of petabytes.

02:12:58.910 --> 02:13:00.210
Of note, it's actually used

02:13:00.210 --> 02:13:04.160
to manage distributed data
centers so that's our platform.

02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:09.250
There's no external file system,
there's no single point of failure.

02:13:09.250 --> 02:13:12.820
Data's automatically
replicated and compressed.

02:13:12.820 --> 02:13:17.480
And you can store arbitrary data
objects and tag them with metadata

02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:21.870 position:56%
and create hierarchies and
containers, and all kinds of things.

02:13:21.870 --> 02:13:23.890
So, it allows organizations

02:13:23.890 --> 02:13:26.370
to deposit data objects
in a direct retreat.

02:13:26.370 --> 02:13:30.210
And then there's a whole
mechanism based on,

02:13:30.210 --> 02:13:31.510
sorry I'm looking down here.

02:13:31.510 --> 02:13:36.470
There's a whole mechanism
based on triggers, and actions,

02:13:36.470 --> 02:13:39.140
and so there's a whole
philosophy behind this of sort

02:13:39.140 --> 02:13:43.970
of not self-archiving archives,
but sort of self-cleaning archives

02:13:43.970 --> 02:13:48.150
and things that can do
a lot of automation,

02:13:48.150 --> 02:13:50.830
so self-managing repositories.

02:13:50.830 --> 02:13:55.700
So, very quickly, so number two, so
we're using this, all these layers

02:13:55.700 --> 02:13:59.450
to design, this is part
of NSF collaboration

02:13:59.450 --> 02:14:03.140
with the National Center for Super
Computing Applications in Illinois.

02:14:03.140 --> 02:14:09.520
So, we're developing
essentially a series

02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:13.490
of cloud based digital
preservation services.

02:14:13.490 --> 02:14:18.820
There are two classes of
services, legacy format converters

02:14:18.820 --> 02:14:24.480
and then there's a slew of
information extraction mechanisms.

02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:25.780
All right.

02:14:25.780 --> 02:14:28.030
So, what's been funded?

02:14:28.030 --> 02:14:31.380
I did a little walk
back through time.

02:14:31.380 --> 02:14:32.860
This is just for reference.

02:14:32.860 --> 02:14:37.360
Polls, titles of all kinds of
projects I've been involved with.

02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:41.550
I was more interested in looking
sort of at the signature of funding

02:14:41.550 --> 02:14:44.050
in which agencies have been
involved over the last few decades.

02:14:44.050 --> 02:14:47.810
And just in my own projects, some
of my own projects listed here,

02:14:47.810 --> 02:14:53.030
obviously, it's The National
Archives, Library of Congress, NSF,

02:14:53.030 --> 02:14:56.940
NHBRC, IMLS, Canadian
Shark, Homeland Security,

02:14:56.940 --> 02:15:03.340
Mellon Foundation, Darpa, and one
of the themes here is preservation

02:15:03.340 --> 02:15:07.440
of digital data, self-validating
archives, notions of automation.

02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:12.480
If I place all these projects and
I try to pull out sort of themes,

02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:15.960
I do a little topic
modeling inside that bubble,

02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:18.280
you see the complexity of all this.

02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:22.020
You have thousands of
data types, representative

02:15:22.020 --> 02:15:23.840
of what you find on the web.

02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:28.690 position:56%
All of these different categories
of preservation from geospatial data

02:15:28.690 --> 02:15:32.940
to digital humanities with
ethical considerations,

02:15:32.940 --> 02:15:35.710
scale, looking at work flows.

02:15:35.710 --> 02:15:37.100
On and on.

02:15:37.100 --> 02:15:40.300
And a lot of what you have with
big data is represented here.

02:15:40.300 --> 02:15:43.590
So, you might make a claim
that all the Vs are in there,

02:15:43.590 --> 02:15:48.010
but you also have another calling
which is all the Vs for eternity.

02:15:48.010 --> 02:15:51.600
So, how do you deal with
volume, variety, veracity,

02:15:51.600 --> 02:15:54.070
velocity at times, not always.

02:15:54.070 --> 02:15:59.810
And how do you keep that
around for a long, long time.

02:15:59.810 --> 02:16:01.970
So, very quickly these
are references

02:16:01.970 --> 02:16:03.270
that will be in the slides.

02:16:03.270 --> 02:16:05.750
So, we had a recent workshop if
any of you are interested in this.

02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:08.430
There's slides and videos in April,

02:16:08.430 --> 02:16:14.040
looking at computational archival
science, and positing that we need

02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:16.810
to sort of contribute
to moving this space

02:16:16.810 --> 02:16:20.370 position:56%
in this field toward what colleagues
are doing in other spaces,

02:16:20.370 --> 02:16:24.930
computational social science,
computational journalism.

02:16:24.930 --> 02:16:28.150
And that there's a place for
computational archival science.

02:16:28.150 --> 02:16:31.970
And we're forming a new community
if any of you are interested.

02:16:31.970 --> 02:16:33.710
Contact us, come and join us,

02:16:33.710 --> 02:16:35.720
this is kind of building
a social network.

02:16:35.720 --> 02:16:39.250
There's an upcoming
workshop in December

02:16:39.250 --> 02:16:42.670
at the IEEE big data conference
in DC, where we'll be looking

02:16:42.670 --> 02:16:44.450
at these issues of
digital records in the age

02:16:44.450 --> 02:16:46.780
of big data, including web records.

02:16:46.780 --> 02:16:51.780
Last couple of comments, there's
some really interesting documents,

02:16:51.780 --> 02:16:54.320
federal documents that
were just released.

02:16:54.320 --> 02:16:56.140
So, I've put a few notes in here.

02:16:56.140 --> 02:17:01.370
I'm not going to paraphrase, but I
invite you to take a look at those.

02:17:01.370 --> 02:17:05.040
While the funding agendas
don't directly talk

02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:09.340
about digital preservation
or archival curation

02:17:09.340 --> 02:17:13.250
and digital curation or
archival science per se,

02:17:13.250 --> 02:17:14.760
there's a lot to build on.

02:17:14.760 --> 02:17:17.350
And these are two documented
from the NITRD Group.

02:17:17.350 --> 02:17:21.330
So, this is out of the office of
Science, Technology and policy

02:17:21.330 --> 02:17:24.220
of the White House,
there's an April document

02:17:24.220 --> 02:17:31.720
which is the federal R&amp;D
supplementary budget for 2017.

02:17:31.720 --> 02:17:36.220
So, if you actually; NITRD is the
organization that coordinates all

02:17:36.220 --> 02:17:39.510
of the federal R&amp;D investments
and makes recommendations

02:17:39.510 --> 02:17:44.270
of what the research priorities
are for the following year.

02:17:44.270 --> 02:17:47.350
NARA is on here, NSF is
on here, a lot of people

02:17:47.350 --> 02:17:49.370
in the room are involved with this.

02:17:49.370 --> 02:17:52.860
So, if you look at the
very latest document,

02:17:52.860 --> 02:17:54.960
I highlighted sections 5 and 6.

02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:56.900 position:56%
These have been completely reworked.

02:17:56.900 --> 02:17:59.070
And even 6 is brand new.

02:17:59.070 --> 02:18:02.140
There's a whole section
on information management,

02:18:02.140 --> 02:18:04.970
and large-scale data
management and analysis.

02:18:04.970 --> 02:18:07.240
And these are really
worth looking at.

02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:11.290
And I highlighted in red all of
those areas that are congruent

02:18:11.290 --> 02:18:15.210
to the themes of the workshop
and research topics today.

02:18:15.210 --> 02:18:20.430
And these are highlighted
as growth areas,

02:18:20.430 --> 02:18:23.040
funding areas, futuristic areas.

02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:25.910
And this is an opportunity for
all of us to work together to see

02:18:25.910 --> 02:18:30.200
if we can tap into these
recommendations and make a mark.

02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:33.090
And voice our voices.

02:18:33.090 --> 02:18:36.570 position:56%
So, a lot of interesting stuff here.

02:18:36.570 --> 02:18:40.170
Last document and I'll
wrap up after that.

02:18:40.170 --> 02:18:43.910
This just came out a few weeks ago.

02:18:43.910 --> 02:18:46.250
Maria would probably
know about this.

02:18:46.250 --> 02:18:49.900
This is federal big data research
development strategic plan.

02:18:49.900 --> 02:18:51.900
Extremely interesting.

02:18:51.900 --> 02:18:56.570
All these considerations
on authenticity.

02:18:56.570 --> 02:19:01.370
So, a lot of the issues that
are referenced here have to do

02:19:01.370 --> 02:19:06.050
with trust, which is a
fundamental issue for all of us.

02:19:06.050 --> 02:19:09.040
What is trust, there
are issues of ethics.

02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:10.840
There are issues of training.

02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:15.540
There are issues of developing
the right kind of systems

02:19:15.540 --> 02:19:18.880
in cyber infrastructure
and what that means.

02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:23.290
Lots of references to
trustworthy digital repositories,

02:19:23.290 --> 02:19:26.810
which came out of OAIS and
conversations, etcetera where many

02:19:26.810 --> 02:19:28.770
of you have been involved.

02:19:28.770 --> 02:19:30.740
So, a few questions
and we'll end on this.

02:19:30.740 --> 02:19:34.420
So, looking at that
kind of landscape

02:19:34.420 --> 02:19:36.940
and the things we're trying to
start here are a few questions,

02:19:36.940 --> 02:19:39.550
maybe for the panel, maybe
for later on in the day.

02:19:39.550 --> 02:19:42.160
So, do we really need
to preserve the web?

02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:45.250
Don't laugh, yes.

02:19:45.250 --> 02:19:46.550
How much of it?

02:19:46.550 --> 02:19:48.880
All of it?

02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:52.680
Do we use archival
appraisal mechanisms,

02:19:52.680 --> 02:19:56.540
or how selective do we want to be?

02:19:56.540 --> 02:19:57.840
What's the scale?

02:19:57.840 --> 02:19:59.140
What does it look like?

02:19:59.140 --> 02:20:02.210
Who decides what gets preserved?

02:20:02.210 --> 02:20:05.130
Those aren't obvious
questions for me.

02:20:05.130 --> 02:20:07.540
You may have deeper insights.

02:20:07.540 --> 02:20:09.840
How do we get at the Deep Web?

02:20:09.840 --> 02:20:14.230
And our first speaker talked
about some of those issues.

02:20:14.230 --> 02:20:15.610
What are we missing?

02:20:15.610 --> 02:20:18.780
What technologies do we
need to develop further?

02:20:18.780 --> 02:20:20.440
Do people have the
right to be forgotten?

02:20:20.440 --> 02:20:21.740
That's a big theme.

02:20:21.740 --> 02:20:23.900
What are the ethics of remembering?

02:20:23.900 --> 02:20:26.440
How do we leverage those things?

02:20:26.440 --> 02:20:30.980
How do we actually preserve the
web as a sociotechnical system

02:20:30.980 --> 02:20:33.020 position:56%
and from a technological standpoint?

02:20:33.020 --> 02:20:34.320
What are the strategies?

02:20:34.320 --> 02:20:36.310
Are there things we
haven't thought of?

02:20:36.310 --> 02:20:38.180
Who are we preserving the web for,

02:20:38.180 --> 02:20:41.490
so the chair of the
panel talked about, well,

02:20:41.490 --> 02:20:43.100
we don't know who the
future users are.

02:20:43.100 --> 02:20:46.870
So, one of my former colleagues
actually defines preservation

02:20:46.870 --> 02:20:50.040
as this sort of act of faith,
this time travel machine

02:20:50.040 --> 02:20:54.210
where you're communicating
with unborn historians,

02:20:54.210 --> 02:20:59.390
and future citizens, and you
have no idea how to get there.

02:20:59.390 --> 02:21:01.790
All you know is the present.

02:21:01.790 --> 02:21:04.410
And sort of you're
navigating and you're trying

02:21:04.410 --> 02:21:09.970
to move forward the very, sort
of it's the shadows on the cave.

02:21:09.970 --> 02:21:13.440
You're seeing shadows
and you're trying

02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:18.350
to device what this glorious future
might look like and you're impeded

02:21:18.350 --> 02:21:20.540
by all the limitations
of the moment.

02:21:20.540 --> 02:21:25.350 position:56%
So, one of the themes I've
actually gotten funding for and look

02:21:25.350 --> 02:21:29.050
at is this notion of what does
software independent mean?

02:21:29.050 --> 02:21:30.350
How do you characterize that

02:21:30.350 --> 02:21:33.370 position:56%
and how do you create
virtualization logical environments.

02:21:33.370 --> 02:21:35.370
So, a few more questions
and we're done?

02:21:35.370 --> 02:21:37.400
How do we leverage
the preserved web?

02:21:37.400 --> 02:21:39.880
So, what do we do with that?

02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:42.190
What kinds of analytics
are we going to look at?

02:21:42.190 --> 02:21:43.490
What can we do right now?

02:21:43.490 --> 02:21:45.040
What could we do in the future?

02:21:45.040 --> 02:21:47.120
Who will be paying for this?

02:21:47.120 --> 02:21:49.960
So, you heard several
comments on this.

02:21:49.960 --> 02:21:51.260
What's the business model.

02:21:51.260 --> 02:21:55.590
And then a more technological
theme that comes out of some

02:21:55.590 --> 02:21:59.830
of the slides I shared with you
is how do we move toward building

02:21:59.830 --> 02:22:02.000
systems of trust?

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:07.850
So, trustworthy complex highly
scalable distributive systems.

02:22:07.850 --> 02:22:09.320
And what are all the
implications there?

02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:13.370
So, there's a slew of
issues, and I've been working

02:22:13.370 --> 02:22:16.150
in this field for over 15 years.

02:22:16.150 --> 02:22:19.740
I would venture to say, this
is a contentious statement,

02:22:19.740 --> 02:22:22.850
that we've made some progress,
but that we really don't know how

02:22:22.850 --> 02:22:24.840
to solve most of these issues,

02:22:24.840 --> 02:22:27.690
so this is still a research
questions, and it's wide open.

02:22:27.690 --> 02:22:33.080 position:56%
And it's why it's so exciting and
it's why we need to develop networks

02:22:33.080 --> 02:22:36.910
and communities to continue
to tackle all these problems.

02:22:36.910 --> 02:22:38.710
Thank you.

02:22:38.710 --> 02:22:42.130
[ Applause ]

02:22:42.130 --> 02:22:45.120
&gt;&gt; RICHARD PRICE: Just to introduce
Contemporary British Collections

02:22:45.120 --> 02:22:50.740
which is essentially the
British Library sound archive,

02:22:50.740 --> 02:22:55.610
contemporary manuscripts from
1950 onwards, and published works

02:22:55.610 --> 02:23:02.490 position:56%
from about 2000 on and by published,
we included the UK Web Archive,

02:23:02.490 --> 02:23:06.820
and we include the
newspaper collections.

02:23:06.820 --> 02:23:14.190 position:56%
What I thought I would do is not
tell you too much about the library,

02:23:14.190 --> 02:23:18.870
but take this opportunity to
think hopefully philosophically,

02:23:18.870 --> 02:23:22.210
hopefully not ponderously
a little bit

02:23:22.210 --> 02:23:26.760
about the advocacy of preservation.

02:23:26.760 --> 02:23:31.460
And the question I posed myself
was why are we still talking

02:23:31.460 --> 02:23:32.850
about advocacy.

02:23:32.850 --> 02:23:39.740
Why is that after in one way
so long, years and years,

02:23:39.740 --> 02:23:45.060
in terms of published
output not very long.

02:23:45.060 --> 02:23:50.440
Then Wendy's complete right it's
actually just a blink in some ways.

02:23:50.440 --> 02:23:53.720
And to characterize that from a
national library point of view,

02:23:53.720 --> 02:24:02.540
legal deposit as a French invention
in modern times, 16th century

02:24:02.540 --> 02:24:13.150
and it comes into England
with effect in legal terms

02:24:13.150 --> 02:24:16.400
from the 17th century,
but really enforced

02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:20.040
by Antonio Panizzi the Librarian

02:24:20.040 --> 02:24:22.670
of the British Museum
Library in the 19th century.

02:24:22.670 --> 02:24:27.310
So, we're talking about centuries
of, in theory, legal deposit,

02:24:27.310 --> 02:24:31.090
which is to bring every
copy in the land into one

02:24:31.090 --> 02:24:33.730
or multiple places really.

02:24:33.730 --> 02:24:39.150
The idea of positive implication
is very important to legal deposit

02:24:39.150 --> 02:24:46.230 position:56%
in the same way it is very important
to having modes of digit content.

02:24:46.230 --> 02:24:51.170
So, I'm briefly going to call this
talk, goes without saying' it's

02:24:51.170 --> 02:24:54.260 position:56%
about advocacy, goes without saying.

02:24:54.260 --> 02:24:57.380
And so, I'm turning that phrase
on its head because there's

02:24:57.380 --> 02:25:03.260 position:56%
so much implicit in what we say that
we believe in the web and we want

02:25:03.260 --> 02:25:05.260
to preserve it, that
goes without saying,

02:25:05.260 --> 02:25:08.770
but if you don't say
it, it's going to go.

02:25:08.770 --> 02:25:17.390
There has to be an advocacy element
is actually really complicated.

02:25:17.390 --> 02:25:23.330
And you come across mixed messages
that you have to tell to deal

02:25:23.330 --> 02:25:27.790
with expectation, anxiety,
fear, idealism.

02:25:27.790 --> 02:25:32.730
They're not all the same story
that we tell, or that users

02:25:32.730 --> 02:25:36.570
and potential influencers can here.

02:25:36.570 --> 02:25:43.390 position:56%
So, for any category of collecting,
it's good practice to pause a little

02:25:43.390 --> 02:25:45.570
and think why you're doing it.

02:25:45.570 --> 02:25:51.590
Why you're spending this money,
and but for new technology,

02:25:51.590 --> 02:25:52.920
it's particularly important

02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:58.060
because you can make
future proof less decisions

02:25:58.060 --> 02:26:00.910
that can be very expensive.

02:26:00.910 --> 02:26:03.480
Thinking about why
we need to advocate

02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:06.200
for preservation also
immediately gets you

02:26:06.200 --> 02:26:12.440
into the kind of nexus
of complexity.

02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:16.220
The web is certainly a layered
network, a kind of ecosystem.

02:26:16.220 --> 02:26:20.740
And the way you cut it culturally,
it's an intellectual artistic,

02:26:20.740 --> 02:26:22.670
social, political, economic system.

02:26:22.670 --> 02:26:24.830
And that's before you
even get to the complexity

02:26:24.830 --> 02:26:29.000
of the technical detail, which
is not detail in the sense

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:30.780
of something you can brush off.

02:26:30.780 --> 02:26:33.860
It's absolutely fundamental
to the preservation challenge.

02:26:33.860 --> 02:26:37.640
Within each of those
cultural challenges,

02:26:37.640 --> 02:26:42.060
there's a different
kind of advocacy piece.

02:26:42.060 --> 02:26:44.290
We've talked about
general elections.

02:26:44.290 --> 02:26:47.060
And that was a selection priority.

02:26:47.060 --> 02:26:51.500
We also collect the general
elections in our country.

02:26:51.500 --> 02:26:55.160
But that's, already you
have made a decision

02:26:55.160 --> 02:27:02.610 position:56%
to prioritize essentially the way an
established political system works.

02:27:02.610 --> 02:27:07.220
So, you haven't been collecting
in the same detail other kinds

02:27:07.220 --> 02:27:11.400
of ideas, political ideas which
don't reach the mainstream.

02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:18.290
So, it's very, very difficult
not to prioritize by accident,

02:27:18.290 --> 02:27:22.160 position:56%
or by things that go without saying.

02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:26.350
It's important we keep on
interrogating our own assumptions.

02:27:26.350 --> 02:27:30.970
I also want to share some of the
National Library difficulties

02:27:30.970 --> 02:27:34.350
and pay tribute to
The Internet Archive

02:27:34.350 --> 02:27:40.310
for actually beating the digital
library so quickly off the ground.

02:27:40.310 --> 02:27:46.350
National libraries can seem,
and are in many ways slow.

02:27:46.350 --> 02:27:53.310
And there are good reasons for
that and I wanted to explain some

02:27:53.310 --> 02:27:55.290
of those I terms of advocacy.

02:27:55.290 --> 02:28:02.920
It's not just that we're trying to
win over external and stakeholders

02:28:02.920 --> 02:28:05.270
and people that are going
to fund us and support us.

02:28:05.270 --> 02:28:11.100
We're also having internal debates
about the importance of digital

02:28:11.100 --> 02:28:14.350
and how we can fund this.

02:28:14.350 --> 02:28:17.920
One of the fantastic
myths, of course,

02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:21.800 position:56%
about digital is it's somehow free,
it's somehow free and we internalize

02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:23.800
that even as information
professionals.

02:28:23.800 --> 02:28:25.100
We internalize that.

02:28:25.100 --> 02:28:29.980
And the actual fact, it's
very expensive to build

02:28:29.980 --> 02:28:33.760
that infrastructure and
to bring those curators

02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:36.550
and those technical people in.

02:28:36.550 --> 02:28:37.850
And guess what?

02:28:37.850 --> 02:28:46.000
Our budgets are not booming to
accommodate this thirsty, thirsty,

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.920
rightly thirsty wish
to take in more.

02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:53.890
It's actually much
more tricky than that.

02:28:53.890 --> 02:29:00.490
I think there's also, in bold terms
there's also a kind of competition.

02:29:00.490 --> 02:29:03.740
I mean we're friends within
the library, but there's a kind

02:29:03.740 --> 02:29:07.250
of competition between
the old kind of heritage,

02:29:07.250 --> 02:29:09.910
some of which is actually
in my collection as well.

02:29:09.910 --> 02:29:13.520 position:56%
I'm talking about ordinary books
and ordinary magazines and journals.

02:29:13.520 --> 02:29:18.120
And the new kind of what we think
of as heritage, but is not a given.

02:29:18.120 --> 02:29:20.580
It doesn't go without saying.

02:29:20.580 --> 02:29:27.350 position:56%
There is a case for making our work,
heritage, a kind of new heritage.

02:29:27.350 --> 02:29:30.980
And that's quite a
complicated argument.

02:29:30.980 --> 02:29:35.760
We can say it's like the
heritage we're so glad we got.

02:29:35.760 --> 02:29:37.760
It's just the same, sort of thing.

02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:40.370
And in some cases,
that's sort of true.

02:29:40.370 --> 02:29:43.420
So, newspapers which only
appear online are a bit

02:29:43.420 --> 02:29:46.480
like the newspapers that we've got.

02:29:46.480 --> 02:29:51.530 position:56%
So, the Bernie Collection is a Civil
War, English Civil War collection.

02:29:51.530 --> 02:29:52.830
Great, we've got those.

02:29:52.830 --> 02:29:57.740
And now we can collect news
about Brexit E referendum,

02:29:57.740 --> 02:30:00.190
not saying that's an
English Civil War.

02:30:00.190 --> 02:30:01.660
Maybe it is.

02:30:01.660 --> 02:30:02.960
Maybe it is.

02:30:02.960 --> 02:30:05.790
So, we can do those
kind of equivalent.

02:30:05.790 --> 02:30:08.800
And that's quite a
good way of advocating.

02:30:08.800 --> 02:30:11.140
We can also say to our
heritage colleagues,

02:30:11.140 --> 02:30:13.210
you know that stuff you're a
bit embarrassed about getting

02:30:13.210 --> 02:30:17.890
and you've not done anything
with, it's sort of un-cataloged,

02:30:17.890 --> 02:30:21.820
we've got the same
sort of equivalent.

02:30:21.820 --> 02:30:25.860
Those kind of flyers, those posters

02:30:25.860 --> 02:30:29.150 position:56%
that you've never really had the
resource to catalog, we've got those

02:30:29.150 --> 02:30:32.540
and we're going to catalog them
in a completely different way

02:30:32.540 --> 02:30:37.580
because we have the data.

02:30:37.580 --> 02:30:43.600
Well, the advocacy piece
needs public access.

02:30:43.600 --> 02:30:46.150
Public access is the best advocate.

02:30:46.150 --> 02:30:49.200
And because of our legal
deposit commitment,

02:30:49.200 --> 02:30:51.800
although we have a whole lot of
stuff now in British Library,

02:30:51.800 --> 02:30:55.180
it's very difficult
for us to share that.

02:30:55.180 --> 02:30:59.860
And even when you get
into the reading room,

02:30:59.860 --> 02:31:02.800 position:56%
the render can be surprisingly poor,

02:31:02.800 --> 02:31:06.650
and that's because web
archiving is like that.

02:31:06.650 --> 02:31:13.550
You're not getting a look and
feel translation all the time.

02:31:13.550 --> 02:31:17.860
But I've got tentative solutions

02:31:17.860 --> 02:31:20.540
and there are really
sort of two or three.

02:31:20.540 --> 02:31:23.810
One is for us to occupy
the old spaces.

02:31:23.810 --> 02:31:28.460
And by that, I mean meet
each other, you know,

02:31:28.460 --> 02:31:30.120
meet each other just like this.

02:31:30.120 --> 02:31:35.480
It's really, really important
that we behave non-virtually.

02:31:35.480 --> 02:31:40.510
And lastly.

02:31:40.510 --> 02:31:47.160
[ Laugther ]

02:31:47.160 --> 02:31:50.000
Of course, occupy the new spaces.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:53.450
I have lots of other kind of
subheadings for these things

02:31:53.450 --> 02:31:57.630
and maybe I can squeeze them I a
little bit later in the discussion.

02:31:57.630 --> 02:32:00.970
So, occupy the old spaces,
don't neglect those.

02:32:00.970 --> 02:32:08.390
Have websites on exhibition
alongside physical objects.

02:32:08.390 --> 02:32:09.730
Don't forget about that.

02:32:09.730 --> 02:32:13.150
It sends fantastic and
really strong messages

02:32:13.150 --> 02:32:17.510
about the peril on each of them.

02:32:17.510 --> 02:32:19.610
Last thing, be poetic.

02:32:19.610 --> 02:32:23.090
Poetry-like time traveling
with the web archive,

02:32:23.090 --> 02:32:26.120 position:56%
that's an incredibly strong message.

02:32:26.120 --> 02:32:31.400
It's much, much stronger
than more water-tight theory

02:32:31.400 --> 02:32:36.570
and mathematical understanding
for a general population.

02:32:36.570 --> 02:32:41.510
So, be poetic [laughter].

note to end on.

you've been reorganized.

02:33:08.490 --> 02:33:09.790

well thank you Abigail.

So, if you can spell it.

02:33:21.200 --> 02:33:23.800
So, welcome everybody,
we're thrilled to have you

02:33:23.800 --> 02:33:26.510
in our home turf today,
we don't often get

02:33:26.510 --> 02:33:29.220
to host web archiving events
since I've been doing this.

02:33:29.220 --> 02:33:31.760
I've been involved with
the web archiving program

02:33:31.760 --> 02:33:35.270
since 2002 I think along with my
colleague Gina Jones, over here.

02:33:35.270 --> 02:33:38.050
David talked a little
bit about the program,

02:33:38.050 --> 02:33:41.000
but 'll give you a little bit
more of our history and how we got

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.330
to where we are and the
things that still keep us

02:33:43.330 --> 02:33:46.010 position:56%
up at night, because there are many.

02:33:46.010 --> 02:33:48.640
We started in 2000
as a pilot program

02:33:48.640 --> 02:33:51.280
to explore collecting web content.

02:33:51.280 --> 02:33:55.000
There was an interdisciplinary
team including some folks

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:58.690
that are actually in this room,
I think Jane was on that team.

02:33:58.690 --> 02:34:02.260
Looking at issues around technical
approaches, cataloging of data,

02:34:02.260 --> 02:34:06.740
selection of content and of course
the ever-present legal issues.

02:34:06.740 --> 02:34:10.620
We started with our election
archives as many organizations

02:34:10.620 --> 02:34:15.340
who do this work do, the election
2000 and we were happily starting

02:34:15.340 --> 02:34:19.250
to plan the election 2002
archive as another pilot

02:34:19.250 --> 02:34:21.940
with some collaborations
with the internet archive,

02:34:21.940 --> 02:34:26.160
in those early days as well,
when September 11th happened.

02:34:26.160 --> 02:34:31.470
And we quickly realized that this
was something real and we had

02:34:31.470 --> 02:34:34.550
to make it not a pilot anymore.

02:34:34.550 --> 02:34:37.710
So, we went quickly into
production without really sorting

02:34:37.710 --> 02:34:39.430
out what that actually meant.

02:34:39.430 --> 02:34:43.780
And I can safely say that all these
years later we're still grappling

02:34:43.780 --> 02:34:45.080
with all these same issues.

02:34:45.080 --> 02:34:48.350
We haven't really solved
all of the concerns

02:34:48.350 --> 02:34:50.810
that were even brought
up in those early days.

02:34:50.810 --> 02:34:56.970
So, our approach here is a curated,
selective collecting activity.

02:34:56.970 --> 02:35:02.000
We select content in various
events and themes to archive.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:06.790
We do not have the luxury of an
easily defined US domain to crawl

02:35:06.790 --> 02:35:09.600
like our colleagues
in the UK, or Iceland.

02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:12.430
We're very envious of Iceland.

02:35:12.430 --> 02:35:16.250
So, we also have a
lack of copyright laws

02:35:16.250 --> 02:35:18.690
that really support
the activity so we,

02:35:18.690 --> 02:35:21.290
and no legal mandate
to do this work.

02:35:21.290 --> 02:35:27.530
So, we actually, we have a pretty
intensive and labor intensive

02:35:27.530 --> 02:35:31.030 position:56%
and complicated permissions
process that I don't have time to go

02:35:31.030 --> 02:35:34.260
into today, but I can spend
hours talking about it.

02:35:34.260 --> 02:35:37.220
We're very good friends with
the lawyers in the library.

02:35:37.220 --> 02:35:41.760 position:56%
The program is, we have a very
small core team that works full time

02:35:41.760 --> 02:35:44.840
on the activity, but there are
people scattered around the library

02:35:44.840 --> 02:35:48.890
that work on this and it's kind of
reflective of the collaborations

02:35:48.890 --> 02:35:52.540
that we've all undertaken
with other institutions,

02:35:52.540 --> 02:35:54.110
which his so critical to this work.

02:35:54.110 --> 02:35:58.640
We really can't do it alone
and we need all sorts of people

02:35:58.640 --> 02:36:02.070
and it's reflective in the research
projects that happen this week

02:36:02.070 --> 02:36:05.310
that you need selectors
selecting the content,

02:36:05.310 --> 02:36:06.640
you need technical experts.

02:36:06.640 --> 02:36:09.210
You need the lawyers to tell
you how to do this work.

02:36:09.210 --> 02:36:11.120
You need developers that
are supporting other

02:36:11.120 --> 02:36:13.070
infrastructure aspects.

02:36:13.070 --> 02:36:17.060
You need the storage experts that
can help manage all this data.

02:36:17.060 --> 02:36:20.740 position:56%
So, we really couldn't do it without
these different types of people.

02:36:20.740 --> 02:36:23.840
And as Jefferson talked about
we collaborate quite a bit

02:36:23.840 --> 02:36:27.450 position:56%
with the broader community, like the
International Internet Preservation

02:36:27.450 --> 02:36:29.590
Consortium, we were
a founding member

02:36:29.590 --> 02:36:32.190
with the Internet Archive
in that organization.

02:36:32.190 --> 02:36:35.040
And things like the end of term
government web archive and working

02:36:35.040 --> 02:36:38.680
with some of our federal colleagues
who are here in the room on issues

02:36:38.680 --> 02:36:41.910
around collecting the
Federal Government Domain.

02:36:41.910 --> 02:36:46.820
So, again the permissions process I
won't go into hugely but we do have

02:36:46.820 --> 02:36:50.160
to notify almost every
site that we crawl.

02:36:50.160 --> 02:36:54.140
So, we have built tools around this
to help process all of these things

02:36:54.140 --> 02:36:58.250
and send out permission
letters, and we get responses.

02:36:58.250 --> 02:37:03.030 position:56%
Mostly people like what we do, but
we do have a lack of response issue,

02:37:03.030 --> 02:37:05.950
which I think is reflective
in other archives as well.

02:37:05.950 --> 02:37:09.770
Most people don't say no they
just don't ever respond to us.

02:37:09.770 --> 02:37:14.710
So, we do, that creates unbalanced
collections when you are trying to,

02:37:14.710 --> 02:37:18.520
when there are types of sites
that you must ask permission for

02:37:18.520 --> 02:37:20.300
and then they don't respond.

02:37:20.300 --> 02:37:24.030
So, there are gaps in the
collection because of that.

02:37:24.030 --> 02:37:26.690
Luckily the permissions
policies have evolved over time

02:37:26.690 --> 02:37:30.170
and they keep evolving, and are
becoming a little bit more lenient

02:37:30.170 --> 02:37:32.580 position:56%
so we can do more, but we still have

02:37:32.580 --> 02:37:35.950
to notify everybody,
which is a lot of work.

02:37:35.950 --> 02:37:41.140
So, we have Internet Archive does
most of our crawling under contract

02:37:41.140 --> 02:37:42.440
for the Library of Congress.

02:37:42.440 --> 02:37:46.350 position:56%
We don't really have the technical
infrastructure here to do that work.

02:37:46.350 --> 02:37:50.660
But we do do some in-house crawling
using the same open source tools

02:37:50.660 --> 02:37:52.520
that they are using.

02:37:52.520 --> 02:37:55.690
We schedule our crawls under a
variety of frequencies depending

02:37:55.690 --> 02:37:59.180
on topics and managing all
of that and trying to sort

02:37:59.180 --> 02:38:02.700
through all the content that we're
trying to schedule, and crawl

02:38:02.700 --> 02:38:05.500
and make sure we have is complex.

02:38:05.500 --> 02:38:08.730
I'll talk a little bit alter about
some of the crawling strategies

02:38:08.730 --> 02:38:11.940
that we've employed in recent
years to try to capture some

02:38:11.940 --> 02:38:15.090 position:56%
of that frequently changing content.

02:38:15.090 --> 02:38:17.990
Our search is pretty
basic at this point.

02:38:17.990 --> 02:38:22.990
My one visual here is our public
access website, which allows you

02:38:22.990 --> 02:38:25.990
to search some meta data records,

02:38:25.990 --> 02:38:29.040
that take you to our instance
of the Wayback Machine.

02:38:29.040 --> 02:38:32.340
We are very excited about
the use of our data this week

02:38:32.340 --> 02:38:36.330
and the possibilities
that we can now see

02:38:36.330 --> 02:38:38.290
for using our data in other ways.

02:38:38.290 --> 02:38:42.040
So, we look forward to the
future, working with researchers.

02:38:42.040 --> 02:38:44.900
Some statistics about our archives,

02:38:44.900 --> 02:38:49.390
we have about 90 total
web archive collections,

02:38:49.390 --> 02:38:52.410
in a variety of themes
that we're managing.

02:38:52.410 --> 02:38:55.970
Again, government sites,
law content.

02:38:55.970 --> 02:38:59.150
We have things like,
obviously, our US elections,

02:38:59.150 --> 02:39:02.320
don't worry we're getting
all those campaign sites.

02:39:02.320 --> 02:39:04.420
We do things like collecting
web comics.

02:39:04.420 --> 02:39:08.310 position:56%
Some of our curators here in the
room who have selected that content.

02:39:08.310 --> 02:39:11.630
So, we're trying to get a broad
view, but it really is those people

02:39:11.630 --> 02:39:15.400 position:56%
in the library that are interested
in web archives, who kind of get it.

02:39:15.400 --> 02:39:17.620
So, there are gaps
in the collection.

02:39:17.620 --> 02:39:22.260 position:56%
We don't cover all subjects that the
library collects in other materials.

02:39:22.260 --> 02:39:27.490
We have 22 websites available
through our public access website.

02:39:27.490 --> 02:39:29.870
So, that's about 1/3
of our collections,

02:39:29.870 --> 02:39:31.300
which we're hoping to improve.

02:39:31.300 --> 02:39:34.580
We seem to get ahead in some areas
and then fall behind in others.

02:39:34.580 --> 02:39:37.490
It's one of the things
that keeps us up at night.

02:39:37.490 --> 02:39:41.150
We have about 25 active collections
that we're managing right now.

02:39:41.150 --> 02:39:42.560
Mostly ongoing crawls.

02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:44.940
So, we're getting sort of, in
the early days we had a lot

02:39:44.940 --> 02:39:47.860
of collections that started and
stopped and now we have things

02:39:47.860 --> 02:39:51.250
that go on, and on, and on sort
of with these long-term things,

02:39:51.250 --> 02:39:52.950
rather than time-bounded.

02:39:52.950 --> 02:39:56.650
We're bringing in about 15 to 20
terabytes per month these days.

02:39:56.650 --> 02:39:59.570
And I like to, I have
charts that are similar

02:39:59.570 --> 02:40:02.040
to Jefferson's showing
the amount of data.

02:40:02.040 --> 02:40:05.950
We are much smaller scale we
have about a petabyte of data

02:40:05.950 --> 02:40:09.180
of web archive content, but
really it's YouTube's fault.

02:40:09.180 --> 02:40:13.020
I mean they really ruined
everything for us in 2005.

02:40:13.020 --> 02:40:16.950
And you can see the numbers
just went crazy after that.

02:40:16.950 --> 02:40:21.220
We're expecting to get about
290 terabytes this year alone.

02:40:21.220 --> 02:40:23.520
And in the early days we
were, I don't know it was

02:40:23.520 --> 02:40:26.890
about half a terabyte
in the first year.

02:40:26.890 --> 02:40:30.840
In all of those collections we
manage about 6000 seed URLs.

02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:32.760
At, again varying frequencies.

02:40:32.760 --> 02:40:38.110
So, we're trying to use our tools
and our brains to manage all

02:40:38.110 --> 02:40:40.470
of them, juggle all that
collecting activity.

02:40:40.470 --> 02:40:43.540
And as one of my colleagues likes
to say, it's basically the scale

02:40:43.540 --> 02:40:46.760
of domain crawling, but
at a selective level,

02:40:46.760 --> 02:40:50.020
which is very complex to manage,
particularly when you're thinking

02:40:50.020 --> 02:40:53.420
about asking permission
for all of those sites.

02:40:53.420 --> 02:40:58.480
And we are very lucky here,
the management of the Library

02:40:58.480 --> 02:40:59.960
of Congress is very supportive

02:40:59.960 --> 02:41:03.560
and there's definitely
they understand the need

02:41:03.560 --> 02:41:04.860
for preservation.

02:41:04.860 --> 02:41:08.040
We have a steady budget at
this point, for crawling,

02:41:08.040 --> 02:41:10.740
it does not cover other aspects
of the workflow right now,

02:41:10.740 --> 02:41:12.910
which is one of our challenges.

02:41:12.910 --> 02:41:16.000
But we are a more formal,
established program.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:17.600
And I think we have job security.

02:41:17.600 --> 02:41:18.900
I don't think we're going away,

02:41:18.900 --> 02:41:22.630
no matter how many
reorganizations we participate in.

02:41:22.630 --> 02:41:24.420
And the great news
is I know longer have

02:41:24.420 --> 02:41:26.440
to explain what web
archiving is to many

02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:28.540 position:56%
of my colleagues across the library.

02:41:28.540 --> 02:41:32.130
In the early days, it was the first
half hour of the presentation was,

02:41:32.130 --> 02:41:34.260
here's what a web archive is.

02:41:34.260 --> 02:41:37.640
It is not downloading
to your desktop.

02:41:37.640 --> 02:41:41.940 position:56%
So, some of the bigger challenges
that we face, it really gets at some

02:41:41.940 --> 02:41:45.260
of what you've heard already
with the selective archiving.

02:41:45.260 --> 02:41:46.840
What do we actually select?

02:41:46.840 --> 02:41:49.610
We have, there's just
so much out there.

02:41:49.610 --> 02:41:51.690
And what topics do we cover?

02:41:51.690 --> 02:41:54.200
We have selection policies
that cover some

02:41:54.200 --> 02:41:58.950
of what might be the things that
we do, but there's also trying

02:41:58.950 --> 02:42:03.300
to figure out what our space is
and what, to avoid duplication

02:42:03.300 --> 02:42:06.580
with shat other libraries are
doing, particularly in the US

02:42:06.580 --> 02:42:08.760
when we have hundreds
of organizations

02:42:08.760 --> 02:42:10.670
that are collecting content.

02:42:10.670 --> 02:42:14.460
How do we know what we should
be taking responsibility for?

02:42:14.460 --> 02:42:18.720
And there's just so
much, so much data.

02:42:18.720 --> 02:42:20.020
It's so big.

02:42:20.020 --> 02:42:21.320
And we are so little.

02:42:21.320 --> 02:42:22.620
There are so few of us.

02:42:22.620 --> 02:42:26.070
So, we there's also
this desire in all

02:42:26.070 --> 02:42:30.050
of this massive data
to get everything.

02:42:30.050 --> 02:42:33.960
So, to get quality, complete
captures of websites.

02:42:33.960 --> 02:42:36.510
Think about how large
some of these sites are.

02:42:36.510 --> 02:42:40.020
Some of these government sites that
we're crawling and hoping we get

02:42:40.020 --> 02:42:42.120
that PDF that might be useful

02:42:42.120 --> 02:42:46.720 position:56%
to the Congressional Research
Service someday, or the one document

02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:48.480
that somebody might
need in the future.

02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:49.780
We can't guarantee it.

02:42:49.780 --> 02:42:51.490
We can't, we can't do it.

02:42:51.490 --> 02:42:54.880
So, trying to grapple with
those issues and make the case

02:42:54.880 --> 02:42:57.350
that what we're getting
is good enough and good.

02:42:57.350 --> 02:43:01.350
And the crawl, Jefferson's
already has talked

02:43:01.350 --> 02:43:03.150
about this a little bit
there's been advancements

02:43:03.150 --> 02:43:06.930
in how the crawler tools
are being developed.

02:43:06.930 --> 02:43:09.110
Keeping up with all of
the changes in the web.

02:43:09.110 --> 02:43:10.410
It's very difficult.

02:43:10.410 --> 02:43:11.780 position:56%
We often joke in the IAPC that we're

02:43:11.780 --> 02:43:14.210
about 10 years behind
what's happening

02:43:14.210 --> 02:43:15.910
on the web now with crawler tools.

02:43:15.910 --> 02:43:21.720 position:56%
So, little changes that Facebook can
make can just mess us up forever.

02:43:21.720 --> 02:43:24.130
So, it's a big challenge.

02:43:24.130 --> 02:43:28.810
So, let's see, jumping ahead here.

02:43:28.810 --> 02:43:31.590
So, some of the things
we're doing to tackle some

02:43:31.590 --> 02:43:37.520
of these scale problems and get
deeper crawls of some of the sites

02:43:37.520 --> 02:43:38.820
that are of interest

02:43:38.820 --> 02:43:43.070
to our recommending officers are
doing deeper quarterly crawls

02:43:43.070 --> 02:43:48.080
of some of these really large,
like state.gov that's a huge site

02:43:48.080 --> 02:43:50.180
and trying to get that
in a monthly crawl,

02:43:50.180 --> 02:43:53.400
where you're just getting a little
bit along with all the other sites

02:43:53.400 --> 02:43:56.530
that we're crawling
has been a challenge.

02:43:56.530 --> 02:44:00.080
So, we're now doing like really
deep focus crawls on that content.

02:44:00.080 --> 02:44:03.770
We're also employing some
RSS feed crawling modelled

02:44:03.770 --> 02:44:08.040
after what some folks I Iceland
are doing for some news content

02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:12.340 position:56%
that changes so rapidly that we
can't get it in a weekly crawl even.

02:44:12.340 --> 02:44:17.340
So, we're doing crawling feeds and
being able to fill out the gaps

02:44:17.340 --> 02:44:19.170
in the collection that way.

02:44:19.170 --> 02:44:21.700
So, we think that's, we've been
doing that about six months

02:44:21.700 --> 02:44:25.050
or a year maybe, and that's
been going pretty well.

02:44:25.050 --> 02:44:28.140
I have a few minutes left.

02:44:28.140 --> 02:44:32.450
Some of the other issues, again,
around the permissions policies.

02:44:32.450 --> 02:44:37.550
We keep hoping for changes and
that the site owners will respond

02:44:37.550 --> 02:44:39.610
favorably, but we can't
rely on that.

02:44:39.610 --> 02:44:43.660
So, again that unbalanced
collections is a big issue for us.

02:44:43.660 --> 02:44:49.190
And it also creates a dataset that
has a mixture of permissions in it.

02:44:49.190 --> 02:44:53.140
So, we find it difficult to share
our datasets with researchers

02:44:53.140 --> 02:44:55.120
because we have some
content that's restricted

02:44:55.120 --> 02:44:56.950 position:56%
to on-site only and some that isn't.

02:44:56.950 --> 02:45:00.340
And others that are perfectly free
to use no matter where you are.

02:45:00.340 --> 02:45:03.490
So, all of that is stored
together in one archive

02:45:03.490 --> 02:45:05.580
and how do we share that.

02:45:05.580 --> 02:45:07.240
And again, our staff is limited.

02:45:07.240 --> 02:45:11.550 position:56%
We can only do so much and our focus
is really in acquiring the data.

02:45:11.550 --> 02:45:15.730
We don't have the resources
to really work

02:45:15.730 --> 02:45:18.860
to help make our collections more
accessible which is a really,

02:45:18.860 --> 02:45:20.760
we hope to do that in the future

02:45:20.760 --> 02:45:24.410
and that we can make
progress in those areas.

02:45:24.410 --> 02:45:28.280
And we are truly inspired by all
of you here and all the people

02:45:28.280 --> 02:45:29.580 position:56%
that worked with the data this week.

02:45:29.580 --> 02:45:31.790
It's very exciting to see.

02:45:31.790 --> 02:45:35.960
So, I think I'll close there,
because I see the zero coming.

02:45:35.960 --> 02:45:38.660
And I guess move on to questions.

02:45:38.660 --> 02:45:40.460
&gt;&gt; DAVID LAZER: Thank you.

02:45:40.460 --> 02:45:47.640
[ Applause ]

02:45:47.640 --> 02:45:53.210
So is the mic circulating
for questions.

02:45:57.100 --> 02:45:59.880
In the back.

02:45:59.880 --> 02:46:03.710
And if you can just say who you
are, and that will be great.

02:46:03.710 --> 02:46:05.010
&gt;&gt; JOHN WIN: Hi.

02:46:05.010 --> 02:46:06.790
There we go.

02:46:06.790 --> 02:46:10.800
Hi. I'm John Win, I actually work
under Abbie here at the library,

02:46:10.800 --> 02:46:12.650
but I kind of had a question
for the rest of the panel.

02:46:12.650 --> 02:46:16.290
Just in terms of like the
threshold between automation

02:46:16.290 --> 02:46:19.280
and human curation of this content,

02:46:19.280 --> 02:46:22.910
just in my own experiences
knowing I've made certain mistakes,

02:46:22.910 --> 02:46:25.840 position:56%
and screwing up an entire
collection because of it [laughter],

02:46:25.840 --> 02:46:29.900
where do we really find the sort
of point where we can hand this off

02:46:29.900 --> 02:46:33.480
to an automated program, or
what are your sort of thoughts

02:46:33.480 --> 02:46:36.780
on where we can find
that point in the future?

02:46:42.120 --> 02:46:44.600
&gt;&gt; JEFFERSON BAILEY:
I guess I'll talk.

02:46:44.600 --> 02:46:45.900
That's a great question.

02:46:45.900 --> 02:46:50.490
I think there are efforts to
do, so I talked a little bit

02:46:50.490 --> 02:46:52.070
about browser automation.

02:46:52.070 --> 02:46:55.590
But browser automation will never
get to the scale of human action.

02:46:55.590 --> 02:46:59.630
There are efforts to, and I don't,
this is not really scalable,

02:46:59.630 --> 02:47:02.480 position:56%
but I do think it's a potential
approach for transactional browsing.

02:47:02.480 --> 02:47:06.230
So, if you are a person and you
can essentially flip a switch

02:47:06.230 --> 02:47:08.200
in your browser, and it will record

02:47:08.200 --> 02:47:10.790
to a preservation format
as you browse.

02:47:10.790 --> 02:47:13.110
So, you obviously need
some self-awareness

02:47:13.110 --> 02:47:15.080
about what you're browsing to
make sure that it doesn't go

02:47:15.080 --> 02:47:20.080
into the archival records, but
I think that has potential,

02:47:20.080 --> 02:47:24.010
but it obviously won't scale to
the extent to which the web grows.

02:47:24.010 --> 02:47:30.570
So, I think it's probably not an
automation human question it's more

02:47:30.570 --> 02:47:32.540
a multi-institutional question.

02:47:32.540 --> 02:47:37.550 position:56%
So, the more institutions that are
doing even small scale web archiving

02:47:37.550 --> 02:47:41.710
will contribute to this
greater pool of archival data.

02:47:41.710 --> 02:47:44.750
&gt;&gt; DAVID LAZER: Is there room for
harnessing the crowd for this?

02:47:44.750 --> 02:47:47.760 position:56%
Like getting people looking,
saying, well you know you're messing

02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:50.440
up this collection and
having like bug reports.

02:47:50.440 --> 02:47:53.940
I mean there's you know
that kind of thing?

02:47:53.940 --> 02:47:56.630
&gt;&gt; JEFFERSON BAILEY: Yeah, there
are tools sort of in the browser

02:47:56.630 --> 02:48:00.700
where you can, you know report
a bad capture, or tell it,

02:48:00.700 --> 02:48:03.630
if there are images missing
in an archival copy it can try

02:48:03.630 --> 02:48:05.490
to find whether those
URLs still exist,

02:48:05.490 --> 02:48:08.480
they could have been not captured
for various technical reasons,

02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:11.110
and then could be scoped
in during the browsing.

02:48:11.110 --> 02:48:14.000
So, there's a little automated
QA that could be done.

02:48:15.490 --> 02:48:19.060
&gt;&gt; RICHARD PRICE: I think public
intervention also builds advocacy.

02:48:19.060 --> 02:48:20.800 position:56%
So, you don't really want to get rid

02:48:20.800 --> 02:48:25.450
of public selectors, or
curatorial selectors.

02:48:25.450 --> 02:48:29.770
It's very good to have fan-based
selectors who are actually going

02:48:29.770 --> 02:48:34.900
to bring a kind of loyalty and
enthusiasm to a wider project,

02:48:34.900 --> 02:48:40.710
even though it may be niche,
the fact is that that is a very,

02:48:40.710 --> 02:48:43.930
enthusiasm is leaky
in a very good way.

02:48:43.930 --> 02:48:47.690
And it goes over to
a general populous.

02:48:47.690 --> 02:48:50.760
And so, it's very important
that some things,

02:48:50.760 --> 02:48:55.850 position:56%
although they could be fully
automatable, are still personalized.

02:48:57.460 --> 02:48:59.260
&gt;&gt; DAVID LAZER: Question
will go to the middle.

02:48:59.260 --> 02:49:03.640
Will go number two
and number three so.

02:49:03.640 --> 02:49:09.770
If we're going to archive
this [laughter].

02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:15.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; MARIA ZEMANKOVA: Maria Zemankova,
National Science Foundation.

02:49:15.350 --> 02:49:19.250
And I think it's about three
years ago when we had a workshop.

02:49:19.250 --> 02:49:24.320
Richard Marciano was really
chairing it on curation.

02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:27.710
The reason why we held it
because we wanted to find

02:49:27.710 --> 02:49:30.790
out what techniques
would be developed

02:49:30.790 --> 02:49:35.010
with what we had called
as painless curation.

02:49:35.010 --> 02:49:38.350
Because without curation,
if we store it all,

02:49:38.350 --> 02:49:40.630
I don't think it's very useful.

02:49:40.630 --> 02:49:48.590
Okay. The report has been
published at ACM Communications

02:49:48.590 --> 02:49:52.240
and I think there is a lot to
be learned from that workshop.

02:49:52.240 --> 02:49:59.410
But I think one point that we did
not quite touch upon is archiving,

02:49:59.410 --> 02:50:05.330
or evolving of the curations
across the centuries.

02:50:05.330 --> 02:50:09.250
We've been talking here about
preserving the cultural heritage

02:50:09.250 --> 02:50:11.480
and this and that, and what not.

02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:14.980
We all of us know about
the concept drifts.

02:50:14.980 --> 02:50:17.820
What about the curation drifts?

02:50:22.710 --> 02:50:24.010 position:56%
&gt;&gt; DAVID LAZER: You can pass it back

02:50:24.010 --> 02:50:27.970
and then we'll ask the next
question later, so reactions?

02:50:32.130 --> 02:50:38.440
It's just one you've got
to chew on a little bit.

02:50:38.440 --> 02:50:39.990
&gt;&gt; JEFFERSON BAILEY: I do
think there's more potential

02:50:39.990 --> 02:50:41.980 position:56%
for crowd sourcing, as we mentioned,

02:50:41.980 --> 02:50:44.520
we do a lot of spontaneous
event collections,

02:50:44.520 --> 02:50:48.690
which are community's
submitted URLs, our sites.

02:50:48.690 --> 02:50:51.670
And I do think that's much
different than the traditional,

02:50:51.670 --> 02:50:54.660
archival appraisal or
acquisition model, which is driven

02:50:54.660 --> 02:50:58.410
by an institution, or
by, university, or.

02:50:58.410 --> 02:51:04.040
So, I think the curation aspect
has drifted into the public a bit.

02:51:04.040 --> 02:51:07.840
But you do sort of have that
separation between the act

02:51:07.840 --> 02:51:10.120
of nominating something and the act

02:51:10.120 --> 02:51:12.700
of actually acquiring
it and preserving it.

02:51:12.700 --> 02:51:15.990
So, it would be interesting
to think about how the sort

02:51:15.990 --> 02:51:19.550
of curation drift could also
move into the preservation drift.

02:51:19.550 --> 02:51:23.090
&gt;&gt; RICHARD PRICE: I
suppose I like the idea

02:51:23.090 --> 02:51:28.270
of there being curation drift
across the older heritage

02:51:28.270 --> 02:51:31.720
and the newer heritage
across the disciplines.

02:51:31.720 --> 02:51:37.780 position:56%
So, social scientists, computational
people linguistic corpus people

02:51:37.780 --> 02:51:39.380
looking at 19th century.

02:51:39.380 --> 02:51:42.980
Those techniques, very
useful to contemporary.

02:51:42.980 --> 02:51:45.870
We want to have a text
and data mining community

02:51:45.870 --> 02:51:47.740
that crosses all that.

02:51:47.740 --> 02:51:52.290
And again, occupying the
old space, scholars meeting

02:51:52.290 --> 02:51:56.320
up across the divide, we librarians
are very, very important for that,

02:51:56.320 --> 02:51:59.890
particularly at this stage.

02:51:59.890 --> 02:52:03.750
&gt;&gt; DAVID LAZER: Okay, I think
I promised to, yes, thank you.

02:52:03.750 --> 02:52:05.580
And then, yes, you can be on line.

02:52:05.580 --> 02:52:08.380
I just want to make sure I'm not
neglecting the peripheries here.

02:52:08.380 --> 02:52:09.680
So.

02:52:09.680 --> 02:52:10.980
&gt;&gt; MEGAN HALSBAND: My
name's Megan Halsband.

02:52:10.980 --> 02:52:13.050
I'm a reference librarian here
at the Library of Congress

02:52:13.050 --> 02:52:15.820
and actually I work on some of
the web archiving collections.

02:52:15.820 --> 02:52:19.560 position:56%
And kind of from a, I guess
curatorial point of view going along

02:52:19.560 --> 02:52:22.970
with what everyone else has been
talking about, what are some ways

02:52:22.970 --> 02:52:26.530
that you might see that
those of us who are,

02:52:26.530 --> 02:52:31.840
you know maybe selecting content
can help more formally broaden the

02:52:31.840 --> 02:52:35.180
conversation between institutions,
and between disciplines,

02:52:35.180 --> 02:52:39.970
and between you know
professional societies?

02:52:39.970 --> 02:52:43.180
Because it seems like there's a
lot of conversation that happens

02:52:43.180 --> 02:52:46.600
on the same topics between,
you know historians,

02:52:46.600 --> 02:52:49.430
and between art historians, and
between computer scientists.

02:52:49.430 --> 02:52:52.860
But there's the cross
pollination of it and kind

02:52:52.860 --> 02:52:55.510
of that cross discussion doesn't
really seem to happen very much

02:52:55.510 --> 02:53:00.070
on a very formal platform, or
a formal way that I'm aware of.

02:53:00.070 --> 02:53:03.020
I could be very out of it though.

02:53:03.020 --> 02:53:08.360
And so, just some thoughts on what,
you know future planning might be

02:53:08.360 --> 02:53:13.760
for that so that you know to help
librarians and to help those of us

02:53:13.760 --> 02:53:16.310
who are working on these
types of collections make sure

02:53:16.310 --> 02:53:19.830
that we are making responsible
curatorial decisions.

02:53:25.460 --> 02:53:26.760
&gt;&gt; DAVID LAZER: Thoughts?

02:53:26.760 --> 02:53:28.100
I mean I think part of
what my reaction is,

02:53:28.100 --> 02:53:31.470
it's an interesting question of how
to engage the relevant communities

02:53:31.470 --> 02:53:34.270
and get them in the
room talking about this.

02:53:34.270 --> 02:53:38.040
And so, is there a space,
you know for example going

02:53:38.040 --> 02:53:39.800
to the political science
meetings and saying,

02:53:39.800 --> 02:53:45.100
what do you need archived
on campaign 2016?

02:53:45.100 --> 02:53:49.220
Right? I'd be happy to facilitate
that, but that's just more

02:53:49.220 --> 02:53:54.070
of a model of how one might engage
a community that is going to want

02:53:54.070 --> 02:53:56.750
to chew on these collections
like tomorrow.

02:53:56.750 --> 02:53:59.530
But of course, that's not
necessarily representing the unborn

02:53:59.530 --> 02:54:00.830
historians that well.

02:54:00.830 --> 02:54:02.360
So.

02:54:02.360 --> 02:54:05.130
&gt;&gt; RICHARD MARCIANO: I'd like
to believe that perhaps as part

02:54:05.130 --> 02:54:09.040
of your arsenal in moving forward,
you'll be fully weaponized,

02:54:09.040 --> 02:54:13.300
that's a terrible expression, but
that there'll be other paradigms

02:54:13.300 --> 02:54:16.520
and these are things that are being
funded, and they're being explored

02:54:16.520 --> 02:54:20.470
that are part of interdisciplinary
conversations.

02:54:20.470 --> 02:54:22.800
There are probably
not enough of them.

02:54:22.800 --> 02:54:27.450
So, this is my shameless cue to
the folks from the funding agencies

02:54:27.450 --> 02:54:30.410
to help us create these spaces

02:54:30.410 --> 02:54:33.030
where we can bring these
communities together to continue

02:54:33.030 --> 02:54:38.280
to explore these topics, such as
the meeting you mentioned several

02:54:38.280 --> 02:54:39.580
years ago.

02:54:39.580 --> 02:54:43.500
But, I don't know the
reference, sort of selector

02:54:43.500 --> 02:54:47.390
of the future will have a
dashboard and will be able to do,

02:54:47.390 --> 02:54:50.980
hopefully analytics on the fly
and you'll be able to examine some

02:54:50.980 --> 02:54:57.180
of the collections yourself
and perform elements

02:54:57.180 --> 02:55:00.130
of machine learning, and
discovery, and visualization.

02:55:00.130 --> 02:55:04.960
And make more, even more
informed decisions at scale.

02:55:04.960 --> 02:55:07.690
Looking at collections
and across collections.

02:55:07.690 --> 02:55:12.440 position:56%
And mixing, you know multimedia, and
historical records and other things.

02:55:12.440 --> 02:55:19.620 position:56%
So, there's all kinds of human
computer interface issues that build

02:55:19.620 --> 02:55:23.140
on these conversations and would
benefit from these conversations,

02:55:23.140 --> 02:55:26.800
and build on the integration
of a lot of the frameworks

02:55:26.800 --> 02:55:29.100
and technologies that
are also very siloed.

02:55:29.100 --> 02:55:32.240
That are funded through all
these different agencies

02:55:32.240 --> 02:55:34.030
and programs, etcetera.

02:55:34.030 --> 02:55:37.520
So, I'd love to see that happen and
there's some interesting examples

02:55:37.520 --> 02:55:41.820
of what that might look like in
terms of future finding aids,

02:55:41.820 --> 02:55:45.740
so futuristic finding aids,
and how to build those.

02:55:45.740 --> 02:55:51.320
And what curatorial support you
might have in moving forward.

02:55:51.320 --> 02:55:53.540
&gt;&gt; DAVID LAZER: Why don't I
collect just a few questions,

02:55:53.540 --> 02:55:55.640
because we're nearing
the end and I see that,

02:55:55.640 --> 02:55:58.200
and I hate to leave questions
unasked, but there's also

02:55:58.200 --> 02:56:01.470
that curatorial role I have.

02:56:01.470 --> 02:56:04.950
So, why don't we collect a few
questions and then people can react

02:56:04.950 --> 02:56:07.480
to whatever questions
they want to react to.

02:56:07.480 --> 02:56:08.780
Yes?

02:56:08.780 --> 02:56:10.520
&gt;&gt; MARY FRAKER: My
name is Mary Fraker

02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:15.390
and I've probably been watching too
many reruns of "Law and Order SVU"

02:56:15.390 --> 02:56:19.460
but I'm wondering what is sort
of the ethics, the philosophy,

02:56:19.460 --> 02:56:23.710
the policy, and the practice
regarding really repugnant things

02:56:23.710 --> 02:56:25.540
like child pornography.

02:56:25.540 --> 02:56:27.990
&gt;&gt; DAVID LAZER: And I think,
like I said I just want

02:56:27.990 --> 02:56:29.290
to collect a few questions.

02:56:29.290 --> 02:56:30.950
&gt;&gt; ROSEMARY SEGEROS: Yes, good
morning ladies and gentlemen,

02:56:30.950 --> 02:56:34.410
I don't know, thank you so much Mr.
David, I didn't know we were coming

02:56:34.410 --> 02:56:38.060
to the same event for
your cutesy this morning.

02:56:38.060 --> 02:56:39.360
Bless you.

02:56:39.360 --> 02:56:40.790
Thank you so much for
your presentation,

02:56:40.790 --> 02:56:43.660
my name is Rosemary
Segeros, I'm the president

02:56:43.660 --> 02:56:46.280
of an organization
called Hope for Tomorrow,

02:56:46.280 --> 02:56:48.140
and Segeros International Group.

02:56:48.140 --> 02:56:52.430
Looking at your presentations,
after the gentleman

02:56:52.430 --> 02:56:54.760
for counter terrorism spoke.

02:56:54.760 --> 02:56:58.300
I will see, I will talk
later, how do you look

02:56:58.300 --> 02:57:02.150
at engaging international people?

02:57:02.150 --> 02:57:03.450
IT people?

02:57:03.450 --> 02:57:07.060
Groups? All you are talking
goes international, the website,

02:57:07.060 --> 02:57:08.490
the election observation.

02:57:08.490 --> 02:57:12.540 position:56%
I do election observations in Africa
using my own applications I share

02:57:12.540 --> 02:57:13.840
with you.

02:57:13.840 --> 02:57:17.470
So how do we put this content
and what you are discussing

02:57:17.470 --> 02:57:22.250 position:56%
into the international level so
that we are talking internationally.

02:57:22.250 --> 02:57:25.260
Because all you are
talking is used out there,

02:57:25.260 --> 02:57:29.050
but many people don't know how,
even if they have that thing,

02:57:29.050 --> 02:57:32.030
you want to make it universal so
that what you are talking here

02:57:32.030 --> 02:57:35.750
at the Congress is talked in
Africa, is talked somewhere else

02:57:35.750 --> 02:57:37.460
so that we are on the same page,

02:57:37.460 --> 02:57:40.660
so that we don't blame each other
one day somebody did somebody,

02:57:40.660 --> 02:57:42.510
because those smart
guys are not here

02:57:42.510 --> 02:57:44.690 position:56%
who do the hacking, or do bad stuff.

02:57:44.690 --> 02:57:45.990
They're out there.

02:57:45.990 --> 02:57:47.300
So, they need to get the message

02:57:47.300 --> 02:57:49.700
and getting this knowledge
is very important.

02:57:49.700 --> 02:57:53.760
So, how do we collaborate with
you all to make sure we bring them

02:57:53.760 --> 02:57:56.880
for India and you go to
Africa for a conference

02:57:56.880 --> 02:57:58.440
like this one and talk to people.

02:57:58.440 --> 02:57:59.740
So, thank you so much.

02:57:59.740 --> 02:58:02.170
&gt;&gt; DAVID LAZER: And
any other questions

02:58:02.170 --> 02:58:03.470 position:56%
on the left that we want to collect?

02:58:03.470 --> 02:58:06.640
Anyone here want to get
a lot shot of questions?

02:58:06.640 --> 02:58:11.150
How about on the right I
think I saw, any hands there?

02:58:11.150 --> 02:58:14.550
Okay so we're left with
the ethical issues,

02:58:14.550 --> 02:58:17.900
and the sort of more global
international perspective

02:58:17.900 --> 02:58:19.280
to put it really short.

02:58:19.280 --> 02:58:20.610
So, reaction?

02:58:20.610 --> 02:58:22.450
&gt;&gt; ABBIE GROTKE: I can speak a
little bit to the global efforts.

02:58:22.450 --> 02:58:28.060
I think part of this because it's
still very new, the early group

02:58:28.060 --> 02:58:29.880
that formed around the
international community,

02:58:29.880 --> 02:58:33.820 position:56%
I mean there's a big European focus,
but there is an effort to expand

02:58:33.820 --> 02:58:37.360
that community, work globally
together on these issues.

02:58:37.360 --> 02:58:41.660
We all understand that the
web is not the US domain

02:58:41.660 --> 02:58:44.060
and the Icelandic domain
or the British domain.

02:58:44.060 --> 02:58:46.420
It's a global internet.

02:58:46.420 --> 02:58:51.030 position:56%
So even though we're all collecting
in different areas, we all are aware

02:58:51.030 --> 02:58:53.920
that our archives, and we
all struggle with trying

02:58:53.920 --> 02:58:57.810
to make this happen, to link
those archives and connect them

02:58:57.810 --> 02:58:59.170
so that researchers will know

02:58:59.170 --> 02:59:01.940
that we have all this
data gathered around.

02:59:01.940 --> 02:59:05.170
There are efforts within the
IAPC to reach other communities

02:59:05.170 --> 02:59:08.270
that we're not currently
engaging with and try

02:59:08.270 --> 02:59:10.680
to expand our membership,
or collect in areas

02:59:10.680 --> 02:59:15.150 position:56%
where archiving may not be
happening, such as the Cuban domain.

02:59:15.150 --> 02:59:18.260
So, I think it's definitely
a concern of all of ours.

02:59:18.260 --> 02:59:19.900
The Library of Congress,
also, I didn't mention,

02:59:19.900 --> 02:59:21.370
we have offices overseas.

02:59:21.370 --> 02:59:23.120
So, we have a number of
international collections.

02:59:23.120 --> 02:59:26.260
So, we are not just collecting
US content, we are collecting

02:59:26.260 --> 02:59:29.760
across the globe in areas that the
library traditionally has collected

02:59:29.760 --> 02:59:32.630
in so.

02:59:32.630 --> 02:59:35.190
&gt;&gt; RICHARD PRICE: From
and ethical point of view.

02:59:35.190 --> 02:59:40.000
Well I suppose there's also
a practical element to this.

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:43.010
Child pornography's probably on the
deep web, we probably won't be able

02:59:43.010 --> 02:59:45.490
to get it in the first
place if we do get it,

02:59:45.490 --> 02:59:47.280
it wouldn't have been actively.

02:59:47.280 --> 02:59:49.490
We certainly wouldn't
actively select that.

02:59:49.490 --> 02:59:51.360
It would come in through
a domain crawl.

02:59:51.360 --> 02:59:54.770
And because it comes in that
way, we're protected legally

02:59:54.770 --> 02:59:56.190
until we notice we've got it

02:59:56.190 --> 02:59:59.060
and then we will take
it out of public access.

02:59:59.060 --> 03:00:04.000
It would be illegal for us
to knowingly maintain it.

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:07.590
So, that's never happened
to my knowledge.

03:00:07.590 --> 03:00:11.240
I'm sure in the long, long view
that the legal deposit libraries

03:00:11.240 --> 03:00:13.920
and national libraries think
it will happen at some point,

03:00:13.920 --> 03:00:17.420 position:56%
but that's how we would approach it.

03:00:18.910 --> 03:00:22.000
&gt;&gt; RICHARD MARCIANO: I think there
are all kinds of other aspects

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:24.100
of ethics when it comes

03:00:24.100 --> 03:00:28.220
to collecting large content
and distributed content.

03:00:28.220 --> 03:00:30.100
Very much like the
credit card companies

03:00:30.100 --> 03:00:34.190
and all the social media companies
that classify our actions,

03:00:34.190 --> 03:00:38.320
identify what we do,
derive knowledge

03:00:38.320 --> 03:00:41.760
from what we browse,
what we look at.

03:00:41.760 --> 03:00:47.790
We're reaching the point where
you can take several cultural,

03:00:47.790 --> 03:00:51.300
historical archival
sources and start to find

03:00:51.300 --> 03:00:55.550
and reveal really interesting
things that may need

03:00:55.550 --> 03:01:00.360
to problematic ethical
findings in the data.

03:01:00.360 --> 03:01:05.560
So, you can reveal sort of the,
you know, the hidden information,

03:01:05.560 --> 03:01:10.520
correlate it, bring it back
together, de-identify people,

03:01:10.520 --> 03:01:14.220
places, events that were
not meant to be shared.

03:01:14.220 --> 03:01:18.700
So, this is a side effect I guess
of the technology of crawling.

03:01:18.700 --> 03:01:24.020
It may not happen in one swoop,
but it's not that hard to do.

03:01:24.020 --> 03:01:30.220
One of the collections in the
DCIC lab we were looking at,

03:01:30.220 --> 03:01:35.480
which included conversations with
former inmates and survivors was,

03:01:35.480 --> 03:01:38.660
for example was looking
at Second World War,

03:01:38.660 --> 03:01:42.090
Japanese American internment
camp data.

03:01:42.090 --> 03:01:49.910
And one of our computational
interventions was precisely

03:01:49.910 --> 03:01:55.160
to link all the people, the events.

03:01:55.160 --> 03:01:57.880
These were stazi-like accusations

03:01:57.880 --> 03:02:00.340
of alleged misdeeds while
people were prisoners.

03:02:00.340 --> 03:02:03.120
Many of them invented or imaginary.

03:02:03.120 --> 03:02:04.940
So, you start putting
these things together

03:02:04.940 --> 03:02:10.440
and you use modern analytics,
or commercial style analytics

03:02:10.440 --> 03:02:13.450
and you're rebuilding
as we saw in some

03:02:13.450 --> 03:02:20.150 position:56%
of the student hack-a-thon projects,
you're revealing social networks,

03:02:20.150 --> 03:02:23.520
and occurrences of
individuals and peoples

03:02:23.520 --> 03:02:24.820
in the context of accusations.

03:02:24.820 --> 03:02:27.540
It is very, very problematic.

03:02:27.540 --> 03:02:32.960
So, there's this whole other layer
of how you very quickly stumble

03:02:32.960 --> 03:02:38.230
into all kinds of ethical
dilemmas and implications

03:02:38.230 --> 03:02:42.290
when you're harvesting a
large distributed archives

03:02:42.290 --> 03:02:44.730
and bringing all this
information together.

03:02:44.730 --> 03:02:47.830
And I think that's a
really important theme,

03:02:47.830 --> 03:02:52.820
National Science Foundation has
a whole number of discussions

03:02:52.820 --> 03:02:54.850
on the ethics of big data

03:02:54.850 --> 03:02:57.660
and archival collections
in moving forward.

03:02:57.660 --> 03:02:58.960
&gt;&gt; DAVID LAZER: Perfect
note to end on.

03:02:58.960 --> 03:03:01.510
I want to thank our
panelist and our audience.

03:03:01.510 --> 03:03:11.930
[ Applause ]

03:03:11.930 --> 03:03:14.830
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL:
Thank you very much,

03:03:14.830 --> 03:03:17.900 position:56%
panel that was a really good debate.

03:03:17.900 --> 03:03:21.660
Vint asked to point that as he was
going that it's really important

03:03:21.660 --> 03:03:24.270 position:56%
that we're focusing a lot on
archiving what's already on the web,

03:03:24.270 --> 03:03:28.320
but we need to add more, by
adding the context, the political,

03:03:28.320 --> 03:03:32.770
the economic, the historical
context to help people

03:03:32.770 --> 03:03:35.470
in the future understand
what's going on today.

03:03:35.470 --> 03:03:38.300
Right. Now's the time for a break.

03:03:38.300 --> 03:03:39.600
Looks like it's lovely.

03:03:39.600 --> 03:03:41.210
It's not pouring with rain.

03:03:41.210 --> 03:03:42.660
This room will be locked for lunch.

03:03:42.660 --> 03:03:44.200
Please be back here for two.

03:03:44.200 --> 03:03:46.860
There are suggestions if
you don't know the area.

03:03:46.860 --> 03:03:49.370
There's some lovely little
cafes just over the road.

03:03:49.370 --> 03:03:53.570
Get some fresh air and please
be back here before two.

03:03:53.570 --> 03:03:56.550
And come back and see
us don't disappear.

03:03:59.040 --> 03:04:02.910
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
