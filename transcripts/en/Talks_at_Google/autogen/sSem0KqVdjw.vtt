00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.630
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Ladies and
gentlemen, Garfunkel herself,

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:02.874
Riki Lindhome.

00:00:02.874 --> 00:00:03.758
RIKI LINDHOME: Hello!

00:00:03.758 --> 00:00:05.472
Am I sitting here?

00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:06.680
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.120
RIKI LINDHOME: That was
clearly not from the special.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.180
That was from last season
of "Another Period."

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.910
If you haven't seen it,
it takes place in 1902.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.479
It's like a reality
show set in 1902.

00:00:18.479 --> 00:00:20.770
And that's all real stuff
it's based on all real stuff.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.480
That finger contraption is real,
from the turn of the century.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.162
Yeah, those are all
Freud techniques

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:27.120
except for the bicycle.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.974
We're like, we have to
add something to it.

00:00:28.974 --> 00:00:30.640
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
"Yes, and," of course.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.880
RIKI LINDHOME: Yes.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.932
So we had "yes, and"
it so we had the bike.

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:35.390
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Riki, you
are really a renaissance woman.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.050
You are an actress, a
comedian, a musician.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.704
You created "Another Period."

00:00:40.704 --> 00:00:42.870
You're a writer on "Another
Period," the showrunner.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.190
Now we have a new special
coming this week with--

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.960
RIKI LINDHOME: I've been busy.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.030
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Yeah.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.930
Well, thank you for making
time and coming here to Google.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.810
RIKI LINDHOME: I try to tell
my parents what I do all day.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:51.700
I'm just like, I don't know.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.130
Everything.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.380
I don't know, just everything.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.634
And they're like, what do you?

00:00:54.634 --> 00:00:55.550
It's always different.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.480
It's always, no,
no, no, I gotta go.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.660
And yeah, that's basically
their understanding of my job.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.420
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: And you were
here today without your cohort.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.420
You are here without Oates.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.220
RIKI LINDHOME: I
know, I'm so sad.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.000
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: No Kate today.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.170
RIKI LINDHOME: She's in
LA doing "Conan" today.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.580
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Oh, I know.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.776
Here we are with Cliff.

00:01:10.776 --> 00:01:14.772
So you drew the short
straw, I'm sure.

00:01:14.772 --> 00:01:15.730
So Garfunkel and Oates.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.460
Let's just start with
what people need to know.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.050
Why Garfunkel?

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.560
RIKI LINDHOME: Well, I
was at a Hall and Oates

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.130
concert at the Hollywood Bowl.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.650
And I had really bad seats.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.400
I was waitressing.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.190
I was in the back.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.610
And so basically, you could
only watch it on the monitors.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.340
And the camera had
a closeup of Darryl,

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.246
that he had a wind
machine kind of situation.

00:01:37.246 --> 00:01:38.370
It was a closeup of Darryl.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.100
And then it was like
Oates and the band.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.800
So Oates was only
in the wide shot

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.550
or like the moving
right past him.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.830
And there was no two shot.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.900
It was just Darryl,
and then everyone else.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.470
And for some reason,
that just made me laugh.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.803
And I was like, who set that up?

00:01:49.803 --> 00:01:51.330
Like how does it
feel to be Oates?

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.210
And then we went from there.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.280
But we didn't realize--
about two years ago,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.390
someone sent us this
"Simpsons" thing where

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.030
they had almost the same joke.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.310
We were like [GROANS].

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.094
They had something called--
it was like Nash, Oates

00:02:04.094 --> 00:02:05.260
and Garfunkel, or something.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.320
But it was close enough.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.490
We were like, well, OK.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.260
Oh well, too late now.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.610
That's our name.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.660
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: So, of
course, Kate is Oates.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.680
You are Garfunkel.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.550
How did you guys get together?

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.940
RIKI LINDHOME: We were both
auditioning for commercials.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.120
And neither of us were working
because it was all like Maxim

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.540
girls, like that Doritos girl.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.050
If you guys remember, it
was all that kind of look.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.540
And then all of a sudden, they
just started casting girls

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.449
with big eyes.

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:32.990
And so she and I
just got called back

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.351
for everything out of nowhere.

00:02:35.351 --> 00:02:36.850
I auditioned for a
couple years, got

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.840
dropped by my commercial
agent, never booked anything.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.932
And then out of nowhere,
like Kate and I were just

00:02:40.932 --> 00:02:41.890
in all the commercials.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.200
We were like, what is happening?

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.610
It didn't last that
long, but we just

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.150
kept seeing each
other at callbacks.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.170
And then she came up and
introduced herself to me

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.500
at UCB, and then
it went from there.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.800
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: And how did
the musician line get into it?

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.120
How do you pick up--

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.730
RIKI LINDHOME: We just became
like these weird soul mate

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.440
friends.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.360
I don't even know
how to explain it.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.147
Like Kate's boyfriend, who
was with her when we met,

00:03:04.147 --> 00:03:06.730
on the way home, he's like you
like her more than you like me.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.660
And Kate says she
remembers going like, yeah.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.490
So yeah.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.300
And then we found out that
we both wrote comedy songs

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.924
on our own.

00:03:14.924 --> 00:03:17.090
I used to play them in
college, and Kate was playing

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.584
these comedy songs around town.

00:03:18.584 --> 00:03:19.750
And I would play at parties.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.770
Like we'd been doing it on our
own in an unofficial capacity

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.320
for like 10 years.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.120
And so then we're just like,
oh, let's just do this together.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.098
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: When was
your first gig together?

00:03:30.098 --> 00:03:31.390
RIKI LINDHOME: Gosh.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.090
I think it's been
eight years, maybe.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.960
It's been a long time, yeah.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.940
Yeah, I think it was 2008.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.220
We made this short that Kate
was my imaginary friend,

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.910
and it was a musical, and
we wrote the songs for it,

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.084
and just made it.

00:03:43.084 --> 00:03:44.250
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Very cool.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.353
RIKI LINDHOME: And
some sun, yeah.

00:03:45.353 --> 00:03:46.352
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Great.

00:03:46.352 --> 00:03:48.270
What is your song process like?

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.702
I know, the old creative
process question.

00:03:50.702 --> 00:03:52.160
RIKI LINDHOME:
Well, basically it's

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.742
evolved because we've found
out what we're good at

00:03:55.742 --> 00:03:56.450
and how to do it.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.290
So basically,
we'll have a topic,

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.040
and then we just
brainstorm on it forever.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.400
And this is only the
songs that make it.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.340
The songs that don't,
I don't even know.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.756
We just throw them
in the garbage.

00:04:04.756 --> 00:04:06.320
But basically, we
brainstorm forever.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.360
We'll have like a 20
page document of anything

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.180
we've ever thought
about this topic.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.390
And then she gives it to me,
and I narrow it down and come up

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.996
with a title.

00:04:14.996 --> 00:04:16.829
And then after I have
the title, I go and do

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.690
a first pass of the
lyrics give it to Kate,

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.450
she does the first
pass of the melody.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.187
And then we get together
and make it together.

00:04:25.187 --> 00:04:26.770
But she just has
these catchy melodies

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.702
that are always in her head.

00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:30.452
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: So
do you guys have ever

00:04:30.452 --> 00:04:33.190
go on like a specific bit of
like you want to hit a joke,

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.630
and then a song
comes around that?

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.430
Or is it--

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.556
RIKI LINDHOME: Sometimes,
we'll get a title.

00:04:39.556 --> 00:04:42.180
If there's not enough to sustain
a joke for like three minutes,

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.330
then we don't do it.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.970
Because some things are
good as one line, but then

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.710
what do you say after that?

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.210
Its just like I've
got nothing left.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.580
So most things end
up in the garbage

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.997
because we can't blow
them out to a whole song.

00:04:54.997 --> 00:04:57.330
RIKI LINDHOME: Now this leads
to the very first special,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.750
"Trying To Be Special."

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.570
And of course, spoiler
alert, I have seen it

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.190
so I'll try and keep it close.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.769
But the special is about
trying to make a special.

00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:07.810
RIKI LINDHOME: Yes it is.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:08.880
It's very meta.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.450
It's basically Kate and
I are in a hotel room

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.860
and we had this gig that
you think went really badly.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.330
And we're just like this
sucks We're so tired.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.870
And I'm like, do you think we
should do something different?

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:21.870
She's like I don't know.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.690
And I'm like, well,
we're 36 years old.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.910
We have no husbands,
no real jobs, no kids.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.580
Our lives are amusing.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.830
And she's like, yeah, totally.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.204
Like the only
thing that can make

00:05:33.204 --> 00:05:34.720
it better is a comedy special.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.230
And so we're like, oh,
we don't have the money

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.271
to make a comedy special.

00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:39.820
So we do a fundraiser
concert in order

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.760
to make money to be able
to put on the special.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.701
And then you see the
fundraiser concert.

00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:47.950
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: And this
comes out this coming week,

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:48.850
on Cinco de Mayo--

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:49.960
RIKI LINDHOME:
Cinco de Mayo, yes.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:50.580
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: --May 5th.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.945
It's available on Vimeo.

00:05:51.945 --> 00:05:53.070
RIKI LINDHOME: Vimeo, Yeah.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.110
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: So
going the digital route?

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.526
RIKI LINDHOME: Yeah, we decided
to do something different.

00:05:57.526 --> 00:05:59.349
Because Vimeo, they
have the best player.

00:05:59.349 --> 00:05:59.890
They just do.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.870
Like businesses use it,
they're the best player.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.620
And you can just download it
and have it on your computer

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.120
forever.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.200
And they don't give notes.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.740
You have full, 100%
creative control.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.940
So we were like that feels-- and
the same budget as everywhere

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:14.440
else.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.450
So we're like oh, no notes
and yeah, let's do that.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.810
So that's what we
decided to go with.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.560
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: One
thing in the special

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.590
that we were talking
about prior is just

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.380
the quirkiness of
your guys' characters.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.110
And it makes everything seem
so just spur of the moment.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.060
RIKI LINDHOME: Right.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.506
Some of it is, some of it is.

00:06:35.506 --> 00:06:36.880
When we go on
tour, we don't know

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.879
what we're going to talk
about when we walk out.

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:41.250
Unless something really
weird happened right before.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.300
Then we're like, OK, we're
going to talk about that.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.550
But usually, we just
walk out and like begin,

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.980
and sometimes it goes
better than other times.

00:06:48.512 --> 00:06:49.970
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
You actually said

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.130
that you and Kate had--
she introduced herself

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.780
at UCB, so improv background?

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.550
RIKI LINDHOME: No.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.460
No, we were there
seeing a friend's show.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.400
We were seeing a
Doug Benson show.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.060
And we were both
friends with him.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.700
I made friends with
them on Friendster.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:02.970
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Oh wow.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.095
RIKI LINDHOME: That's real.

00:07:04.095 --> 00:07:05.060
That is real.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.810
He saw some play that
I was in it, and was

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:07.590
like your play is funny.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.298
And I was like, I just
saw you do comedy,

00:07:09.298 --> 00:07:10.910
and we were loose acquaintances.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.130
And he like was like
come to my next show,

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.390
and that's where I met Kate.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.930
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
That's actually funny.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.514
I was first exposed to you guys
from Doug Benson's podcast.

00:07:16.514 --> 00:07:17.430
RIKI LINDHOME: Really?

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.670
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Yeah.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:18.020
RIKI LINDHOME: Yeah.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.970
He's been so nice
to us since day one.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.100
He always has us on there.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.132
He's just like been
a good friend to us.

00:07:23.132 --> 00:07:24.299
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Very nice.

00:07:24.299 --> 00:07:26.132
RIKI LINDHOME: He opened
for us last time we

00:07:26.132 --> 00:07:27.320
were in LA just to be nice.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.640
Didn't want any money,
just opened for us.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.126
Yeah, it was cool.

00:07:31.126 --> 00:07:32.750
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: So
just shifting over

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.490
since we saw the "Another
Period" clip to start.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.250
So "Another Period"
is created and written

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.260
by you and Natasha Leggero.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.057
And you did say it's like a
reality show based in 1902.

00:07:42.057 --> 00:07:42.890
RIKI LINDHOME: Yeah.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.640
We say it's like a family
like the Kardashians moved

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.980
into Downton Abbey.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.900
So this is set in America.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.210
It's in Newport, Rhode Island.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.000
These people are not
classy, they're new money.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.290
And they have unlimited
money but it's brand new.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.240
And our dad is a magnet magnate.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.730
He owns all the magnets
in the world, I guess.

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.160
And then we just are
like pieces of garbage

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.842
that have no problems but
complain all day long.

00:08:08.842 --> 00:08:11.050
And "Another Period's", of
course, on Comedy Central.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:12.350
Season two comes out in June?

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:13.280
RIKI LINDHOME: June 15th.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.280
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Great.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.485
June 15th, Comedy Central.

00:08:16.485 --> 00:08:18.360
How did that come about
with you and Natasha?

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.450
Was that just a
conversation of imagine--

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:25.300
RIKI LINDHOME: So Natasha and
I, we went on a charity trip

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.780
to Senegal for Malaria No More.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.740
Which is actually an
incredible organization.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.329
They're actually curing malaria.

00:08:32.329 --> 00:08:34.370
Like they're actually
doing stuff, it's so crazy.

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:35.700
But I love that company.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.780
And we went to Senegal,
and we just bonded.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:40.919
It's so hot.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:44.450
And we didn't know what we
were doing, and it was intense.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:45.700
And so we just became friends.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.395
And then, when we
were flying back,

00:08:48.395 --> 00:08:50.020
Natasha was like I
looked at your IMDB.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.010
And I'm like yeah, OK.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.330
She's like you have like
80 credits on there,

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:57.900
and how many of
those things have you

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.197
been in that are actually funny?

00:09:01.197 --> 00:09:02.530
I was like that a good question.

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:05.060
I was like, I don't know, two?

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.450
And she's like I have zero.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.480
I have like 50 things,
and zero things are funny.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.540
And she's like, I feel
like that's weird.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.620
She's like, I think we need
to write stuff and make

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.780
funny stuff because why
is everything not funny?

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.690
And I'm like, all
right, good point.

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.910
And so we started trying
to come up with an idea,

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.160
and then we were really stuck.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.034
And so we went out and
drank a bunch of wine,

00:09:24.034 --> 00:09:26.070
and then came up with the idea.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.100
As you do.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.110
When you're like fuck
it, let's get wasted.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:30.700
And you're like,
I know the idea!

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.524
Like it's a terrible creative
process but it totally works.

00:09:33.524 --> 00:09:35.190
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
Speaking of your IMDB,

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:37.600
I found myself watching
"Million Dollar Baby" recently

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.020
and I was totally blindsided.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.760
And I was like, oh my god.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.730
That's an intense film.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:43.815
RIKI LINDHOME: I'm a
renaissance woman, as you say.

00:09:43.815 --> 00:09:44.021
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: There you go.

00:09:44.021 --> 00:09:44.210
That's right.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.240
RIKI LINDHOME: That's
my first movie.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.141
It was so crazy.

00:09:46.141 --> 00:09:47.890
I just thought it was
going up from there.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.139
I was like my first movie I
was ever in won the Oscar?

00:09:50.139 --> 00:09:51.180
Like sky's the limit.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.280
And then I still didn't get an
agent for another two or three

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:53.780
years.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.960
I was like, OK, so it's
going to be slower.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.670
But it was really awesome.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.247
It was crazy.

00:10:00.247 --> 00:10:02.580
My first scene was with Clint
Eastwood, and Hilary Swank

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.550
and Margo Martindale
that I ever did.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.010
I'm like, OK, it's fine.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:08.100
I'm fine.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.500
I totally deserve to be here.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.285
I just-- you know.

00:10:10.285 --> 00:10:11.910
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
Well, congratulations

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:12.817
on the Best Picture.

00:10:12.817 --> 00:10:13.650
RIKI LINDHOME: Yeah.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.550
Thank you, thank you.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.434
It really changed my life.

00:10:16.434 --> 00:10:18.100
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
Just so you guys know,

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.550
we will be taking questions
from the audience.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.060
There are microphones
in both the aisles

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.393
if you want to just go up there.

00:10:22.393 --> 00:10:24.739
I'll call on you, and
do it like school.

00:10:24.739 --> 00:10:26.530
RIKI LINDHOME: I feel
like you have my back

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.490
and you clapped the hardest, so
you have to ask me a question

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:29.531
and get the ball rolling.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:34.523
I just like your
whole energy, and it

00:10:34.523 --> 00:10:36.356
made me feel good as I
was walking out here.

00:10:36.356 --> 00:10:37.070
AUDIENCE: I'm sold.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.945
RIKI LINDHOME: So not
to put you on the spot,

00:10:38.945 --> 00:10:41.260
but you have to think
of something to ask me.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:41.820
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: You can wait.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:42.860
Why don't you guys
take a few minutes--

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:43.610
RIKI LINDHOME: OK.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.370
Think about it and we'll
get back to you, OK?

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.120
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: If
I was in the audience

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.120
and I wasn't lucky enough
to be moderating this,

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.100
I would ask you a very
important question.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.550
What is it like
dating Fozzie Bear?

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:58.160
RIKI LINDHOME: It's pretty sexy.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.520
He's pretty smooth.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.610
I actually loved being
on "The Muppets."

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.150
I was a big Muppets fan.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:05.370
I know people always say it.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:06.710
They're like I always
loved "The Flash."

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:07.370
And it's like no, you didn't.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:07.930
No, you didn't.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:08.830
You didn't love that growing up.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:10.600
But I actually did
love the Muppets.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:16.260
I would have Miss Piggy birthday
cakes and I just loved it.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.975
So it was pretty cool.

00:11:17.975 --> 00:11:19.100
I don't know how it worked.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.360
I didn't know there was so many
people controlling a Muppet.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.750
There's like
monitors everywhere,

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.390
and you're on this
raised platform.

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:26.679
And it's pretty--

00:11:26.679 --> 00:11:28.220
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
What is the process

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.810
of doing a scene with Fozzie?

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.160
RIKI LINDHOME: There's just
so many people involved.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.087
There's so many actors making
this thing come to life.

00:11:35.087 --> 00:11:36.920
There's like one guy
that does the left arm,

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.970
and they're all working
in this-- they just

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:40.134
know each other so well.

00:11:40.134 --> 00:11:42.050
And they have like these
things on their heads

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.070
where they can see through
the Mup-- it's just

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.300
a whole technical process
that they find very easy.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.000
And the guy who
played Fozzie also

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.679
does the voice of
Piggy and Animal.

00:11:50.679 --> 00:11:51.720
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Oh wow.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.660
RIKI LINDHOME: So his talent
is basically unlimited.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.410
He does all three
of those himself.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:58.820
What do you got?

00:11:58.820 --> 00:11:59.760
AUDIENCE: Sure, yeah.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.649
I'm ready.

00:12:00.649 --> 00:12:02.690
So I guess, first of all,
on behalf of all of us,

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:04.390
thank you so much for coming.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.020
RIKI LINDHOME: Thank
you for having me.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.800
AUDIENCE: I'm a huge fan,
and have been for years.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.133
I like to feel that your song
"I Don't Know Who You Are"

00:12:09.133 --> 00:12:10.522
is my own personal anthem.

00:12:10.522 --> 00:12:11.730
RIKI LINDHOME: I know, right?

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.000
AUDIENCE: I'm terrible
with names and faces,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.070
and it's really your fault.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:14.710
RIKI LINDHOME: Yeah.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:15.480
Don't you think?

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.170
For people who don't know
what this is, we have a song,

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:19.230
it's called "I Don't
Know Who You Are,"

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:20.200
which you can figure
out what that is.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.210
But it's people
who come up to you,

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:23.626
and they know who you are but
you don't know who they are,

00:12:23.626 --> 00:12:24.480
and they get mad.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.320
And we have this like
hypothesis that it's

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.230
their fault because they're
not interesting enough.

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:31.640
They don't have a thing.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.874
And so they blend, and
then it's not our fault.

00:12:34.874 --> 00:12:36.040
AUDIENCE: So that's amazing.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.070
So thank you so much
for opening up my life

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:40.740
like that and [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.590
So I discovered-- you guys are
amazing, Garfunkel and Oates.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.194
There's another
comedy folk duo I'm

00:12:46.194 --> 00:12:48.360
sure you've heard of called
Flight of the Conchords.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.050
RIKI LINDHOME: Yes.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.966
AUDIENCE: And it seems
such an odd thing to me

00:12:50.966 --> 00:12:54.210
that there were two comedy folk
duos that were so hysterically

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:57.130
funny, had really successful
songwriting careers,

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.830
and then made specials where
they incorporated those songs.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.060
Were you guys inspired
by each other?

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.120
Do you collaborate?

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:03.200
RIKI LINDHOME: Totally.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.616
AUDIENCE: Do you guys all hang
out in some really cool bar

00:13:05.616 --> 00:13:06.130
somewhere?

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:06.680
Where is this bar?

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.130
RIKI LINDHOME: I've never met
Bret, but I know Jermaine.

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.088
And Jermaine is actually
on the upcoming season

00:13:10.088 --> 00:13:11.510
of "Another Period."

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.000
He's doing two episodes this
season, which is so cool.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.520
He flew in from New Zealand
just to do the show,

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.702
and he plays a priest.

00:13:19.702 --> 00:13:21.410
Like every single
thing he says is funny,

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.030
so we were very, very excited.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:25.350
But Jermaine and I actually
became friends on Twitter.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:27.925
He just sent me a DM
one day being like, hey,

00:13:27.925 --> 00:13:30.300
there's like eight people in
the world who do what we do.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.230
What's up?

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.680
And I was like, I know,
it's so crazy, right?

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.730
And he was like how
weird is it we're

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:38.230
in comedy folk--
like who does this?

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.940
I'm like I don't know.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.520
And then we've just been Twitter
acquaintances since then.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.770
And then, he agreed to do
the show, which was so cool.

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:46.834
AUDIENCE: So no plans for some
grand mega band or something?

00:13:46.834 --> 00:13:48.250
RIKI LINDHOME: I
would be so down.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.010
AUDIENCE: Comedy
folk court quartet?

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:50.990
RIKI LINDHOME: I wish.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.630
I hope.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:54.292
I'm going to put-- I don't
know Bret, but I would love to.

00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:55.125
Just putting it out.

00:13:55.125 --> 00:13:56.150
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Now
it's out in the world.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.520
RIKI LINDHOME: Yeah.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.670
It's in the universe now.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.810
It's going to happen.

00:13:58.810 --> 00:13:59.420
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Thank you.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:00.060
RIKI LINDHOME: Thanks.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:00.540
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
Thank you, buddy.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.456
RIKI LINDHOME: That "I
Don't Know Who You Are"

00:14:02.456 --> 00:14:04.850
song was really weird
because everyone liked takes

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:06.710
your point of view, which is
like I don't remember people

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:07.210
either.

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:08.994
You put yourself in
the hero position.

00:14:08.994 --> 00:14:10.910
But then one person came
up to us after a show

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:12.810
and they're like
that song is so mean.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.570
And I was like, wait, why?

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:15.070
What?

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.700
He goes people always forget me.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.620
And I was like, oh god.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.100
And he put himself in the--
don't you guys put yourself

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:23.990
in the hero shoes?

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:26.240
Like you hear a bit about
other people being annoying,

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.390
they're like I am annoying.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:28.290
Like you don't put
yourself-- I don't know,

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:30.640
I thought that was so strange
and I didn't want to say.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.550
I was like, I think you
should change your perspective

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:35.050
on this.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:36.000
Do you forget people?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.820
And he's like not really.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.222
Sorry man, I don't know.

00:14:40.222 --> 00:14:41.930
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
Well, speaking of that,

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.060
another one of your songs
seems like it may come across

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.185
as aggressive to people,
"Pregnant Women Are Smug."

00:14:46.185 --> 00:14:48.680
Have you ever had any
backlash from that?

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.390
RIKI LINDHOME: Yeah, but not
any that you care about it.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:53.300
I don't know.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.730
Like what's the-- I
don't like that like.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.210
I'm like OK.

00:14:58.210 --> 00:14:58.740
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
Because they're smug.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:14:59.615
RIKI LINDHOME: Right.

00:14:59.615 --> 00:15:02.700
Like it doesn't ever
hurt my feelings ever.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:06.130
But so many more
people have been like--

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:09.600
like Amanda Palmer is pregnant,
and she sang "Pregnant Women

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.150
Are Smug" on her whole tour.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.022
She like took it on.

00:15:13.022 --> 00:15:15.480
Like we got these onesies made
that say "My mommy is smug,"

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.565
and they just like sold out.

00:15:17.565 --> 00:15:18.440
People just buy them.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.060
So I think probably for
gag gifts for baby showers.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.950
But I think most people own it.

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:26.750
I feel like if you're
pregnant and acting like that,

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:27.970
you know it.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:30.090
And like you can like,
you're allowed to.

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:33.686
You're just allowed to do
that, but I think you know it.

00:15:33.686 --> 00:15:35.060
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
The woman card.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.140
RIKI LINDHOME: The
woman card, I know.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:38.170
The pregnant woman card.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:41.027
That's more powerful than
the woman card, I think.

00:15:41.027 --> 00:15:42.610
Because no one can
say that you're not

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:45.640
going through whatever you
say you're going through.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.905
Like no, my ankles hurt.

00:15:47.905 --> 00:15:49.580
And you're like OK.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:54.210
Like you can't be like no, they
don't because you have no idea.

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:56.010
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
Speaking of your songs,

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:58.930
I'm dating a 31-year-old
woman who loves "29/31".

00:15:58.930 --> 00:15:59.930
RIKI LINDHOME: Oh, cool.

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:02.260
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: So thank
you for that from her.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:03.710
RIKI LINDHOME: Does she feel
like there's no one left,

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:04.820
and that's why she's dating you?

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:05.880
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Maybe.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.463
RIKI LINDHOME: No,
I'm totally joking.

00:16:07.463 --> 00:16:08.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.040
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
That's exactly what

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.272
I said when she was like,
oh man, that's so cool.

00:16:11.272 --> 00:16:12.730
And I was just
like, wait a second.

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:14.015
This got really real.

00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:15.390
RIKI LINDHOME:
It's so funny when

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:17.570
people take that-- some people
have taken it seriously.

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:18.822
Like I was at a baseball
game the other day,

00:16:18.822 --> 00:16:19.946
and this girl turns around.

00:16:19.946 --> 00:16:22.110
She's like are you the girl
from the "29/31" video?

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:23.285
And I was like, yeah, yeah.

00:16:23.285 --> 00:16:24.660
And she didn't
think we wrote it.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.680
She thought we were like
acting in this video.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.990
And she's like I relate
to that song so much.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:33.030
I'm 30, and I know my life
is about to get really bad.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.680
And I was like no,
it's just a joke.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.260
It's not real.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.030
It's not necessarily that,
it's just like a joke.

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.860
It was about basically me and
Kate's perspectives on love,

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.580
and we weren't even
29, 31 at the time.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.288
We just thought those
were funny numbers.

00:16:46.288 --> 00:16:48.200
We were like 31
and 33, but we're

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.850
like nah, that's not as funny.

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:50.350
Yeah.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:52.440
But she's like I just know
everything's going to get bad,

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.731
and I got to meet someone soon.

00:16:53.731 --> 00:16:56.490
And she was so
pretty, and I was OK.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.150
Sorry, maybe you shouldn't
watch that video.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.392
It's just a joke.

00:17:01.392 --> 00:17:03.100
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
That's said, out of all

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.933
of the songs you and
Kate have put together,

00:17:04.933 --> 00:17:06.680
what is like your go-to?

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.800
Like which is your
favorite baby, basically?

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.380
What's your favorite?

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.589
RIKI LINDHOME: My
favorite song is one

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:12.169
that we've actually
never played.

00:17:12.169 --> 00:17:14.210
It's just on an album,
but it was on our TV show.

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:16.890
It's called "Such a
Loser," and it's an anthem

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.720
for people who are trying.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.750
Because just like you
guys are on the internet.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.770
You understand when you
put something out there,

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:25.920
you just get all this criticism.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.660
And it feels like there's
like this hierarchy where

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:32.520
it's winners, people who
just don't do anything

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.232
but comment on it,
and then losers.

00:17:34.232 --> 00:17:36.190
But we just feel like
those should be switched.

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:38.710
Like winners are just like they
won, you got it like they did.

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:40.930
But the people who try and
the people who comment on it,

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:42.480
should be like a
different hierarchy.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.020
So that the commenters
should just be like whatever.

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.500
And so we wrote a song
in praise of people

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.450
who are trying and failing
because if you're failing that

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:51.770
much, you're trying that much.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:52.812
So it's not a funny song.

00:17:52.812 --> 00:17:54.353
It's totally
sentimental, but I think

00:17:54.353 --> 00:17:56.280
it's the best thing
we've ever written.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.500
Yeah, look it up.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.500
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Great.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.910
RIKI LINDHOME: We have
a cartoon made of it,

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:03.571
and people play
it for their kids.

00:18:03.571 --> 00:18:05.570
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: With
your songwriting process,

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:07.950
you seem to then
also go into video.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:09.230
So what is that like?

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:12.640
Do you ever get bogged
down in like, oh, this

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.409
would look great visually, so
we should add it to the song?

00:18:15.409 --> 00:18:16.700
Or is that well after the fact?

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:17.080
RIKI LINDHOME: Nope.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.780
We don't have that
kind of forethought.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:19.970
We're just like,
oh, I don't know.

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:21.428
I guess we'll just
film some stuff.

00:18:21.428 --> 00:18:23.970
Yeah, we don't really ever think
about that part of the song.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:25.427
And like for "Such
a Loser," we had

00:18:25.427 --> 00:18:28.050
it animated by these people in
Boston, who are so incredible.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.091
And they just sent us this
thing, and Kate and I,

00:18:30.091 --> 00:18:31.387
we always have a million notes.

00:18:31.387 --> 00:18:33.970
We're so nit-picky, it takes us
forever for us to do anything.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.344
And they sent it, and we just
started crying, both of us.

00:18:36.344 --> 00:18:37.936
And we're like this is perfect.

00:18:37.936 --> 00:18:39.310
And they were,
well, we have like

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:40.559
four rounds of notes built-in.

00:18:40.559 --> 00:18:42.890
And we're like no, love it.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:44.310
So sometimes it's
like that easy.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.851
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
I was going to say,

00:18:45.851 --> 00:18:48.064
so for you, notes are really
a bad thing in general.

00:18:48.064 --> 00:18:48.980
RIKI LINDHOME: No, no.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.980
I always have so many notes.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.980
But this one, it was perfect.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:57.890
And so you don't want to-- if
it's perfect, it's perfect.

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:00.930
But yeah, I'm like pretty
hands-on with everything.

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.074
I like to be in every
moment of everything.

00:19:03.074 --> 00:19:05.490
Like Natasha and I are editing
"Another Period" right now,

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.740
and we're in the editing
room from like 10:00 to 8:00,

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.040
every single day.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.010
We just get our
nails done in there.

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:14.124
Yeah, we're hands-on.

00:19:14.124 --> 00:19:15.124
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Great.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.110
Sorry, I thought I
was getting signaled.

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:22.790
In "Another Period" coming up,
what can we look forward to?

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.320
You mentioned that
Jermaine's going to be on.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.153
RIKI LINDHOME: Jermaine,
and Andrew Reynolds

00:19:26.153 --> 00:19:28.980
is on this new season, playing
like a dashing prince-type

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.840
person.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.930
Harriet Tubman is
in our premiere,

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:36.320
which is so crazy that
now she's on money-- well,

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.400
about to be on money--
because we have her

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.610
as a-- she's a branding expert.

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:42.470
We have her as like
this Oprah-type person,

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:43.928
and she's basically
like how do you

00:19:43.928 --> 00:19:45.360
think I'm the only
name associated

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.610
with this entire movement?

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.680
She's like, I did that
shit, like on our show.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.638
People are going to have
mixed reactions to it,

00:19:51.638 --> 00:19:53.700
they really are, and
we're prepared for that.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.752
But it is funny if you watch.

00:19:56.752 --> 00:19:58.710
Because you think about
it how did one person--

00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:59.543
how did that happen?

00:19:59.543 --> 00:20:01.420
Like there was so many people.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.890
But yeah, so you just
think through history.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:06.762
And now, she's going to be
on money so guess it worked.

00:20:06.762 --> 00:20:08.970
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: In that
vein, you mentioned earlier

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:12.460
that a lot of things are from
1902, and then you "yes, and."

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:13.330
RIKI LINDHOME: Yes.

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:15.252
So much stuff is true though.

00:20:15.252 --> 00:20:16.710
People think we
make up this stuff.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:20.630
Like we have cocaine wine,
that was just a popular drink.

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:21.590
We didn't make that up.

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:23.200
People had cocaine
wine all the time.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.350
Just those kind of
things are just real.

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:29.260
Freud masturbating
people, it's just real.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:33.200
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: So that's a
real clip entirely with Freud?

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.725
RIKI LINDHOME: Yes, that
was not Chris Parnell.

00:20:35.725 --> 00:20:38.022
That was Sigmund Freud.

00:20:38.022 --> 00:20:39.480
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
All right, great.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.236
Thank you so much for being
here, we really appreciate--

00:20:41.236 --> 00:20:41.410
RIKI LINDHOME:
Thanks for having me.

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:41.720
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: --it.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.810
If anyone would like to
meet Riki afterwards,

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:44.710
we'll be right here.

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:45.383
RIKI LINDHOME: Right here.

00:20:45.383 --> 00:20:46.341
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Yeah.

00:20:46.341 --> 00:20:49.105
If you didn't want to ask
your questions directly.

00:20:49.105 --> 00:20:50.480
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.100
RIKI LINDHOME: Thank
you for having me.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:51.880
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
Everyone, Riki Lindhome.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.130
RIKI LINDHOME: Thank you guys.

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:54.030
[APPLAUSE]
