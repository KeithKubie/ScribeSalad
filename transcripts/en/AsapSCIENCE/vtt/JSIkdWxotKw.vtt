00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.800
While many of us go through life
with the persuit of money on our minds,

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.500
we're often told that
money can't buy happiness.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.800
But what truth is
there in the saying?

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.000
Is there a correlation
between money and happiness?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.700
And, if so, how can we use
it to our advantage?

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.820
Humans are very
sensitive to change.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.420
When we get a raise or
commission, we really enjoy it.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.920
But we adapt at incredible
speeds to our new wealth.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.320
Some studies have shown
that in North America,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.820
additional income beyond $75.000 a year
ceases to impact day-to-day happiness.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.520
In fact, people who win the lottery often
report becoming extremely unhappy.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.520
They often end up spending
all the money, going into debt

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.820
and experience ruined
social relationships.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.620
So, surely money can't
really buy happiness.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.820
Well, recent studies suggest that
the problem may actually be

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.820
in the way we spend money.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.220
Instead of buying things for yourself,
try giving some of it to other people

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.020
and see how you feel.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.420
Studies show that people who spend
their money on others feel happier.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.220
And while people who
spend it on themselves

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.720
don't necessarily become less happy,
their happiness is unchanged.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.620
The same principle has been tested
on teams and organizations as well.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.720
One experiment showed that
instead of an organization writing

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.420
a large check to a charity, dividing
the amount up amongst employees

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.320
and allowing them to contribute
to a charity of their choosing,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.520
increased their job satisfaction.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.220
Similarly, individuals that spend
monetary incentives on each other,

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.620
as opposed to themselves,
increase not only job satisfaction,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.420
but improve team
performance and sales.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.620
This has been seen in both
sales and sports teams.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.020
Almost everywhere we look
in the world, we see that

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.720
giving money or gifts to others is
possitively correlated with happiness.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.520
Interestingly, the specific way the
money is spent on others isn't important.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.320
From trivial gifts to major charity
efforts, spending something

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.020
on others is the important aspect
in increasing your happiness.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.620
The emotional rewards of pro-social spending
are even detectable at the neural level.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.420
If you are going to spend the money
on yourself, try to go after experiences,

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.420
as opposed to material things.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.420
Traveling or going to an event is more impactful
for the vast majority of people in the long run.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.720
And while you're saving up
for these big experiences,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.820
don't forget about
the daily joys in life.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.320
Many small frequent pleasures help
to get you through the days and

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.620
and encourage change,
which stimulates the brain.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.420
Instead of buying a 3,000-dollar rug that provides
a one-time experience for the next 10 years,

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.220
a 5-dollar latte with friends
will be different each time,

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.520
offering unique access to
happiness opportunities.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.920
Though money is unlikely to be the
main source of happiness in our lives,

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.420
it certainly has the potential to make some
things easier... and complicate others.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.720
But at the end of the day, it can buy
happiness, if spent in the right way.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.020
