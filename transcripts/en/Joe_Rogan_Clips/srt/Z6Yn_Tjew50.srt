1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,130
The Joe Rogan experience and they
create all these amazing fighters.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,520
There's so many great fighters and Russell
and wrestlers that have come out of

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,890
Russia.
Former Soviet Union.

4
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:15,300
I can drag off rocky f
five or four. Four. Yeah.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,380
The new one was scary to knew what
he was afraid of. New Creed. Rocky's.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,080
Yeah. You know that I've heard. I haven't
seen it yet. Yeah. Drago son is fighting.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,060
Who is this guy? Creed's son till we know
the actor. Is it out yet? The creed guy?

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,230
No, I think this is the
son of a Drago. I Dunno.

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:39,310
Some Russian cat. Okay.
[inaudible] already famous over
here. I'd like to think so.

10
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,920
I don't think so. Yeah. There's the
guy. Look at him. There's drill. Go.

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,360
Yeah. This is his son diseases.
My sauce. Like a bad ass. He does.

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,410
He's still a bad ass. I'm sure that,
that his jaw was perfectly square.

13
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,730
That's like a dam square come much bigger.
You know,

14
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:00,870
like rocky writes.
How tall is a Sylvester?

15
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,390
I don't know. I think you
met him. Yes. Well, yes. Um,

16
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:11,580
I think he's got about five. Nine.
He's taller than me. I'm five.

17
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:14,370
Eight okay. So he's either
five, nine or five. 10 okay.

18
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,030
So that the drug up must be huge.
Like how it tells you to say he is,

19
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:21,540
cause everybody was jokes around and
says he's five 11 or a that these five,

20
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:26,420
seven, five, five. But they do that
with everybody. Yeah. They do that.

21
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:29,070
Tom Cruise,
it's his five 10 see that makes sense.

22
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,930
So He's two inches taller than me.
Five 10 yeah. Okay. Well, yeah,

23
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:38,720
I think I'm five nine. I don't know. I
haven't measured myself in a while. Hello?

24
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,210
How, how tall do you think I am? I think
you're about that. About five. Nine. Yeah.

25
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,630
In high school, I always put
like five, 10, five, 11 bigger.

26
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:49,440
Now we're old people that are small
and as people get bigger and bigger,

27
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:53,220
these kids today that are getting hitting
puberty when they're six yeah. Luke,

28
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,610
there's hormones in the meat [inaudible]
six five [inaudible] who's [inaudible]?

29
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,310
They'd probably accentuated his
height for that. That scene,

30
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,950
that's just his hair is five
inches. Look at that down. The hair.

31
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,940
Looks like he's almost like a foot
taller than them, doesn't it? Yeah. Yeah,

32
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:12,510
they probably had, that's about,
they probably had him in heels.

33
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,210
And how the sessional on barefoot
or something for that shot.

34
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,590
Didn't they say like, uh, at one point
during this movie, Rocky said, uh,

35
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,890
go ahead and uh, go ahead. Hit me for
real one time. Just what, you know,

36
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,340
make it look real. Cause they
were always like, you know,

37
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,580
they're like an anthropology and the
swings and it almost hit him to the

38
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:32,370
hospital. Like he hit him in the chest
ride. Yeah, he talked about that.

39
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,840
Almost stopped his heart shit down.
My idea doll from drones. Right?

40
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,800
He's a senior professional. Yeah.
He's a kickbox kickboxing. Yeah.

41
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:44,130
Really Good Sylvester Stallone Lundgren
put me in the hospital during rocky four.

42
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,410
Yeah, I believe it. The
only people hit you bro.

43
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,770
He also had to realism bell, I guess. I
wonder if they even use the clip. Right.

44
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,480
Um,
he um,

45
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,720
also has like screws in his
neck from doing the expendables.

46
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,710
Oh yeah. Yeah. What do you got chain?

47
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,320
He's put in intensive care
for five days because of that.

48
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,740
With nuns walking around.
Jesus Christ.

49
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,210
Wow. Insurance Company would not pay out
until after they saw the footage of the

50
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:20,200
incident. Once they did, they wrote
the check. I want to see that footage.

51
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,760
He said he didn't see that punch.

52
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,770
He hit my heart so hard that it banged
against my ribs and started to swell.

53
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,540
And that usually happens in
car accidents. Oh my God. Well,

54
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,370
Jesus, that guy can punch. He's
a beast, man. He's a giant dude.

55
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,060
Why would he ever needs a serious striker?
Like he knows how to throw shots.

56
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:45,010
If you watch him in his movies, he's
uh, he's obviously trained. Yeah.

57
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,150
I want to say that footage. I want to say
that Po ouch. That's gotta be out there.

58
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,940
But if it's Sylvester Stallone
wouldn't let anybody see it.

59
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,090
The way isn't wants to embarrass
him the way. Wait, cried.

60
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,563
So we were faced.

61
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,860
He's like that lady who steps on grapes,
who falls down.

62
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,780
Oh Wow.

63
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,740
She loses her breath.
You can never be an action hero again.

64
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:07,360
If somebody sees you
cry. That's true. Right?

65
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:11,210
If someone sees he like legitimately
cry from the liver shot. Whoa.

66
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,250
You just shit yourself. And
he's looking at the camera. Why.
