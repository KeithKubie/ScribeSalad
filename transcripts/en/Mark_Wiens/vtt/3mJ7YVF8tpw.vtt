00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:03.001
- This is, literally, the biggest prawn

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:04.241
I've ever seen in my life.

00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:07.193
To get a scale of this, I need
to put it up next to my face.

00:00:07.193 --> 00:00:09.957
Here, this is almost as
wide as my shoulder torso.

00:00:09.957 --> 00:00:12.540
(lively music)

00:00:14.861 --> 00:00:16.186
Good morning, everyone, it's Mark Wiens

00:00:16.186 --> 00:00:19.568
with migrationology.com,
in Lisbon, Portugal.

00:00:19.568 --> 00:00:21.629
We are having breakfast
this morning at the hotel

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:25.177
before we go out for a full
day of sightseeing and eating.

00:00:25.177 --> 00:00:28.553
Got some mushrooms, got some
scrambled eggs, got some fruit.

00:00:28.553 --> 00:00:31.303
Oh, and also, I got some chorizo.

00:00:34.538 --> 00:00:36.032
Mushrooms fried in butter.

00:00:36.032 --> 00:00:38.593
I could not resist a couple pieces of,

00:00:38.593 --> 00:00:41.157
this one is some kind
of chorizo, and then,

00:00:41.157 --> 00:00:42.158
I'm not sure what this one is,

00:00:42.158 --> 00:00:45.658
but look at that nice peppercorn in there.

00:00:48.163 --> 00:00:48.996
Oh!

00:00:48.996 --> 00:00:51.579
Oh, that peppercorn, fantastic.

00:00:52.705 --> 00:00:57.054
And also, I should tell
you, it is, like, freezing!

00:00:57.054 --> 00:00:59.272
I'm in shorts and a T-shirt right now.

00:00:59.272 --> 00:01:01.218
I definitely need a jacket.

00:01:01.218 --> 00:01:03.702
I wasn't expecting, it's really cold.

00:01:03.702 --> 00:01:06.027
Not really cold, but it's very cool,

00:01:06.027 --> 00:01:08.838
and this is the middle
of the summer in Lisbon.

00:01:08.838 --> 00:01:10.745
(sipping loudly)

00:01:10.745 --> 00:01:12.051
Ah!

00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:14.801
Oh, yeah, this weather's amazing.

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:18.284
(laughs) And my hair's sticking up.

00:01:18.284 --> 00:01:19.301
Can you see that, Ying?

00:01:19.301 --> 00:01:20.134
- [Ying] Yeah.

00:01:20.134 --> 00:01:21.931
- It's not like freezing,

00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:25.008
but it's definitely kinda cool.

00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:28.925
Oh, 18 degrees, and what
is that in Fahrenheit?

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.971
Ying, how do you change it?

00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:36.138
Which in Fahrenheit is 64.

00:01:37.343 --> 00:01:40.889
We are out now walking
around this cool morning,

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:45.444
on our way, heading
towards Castelo de Jorge.

00:01:45.444 --> 00:01:48.027
(upbeat music)

00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:57.254
We made it to the plaza of Dom Pedro IV

00:01:57.254 --> 00:01:59.777
at Rossio, and so we're
just walking through here.

00:01:59.777 --> 00:02:02.294
There are a couple of
fountains on either side,

00:02:02.294 --> 00:02:04.758
and then right in the
center is the main statue

00:02:04.758 --> 00:02:06.091
of Dom Pedro IV.

00:02:06.937 --> 00:02:09.520
(upbeat music)

00:02:18.908 --> 00:02:20.966
Before going to the castle,
while I'm in this area,

00:02:20.966 --> 00:02:24.195
we decided to stop by
the Santa Justa Lift,

00:02:24.195 --> 00:02:28.708
which is an elevator
that dates back to 1902.

00:02:28.708 --> 00:02:30.231
And because the line
is not long right now,

00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:33.981
I think I'm gonna go up
to the top right now.

00:02:35.685 --> 00:02:36.859
(clicking)

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.203
On the lift now, about to go up.

00:02:39.203 --> 00:02:41.786
(upbeat music)

00:02:46.517 --> 00:02:48.600
How many floors is it up?

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.200
- [Woman] Floors, I'm not
sure, it's 42 meters high.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.075
- 42 meters high.

00:02:54.075 --> 00:02:55.396
- [Woman] With your ticket,
you just have to show it

00:02:55.396 --> 00:02:57.884
to my colleague when
you go up there, okay?

00:02:57.884 --> 00:02:59.054
- Okay, thank you.

00:02:59.054 --> 00:03:02.452
And now, I am climbing
up the iron staircase,

00:03:02.452 --> 00:03:06.318
circular iron staircase,
to the top viewpoint.

00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:08.372
All right, made it to the top.

00:03:08.372 --> 00:03:10.955
(upbeat music)

00:03:21.883 --> 00:03:25.676
The elevator was designed
by Raoul Mesnier,

00:03:25.676 --> 00:03:28.298
who was an apprentice of Gustave Eiffel,

00:03:28.298 --> 00:03:30.145
and it's built of wrought iron,

00:03:30.145 --> 00:03:32.901
and it was completed in the year 1902.

00:03:32.901 --> 00:03:36.685
From up here, you get a
great sense of Lisbon.

00:03:36.685 --> 00:03:38.649
You can see Rossio Square,

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:41.724
you can see the Castle of Sao Jorge,

00:03:41.724 --> 00:03:43.938
you can see the cathedral,

00:03:43.938 --> 00:03:47.438
as well as the waterfront in the distance.

00:03:51.143 --> 00:03:54.143
(elevator creaking)

00:03:55.325 --> 00:03:56.158
Thank you very much.

00:03:56.158 --> 00:03:57.092
- Goodbye!

00:03:57.092 --> 00:03:59.495
- Bye. (laughs)

00:03:59.495 --> 00:04:02.347
Yeah, a vintage elevator in Lisbon.

00:04:02.347 --> 00:04:03.632
We're on our way to the castle now,

00:04:03.632 --> 00:04:06.622
which is just up the hill,
I can see a view of it.

00:04:06.622 --> 00:04:09.171
And to save some time,
we're gonna jump on the bus.

00:04:09.171 --> 00:04:13.088
(speaking in foreign language)

00:04:14.156 --> 00:04:16.944
We made it on to bus number 737,

00:04:16.944 --> 00:04:20.175
and we're gonna go up the
hill towards the castle.

00:04:20.175 --> 00:04:21.573
It is a packed bus.

00:04:21.573 --> 00:04:24.156
(upbeat music)

00:04:31.427 --> 00:04:35.808
We really wound up the tiny
narrow streets here in Lisbon.

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:38.645
It was almost a roller coaster ride,

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:41.513
but we have arrived to
the top of the hill,

00:04:41.513 --> 00:04:45.426
and welcome to the Castle of Sao Jorge.

00:04:45.426 --> 00:04:47.765
(people chattering)

00:04:47.765 --> 00:04:49.562
(beeping)

00:04:49.562 --> 00:04:51.888
That cost 8.50 for entrance,

00:04:51.888 --> 00:04:54.554
and this is a castle that is, maybe,

00:04:54.554 --> 00:04:56.534
one of the biggest attractions in Lisbon.

00:04:56.534 --> 00:04:58.156
It dates back to the 11th century

00:04:58.156 --> 00:05:00.939
and was built by the Moors.

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:03.238
It's a citadel, so it's
on the top of a hill.

00:05:03.238 --> 00:05:06.548
There's a castle, and
also on the same compound

00:05:06.548 --> 00:05:09.314
is where there is a royal palace.

00:05:09.314 --> 00:05:12.681
And also, from what I
was just reading in the

00:05:12.681 --> 00:05:15.155
pamphlet that they gave
me, or the brochure,

00:05:15.155 --> 00:05:18.279
this was also a privileged area of Lisbon,

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:19.885
where the elite lived.

00:05:19.885 --> 00:05:23.722
And also, get some more
views of Lisbon from up here.

00:05:23.722 --> 00:05:26.305
(upbeat music)

00:05:36.265 --> 00:05:38.698
And I love how the entire fort

00:05:38.698 --> 00:05:41.927
is just kinda sloping from how old it is,

00:05:41.927 --> 00:05:45.674
and it's really nice,
lots of trees as well.

00:05:45.674 --> 00:05:47.416
It's cool and shady.

00:05:47.416 --> 00:05:49.999
(upbeat music)

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:55.306
Just a short walk to the
corner of the complex

00:05:55.306 --> 00:05:57.376
is the actual castle itself.

00:05:57.376 --> 00:05:59.932
There are 11 watchtowers
that still survive

00:05:59.932 --> 00:06:01.190
within the castle,

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.024
and it was built as a military
fortress for protection

00:06:05.024 --> 00:06:08.156
on a very strategic point in Lisbon,

00:06:08.156 --> 00:06:10.476
right on the top of a hill in a position

00:06:10.476 --> 00:06:12.277
where you can get a good view

00:06:12.277 --> 00:06:16.444
and see the other parts of the
city, and people coming up.

00:06:26.748 --> 00:06:29.331
(upbeat music)

00:06:39.972 --> 00:06:41.383
You do have to be careful of the steps

00:06:41.383 --> 00:06:43.250
because they're so well,

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.612
just like the roads and
the sidewalks in Lisbon,

00:06:46.612 --> 00:06:50.188
they're so well-used that
they are smooth and slippery.

00:06:50.188 --> 00:06:51.365
Whatever you do when you come up here,

00:06:51.365 --> 00:06:54.282
you don't wanna slip and fall down.

00:06:56.426 --> 00:06:59.278
(people chattering)

00:06:59.278 --> 00:07:02.099
I think this is the tallest
tower of the castle.

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:04.682
(upbeat music)

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:21.749
From the castle, we decided
to just walk down the hill,

00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:23.848
kinda curving, looping around,

00:07:23.848 --> 00:07:26.264
and we're on our way to eat lunch,

00:07:26.264 --> 00:07:28.956
but I'm loving this
walk through the narrow

00:07:28.956 --> 00:07:33.170
medieval lanes of Lisbon,
and the buildings.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.327
Awesome place to walk around and explore.

00:07:35.327 --> 00:07:37.910
(upbeat music)

00:07:45.451 --> 00:07:46.783
When you're walking around Lisbon,

00:07:46.783 --> 00:07:49.017
it feels like you're half stumbling,

00:07:49.017 --> 00:07:50.633
half losing your balance all of the time

00:07:50.633 --> 00:07:53.303
because the sidewalks are so slippery,

00:07:53.303 --> 00:07:55.923
and then so uneven,
with little sink holes.

00:07:55.923 --> 00:07:59.039
And sometimes, the
sidewalks are so narrow.

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:00.859
This is such an awesome city.

00:08:00.859 --> 00:08:02.522
We're on our way to go eat at

00:08:02.522 --> 00:08:05.352
what is one of the most legendary,

00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:09.291
and what almost everybody
says is the best,

00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:12.208
the standard for seafood in Lisbon.

00:08:13.604 --> 00:08:16.417
(silverware clanking)
(hissing)

00:08:16.417 --> 00:08:19.667
And this is one of the ultimate, maybe,

00:08:20.513 --> 00:08:23.210
I think it's the best from
what almost everybody says

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:26.324
for seafood in all of Lisbon.

00:08:26.324 --> 00:08:28.369
We got here, luckily,
there was no waiting line,

00:08:28.369 --> 00:08:30.051
but we did wait just
for about five minutes

00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:31.548
for them to clear our table.

00:08:31.548 --> 00:08:34.079
We're in here, I love
the lively environment.

00:08:34.079 --> 00:08:38.212
You can smell the crab
and the shrimp in the air,

00:08:38.212 --> 00:08:40.880
and the butter, in the
air of this restaurant.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.691
And we just sat down and
they give you an iPad

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:45.644
for the menu.

00:08:45.644 --> 00:08:48.128
All the different types of seafood.

00:08:48.128 --> 00:08:49.961
Spiny dye-murex, whoa.

00:08:51.014 --> 00:08:52.097
Tiger prawns,

00:08:53.082 --> 00:08:56.428
crawfish, lobster, oysters, barnacles.

00:08:56.428 --> 00:08:59.649
- (mumbles) One kilo (mumbles).

00:08:59.649 --> 00:09:01.066
- Okay, one crab,

00:09:01.974 --> 00:09:03.296
clams with garlic.

00:09:03.296 --> 00:09:04.326
- Yes.

00:09:04.326 --> 00:09:07.966
- And they have, just, an
amazing array of seafood.

00:09:07.966 --> 00:09:12.133
And also, Portugal is known
to have some of the best

00:09:13.293 --> 00:09:16.654
coastal seafood waters
of anywhere in the world.

00:09:16.654 --> 00:09:19.547
You gotta love the lively
environment in here as well.

00:09:19.547 --> 00:09:21.840
They have tanks of fresh seafood,

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.829
and then it actually feels like
a Chinese restaurant in here

00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:27.987
although it's pure Portuguese.

00:09:27.987 --> 00:09:30.169
Oh, wow, our first dish has just arrived.

00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:32.508
(sizzling)
(speaking in foreign language)

00:09:32.508 --> 00:09:33.341
Thank you.

00:09:34.484 --> 00:09:35.724
Oh, thank you.

00:09:35.724 --> 00:09:37.387
This one is the clams.

00:09:37.387 --> 00:09:39.162
- Yeah, it's the clams in garlic sauce.

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:40.753
- Okay, (speaking in foreign language).

00:09:40.753 --> 00:09:43.586
(loud chattering)

00:09:48.666 --> 00:09:50.712
I'm, just, already
overwhelmed with seafood

00:09:50.712 --> 00:09:52.809
and I haven't even taken my first bite.

00:09:52.809 --> 00:09:55.642
(loud chattering)

00:09:57.356 --> 00:09:58.589
Okay, seafood time.

00:09:58.589 --> 00:10:01.271
While this is hot and fresh,
I am gonna take a bite.

00:10:01.271 --> 00:10:04.577
These are prawns in garlic,
and I think that's butter.

00:10:04.577 --> 00:10:07.497
And when he delivered it,
it was just bubbling over.

00:10:07.497 --> 00:10:11.848
You can smell that aroma
of garlic in the steam.

00:10:11.848 --> 00:10:13.803
Oh, wow, and it has stopped bubbling,

00:10:13.803 --> 00:10:16.209
but I think it is still flaming hot.

00:10:16.209 --> 00:10:19.042
(loud chattering)

00:10:25.753 --> 00:10:27.336
Just pure goodness.

00:10:28.456 --> 00:10:30.998
Oh, those are meaty and firm.

00:10:30.998 --> 00:10:34.290
And along with those prawns,
what is exceptionally good

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.786
is how that garlic, just get
a really, really close up look

00:10:36.786 --> 00:10:37.619
at that garlic.

00:10:37.619 --> 00:10:41.482
It is half caramelized, so it's crispy,

00:10:41.482 --> 00:10:44.473
yet it just has so much
garlicky-ness to it.

00:10:44.473 --> 00:10:49.348
(laughing) Okay, one more, I have to.

00:10:49.348 --> 00:10:51.492
On the menu, I think it said edible crab,

00:10:51.492 --> 00:10:54.370
but I think it's a local crab
from the waters off Portugal.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:58.657
And what is insanely
impressive about this crab,

00:10:58.657 --> 00:11:00.746
as opposed to any other crab I've seen,

00:11:00.746 --> 00:11:03.996
is the amount of eggs within the shell.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:06.457
Look at that!

00:11:06.457 --> 00:11:07.932
And they served it with
two spoons on the side,

00:11:07.932 --> 00:11:09.345
it's like pudding.

00:11:09.345 --> 00:11:12.178
(loud chattering)

00:11:13.468 --> 00:11:15.830
Has just a very faint bitterness to it.

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.580
Just incredibly rich,

00:11:19.978 --> 00:11:22.376
and you get little bits of,

00:11:22.376 --> 00:11:24.567
I think they have, like,

00:11:24.567 --> 00:11:27.256
they've sort of whipped it up, maybe.

00:11:27.256 --> 00:11:28.959
And one more thing to
explain about the crab

00:11:28.959 --> 00:11:32.459
is that it's served cold, so it's chilled.

00:11:34.053 --> 00:11:36.172
It makes it refreshing, very refreshing.

00:11:36.172 --> 00:11:37.798
I'm putting down the spoon and going in

00:11:37.798 --> 00:11:40.823
for one of these hairy legs.

00:11:40.823 --> 00:11:44.846
Oh, nugget, look at that
nugget of crab there.

00:11:44.846 --> 00:11:47.754
Oh, you can actually feel the hairs

00:11:47.754 --> 00:11:49.256
on this crab leg.

00:11:49.256 --> 00:11:52.089
(loud chattering)

00:11:57.078 --> 00:11:58.664
Whoa.

00:11:58.664 --> 00:12:00.831
The juiciness of the crab,

00:12:02.023 --> 00:12:05.706
it's so juicy, maybe because
of the way it's prepared,

00:12:05.706 --> 00:12:07.486
and then how it's chilled.

00:12:07.486 --> 00:12:10.319
(loud chattering)

00:12:12.648 --> 00:12:13.481
Yeah.

00:12:14.433 --> 00:12:15.613
That's just insane.

00:12:15.613 --> 00:12:17.195
The other seafood dish that has come out

00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:21.257
are the clams in garlic,
and I think butter as well.

00:12:21.257 --> 00:12:25.019
Maybe I'll put some of
these onto my plate.

00:12:25.019 --> 00:12:29.594
And these smell equally as
fantastic as those shrimp.

00:12:29.594 --> 00:12:33.250
You can see all of those
pieces of garlic on it.

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:37.417
Oh, this one is covered in
sauce and butter and garlic

00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:39.352
and goodness.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:43.854
Oh, oh, he just slid out.

00:12:43.854 --> 00:12:46.832
I wanna get all of that garlic though.

00:12:46.832 --> 00:12:49.454
Actually, I will just pick this guy up.

00:12:49.454 --> 00:12:52.287
(loud chattering)

00:12:56.492 --> 00:12:57.825
That's stunning!

00:12:58.768 --> 00:12:59.768
Little clam,

00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:04.282
again, they are naturally
a little bit sweet,

00:13:04.282 --> 00:13:06.784
and that is a salty, buttery,

00:13:06.784 --> 00:13:11.406
just incredibly garlicky
goodness, buttery sauce.

00:13:11.406 --> 00:13:13.090
And I think what they do here

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:15.263
is they bring a couple of seafood dishes,

00:13:15.263 --> 00:13:18.277
and then once you finish
them, they bring some more

00:13:18.277 --> 00:13:20.605
because if they were to
bring everything at once,

00:13:20.605 --> 00:13:22.195
your table would just, actually,

00:13:22.195 --> 00:13:23.598
everything would not fit on the table,

00:13:23.598 --> 00:13:26.489
and your seafood would fall off the table.

00:13:26.489 --> 00:13:27.970
So we just got three dishes now and then

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:29.366
some more will be coming.

00:13:29.366 --> 00:13:33.222
What I need to do next is just
gather some of this garlic,

00:13:33.222 --> 00:13:36.906
and just take an entire forkful of garlic.

00:13:36.906 --> 00:13:40.922
Look at that, just caramelized, golden,

00:13:40.922 --> 00:13:43.755
yet half raw at the same time.

00:13:43.755 --> 00:13:46.588
(loud chattering)

00:13:51.882 --> 00:13:55.740
Garlic is just one of the
greatest culinary gems

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.847
of anything, ever.

00:13:57.847 --> 00:14:01.253
Next up, I am moving on to the crab claw.

00:14:01.253 --> 00:14:05.003
And they give you a mallet
and a little hitting board.

00:14:05.003 --> 00:14:05.836
(cracking softly)

00:14:05.836 --> 00:14:07.142
Oh, you don't even need it on this.

00:14:07.142 --> 00:14:09.725
Oh, that just popped right off.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:14.307
Oh, and this just pops right off too, oh.

00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:17.119
Okay, let me see if I can,

00:14:17.119 --> 00:14:20.177
oh no, I broke off the
little claw on the inside.

00:14:20.177 --> 00:14:23.555
Okay, I will come back for you later,

00:14:23.555 --> 00:14:25.202
but I have to eat the drumstick.

00:14:25.202 --> 00:14:26.437
Should I take this in one bite?

00:14:26.437 --> 00:14:27.999
Yes, I think I should.

00:14:27.999 --> 00:14:30.832
(loud chattering)

00:14:43.003 --> 00:14:43.836
Whoa.

00:14:47.286 --> 00:14:50.536
That is ridiculously flaky and stringy.

00:14:53.387 --> 00:14:54.637
That is insane.

00:14:56.883 --> 00:14:58.883
And what I love is that

00:15:00.397 --> 00:15:03.696
it's such good crab that
it doesn't need anything.

00:15:03.696 --> 00:15:07.054
I am already in a little
bit of a seafood shock

00:15:07.054 --> 00:15:09.060
and high right now,

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.507
but we're only halfway done
with this seafood meal.

00:15:11.507 --> 00:15:13.829
He has just brought the next course.

00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:16.401
This is, literally, the biggest prawn

00:15:16.401 --> 00:15:17.759
I've ever seen in my life.

00:15:17.759 --> 00:15:20.227
And I also ordered some scarlet prawns,

00:15:20.227 --> 00:15:22.271
but I thought these were
just gonna be little.

00:15:22.271 --> 00:15:24.084
These are gigantic as well.

00:15:24.084 --> 00:15:26.008
They're both huge!

00:15:26.008 --> 00:15:29.431
If I just come back over here
to this giant tiger prawn.

00:15:29.431 --> 00:15:32.495
To get a scale of this, I need
to put it up next to my face.

00:15:32.495 --> 00:15:34.162
Just check this out!

00:15:38.221 --> 00:15:41.888
This is almost as wide
as my shoulder torso.

00:15:43.152 --> 00:15:45.138
I'm gonna set this guy down.

00:15:45.138 --> 00:15:47.661
Guys, I'm in a little
bit of a shock right now.

00:15:47.661 --> 00:15:50.054
I don't even know if I can describe

00:15:50.054 --> 00:15:52.965
this with English right now.

00:15:52.965 --> 00:15:54.747
Look at this beauty!

00:15:54.747 --> 00:15:58.914
Wow, okay, I'm just gonna go
right into that mid-section.

00:16:00.266 --> 00:16:01.749
Is this grilled or is it, I don't know,

00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:04.081
but I think it's cooked in butter.

00:16:04.081 --> 00:16:05.203
Oh, wow.

00:16:05.203 --> 00:16:09.878
Oh, oh, yeah, I'm so happy I'm
using the knife upside-down,

00:16:09.878 --> 00:16:13.418
and I don't even have
the energy to change it.

00:16:13.418 --> 00:16:14.932
Oh, wow.

00:16:14.932 --> 00:16:16.852
Okay, that's a good
enough bite for my first.

00:16:16.852 --> 00:16:19.685
(loud chattering)

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.437
The firmness is insane!

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:33.343
It's so muscular, and
it's so juicy, again.

00:16:34.317 --> 00:16:36.168
And it's salty and buttery.

00:16:36.168 --> 00:16:40.116
Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and
peel off the entire shell,

00:16:40.116 --> 00:16:42.993
maybe take out the entire flesh part.

00:16:42.993 --> 00:16:46.828
And yeah, this would be
much easier with my fingers.

00:16:46.828 --> 00:16:47.661
Oh!

00:16:47.661 --> 00:16:52.522
(laughs) It's so meaty and so giant!

00:16:52.522 --> 00:16:55.279
This is just ridiculous how big it is.

00:16:55.279 --> 00:16:57.362
It's actually ridiculous.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.492
All right.

00:17:01.492 --> 00:17:02.325
Oh.

00:17:04.517 --> 00:17:06.684
Wow, this is unbelievable.

00:17:08.355 --> 00:17:11.013
And I will save that head for later.

00:17:11.013 --> 00:17:15.706
Just look at the size of
the flesh of that body.

00:17:15.706 --> 00:17:18.759
Okay, and then for this,
I think I'll squeeze out

00:17:18.759 --> 00:17:20.094
a little bit of lemon.

00:17:20.094 --> 00:17:23.705
(loud chattering)

00:17:23.705 --> 00:17:25.042
All right.

00:17:25.042 --> 00:17:28.740
(laughs) Look at that section!

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.881
That section, there
are gooey things in it,

00:17:30.881 --> 00:17:34.405
there are pieces of muscular flesh.

00:17:34.405 --> 00:17:37.238
(loud chattering)

00:17:46.748 --> 00:17:47.998
That is insane!

00:17:49.839 --> 00:17:52.006
It's buttery, it's creamy,

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:54.137
it's muscular,

00:17:55.299 --> 00:17:56.651
it's a little bit salty.

00:17:56.651 --> 00:18:00.530
I love it with that
squeeze of lemon on it.

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:02.540
That is actually unbelievable.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.827
I'm, like, at an emotional high right now.

00:18:05.827 --> 00:18:09.312
And just get one more
look at the outside shell

00:18:09.312 --> 00:18:10.710
of this guy.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:12.958
And he just brought out
the final seafood dish.

00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:16.047
I think it's the final one I ordered.

00:18:16.047 --> 00:18:18.671
And this is something I
have never had before.

00:18:18.671 --> 00:18:20.491
This is a type of barnacle,

00:18:20.491 --> 00:18:23.681
and I think they're
called goose barnacles.

00:18:23.681 --> 00:18:26.844
These are very interesting,
bizarre-looking.

00:18:26.844 --> 00:18:30.222
They kinda look like little animal hoofs,

00:18:30.222 --> 00:18:32.282
but you can actually see the algae,

00:18:32.282 --> 00:18:36.477
or some, like, green, something
seaweed growing off of them,

00:18:36.477 --> 00:18:38.599
the algae from them.

00:18:38.599 --> 00:18:39.810
These are very interesting.

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:42.383
I'm not even totally
sure how you eat them,

00:18:42.383 --> 00:18:44.726
but I think you sorta just nibble off,

00:18:44.726 --> 00:18:45.949
kinda break it apart,

00:18:45.949 --> 00:18:49.130
and just nibble off all
of that outside material.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.556
Oh, and when I squeeze
it, this juice runs out.

00:18:51.556 --> 00:18:54.326
The end portion kinda
feels like a fingernail,

00:18:54.326 --> 00:18:55.159
or like a hoof.

00:18:55.159 --> 00:18:58.518
Yeah, really kinda looks
and feels like a hoof.

00:18:58.518 --> 00:18:59.421
Okay.

00:18:59.421 --> 00:19:02.254
(loud chattering)

00:19:06.782 --> 00:19:07.615
Wow.

00:19:08.726 --> 00:19:10.643
That's very sandpapery,

00:19:11.786 --> 00:19:13.557
and very, like, leathery.

00:19:13.557 --> 00:19:17.724
It sorta gushes with, like,
sea water taste to it.

00:19:18.803 --> 00:19:21.636
(loud chattering)

00:19:27.488 --> 00:19:29.846
I think that's the part
you're supposed to eat.

00:19:29.846 --> 00:19:30.679
Oh.

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:33.507
Okay, that is pretty good.

00:19:33.507 --> 00:19:35.496
It does taste kind of like a clam,

00:19:35.496 --> 00:19:38.191
but a little more of a leathery clam.

00:19:38.191 --> 00:19:39.644
Okay, so I think you take that out,

00:19:39.644 --> 00:19:42.516
and you can kinda pry it open.

00:19:42.516 --> 00:19:45.450
Oh, I think that's how you open.

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:48.425
Okay, and what you want to eat
is that thing on the inside.

00:19:48.425 --> 00:19:51.033
Okay, a man, a nice man, family sitting

00:19:51.033 --> 00:19:54.787
at the table next to me was
motioning me how to eat it.

00:19:54.787 --> 00:19:55.620
There we go.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:57.297
And you wanna eat that
little piece on the inside.

00:19:57.297 --> 00:19:58.880
They just slip out.

00:19:59.765 --> 00:20:00.973
Oh, yeah.

00:20:00.973 --> 00:20:04.793
Moving on to my last prawn,
and this is a scarlet prawn.

00:20:04.793 --> 00:20:07.880
(loud chattering)

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.307
And I honestly thought
these were just gonna be

00:20:09.307 --> 00:20:11.088
the little, small prawns,

00:20:11.088 --> 00:20:14.421
but these are just insanely huge as well,

00:20:14.421 --> 00:20:16.715
in that deep red color.

00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:20.514
I'm gonna delicately try
to break off the head,

00:20:20.514 --> 00:20:23.270
maybe in his natural, oh no!

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:26.266
Oh, juice just came out. (laughs)

00:20:26.266 --> 00:20:29.191
Okay, maybe turn it this way?

00:20:29.191 --> 00:20:31.564
I wanna preserve all of that head juice.

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:34.528
Oh no, it is just falling
out onto the plate.

00:20:34.528 --> 00:20:38.846
I don't think there's any way
to hold it in that little cup.

00:20:38.846 --> 00:20:40.004
(cracking softly)

00:20:40.004 --> 00:20:40.837
Oh, wow.

00:20:41.821 --> 00:20:46.417
(laughs) There's a pool of shrimp head fat

00:20:46.417 --> 00:20:47.994
on the bottom of my plate.

00:20:47.994 --> 00:20:49.813
Just from peeling this,

00:20:49.813 --> 00:20:52.646
I can feel how soft this prawn is.

00:20:53.558 --> 00:20:55.907
Oh, and little pieces, slivers,

00:20:55.907 --> 00:20:59.208
like strings of the prawn, are coming off

00:20:59.208 --> 00:21:02.388
in the shell, which I will
have to come back and lick.

00:21:02.388 --> 00:21:03.221
(cracking softly)

00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:05.816
But you can feel, just, the
juices seeping out of this prawn

00:21:05.816 --> 00:21:07.316
as I'm peeling it.

00:21:08.841 --> 00:21:11.365
I'm gonna leave it at that.

00:21:11.365 --> 00:21:14.063
This is not only a giant prawn,

00:21:14.063 --> 00:21:16.577
but you can actually see, like, the veins,

00:21:16.577 --> 00:21:19.470
and just strings running through it.

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:20.454
Wow!

00:21:20.454 --> 00:21:23.287
(loud chattering)

00:21:28.031 --> 00:21:28.864
Wow!

00:21:34.123 --> 00:21:37.873
While the tiger prawn
was meaty and muscular,

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:41.160
this is melt in your mouth.

00:21:42.126 --> 00:21:43.576
You don't even need to chew it.

00:21:43.576 --> 00:21:45.032
A baby could eat this prawn.

00:21:45.032 --> 00:21:47.773
It's so soft and so tender,

00:21:47.773 --> 00:21:49.440
and so juicy, again.

00:21:51.459 --> 00:21:55.626
This will actually make you
go insane, it's so good.

00:21:56.566 --> 00:21:59.267
Like, I didn't even need to use my teeth

00:21:59.267 --> 00:22:00.139
to chew that.

00:22:00.139 --> 00:22:02.677
I literally chewed with my gums.

00:22:02.677 --> 00:22:05.510
(loud chattering)

00:22:13.038 --> 00:22:14.461
I don't even wanna chew.

00:22:14.461 --> 00:22:16.877
I just wanna tuck it
into the side of my cheek

00:22:16.877 --> 00:22:19.460
and let it slowly disintegrate.

00:22:22.639 --> 00:22:24.523
That deserves a moment of silence.

00:22:24.523 --> 00:22:27.541
Thank you. (speaking in foreign language)

00:22:27.541 --> 00:22:30.374
(loud chattering)

00:22:46.693 --> 00:22:49.905
The only thing greater
than having these oysters

00:22:49.905 --> 00:22:52.488
is having Nuno feed them to me.

00:22:53.445 --> 00:22:56.745
I'm gonna go ahead and clean
off all of that barnacle juice

00:22:56.745 --> 00:22:59.926
from my hands in preparation for dessert.

00:22:59.926 --> 00:23:02.759
(loud chattering)

00:23:04.546 --> 00:23:07.726
Oh, refreshing, lemony, lemony refreshing.

00:23:07.726 --> 00:23:10.318
If my adjectives and my
words and my descriptions

00:23:10.318 --> 00:23:12.615
don't completely line up correctly,

00:23:12.615 --> 00:23:13.829
that's because I'm a little bit

00:23:13.829 --> 00:23:16.509
seafood-intoxicated right now.

00:23:16.509 --> 00:23:18.394
I'm not huge on desserts.

00:23:18.394 --> 00:23:20.742
I don't like sweets very much,

00:23:20.742 --> 00:23:24.251
but this is one dessert that I cannot wait

00:23:24.251 --> 00:23:25.468
to dig into.

00:23:25.468 --> 00:23:28.641
What you have to eat for
dessert when you come to Ramiro

00:23:28.641 --> 00:23:32.076
is the prego, which is a steak sandwich.

00:23:32.076 --> 00:23:34.672
Oh, and it is hot and fresh and warm.

00:23:34.672 --> 00:23:37.622
Oh, you can feel the
tenderness of that bread.

00:23:37.622 --> 00:23:39.338
And you open it up.

00:23:39.338 --> 00:23:42.245
Oh, it's filled with steak!

00:23:42.245 --> 00:23:43.506
Oh, and that beautiful pink,

00:23:43.506 --> 00:23:45.901
oh, and you can see how the
juices have already soaked

00:23:45.901 --> 00:23:47.200
into the bread.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.460
But I absolutely wish you guys could feel

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.704
the softness of the bread.

00:23:52.704 --> 00:23:55.889
It literally feels like a feather pillow.

00:23:55.889 --> 00:23:58.722
(loud chattering)

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:08.287
This is a dessert to cherish.

00:24:09.467 --> 00:24:11.300
That beef is so tender

00:24:12.156 --> 00:24:14.489
and the bread is so pillowy!

00:24:15.436 --> 00:24:16.445
That is absolutely amazing,

00:24:16.445 --> 00:24:18.496
but I think I will add
a little bit of mustard.

00:24:18.496 --> 00:24:20.572
Okay, and as I took off that bread,

00:24:20.572 --> 00:24:22.068
that is another reason why it's so good.

00:24:22.068 --> 00:24:24.539
It's topped with more garlic.

00:24:24.539 --> 00:24:26.699
I love their use of
garlic at this restaurant.

00:24:26.699 --> 00:24:29.532
(loud chattering)

00:24:31.208 --> 00:24:33.375
Okay, that should be good.

00:24:38.982 --> 00:24:42.839
That beef is incredible,
and the whole combination,

00:24:42.839 --> 00:24:45.847
I can't even think of a better way

00:24:45.847 --> 00:24:48.520
to have ended such a meal.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.780
They know what they're doing here.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.947
That was a stunner of a sandwich
after a stunner of a meal.

00:24:56.199 --> 00:24:57.318
All I can literally do right now

00:24:57.318 --> 00:24:59.735
is just sit back in my chair.

00:25:01.372 --> 00:25:04.364
I'm even trying to just
comprehend that meal.

00:25:04.364 --> 00:25:05.992
It was so good.

00:25:05.992 --> 00:25:07.676
- [Nuno] Ice cream and lemon.

00:25:07.676 --> 00:25:09.345
- [Mark] Ice cream and lemon.
- [Nuno] And vodka.

00:25:09.345 --> 00:25:10.614
- And vodka!

00:25:10.614 --> 00:25:13.653
But there's one more dessert
that Nuno has just given me.

00:25:13.653 --> 00:25:17.246
I was honestly not expecting this at all.

00:25:17.246 --> 00:25:18.829
Okay, gotta eat it.

00:25:19.733 --> 00:25:22.221
Wow, that is like a slushy ice cream.

00:25:22.221 --> 00:25:25.054
(loud chattering)

00:25:27.067 --> 00:25:27.900
Wow!

00:25:29.727 --> 00:25:32.154
That is lemon ice cream,

00:25:32.154 --> 00:25:34.548
oh, but wonderful lemon.

00:25:34.548 --> 00:25:37.568
That is, like, yogurty and icy,

00:25:37.568 --> 00:25:41.556
and rich and creamy, and,
like, freshly lemony.

00:25:41.556 --> 00:25:43.873
Oh, and with that splash of vodka,

00:25:43.873 --> 00:25:46.613
that is awesome, actually.

00:25:46.613 --> 00:25:51.385
That's really good, that's like
a complete palate cleanser.

00:25:51.385 --> 00:25:55.162
Ying and I just managed
to spend 2-1/2 hours

00:25:55.162 --> 00:25:58.104
at that restaurant, enjoying the food.

00:25:58.104 --> 00:26:01.520
That was, literally, one
of the finest seafood meals

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.653
I've ever had in my entire life.

00:26:03.653 --> 00:26:05.707
Everything was delicious.

00:26:05.707 --> 00:26:08.560
The variety of prawns were just insane.

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.704
The staff were friendly, shoutout to Nuno,

00:26:10.704 --> 00:26:11.710
who was our waiter.

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:14.606
That is a seafood paradise in Lisbon.

00:26:14.606 --> 00:26:16.806
And I think for the
remainder of the afternoon,

00:26:16.806 --> 00:26:19.451
we're just gonna walk around the center,

00:26:19.451 --> 00:26:21.368
kind of coastline area.

00:26:22.619 --> 00:26:25.786
(bright mellow music)

00:26:28.135 --> 00:26:30.184
Before we get all the way down
to the bottom of the hill,

00:26:30.184 --> 00:26:32.751
we're gonna make a stop
at the Lisbon Cathedral.

00:26:32.751 --> 00:26:35.910
(bright mellow music)

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:40.254
This is the original, one
of the oldest cathedrals

00:26:40.254 --> 00:26:41.087
in Lisbon.

00:26:42.033 --> 00:26:44.048
Construction was started in 1147,

00:26:44.048 --> 00:26:45.936
and it has been taken
over a number of times

00:26:45.936 --> 00:26:47.743
by different civilizations,

00:26:47.743 --> 00:26:52.232
but it remains one of the
ultimate landmarks of Lisbon.

00:26:52.232 --> 00:26:54.056
I'm gonna go inside for a quick look.

00:26:54.056 --> 00:26:57.238
The entranceway to this cathedral is huge!

00:26:57.238 --> 00:26:59.454
And what you really notice
about this cathedral

00:26:59.454 --> 00:27:03.621
is how thick the pillars and
the columns and the walls are.

00:27:05.006 --> 00:27:09.276
I think it started off as a
Romanesque architectural design,

00:27:09.276 --> 00:27:14.061
but since it's been through
so many civilizations,

00:27:14.061 --> 00:27:15.253
other parts have been added,

00:27:15.253 --> 00:27:17.731
so I know it has some
Gothic elements to it,

00:27:17.731 --> 00:27:21.006
as well as some Baroque elements to it.

00:27:21.006 --> 00:27:23.461
So, it's a mix of architectural styles.

00:27:23.461 --> 00:27:26.628
(bright mellow music)

00:27:33.823 --> 00:27:38.288
We made it to the central
Comercio district of Lisbon

00:27:38.288 --> 00:27:42.455
and we are now walking up
to the Arc de Rua Augusta.

00:27:43.777 --> 00:27:47.562
And it was built in 1755 to
commemorate the reconstruction

00:27:47.562 --> 00:27:51.060
of Lisbon after a major, major earthquake.

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:54.227
(bright mellow music)

00:27:59.276 --> 00:28:01.792
After already seeing
this plaza multiple times

00:28:01.792 --> 00:28:04.278
from different lookout points,
we have finally made it

00:28:04.278 --> 00:28:05.585
on the ground level here.

00:28:05.585 --> 00:28:08.575
This is the Praca do Comercio,

00:28:08.575 --> 00:28:11.087
and it used to be the site of a palace

00:28:11.087 --> 00:28:14.689
until the palace was
destroyed in an earthquake

00:28:14.689 --> 00:28:15.824
several hundred years ago,

00:28:15.824 --> 00:28:18.255
and then it was made into a plaza.

00:28:18.255 --> 00:28:22.654
It is an open space, a big
communal public gathering area,

00:28:22.654 --> 00:28:26.661
and we're gonna go see
the Tagus River up close

00:28:26.661 --> 00:28:27.598
for the first time.

00:28:27.598 --> 00:28:30.181
(upbeat music)

00:28:46.642 --> 00:28:49.438
And now, we have decided
to take the Metro,

00:28:49.438 --> 00:28:53.257
and we are en route to go
have what is, hopefully,

00:28:53.257 --> 00:28:56.120
some of the best Piri
Piri Chicken in Lisbon.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.703
(upbeat music)

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:04.875
We just got off the Metro at Rato Station.

00:29:04.875 --> 00:29:07.458
(upbeat music)

00:29:10.965 --> 00:29:12.750
We arrived to the restaurant
right across the street.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:15.667
It's called Frangasqueira Nacional,

00:29:16.735 --> 00:29:19.779
and they are famous for
their Piri Piri Chicken.

00:29:19.779 --> 00:29:21.517
There's a line outside,
but I think it's only

00:29:21.517 --> 00:29:22.598
a takeaway restaurant.

00:29:22.598 --> 00:29:24.928
I don't think they have
any seats in there,

00:29:24.928 --> 00:29:26.221
so we're gonna get takeaway.

00:29:26.221 --> 00:29:27.580
I'm not sure how long it's gonna take,

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:30.241
but I think it's gonna be worth it.

00:29:30.241 --> 00:29:34.043
Every now and then, I will get
a whiff of the grilling smoke

00:29:34.043 --> 00:29:35.404
coming out of the door.

00:29:35.404 --> 00:29:36.867
Smells fantastic.

00:29:36.867 --> 00:29:41.034
(sizzling)
(speaking in foreign language)

00:30:09.303 --> 00:30:10.136
- [Woman] Thank you.

00:30:10.136 --> 00:30:10.969
- [Mark] Thank you. (speaking
in foreign language)

00:30:10.969 --> 00:30:12.809
- [Woman] Bye. (speaking
in foreign language)

00:30:12.809 --> 00:30:14.562
Enjoy (mumbles).
- Thank you.

00:30:14.562 --> 00:30:16.836
That wait took about 30 minutes,

00:30:16.836 --> 00:30:19.034
but as soon as I stepped inside,

00:30:19.034 --> 00:30:21.701
that aroma of the grilling meat,

00:30:23.971 --> 00:30:27.315
I probably have some drool
coming down my cheek.

00:30:27.315 --> 00:30:30.023
And she said there's a
park just down the road.

00:30:30.023 --> 00:30:31.706
I found a spot where I'm gonna eat

00:30:31.706 --> 00:30:34.084
and there's a garden right behind me,

00:30:34.084 --> 00:30:38.111
but it's kinda dark and shady,
so the light is better here,

00:30:38.111 --> 00:30:40.862
'cause I wanna take some
photos of this chicken.

00:30:40.862 --> 00:30:43.394
I got an order of potato chips.

00:30:43.394 --> 00:30:45.398
These are fresh potato chips.

00:30:45.398 --> 00:30:48.315
And then I also got a tomato salad,

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:53.028
which looks fantastic, with
some onions and oregano in it.

00:30:53.028 --> 00:30:55.469
Oh, and it's hot and fresh.

00:30:55.469 --> 00:30:57.964
I think these are the ribs,

00:30:57.964 --> 00:31:02.075
and then also, I had
to get a whole chicken.

00:31:02.075 --> 00:31:02.908
Oh, yes.

00:31:03.944 --> 00:31:07.636
Okay, we just gotta take a
look at the chicken first.

00:31:07.636 --> 00:31:09.062
Oh!

00:31:09.062 --> 00:31:11.297
Oh, a little cloud of steam just came out!

00:31:11.297 --> 00:31:13.687
I, literally, did not
wanna take another step

00:31:13.687 --> 00:31:15.347
before trying this chicken.

00:31:15.347 --> 00:31:17.354
Oh, and which piece?

00:31:17.354 --> 00:31:19.352
Okay, this piece right here on the top.

00:31:19.352 --> 00:31:23.519
This is a piece of the
breast with some of the wing.

00:31:26.621 --> 00:31:27.871
That's awesome!

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:32.059
It's so smoky, and, like, charred.

00:31:32.059 --> 00:31:34.642
(wind blowing)

00:31:38.633 --> 00:31:40.229
(moaning satisfactorily)

00:31:40.229 --> 00:31:43.178
Oh, and that's a combination of the oils

00:31:43.178 --> 00:31:44.888
and the juices of the chicken,

00:31:44.888 --> 00:31:47.207
plus all that sauce that he brushed on.

00:31:47.207 --> 00:31:51.374
You have to have a close-up
look at that skin and that char.

00:31:53.703 --> 00:31:55.051
(dog barking)

00:31:55.051 --> 00:31:58.415
Oh, the drumstick is so
juicy, packed with flavor.

00:31:58.415 --> 00:31:59.248
(moaning satisfactorily)

00:31:59.248 --> 00:32:01.915
And I think the potato chips
have some oregano on them.

00:32:01.915 --> 00:32:03.932
(potato chip crunching)

00:32:03.932 --> 00:32:06.189
Mm, yeah, that's oregano.

00:32:06.189 --> 00:32:07.819
And you can taste that they're homemade.

00:32:07.819 --> 00:32:09.978
That just has such a big difference

00:32:09.978 --> 00:32:11.807
from packaged potato chips.

00:32:11.807 --> 00:32:15.300
Next up are the ribs, and I
think I got the same sauce

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.050
drenched all over it.

00:32:21.283 --> 00:32:23.911
I can really taste the
chili oil on this one.

00:32:23.911 --> 00:32:25.411
That chili oil is,

00:32:26.693 --> 00:32:29.061
it's just a little bit spicy,

00:32:29.061 --> 00:32:31.920
but yeah, it has so much chili flavor.

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:34.155
Oh, yeah, and again, that oregano,

00:32:34.155 --> 00:32:36.488
that oregano is really good.

00:32:37.916 --> 00:32:40.673
And then, again, that oregano.

00:32:40.673 --> 00:32:42.398
And there are just a few onions.

00:32:42.398 --> 00:32:46.438
I think she put olive oil
and lemon, or maybe vinegar

00:32:46.438 --> 00:32:48.277
in here as well, so I
wanna take from the bottom,

00:32:48.277 --> 00:32:50.110
as that has gone down.

00:32:52.978 --> 00:32:55.962
(moaning satisfactorily)

00:32:55.962 --> 00:32:58.903
Really fresh and juicy plump tomatoes,

00:32:58.903 --> 00:33:01.986
and then the oregano comes in nicely.

00:33:05.801 --> 00:33:06.936
(potato chip crunching)

00:33:06.936 --> 00:33:08.153
I didn't finish it yet.

00:33:08.153 --> 00:33:10.849
I just wanted to eat a
couple of drumsticks.

00:33:10.849 --> 00:33:11.968
And actually, we packed it back up

00:33:11.968 --> 00:33:13.781
and Ying and I are gonna
go back to the hotel

00:33:13.781 --> 00:33:16.889
and finish it off, 'cause
it's getting cold out here.

00:33:16.889 --> 00:33:19.007
It's actually really cold,
just like this morning.

00:33:19.007 --> 00:33:20.732
So, I'm gonna end the vlog for today now.

00:33:20.732 --> 00:33:22.657
Thank you all very much for watching.

00:33:22.657 --> 00:33:24.272

And Lisbon is just an outstanding city.

00:33:32.985 --> 00:33:37.040
It's a beautiful city, fantastic culture

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.040
and mix of art and food.

00:33:40.437 --> 00:33:43.403
It's just a great place and I am loving

00:33:43.403 --> 00:33:45.440
this Lisbon trip so far.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.423
I will see you on the next video.

00:33:47.423 --> 00:33:48.256
(beeping)

00:33:48.256 --> 00:33:49.434
Good morning, everyone, it's Mark Wienz

00:33:49.434 --> 00:33:51.684
with migrationology.com in,

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:55.489
where are we? (laughs)

00:33:55.489 --> 00:33:56.355
- [Ying] Portugal.

00:33:56.355 --> 00:33:58.151
