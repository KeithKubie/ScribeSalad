00:00:00.441 --> 00:00:03.858
(whoosh, click and beep)

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:14.649
- Dr. Joseph Sullivan has spoken

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:17.830
at our conference before,
although it's been too long,

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.810
so welcome back.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.589
Dr. Sullivan is the director of the

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:24.448
UCSF Pediatric Epilepsy Center

00:00:24.448 --> 00:00:26.619
and associate professor of neurology

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.889
and of pediatrics.

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:30.889
Good morning.
- Morning.

00:00:32.827 --> 00:00:33.919
Thank you for having me.

00:00:33.919 --> 00:00:37.097
I was thrilled to be able to come back

00:00:37.097 --> 00:00:39.387
because there actually have been a lot of,

00:00:39.387 --> 00:00:41.117
I think it was four years
ago, there's actually

00:00:41.117 --> 00:00:43.867
been a lot of developments in the

00:00:45.308 --> 00:00:46.559
pediatric epilepsy space.

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.229
A lot of that has focused on genetics.

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:52.001
You'd have to probably be living in a hole

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:53.911
to have not heard about medical marijuana

00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:56.230
and its implications (laughs).

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.340
I have a few slides about some of the data

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.092
at the end of this talk.

00:01:01.092 --> 00:01:03.842
When I was first asked to come back,

00:01:03.842 --> 00:01:08.170
I was asked to speak
about atypical seizures.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.451
I think that's kind of a broad term.

00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:14.710
I think a lot of caregivers
and medical providers,

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.073
when they think about seizures,

00:01:16.073 --> 00:01:18.880
maybe the first type of seizure that jumps

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.300
to their mind is a grand mal seizure

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.872
or a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.

00:01:22.872 --> 00:01:25.324
I often, when we're
teaching our residents,

00:01:25.324 --> 00:01:27.486
try to tell them that that is actually

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:30.696
only one of many different seizure types.

00:01:30.696 --> 00:01:33.019
It shouldn't be an alliteration word.

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:34.692
When we get the call from the ER,

00:01:34.692 --> 00:01:36.486
well, what type of seizure was it?

00:01:36.486 --> 00:01:39.280
Generally, a tonic-clonic seizure.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.910
I think that with detailed
video EEG monitoring

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.947
and being able to take
care of a whole host

00:01:44.947 --> 00:01:47.332
of different patients really allows us

00:01:47.332 --> 00:01:50.225
to phenotype, so describe
the different types

00:01:50.225 --> 00:01:52.568
of seizures that we can see across

00:01:52.568 --> 00:01:54.140
different patient populations,

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.936
and certainly in children
and in young adults

00:01:56.936 --> 00:01:59.433
with developmental disabilities.

00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:00.557
We do know that these different

00:02:00.557 --> 00:02:01.982
seizure types can occur.

00:02:01.982 --> 00:02:02.815
With that,

00:02:05.682 --> 00:02:07.432
here is the overview.

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.809
I just wanna do a very cursory overview

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:14.934
of the incidence of epilepsy in children.

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:17.273
I then wanna just talk about, I could do

00:02:17.273 --> 00:02:18.947
a one-hour talk on each of these single

00:02:18.947 --> 00:02:20.838
seizure types, but sort of hit on a couple

00:02:20.838 --> 00:02:24.273
of the common syndromes that we see

00:02:24.273 --> 00:02:26.888
in children and young adults with

00:02:26.888 --> 00:02:28.848
developmental disability.

00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:30.630
I wanna talk a little bit about the impact

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.959
of genetics and the era
of whole exome sequencing.

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.795
I certainly was one of those that said,

00:02:36.795 --> 00:02:39.611
"Oh, yeah, genetic testing is interesting,

00:02:39.611 --> 00:02:41.427
"but right now it doesn't
actually translate

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:43.847
"into any changes in our management,"

00:02:43.847 --> 00:02:45.267
but that is changing, and it's likely

00:02:45.267 --> 00:02:48.953
gonna be, continue to change in the next

00:02:48.953 --> 00:02:49.965
five to 10 years.

00:02:49.965 --> 00:02:52.021
Then I'll talk about some of the

00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:54.143
emerging treatment options.

00:02:54.143 --> 00:02:55.498
These are my disclosures.

00:02:55.498 --> 00:02:58.499
I am involved with a couple
of pharmaceutical companies

00:02:58.499 --> 00:02:59.623
that are actually investigating

00:02:59.623 --> 00:03:01.161
some of these novel compounds for some

00:03:01.161 --> 00:03:03.744
of the rare genetic epilepsies.

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:06.312
Just some simple definitions.

00:03:06.312 --> 00:03:07.324
What is a seizure?

00:03:07.324 --> 00:03:09.523
There are actually
three-hour-long symposia

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:11.021
at the American Epilepsy Society meeting

00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:12.164
about what is a seizure.

00:03:12.164 --> 00:03:13.826
This is still debated,
but for our purposes,

00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:15.884
I think we can come to an agreement

00:03:15.884 --> 00:03:18.866
that it's a transient occurrence of signs

00:03:18.866 --> 00:03:21.912
and/or symptoms due to
an abnormal, excessive

00:03:21.912 --> 00:03:24.683
or synchronous neuronal
activity in the brain.

00:03:24.683 --> 00:03:26.675
This is what we spend
all of our time doing,

00:03:26.675 --> 00:03:29.150
looking at EEGs and videos to see

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.535
what's the first thing that happened.

00:03:30.535 --> 00:03:31.568
Did the right arm move?

00:03:31.568 --> 00:03:32.537
Did the left arm move?

00:03:32.537 --> 00:03:34.079
Did the head turn to the side?

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.331
'Cause that allows us to look back

00:03:35.331 --> 00:03:36.895
at our neuroanatomy and have some type

00:03:36.895 --> 00:03:38.555
of hypothesis as where that seizure

00:03:38.555 --> 00:03:40.206
is actually starting.

00:03:40.206 --> 00:03:41.855
As opposed to epilepsy.

00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:43.757
Again, this is debated and the definitions

00:03:43.757 --> 00:03:47.125
are changing, is still simply defined

00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:49.500
as two or more unprovoked seizures

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.547
greater than 24 hours apart.

00:03:51.547 --> 00:03:53.241
People debate this because what happens

00:03:53.241 --> 00:03:54.748
when someone has a seizure, and then

00:03:54.748 --> 00:03:56.575
five years later has their second seizure?

00:03:56.575 --> 00:03:59.391
Does that patient have epilepsy?

00:03:59.391 --> 00:04:01.964
Chief Justice John
Roberts, he has epilepsy

00:04:01.964 --> 00:04:03.700
'cause that's actually happened to him.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.450
I would say yes.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.123
Most of the patients that I treat,

00:04:07.123 --> 00:04:09.368
it doesn't become that nuanced because

00:04:09.368 --> 00:04:12.261
the kids are often
having frequent seizures.

00:04:12.261 --> 00:04:16.088
Then this is an expansion
of the definition.

00:04:16.088 --> 00:04:18.640
Having one unprovoked seizure.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.280
The probability of having a second seizure

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.240
being equivalent to if you already had

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.928
a second seizure, which is
generally around the 60%.

00:04:26.928 --> 00:04:29.786
There's a trend towards
actually giving someone

00:04:29.786 --> 00:04:32.424
a diagnosis of epilepsy at that point.

00:04:32.424 --> 00:04:34.933
Now, we can debate
whether or not we should

00:04:34.933 --> 00:04:37.749
actually intervene and start treating

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:41.488
in that scenario of someone
who has a single seizure,

00:04:41.488 --> 00:04:44.812
has a high increased
risk of a second seizure.

00:04:44.812 --> 00:04:46.461
Do we actually treat?

00:04:46.461 --> 00:04:49.484
My personal practice is that I don't

00:04:49.484 --> 00:04:51.663
because we still don't know when

00:04:51.663 --> 00:04:53.280
that second seizure may be.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.578
The example that I just brought up,

00:04:54.578 --> 00:04:56.348
it may be five years.

00:04:56.348 --> 00:04:58.055
In that scenario, you've exposed someone

00:04:58.055 --> 00:05:01.606
to a medication for five
years unnecessarily.

00:05:01.606 --> 00:05:03.183
If it happens within the next few months,

00:05:03.183 --> 00:05:05.808
then I think it's
actually pretty clear that

00:05:05.808 --> 00:05:07.921
that tempo of having a
seizure every few months

00:05:07.921 --> 00:05:10.085
warrants intervention.

00:05:10.085 --> 00:05:11.870
Then diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.115
What is an epilepsy syndrome?

00:05:13.115 --> 00:05:15.782
This is the other academic topic

00:05:17.263 --> 00:05:18.635
that we get really excited about.

00:05:18.635 --> 00:05:20.925
If we can take someone that walks into

00:05:20.925 --> 00:05:24.015
our clinic with a diagnosis of spells,

00:05:24.015 --> 00:05:25.752
and then have them leave with a diagnosis

00:05:25.752 --> 00:05:27.237
of an epilepsy syndrome
so that they actually

00:05:27.237 --> 00:05:30.439
have a more specific label that they

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:32.772
can put on their diagnosis,

00:05:33.814 --> 00:05:35.927
not only does that actually help inform

00:05:35.927 --> 00:05:39.520
treatment and prognosis,
but as I'll show you

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.341
in a couple of slides,
I think it really helps

00:05:43.341 --> 00:05:45.790
families reach out to other

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.938
disease-specific organizations so that

00:05:47.938 --> 00:05:49.105
they know that

00:05:50.458 --> 00:05:53.098
they can have support from other people

00:05:53.098 --> 00:05:55.167
who are dealing with
similar types of seizures

00:05:55.167 --> 00:05:57.039
and comorbidities.

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:58.593
What is an epilepsy syndrome?

00:05:58.593 --> 00:06:00.876
It's a complex of signs and symptoms

00:06:00.876 --> 00:06:02.596
that define a unique epilepsy condition

00:06:02.596 --> 00:06:03.739
with different etiologies.

00:06:03.739 --> 00:06:05.815
The three pillars that go into determining

00:06:05.815 --> 00:06:09.020
the epilepsy syndrome
are the age of onset,

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.416
so very different if someone presents

00:06:10.416 --> 00:06:13.091
at six months of age as
opposed to six years of age,

00:06:13.091 --> 00:06:16.312
the seizure type and then the EEG pattern.

00:06:16.312 --> 00:06:18.477
Again, this is what we do in comprehensive

00:06:18.477 --> 00:06:20.689
epilepsy centers, is
rather than just giving

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:22.803
someone the diagnosis of seizure disorder,

00:06:22.803 --> 00:06:24.624
which I hate that term, seizure disorder.

00:06:24.624 --> 00:06:25.475
It tells us nothing.

00:06:25.475 --> 00:06:27.301
People who have,

00:06:27.301 --> 00:06:28.993
don't have heart rhythm disorders, right?

00:06:28.993 --> 00:06:31.666
They have specific cardiac arrhythmias.

00:06:31.666 --> 00:06:34.945
We like to be able to be very accurate

00:06:34.945 --> 00:06:37.028
in our seizure diagnosis.

00:06:38.171 --> 00:06:39.784
Lastly, this term, semiology.

00:06:39.784 --> 00:06:41.952
I'm gonna show you a
few seizure videos here.

00:06:41.952 --> 00:06:44.669
The semiology are all of the nuances

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:47.669
that happen prior, the onset, during

00:06:49.522 --> 00:06:51.556
and after the seizure that allow us

00:06:51.556 --> 00:06:55.723
to put a label, other than
generalized tonic-clonic.

00:06:56.956 --> 00:06:58.264
How about epilepsy in children

00:06:58.264 --> 00:07:00.301
with intellectual disability?

00:07:00.301 --> 00:07:01.974
This is an old paper,

00:07:01.974 --> 00:07:03.922
but epilepsy's common.

00:07:03.922 --> 00:07:05.559
Even in the general
population, it's estimated

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:07.903
to be about 1% of the population.

00:07:07.903 --> 00:07:11.300
But it has a five-fold increase

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.039
in prevalence in those with
intellectual disability.

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:15.680
When you look at the severity

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.373
on intellectual disability, you can see

00:07:17.373 --> 00:07:20.310
there's a range here, but if one has mild

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.532
through the spectrum of
severe, the incidence

00:07:22.532 --> 00:07:24.388
of epilepsy does increase as the severity

00:07:24.388 --> 00:07:28.793
of the intellectual
disability also increases.

00:07:28.793 --> 00:07:29.904
Why?

00:07:29.904 --> 00:07:31.123
Why is that?

00:07:31.123 --> 00:07:34.073
Well, I don't think we actually know.

00:07:34.073 --> 00:07:35.953
I think the genetics here are, hopefully,

00:07:35.953 --> 00:07:37.777
gonna shed a little
bit more light on that.

00:07:37.777 --> 00:07:40.558
But when I explain this to parents,

00:07:40.558 --> 00:07:43.968
I basically say epilepsy
simply is a disorder

00:07:43.968 --> 00:07:45.737
of brain function.

00:07:45.737 --> 00:07:48.039
Development and cognition in a child,

00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:52.053
in a developing brain, rely
on normal brain function.

00:07:52.053 --> 00:07:56.484
Because development is
not a static process,

00:07:56.484 --> 00:07:58.919
you can imagine that someone who is prone

00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:00.446
to having seizures as a result of a

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:02.748
functional disorder of
their brain may also

00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:06.915
be prone to having abnormal
development over time.

00:08:08.739 --> 00:08:11.173
This is one of the joys and frustrations

00:08:11.173 --> 00:08:12.006
of my job.

00:08:15.254 --> 00:08:16.939
Yes, adults, your brain is still changing,

00:08:16.939 --> 00:08:19.207
but hopefully we would
all agree, when we have

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:22.088
a newborn that then becomes an infant

00:08:22.088 --> 00:08:25.356
and then a sassy teenager, a lotta stuff

00:08:25.356 --> 00:08:28.379
happens there in the brain.

00:08:28.379 --> 00:08:29.997
It is a moving target.

00:08:29.997 --> 00:08:32.067
We can have instances where there's either

00:08:32.067 --> 00:08:34.321
a genetic abnormality, a structural

00:08:34.321 --> 00:08:36.409
brain abnormality, that is present

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.832
in the newborn, period, but may actually

00:08:38.832 --> 00:08:41.109
not be symptomatic until later on.

00:08:41.109 --> 00:08:44.942
We have to be prepared
to re-evaluate children

00:08:46.188 --> 00:08:50.082
as they mature because their seizure types

00:08:50.082 --> 00:08:51.172
may change.

00:08:51.172 --> 00:08:54.011
That may actually dictate a
change in their treatment.

00:08:54.011 --> 00:08:55.615
Just a little vignette here.

00:08:55.615 --> 00:08:56.696
You have a child who comes in with

00:08:56.696 --> 00:08:58.247
new onset infantile spasms.

00:08:58.247 --> 00:08:59.668
I'm gonna show you a video of this.

00:08:59.668 --> 00:09:01.175
We do brain MRI, which is pretty much

00:09:01.175 --> 00:09:02.341
standard of care now.

00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:05.405
It shows a developmental
brain malformation.

00:09:05.405 --> 00:09:08.437
That patient is treated and does well.

00:09:08.437 --> 00:09:10.219
Spasms respond, and this
child is seizure free

00:09:10.219 --> 00:09:11.573
for a few years.

00:09:11.573 --> 00:09:13.385
But then later, that child develops

00:09:13.385 --> 00:09:16.148
a new type of seizure,
tonic and atonic seizures,

00:09:16.148 --> 00:09:17.687
which, again, I'm gonna show you.

00:09:17.687 --> 00:09:21.439
Now this is a diagnosis of
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

00:09:21.439 --> 00:09:23.166
Then we treat Lennox-Gastaut syndrome

00:09:23.166 --> 00:09:25.947
with very different types of medications.

00:09:25.947 --> 00:09:27.993
It's unusual to be able to get someone

00:09:27.993 --> 00:09:31.128
with Lennox-Gastaut
syndrome truly seizure free,

00:09:31.128 --> 00:09:33.249
but then as that child becomes an adult

00:09:33.249 --> 00:09:36.429
and ends up in my adult
epilepsy colleague's clinic,

00:09:36.429 --> 00:09:38.520
then they actually may just look like

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.635
they have treatment-resistant
complex partial seizures.

00:09:42.635 --> 00:09:44.801
I think my adult epilepsy colleagues

00:09:44.801 --> 00:09:46.640
have a really difficult job because

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.772
these patients show up.

00:09:48.772 --> 00:09:50.886
Unless you go back or they've come

00:09:50.886 --> 00:09:52.798
from their pediatric
colleagues and you have

00:09:52.798 --> 00:09:55.548
the nice longitudinal documentation

00:09:55.548 --> 00:09:58.465
of all the different
seizure types, you may not

00:09:58.465 --> 00:10:00.576
appropriately diagnose
someone in adulthood

00:10:00.576 --> 00:10:03.634
unless you go back and understand how

00:10:03.634 --> 00:10:06.052
their seizures presented
and how it evolved

00:10:06.052 --> 00:10:06.885
over time.

00:10:08.802 --> 00:10:10.112
Onto a few videos here.

00:10:10.112 --> 00:10:11.817
Infantile spasms.

00:10:11.817 --> 00:10:13.632
Here's a cute little baby.

00:10:13.632 --> 00:10:14.974
Let's just play this
video for those of you

00:10:14.974 --> 00:10:16.391
who haven't seen.

00:10:17.582 --> 00:10:20.211
What you'll see, awake,
alert, interactive,

00:10:20.211 --> 00:10:22.762
non-dysmorphic-appearing
baby who is starting

00:10:22.762 --> 00:10:26.635
to have what we would say are bilateral

00:10:26.635 --> 00:10:27.682
flexor-extensor.

00:10:27.682 --> 00:10:29.378
You see the hips are coming up,

00:10:29.378 --> 00:10:30.699
the legs are coming up.

00:10:30.699 --> 00:10:33.327
The arms are extending, and then briefly

00:10:33.327 --> 00:10:35.130
adducting to the midline.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.759
It's coming in a cluster.

00:10:36.759 --> 00:10:39.009
It's coming pretty regular.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.515
Very often there's a cry in between there.

00:10:45.515 --> 00:10:47.946
This is actually taken from the

00:10:47.946 --> 00:10:50.133
Child Neurology Foundation website about,

00:10:50.133 --> 00:10:52.014
it's an instructional video.

00:10:52.014 --> 00:10:53.367
It couldn't be any more classic.

00:10:53.367 --> 00:10:56.085
You see the little
facial grimace, as well.

00:10:56.085 --> 00:10:57.295
This is something that we drive home

00:10:57.295 --> 00:10:59.366
to our pediatric residents, that if you

00:10:59.366 --> 00:11:01.522
have a baby who's having
startles or having

00:11:01.522 --> 00:11:04.189
these exaggerated Moro response,

00:11:05.538 --> 00:11:08.923
the Moro reflex, that if
it's coming in clusters

00:11:08.923 --> 00:11:11.057
like this, that's
something that, arguably,

00:11:11.057 --> 00:11:15.493
is one of the infantile
epilepsy medical emergencies,

00:11:15.493 --> 00:11:16.809
in the sense that you want these kids

00:11:16.809 --> 00:11:20.091
evaluated likely within a week.

00:11:20.091 --> 00:11:23.248
That's a very typical
video for infantile spasms.

00:11:23.248 --> 00:11:27.658
I'm just gonna go through
this sort of table here

00:11:27.658 --> 00:11:29.361
for a couple of the syndromes so that

00:11:29.361 --> 00:11:32.528
we understand why making that specific

00:11:33.904 --> 00:11:36.139
seizure diagnosis and semiology diagnosis

00:11:36.139 --> 00:11:37.426
is important.

00:11:37.426 --> 00:11:39.550
You can see the age of
onset is in infancy,

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:41.816
hence the name infantile spasms.

00:11:41.816 --> 00:11:44.094
The seizure semiology,
that was pretty classic

00:11:44.094 --> 00:11:46.259
of the flexor-extensor spasms.

00:11:46.259 --> 00:11:47.590
We have the mix.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:49.933
You don't always have
to have the flexor part.

00:11:49.933 --> 00:11:51.606
You don't always have to
have the extensor part.

00:11:51.606 --> 00:11:53.487
You can have just each of those.

00:11:53.487 --> 00:11:56.414
But once you see it, it's really hard

00:11:56.414 --> 00:11:58.075
to misdiagnose.

00:11:58.075 --> 00:11:59.800
I think the thing that
happens with families

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.411
they get really nervous
about is they worry

00:12:02.411 --> 00:12:04.116
about the duration of the seizure.

00:12:04.116 --> 00:12:05.986
The cluster may last 15, 20 minutes,

00:12:05.986 --> 00:12:08.196
but you saw each one of
those individual spasms

00:12:08.196 --> 00:12:10.668
literally lasted for about one second.

00:12:10.668 --> 00:12:13.949
If you have 20 to 30 spasms
in a 20-minute cluster,

00:12:13.949 --> 00:12:16.535
that total time spent seizing was actually

00:12:16.535 --> 00:12:19.120
only 20 to 30 seconds.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.353
The EEG is very helpful.

00:12:21.353 --> 00:12:25.600
It can show us this classical
hypsarrhythmia pattern.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.011
It really can be made in
a one-hour outpatient EEG.

00:12:30.011 --> 00:12:32.912
It's very important to capture sleep.

00:12:32.912 --> 00:12:34.080
This is another teaching point.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.730
We tell our medical residents that if you

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.208
have a baby that did that in your office,

00:12:38.208 --> 00:12:40.902
and the EEG is normal,
you have to make sure

00:12:40.902 --> 00:12:42.617
that you've actually captured sleep.

00:12:42.617 --> 00:12:44.545
You can't just write them off.

00:12:44.545 --> 00:12:46.631
If you did capture
sleep, you have to repeat

00:12:46.631 --> 00:12:49.602
that EEG in a few weeks because it could

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:51.669
be a chance that you're
actually just making

00:12:51.669 --> 00:12:53.408
this diagnosis very, very early,

00:12:53.408 --> 00:12:56.423
and the hypsarrhythmia hasn't
had a chance to develop.

00:12:56.423 --> 00:12:59.922
The etiology is really, really broad.

00:12:59.922 --> 00:13:01.605
Malformations of cortical development

00:13:01.605 --> 00:13:04.420
or neonatal encephalopathy, so some

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:09.280
perinatal birth difficulties,
represent the majority,

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.000
but the very, very close second in the era

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.035
of genetic testing are
various genetic abnormalities.

00:13:17.035 --> 00:13:19.091
You can see here Tuberous sclerosis,

00:13:19.091 --> 00:13:22.570
neurofibromatosis and
Down syndrome are some

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.944
of the common genetic diagnoses.

00:13:25.944 --> 00:13:27.418
I'm gonna show you a slide later

00:13:27.418 --> 00:13:30.907
with a whole host of genes that have now

00:13:30.907 --> 00:13:33.688
been associated with infantile spasms.

00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:35.076
Treatment is very different.

00:13:35.076 --> 00:13:36.866
These aren't the kids that
we give phenobarbital.

00:13:36.866 --> 00:13:39.058
These aren't the kids that we give Keppra.

00:13:39.058 --> 00:13:42.490
These are very
syndrome-specific treatments.

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.283
Generally high-dose steroids, which is not

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:49.341
a great medication, in
terms of tolerability,

00:13:49.341 --> 00:13:50.893
or a medication called vigabatrin,

00:13:50.893 --> 00:13:54.249
which does have some potential
for retinal toxicity,

00:13:54.249 --> 00:13:56.085
but when we look at the
developmental outcomes

00:13:56.085 --> 00:13:58.869
of untreated infantile spasms, we know

00:13:58.869 --> 00:14:01.752
that being aggressive early in trying

00:14:01.752 --> 00:14:05.315
to cycle through the
treatments that we know

00:14:05.315 --> 00:14:07.714
can be effective is critical to having

00:14:07.714 --> 00:14:11.464
any chance of a normal
developmental outcome.

00:14:14.754 --> 00:14:16.825
Moving onto one other syndrome
here, so Lennox-Gastaut.

00:14:16.825 --> 00:14:18.199
I have a series of three videos here.

00:14:18.199 --> 00:14:20.408
Here's a young woman with Down syndrome

00:14:20.408 --> 00:14:23.083
who came in to better
understand what types

00:14:23.083 --> 00:14:25.325
of seizures she's having.

00:14:25.325 --> 00:14:26.436
You can see she's playing with her little

00:14:26.436 --> 00:14:27.866
Etch A Sketch thingy.

00:14:27.866 --> 00:14:28.847
Oh, here we go.

00:14:28.847 --> 00:14:30.221
She has abrupt jerk there.

00:14:30.221 --> 00:14:32.796
Extension of the arms.

00:14:32.796 --> 00:14:33.952
Then she looks like it's done.

00:14:33.952 --> 00:14:36.052
Then it happens again.

00:14:36.052 --> 00:14:37.282
She's holding it.

00:14:37.282 --> 00:14:38.680
Then she just readjusts herself,

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.044
and then she's gonna totally pick up

00:14:40.044 --> 00:14:42.876
her little toy here again

00:14:42.876 --> 00:14:43.834
and start playing with it.

00:14:43.834 --> 00:14:45.580
You can see that there's some overlap

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.135
between a spasm.

00:14:47.135 --> 00:14:49.047
That actually had a
little bit of a stuttering

00:14:49.047 --> 00:14:51.161
and clustering, but that was it.

00:14:51.161 --> 00:14:52.698
That was just two.

00:14:52.698 --> 00:14:56.177
But you can see that the
duration that the arms

00:14:56.177 --> 00:14:57.968
were held was longer.

00:14:57.968 --> 00:15:00.873
It was not this sort of crescendo,

00:15:00.873 --> 00:15:02.790
decrescendo of a spasm.

00:15:03.657 --> 00:15:06.324
Rather, this is a tonic seizure.

00:15:07.318 --> 00:15:09.079
Sometimes it's not so easy.

00:15:09.079 --> 00:15:10.439
Here you're gonna see a combination

00:15:10.439 --> 00:15:11.817
of two things.

00:15:11.817 --> 00:15:14.580
The helmet should be a giveaway

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.999
that this child is at risk for falling.

00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:19.749
Mom's holding onto his hand here.

00:15:21.377 --> 00:15:22.520
That actually went a little bit slower

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.018
than it was supposed to, but you can see.

00:15:24.018 --> 00:15:25.370
Imagine what would have happened if he

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:26.940
would not have been
standing at the bedside

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.946
and Mom would not have had her hand there.

00:15:29.946 --> 00:15:32.465
He would have dropped to the ground.

00:15:32.465 --> 00:15:35.313
There is a common theme now,

00:15:35.313 --> 00:15:38.152
especially in epilepsy drug studies,

00:15:38.152 --> 00:15:39.659
of how you count these seizures.

00:15:39.659 --> 00:15:40.779
What do you call that?

00:15:40.779 --> 00:15:43.014
You notice the arms went
out, the head went down.

00:15:43.014 --> 00:15:46.083
We can have epilepsy banter here.

00:15:46.083 --> 00:15:47.855
Was that a tonic, atonic?

00:15:47.855 --> 00:15:49.901
Was it tonic with a head drop?

00:15:49.901 --> 00:15:53.401
All these different things are interesting

00:15:54.751 --> 00:15:58.215
and can be teased out with
detailed video EEG monitoring,

00:15:58.215 --> 00:16:00.077
but the big picture, the drop attack.

00:16:00.077 --> 00:16:02.451
This kid would have fallen.

00:16:02.451 --> 00:16:04.662
We treat drop attacks very seriously

00:16:04.662 --> 00:16:06.465
because of the secondary injuries that

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:09.074
these patients can sustain.

00:16:09.074 --> 00:16:11.657
Then on that same theme,
here's another child

00:16:11.657 --> 00:16:13.397
who's playing with his truck.

00:16:13.397 --> 00:16:15.322
You're gonna see, he's actually

00:16:15.322 --> 00:16:16.883
in a sitting position.

00:16:16.883 --> 00:16:19.236
If he was just to have atonia, he may fall

00:16:19.236 --> 00:16:20.896
to the side, which he
kinda does, but the arms

00:16:20.896 --> 00:16:22.322
come out, and then there's still that

00:16:22.322 --> 00:16:23.882
little bit of extension.

00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:25.382
He stays extended.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:27.503
Dad's over there in the corner.

00:16:27.503 --> 00:16:29.402
He's like, I think you're okay.

00:16:29.402 --> 00:16:31.652
(laughter)

00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:34.535
He stays down, and then he sits back up.

00:16:34.535 --> 00:16:36.948
Those are all sort of themes of tonic

00:16:36.948 --> 00:16:39.652
and atonic seizures that
lead to drop attacks.

00:16:39.652 --> 00:16:42.748
We just know that drop
attacks carry a very,

00:16:42.748 --> 00:16:45.095
they're brief, but
because of the associated

00:16:45.095 --> 00:16:47.441
morbidity that they cause, with regard

00:16:47.441 --> 00:16:50.399
to secondary injury, they
can be very debilitating

00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:53.280
for patients and their caregivers.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.906
What is Lennox-Gastaut syndrome?

00:16:55.906 --> 00:16:58.906
I have a European-Italian colleague.

00:17:00.703 --> 00:17:04.120
The Europeans are very good semiologists.

00:17:06.477 --> 00:17:08.947
They really scrutinize even better than

00:17:08.947 --> 00:17:10.364
the Americans do.

00:17:11.451 --> 00:17:13.971
There's a lotta debate as to us Americans

00:17:13.971 --> 00:17:17.419
over diagnosing Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

00:17:17.419 --> 00:17:20.931
That may be true 'cause the core syndrome,

00:17:20.931 --> 00:17:22.817
as described by Lennox and Gastaut,

00:17:22.817 --> 00:17:24.967
probably is rare, but for the purposes

00:17:24.967 --> 00:17:28.245
of our talk here, I just
want to sort of lump them

00:17:28.245 --> 00:17:31.513
into these types of
seizures that we can see,

00:17:31.513 --> 00:17:33.789
namely the tonic axial seizures,

00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:35.679
which you saw the picture of,

00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:37.590
and then the atonic seizures.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:39.329
The other key component
that really represents

00:17:39.329 --> 00:17:42.213
that core phenotype are these atypical

00:17:42.213 --> 00:17:43.898
absence seizures, which these are the ones

00:17:43.898 --> 00:17:46.451
that are very, very difficult to tell.

00:17:46.451 --> 00:17:48.474
Even when you have neurotypical kids,

00:17:48.474 --> 00:17:49.555
they're gonna stare.

00:17:49.555 --> 00:17:50.388
Adults stare.

00:17:50.388 --> 00:17:51.590
I can see some of you
guys staring right now.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:52.752
Are you actually having (laughter)

00:17:52.752 --> 00:17:55.115
an atypical absence seizure?

00:17:55.115 --> 00:17:57.672
It's very difficult to tell.

00:17:57.672 --> 00:17:59.992
In some children and young adults

00:17:59.992 --> 00:18:03.025
with intellectual disability,

00:18:03.025 --> 00:18:04.949
parents, they know these kids well,

00:18:04.949 --> 00:18:08.199
just like we said in the previous talk.

00:18:09.064 --> 00:18:11.481
They are their best provider.

00:18:12.469 --> 00:18:14.743
They can tell that something happens

00:18:14.743 --> 00:18:16.226
and that there's an on and an off.

00:18:16.226 --> 00:18:18.767
But sometimes the on of the staring

00:18:18.767 --> 00:18:20.311
or the sort of little bit of being

00:18:20.311 --> 00:18:21.797
a little bit more disconnected

00:18:21.797 --> 00:18:23.763
is a little bit more gray, and the off

00:18:23.763 --> 00:18:25.224
is a little bit more gray.

00:18:25.224 --> 00:18:27.201
I would argue that it's almost impossible

00:18:27.201 --> 00:18:30.262
to be 100% sure unless you actually have

00:18:30.262 --> 00:18:32.170
a EEG on at the time.

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.604
That is the seizure type that tends

00:18:34.604 --> 00:18:36.917
to really bring all those three, tonic,

00:18:36.917 --> 00:18:39.190
atonic and the atypical absence together

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:41.457
to represent the true core phenotype

00:18:41.457 --> 00:18:43.757
of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

00:18:43.757 --> 00:18:46.781
The EEG findings, it's very, very helpful.

00:18:46.781 --> 00:18:48.957
We can actually see EEG abnormalities

00:18:48.957 --> 00:18:51.232
even in between seizures.

00:18:51.232 --> 00:18:53.669
With an appropriate history of those types

00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:55.923
of seizures that you would describe to me,

00:18:55.923 --> 00:18:58.213
together with a one-hour EEG, we can

00:18:58.213 --> 00:19:00.443
very often make the clinical diagnosis

00:19:00.443 --> 00:19:01.983
of Lennox-Gastaut.

00:19:01.983 --> 00:19:03.537
You'll see some overlap here, in terms

00:19:03.537 --> 00:19:05.583
of the etiologies of infantile spasms

00:19:05.583 --> 00:19:07.712
in Lennox-Gastaut.

00:19:07.712 --> 00:19:09.345
Brain malformations, so malformations

00:19:09.345 --> 00:19:11.785
of cortical development are very common.

00:19:11.785 --> 00:19:13.831
You can see that there
can be this evolution

00:19:13.831 --> 00:19:16.925
from infantile spasms to Lennox-Gastaut.

00:19:16.925 --> 00:19:19.075
This is also associated
with Down syndrome,

00:19:19.075 --> 00:19:21.372
associated with Angelman syndrome.

00:19:21.372 --> 00:19:23.981
From the few autopsy
specimens that we do have,

00:19:23.981 --> 00:19:26.167
there can be, the patients that actually

00:19:26.167 --> 00:19:28.134
have normal brain MRIs are thought

00:19:28.134 --> 00:19:30.217
to maybe have microscopic

00:19:32.897 --> 00:19:34.194
neurodevelopmental abnormalities

00:19:34.194 --> 00:19:36.152
or sort of cortical
dysplasia, where the normal

00:19:36.152 --> 00:19:39.234
six-layer cortex is not
organized in the way

00:19:39.234 --> 00:19:40.257
that it should.

00:19:40.257 --> 00:19:43.511
But still, there's a
whole host of patients

00:19:43.511 --> 00:19:46.122
that, to this day, are Lennox-Gastaut

00:19:46.122 --> 00:19:47.664
of unknown cause.

00:19:47.664 --> 00:19:50.678
That's really where we hope

00:19:50.678 --> 00:19:52.149
that with whole exome sequencing

00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:55.588
we're gonna arrive at some discoveries.

00:19:55.588 --> 00:19:56.421
Treatment.

00:19:56.421 --> 00:19:59.184
We base it on seizure type, but we also

00:19:59.184 --> 00:20:02.107
base it on experience in the literature

00:20:02.107 --> 00:20:04.717
over the last four
decades, since valproate

00:20:04.717 --> 00:20:06.420
has been available.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.053
We know that valproate and valproate

00:20:09.053 --> 00:20:12.010
and lamotrigine together can be very,

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:13.713
can be actually synergistic.

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.291
Benzodiazepines, I know we don't like

00:20:15.291 --> 00:20:17.257
benzodiazepines, but
they can be very helpful

00:20:17.257 --> 00:20:19.016
for the different
seizure types that we see

00:20:19.016 --> 00:20:20.167
in this syndrome.

00:20:20.167 --> 00:20:21.766
Then the medication felbamate.

00:20:21.766 --> 00:20:22.905
It's not a medicine that we usually

00:20:22.905 --> 00:20:25.200
reach for as the first
or second-line medication

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.624
in any of the epilepsies, but it can

00:20:28.624 --> 00:20:30.821
be particularly effective for the tonic

00:20:30.821 --> 00:20:32.386
and atonic seizures that are associated

00:20:32.386 --> 00:20:33.858
with this syndrome.

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:36.191
Because of the morbidity that they cause,

00:20:36.191 --> 00:20:38.848
I tend to start having
that talk with families

00:20:38.848 --> 00:20:41.666
sooner rather than later.

00:20:41.666 --> 00:20:45.895
The incidence of intellectual disability,

00:20:45.895 --> 00:20:47.553
sorry, I have this old term in there,

00:20:47.553 --> 00:20:49.386
my apologies, is high.

00:20:51.596 --> 00:20:54.870
We know that the chronic
treatment-resistant seizures

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:56.159
can evolve over time.

00:20:56.159 --> 00:20:57.550
Again, you have to be able to react

00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:01.589
accordingly to those
different seizure types.

00:21:01.589 --> 00:21:04.672
Here's my really simplified breakdown

00:21:05.648 --> 00:21:07.971
of what I do in the clinic every day.

00:21:07.971 --> 00:21:09.694
You have someone who
comes in with seizures

00:21:09.694 --> 00:21:10.892
and a developmental disability.

00:21:10.892 --> 00:21:13.319
We still, all this fancy
EEG, whole exome sequence,

00:21:13.319 --> 00:21:15.579
we still wanna look at the patient,

00:21:15.579 --> 00:21:18.579
talk to the family and examine them.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:21.166
I am not a geneticist.

00:21:21.166 --> 00:21:22.718
I am not a dysmorphologist.

00:21:22.718 --> 00:21:25.055
If I see something that
look a little different,

00:21:25.055 --> 00:21:27.284
I will rely on my genetic colleagues

00:21:27.284 --> 00:21:30.138
to hopefully refine that bit.

00:21:30.138 --> 00:21:32.198
But if someone does have specific features

00:21:32.198 --> 00:21:35.152
of a genetic syndrome, we wanna proceed

00:21:35.152 --> 00:21:37.235
to targeted gene testing.

00:21:38.243 --> 00:21:39.968
Then if we have a specific diagnosis,

00:21:39.968 --> 00:21:42.475
such as Down syndrome,
such as Angelman syndrome,

00:21:42.475 --> 00:21:44.751
we can then still, it's clinically based.

00:21:44.751 --> 00:21:47.479
We're still going to treat based on

00:21:47.479 --> 00:21:49.481
the predominant seizure
type, but this is where

00:21:49.481 --> 00:21:50.824
we can use the literature

00:21:50.824 --> 00:21:52.412
and we can use family reporting.

00:21:52.412 --> 00:21:55.529
Now the whole explosion of social media,

00:21:55.529 --> 00:21:57.426
often families are coming into me and say,

00:21:57.426 --> 00:21:58.867
"Well, I read on the
Angelman syndrome board

00:21:58.867 --> 00:22:01.317
"that that is a bad medicine
for Angelman syndrome."

00:22:01.317 --> 00:22:03.385
We're learning a lot
as healthcare providers

00:22:03.385 --> 00:22:04.552
from families.

00:22:05.466 --> 00:22:08.230
If you have someone who
just has non-specific

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:10.426
or pretty much a normal neurologic

00:22:10.426 --> 00:22:13.828
and physical exam, then we
have to sort of broaden,

00:22:13.828 --> 00:22:16.127
I think, our net a bit.

00:22:16.127 --> 00:22:19.979
We still rely very, very
heavily on neuroimagings,

00:22:19.979 --> 00:22:21.395
brain MRI.

00:22:21.395 --> 00:22:25.562
Even in the age of genetic
panels and exome sequencing,

00:22:26.755 --> 00:22:28.341
we can't forget about a good old

00:22:28.341 --> 00:22:30.540
chromosomal microarray 'cause we can still

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:33.140
pick up different copy numer of variants

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.583
on a microarray that can
be very, very important

00:22:36.583 --> 00:22:39.814
in 10 to 15% of patients with seizures

00:22:39.814 --> 00:22:41.735
and developmental disability.

00:22:41.735 --> 00:22:45.159
Then really, with the
imaging and some type

00:22:45.159 --> 00:22:47.004
of genetic testing, we can go into two

00:22:47.004 --> 00:22:49.701
broad branching points,
where if the imaging

00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:52.083
is abnormal, does that actually fit into

00:22:52.083 --> 00:22:53.823
a known malformation syndrome?

00:22:53.823 --> 00:22:55.719
But again, we're still treating based on

00:22:55.719 --> 00:22:57.768
the seizure type.

00:22:57.768 --> 00:22:59.631
I'm preaching some job security here

00:22:59.631 --> 00:23:02.011
because it's still based on us having

00:23:02.011 --> 00:23:03.633
a good understanding
what types of seizures

00:23:03.633 --> 00:23:05.185
are actually present.

00:23:05.185 --> 00:23:07.151
But then if we do have a specific genetic

00:23:07.151 --> 00:23:10.129
diagnosis, then we start to not only

00:23:10.129 --> 00:23:11.681
look at the literature, but in these

00:23:11.681 --> 00:23:13.430
specific instances that I have up here,

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:16.306
SCM1A, tuberous sclerosis and PCDH19,

00:23:16.306 --> 00:23:18.723
we know that are specific
treatment strategies

00:23:18.723 --> 00:23:21.757
to avoid, and some to lean more towards

00:23:21.757 --> 00:23:23.299
that can be particularly effective

00:23:23.299 --> 00:23:24.666
for those groups of patients.

00:23:24.666 --> 00:23:27.705
Our hope is that someday, everyone who has

00:23:27.705 --> 00:23:29.601
a diagnosis of epilepsy will actually have

00:23:29.601 --> 00:23:33.670
a specific gene disorder
that we can actually

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:35.569
be a little bit more specific,

00:23:35.569 --> 00:23:39.411
rather than just basing
it on the seizure type.

00:23:39.411 --> 00:23:41.180
This is just a paper that was published

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.399
about seven years ago.

00:23:43.399 --> 00:23:46.197
A lot has happened in seven years.

00:23:46.197 --> 00:23:48.657
They're basically acknowledging
that genetic testing

00:23:48.657 --> 00:23:51.624
is important and gonna become
increasingly important.

00:23:51.624 --> 00:23:54.624
This is a beautiful graph that shows

00:23:55.831 --> 00:23:59.074
the real availability of
next-generation sequencing.

00:23:59.074 --> 00:24:02.094
The whole exome really
happened, it happened

00:24:02.094 --> 00:24:04.681
where you can see the
blue bubble there, 2007.

00:24:04.681 --> 00:24:07.671
It was about $100,000
to get it back in 2007.

00:24:07.671 --> 00:24:09.637
Today, it's about, at some places,

00:24:09.637 --> 00:24:12.354
you can get it for $5,000 for a trio,

00:24:12.354 --> 00:24:14.137
so parents and a child.

00:24:14.137 --> 00:24:17.688
You can see that in
the pre-next-generation

00:24:17.688 --> 00:24:19.638
sequencing era, we were doing okay.

00:24:19.638 --> 00:24:22.608
We had some pretty
important epilepsy genes,

00:24:22.608 --> 00:24:27.194
all of which are associated
with various degrees

00:24:27.194 --> 00:24:28.443
of intellectual disability.

00:24:28.443 --> 00:24:31.627
Since the next-generation sequencing era,

00:24:31.627 --> 00:24:34.097
you can see that there been this sort of

00:24:34.097 --> 00:24:36.557
exponential rise in the
number of gene discoveries.

00:24:36.557 --> 00:24:38.720
Not only has there been
an exponential rise

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.893
in the gene discoveries, but the amount

00:24:40.893 --> 00:24:42.608
of research that's going on in each

00:24:42.608 --> 00:24:47.208
of these specific genes is
also increasing dramatically.

00:24:47.208 --> 00:24:49.080
Why does this matter?

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.580
I tell this story.

00:24:52.269 --> 00:24:54.785
It's a story of Tracy Dixon-Salazar,

00:24:54.785 --> 00:24:57.696
who is a friend and colleague of mine,

00:24:57.696 --> 00:25:00.133
and who has a daughter
who had Lennox-Gastaut

00:25:00.133 --> 00:25:01.595
of unknown cause.

00:25:01.595 --> 00:25:03.537
She actually went to get her Ph.D

00:25:03.537 --> 00:25:04.916
in developmental neuroscience.

00:25:04.916 --> 00:25:06.571
This was right at the
time when whole exome

00:25:06.571 --> 00:25:08.607
sequencing was just starting to become

00:25:08.607 --> 00:25:10.103
a research tool.

00:25:10.103 --> 00:25:11.772
She had a very typical presentation,

00:25:11.772 --> 00:25:14.034
as I had on that graph of
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome,

00:25:14.034 --> 00:25:15.967
with hundreds of seizures per month,

00:25:15.967 --> 00:25:17.797
multiple medication trial, weekly use

00:25:17.797 --> 00:25:19.589
of rescue medications.

00:25:19.589 --> 00:25:22.957
Then she sequenced her
own daughter's exome.

00:25:22.957 --> 00:25:26.488
They found an abnormality
in a calcium channel gene.

00:25:26.488 --> 00:25:28.892
Generally, we don't reach toward

00:25:28.892 --> 00:25:30.993
the cardiac calcium channel blockers

00:25:30.993 --> 00:25:32.904
in the epilepsy space, but they put her

00:25:32.904 --> 00:25:35.481
on a calcium channel blocker.

00:25:35.481 --> 00:25:39.980
Lo and behold, she had a
95% reduction in seizures.

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.682
She had no need for rescue medications.

00:25:41.682 --> 00:25:44.039
They were able to reduce
her other medications.

00:25:44.039 --> 00:25:46.512
She had improved alertness and function.

00:25:46.512 --> 00:25:48.282
Tracy tells her 20 minute story

00:25:48.282 --> 00:25:50.375
at different meetings to really try

00:25:50.375 --> 00:25:54.390
and drive home the utility
of genetic testing.

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:56.463
She shows pictures of her daughter

00:25:56.463 --> 00:25:57.816
pre- and post-seizures.

00:25:57.816 --> 00:25:59.733
It's really remarkable.

00:26:01.625 --> 00:26:03.196
We do have an amazing
opportunity, I think,

00:26:03.196 --> 00:26:04.646
ahead of us.

00:26:04.646 --> 00:26:06.649
Just to cover some other things

00:26:06.649 --> 00:26:07.990
just with single slides 'cause I know

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:11.312
that it's been addressed
here at this conference.

00:26:11.312 --> 00:26:12.759
Infantile spasms, as I showed you,

00:26:12.759 --> 00:26:15.878
are a common seizure type in children

00:26:15.878 --> 00:26:17.200
with Down syndrome.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.880
Interestingly, and this is by no means

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.030
a one size fits all, but children

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:23.283
with Down syndrome who present with

00:26:23.283 --> 00:26:26.252
infantile spasms tend to
respond more favorably

00:26:26.252 --> 00:26:28.435
than non-Down syndrome patients.

00:26:28.435 --> 00:26:30.608
We actually don't understand that.

00:26:30.608 --> 00:26:32.389
Maybe there's something
about the X chromosome.

00:26:32.389 --> 00:26:34.639
We don't really understand.

00:26:36.359 --> 00:26:40.325
They can still evolve into Lennox-Gastaut.

00:26:40.325 --> 00:26:41.817
They may have other seizure types,

00:26:41.817 --> 00:26:44.186
as you saw that that young woman

00:26:44.186 --> 00:26:45.913
who had the tonic seizures.

00:26:45.913 --> 00:26:48.326
The hard part here is that the EEG

00:26:48.326 --> 00:26:51.133
can be abnormal, even with
no history of seizures.

00:26:51.133 --> 00:26:53.547
Again, my job security, you have to get

00:26:53.547 --> 00:26:56.180
a good history of a seizure.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.456
Don't inappropriately diagnose someone

00:26:58.456 --> 00:26:59.870
with epilepsy just because they have

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:00.873
an abnormal EEG.

00:27:00.873 --> 00:27:03.300
You have to have the history
together with the EEG

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.000
to make that diagnosis.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.357
Then here's just one
video I wanna show you,

00:27:08.357 --> 00:27:12.315
in terms of how detailed
phenotyping actually

00:27:12.315 --> 00:27:14.982
can lead to a genetic diagnosis.

00:27:16.157 --> 00:27:18.465
I want you to watch this little girl.

00:27:18.465 --> 00:27:19.538
Whoops.

00:27:19.538 --> 00:27:21.455
Watch this little girl.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.657
Go back one more.

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:26.975
They're gonna do it for me up at the box.

00:27:26.975 --> 00:27:28.975
There you go. Thank you.

00:27:30.573 --> 00:27:32.406
Describe what you see.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.550
She's sleeping.

00:27:35.717 --> 00:27:38.878
There's a little bit of hypermotoric,

00:27:38.878 --> 00:27:40.440
maybe she's just up and she's cranky.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:43.440
She's developmentally very abnormal.

00:27:44.949 --> 00:27:48.532
She has some kicking
movements of the legs.

00:27:50.053 --> 00:27:53.220
It's playing a little bit slower than.

00:27:57.225 --> 00:27:58.627
Now we see some stiffening.

00:27:58.627 --> 00:28:02.215
There's extension of the arms and legs.

00:28:02.215 --> 00:28:04.862
We have hypermotor slash agitation.

00:28:04.862 --> 00:28:08.540
Now we have stiffening, so we have tonic.

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.066
I won't let this play the whole time,

00:28:10.066 --> 00:28:12.761
but she's gonna go into,
she's gonna relax here

00:28:12.761 --> 00:28:15.082
and then almost go into a little spasm.

00:28:15.082 --> 00:28:16.657
She's no longer an infant, so these

00:28:16.657 --> 00:28:18.337
are not infantile spasms.

00:28:18.337 --> 00:28:20.418
They're now called epileptic spasms.

00:28:20.418 --> 00:28:25.112
But if we actually look at
the hypermotor tonic spasms.

00:28:25.112 --> 00:28:26.548
This is a sequence.

00:28:26.548 --> 00:28:27.965
This was actually

00:28:29.609 --> 00:28:31.794
published in the Journal of Neurology

00:28:31.794 --> 00:28:35.827
by the Australian group
because they noticed

00:28:35.827 --> 00:28:37.077
that this was a

00:28:38.671 --> 00:28:41.191
specific seizure type
that actually happened

00:28:41.191 --> 00:28:42.522
in mostly girls.

00:28:42.522 --> 00:28:45.066
CDKL5 encephalopathy
is a genetic diagnosis

00:28:45.066 --> 00:28:47.303
that happens mainly with girls.

00:28:47.303 --> 00:28:51.136
But we've actually, when
we evaluate patients,

00:28:52.532 --> 00:28:54.950
infant girls who have spasms, and you get

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:56.302
this sort of history, now you know

00:28:56.302 --> 00:28:57.558
the questions to ask.

00:28:57.558 --> 00:28:58.582
You can go back.

00:28:58.582 --> 00:28:59.834
"Does she ever wake up and
look like she's scared,

00:28:59.834 --> 00:29:01.986
"and then that goes into the spasm?"

00:29:01.986 --> 00:29:03.103
That can almost be your cheapest

00:29:03.103 --> 00:29:04.160
genetic testing right here.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:08.061
You can almost predict, nothing is 100%,

00:29:08.061 --> 00:29:09.440
obviously, but you can almost predict

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.546
that this could be the diagnosis.

00:29:11.546 --> 00:29:12.739
Why is this important?

00:29:12.739 --> 00:29:13.926
Right now, we don't necessarily have

00:29:13.926 --> 00:29:16.559
any specific treatments that are tailored

00:29:16.559 --> 00:29:19.476
to CDKL5 encephalopathy, but again,

00:29:20.491 --> 00:29:25.057
there's great, usually
parent-formed support groups

00:29:25.057 --> 00:29:27.831
that really go a long
way, in terms of providing

00:29:27.831 --> 00:29:30.381
that social support and
funding the necessary

00:29:30.381 --> 00:29:32.314
research that we need.

00:29:32.314 --> 00:29:33.913
This is just a quick slide to also show

00:29:33.913 --> 00:29:35.418
that there's been a huge expansion

00:29:35.418 --> 00:29:36.970
in the amount of anti-epileptic drugs

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:39.970
that have been available since 2000.

00:29:41.283 --> 00:29:43.860
Unfortunately, a lot of
them aren't significantly

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.677
more effective than
the ones that were back

00:29:46.677 --> 00:29:49.587
in the good old phenobarb/phenytoin ages,

00:29:49.587 --> 00:29:52.221
but thankfully, they are better tolerated.

00:29:52.221 --> 00:29:54.371
We have equal efficacy, but patients

00:29:54.371 --> 00:29:56.787
are actually truly living
with their epilepsy,

00:29:56.787 --> 00:29:59.097
and not falling asleep.

00:29:59.097 --> 00:30:00.122
The emerging treatments.

00:30:00.122 --> 00:30:02.722
This is kind of the wrapping up here.

00:30:02.722 --> 00:30:05.813
Despite all of those new drugs, and again,

00:30:05.813 --> 00:30:08.055
despite all those new drugs, the number

00:30:08.055 --> 00:30:10.471
of treatment-resistant
patients, which we define

00:30:10.471 --> 00:30:12.963
as still having seizures
despite medication,

00:30:12.963 --> 00:30:16.963
has not changed, which
is embarrassing, I think.

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:19.563
We still use drugs.

00:30:20.843 --> 00:30:22.576
There's devices and
there's all these nice,

00:30:22.576 --> 00:30:24.152
fancy cutting-edge
things that are going on,

00:30:24.152 --> 00:30:26.485
but drugs are still the main

00:30:27.937 --> 00:30:29.455
treatment modality.

00:30:29.455 --> 00:30:31.869
But our hope is, again, I keep hitting

00:30:31.869 --> 00:30:33.514
the genetic drum, is that if we can get

00:30:33.514 --> 00:30:35.928
to a better diagnosis, more accurate

00:30:35.928 --> 00:30:37.400
genetic diagnosis, will that actually

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.952
lead to better treatments?

00:30:38.952 --> 00:30:39.952
Cannabidiol.

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.735
There's been many, many reports,

00:30:43.735 --> 00:30:45.735
even of cannabis sativa,

00:30:47.934 --> 00:30:51.122
being used for various medical disorders.

00:30:51.122 --> 00:30:53.698
Cannabidiol is just one
of the many compounds

00:30:53.698 --> 00:30:55.531
in the cannabis plant.

00:30:57.017 --> 00:30:59.446
The two that are getting
the most attention

00:30:59.446 --> 00:31:01.930
are really CBD, cannabidiol, and THC,

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:03.932
so tetrahydrocannabinol,
which is what gives

00:31:03.932 --> 00:31:06.459
the psychoactive component from cannabis.

00:31:06.459 --> 00:31:10.358
Really, this all happened
five or six years ago

00:31:10.358 --> 00:31:13.509
when many parents were frustrated with the

00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:17.157
lack of effective treatments
for their children

00:31:17.157 --> 00:31:19.951
with various epilepsy diagnoses,

00:31:19.951 --> 00:31:22.846
but most specifically
with Dravet syndrome.

00:31:22.846 --> 00:31:25.011
This one little girl named Charlotte Figi,

00:31:25.011 --> 00:31:27.631
her parents, when they
were living in Colorado,

00:31:27.631 --> 00:31:28.953
and Colorado's one of the first states

00:31:28.953 --> 00:31:31.793
to have medical marijuana available,

00:31:31.793 --> 00:31:35.186
tried her on a oil that
had a high concentration

00:31:35.186 --> 00:31:38.188
of cannabidiol, and a
low concentration of THC.

00:31:38.188 --> 00:31:41.583
Lo and behold, she actually
had a dramatic reduction

00:31:41.583 --> 00:31:43.700
and had prolonged periods
of seizure freedom.

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:47.034
Sanjay Gupta got involved,
a lotta stuff happened.

00:31:47.034 --> 00:31:49.312
There was a company that
actually, for decades,

00:31:49.312 --> 00:31:52.062
had already been, had a pure form

00:31:53.353 --> 00:31:57.247
of cannabidiol that was
plant extracted available.

00:31:57.247 --> 00:32:00.112
They contacted a bunch of centers.

00:32:00.112 --> 00:32:03.620
We were a center that
were involved with this,

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:07.871
where we basically did
an expanded access IND,

00:32:07.871 --> 00:32:10.104
under compassionate use protocol.

00:32:10.104 --> 00:32:13.407
We treated 214 patients with
treatment-resistant epilepsy.

00:32:13.407 --> 00:32:14.982
This was not placebo controlled, so they

00:32:14.982 --> 00:32:17.579
were just given cannabidiol.

00:32:17.579 --> 00:32:19.271
They had a four-week
baseline seizure count,

00:32:19.271 --> 00:32:22.489
followed by 12 weeks of treatment.

00:32:22.489 --> 00:32:25.122
Everything was kept by seizure diary.

00:32:25.122 --> 00:32:26.872
The median reduction in seizures

00:32:26.872 --> 00:32:28.455
was about 35%.

00:32:29.735 --> 00:32:30.874
It works.

00:32:30.874 --> 00:32:33.505
There were some patients
that were seizure free.

00:32:33.505 --> 00:32:35.657
A subsequent placebo controlled trial

00:32:35.657 --> 00:32:38.784
that was done in Dravet syndrome

00:32:38.784 --> 00:32:40.383
has been completed.

00:32:40.383 --> 00:32:43.351
The median reduction in seizures

00:32:43.351 --> 00:32:46.998
was 39%, compared to placebo of 13%.

00:32:46.998 --> 00:32:49.514
So similar, but again,
we have to factor in

00:32:49.514 --> 00:32:51.181
that placebo number.

00:32:53.667 --> 00:32:55.401
That data is not published yet.

00:32:55.401 --> 00:32:57.780
It's just a press release
data from the company.

00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:01.130
This does work, but it's by no means,

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:03.407
it's another tool in our
toolbox, as we'll explain

00:33:03.407 --> 00:33:05.913
to families, and it is by no means

00:33:05.913 --> 00:33:08.496
the cure-all for many patients.

00:33:09.683 --> 00:33:13.790
Wrapping up, where are we today in 2017?

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:15.379
To bring this to full closure, in terms

00:33:15.379 --> 00:33:17.609
of the power of genetics.

00:33:17.609 --> 00:33:19.936
I have some extremely
bright people that work

00:33:19.936 --> 00:33:24.103
at UCSF that are taking these
known genetic epilepsies.

00:33:25.293 --> 00:33:29.524
Scott Baraban at UCSF
has about 80 different

00:33:29.524 --> 00:33:32.203
genetic mutations that
have been discovered

00:33:32.203 --> 00:33:34.956
in forms of different pediatric epilepsy.

00:33:34.956 --> 00:33:37.119
Using this new gene editing technology

00:33:37.119 --> 00:33:39.612
called CRISPR, he's able to insert

00:33:39.612 --> 00:33:43.146
the specific genetic
mutation into a zebrafish.

00:33:43.146 --> 00:33:44.141
Why a zebrafish?

00:33:44.141 --> 00:33:46.030
Turns out zebrafish can actually,

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:47.802
you can turn around large populations

00:33:47.802 --> 00:33:50.635
of zebrafish, as compared to mice,

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:53.955
or even fruit flies.

00:33:53.955 --> 00:33:56.700
Then you can literally take the zebrafish.

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:58.920
Many of them do have seizures.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.782
I won't go into how they
see this fish seizing,

00:34:01.782 --> 00:34:03.716
(laughter) but it's very interesting.

00:34:03.716 --> 00:34:05.325
It's very, very interesting.

00:34:05.325 --> 00:34:06.658
There's cameras.

00:34:07.501 --> 00:34:10.168
Then they literally will
take different medications

00:34:10.168 --> 00:34:11.697
and put them in the water.

00:34:11.697 --> 00:34:14.608
Then the fish are
ingesting the medication.

00:34:14.608 --> 00:34:15.999
They can do toxicity studies.

00:34:15.999 --> 00:34:17.251
They can do different concentrations

00:34:17.251 --> 00:34:18.180
of the medication.

00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:21.159
They see which of these compounds actually

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:23.069
reduce seizures.

00:34:23.069 --> 00:34:25.038
He does this in a blinded way.

00:34:25.038 --> 00:34:28.499
This really, I think, is a whole other era

00:34:28.499 --> 00:34:30.634
for drug repurposing.

00:34:30.634 --> 00:34:32.328
You have drugs that are already out there

00:34:32.328 --> 00:34:34.168
and FDA approved, that we already have

00:34:34.168 --> 00:34:35.834
the toxicity data, but
we just never thought

00:34:35.834 --> 00:34:38.113
to try them in patients with epilepsy.

00:34:38.113 --> 00:34:40.343
So in a blinded fashion,
he takes these compounds,

00:34:40.343 --> 00:34:42.783
he puts 'em in the
water, he sees which ones

00:34:42.783 --> 00:34:44.815
actually cause a reduction in seizure.

00:34:44.815 --> 00:34:47.232
Then you unveil the bottle and see

00:34:47.232 --> 00:34:49.151
what drug it is, and then start to look

00:34:49.151 --> 00:34:51.074
into how that drug works
and better understand

00:34:51.074 --> 00:34:52.109
the mechanism of action.

00:34:52.109 --> 00:34:53.200
I really think that this is going

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:56.925
to be a very, very important technology

00:34:56.925 --> 00:34:59.088
to give us some better treatments.

00:34:59.088 --> 00:35:01.825
Last slide, so take home points.

00:35:01.825 --> 00:35:03.227
Hopefully you will not just say

00:35:03.227 --> 00:35:05.390
generalized tonic-clonic seizure.

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:07.022
Epilepsy has many different faces,

00:35:07.022 --> 00:35:09.245
and all seizures can look
very, very different.

00:35:09.245 --> 00:35:10.751
I've put my foot in my
mouth so many times.

00:35:10.751 --> 00:35:12.792
I say, "Oh, that can't be a seizure."

00:35:12.792 --> 00:35:15.206
If it's stereotyped and it's recurrent,

00:35:15.206 --> 00:35:17.529
don't blow it off.

00:35:17.529 --> 00:35:19.371
Have it evaluated further.

00:35:19.371 --> 00:35:21.761
We know that patients with
developmental disabilities

00:35:21.761 --> 00:35:23.487
are particularly
challenging, due to the many

00:35:23.487 --> 00:35:25.267
different underlying etiologies.

00:35:25.267 --> 00:35:27.362
Again, this accurate classification

00:35:27.362 --> 00:35:29.088
of seizures is critical so that we can,

00:35:29.088 --> 00:35:31.409
ideally, arrive at some gene discoveries

00:35:31.409 --> 00:35:33.504
with some more targeted-based treatments.

00:35:33.504 --> 00:35:35.348
Thank you.
- [Woman] Thank you.

00:35:35.348 --> 00:35:37.681
