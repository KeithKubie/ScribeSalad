00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.300
All right. So the learner, if the learner is choosing

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.020
which questions to ask the learner is in a distinctly more

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.400
difficult situation because it doesn't actually know what the right answer

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.630
is. So whereas the teacher could ask questions there were maximally

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.600
informative. That is to say, whittle down the hypothesis set to

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.950
one in a single question. The learner doesn't, doesn't have that

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.830
ability. The learner can't know which, what whether the question that's

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.790
being asked is going to have a yes or no answer.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.710
So again, assuming that the learner can ask any question it wants,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.310
but doesn't know what the right answer is. How many questions is

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.250
it going to need to ask before it can it has whittled

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.550
down the set of possible people to just the one that is

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.940
the right answer? So I gave four helpful formulae here. All in

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.340
terms of the number of people that we have to choose from.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.350
Is, do we have to ask questions that is the size of

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.870
the set of people? Is it going to be more like the log

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.400
of size of the set of people? Since there's,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.920
you know, lots of difference ways that the person

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.900
can be chosen. Do we have to look at two to the number of people? Or again can

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.610
the learner be as powerful as the teacher, and

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.790
get the whole thing in just a single question?

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.830
Alright, so, is, is, is this a little clearer

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.400
Charles? Can you, can you work this one through?

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think I can work this one through.
