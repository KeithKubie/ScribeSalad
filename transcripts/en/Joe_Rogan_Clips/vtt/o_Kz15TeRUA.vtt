00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.700
Like one of the things that keeps Kanye West relevant is it?

2
00:00:02.701 --> 00:00:07.020
He's constantly putting out music constantly puts out stuff that people love.

3
00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:12.021
He constantly puts his stuff that smashes and some guys lose their enthusiasm

4
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.890
for productivity.
Yeah,
prefer being prolific.

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.130
They lose that and then they don't put out stuff anymore and then they become

6
00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:23.670
like Rod Stewart,
like Rod Stewart.
I'd like to see Rod Stewart.

7
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.600
I'm a giant Rod Stewart Fan.
I like it when Maggie may comes on the radio.

8
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:31.850
I get excited.
I love that Goddamn Song.
I love a lot of his music.
He was,

9
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.430
but how many tickets we sell right now?
You know what I'm saying?

10
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.520
Will he sell out the staples center?
I don't think you will know.
You know,

11
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.170
you know when you,

12
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.680
I know you're still working on Kanye coming on the show and that's not even

13
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.720
though United okay.
Would if he wants to do it,

14
00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:47.910
but I don't want to put any pressure on anybody.
Absolutely.

15
00:00:47.911 --> 00:00:50.580
And I don't necessarily know that podcasts are the best place for someone,

16
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.150
for everybody.
They might not be the best place to just talk about shit.

17
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.710
But did you better just do music?

18
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.890
Did you get to talk to him at least on the phone or what?
Yeah,
yeah.

19
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.060
Very nice guy.
Let me tell you,
man,
he is so opposite his persona,

20
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.180
like on the outside like that you see in like in gossip magazines and on TV I

21
00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:13.200
used to host has done to west foundation a event in Chicago and a lot of people

22
00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:17.310
don't know the good he did in Chicago.
If they had perfect attendance,

23
00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:20.790
he would go there every year,
throw a huge concert,

24
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.590
bringing like a common and all different types of Chicago artists.
He would,
uh,

25
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.420
bus everybody in from all over the city and throw a free concert for all these

26
00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:33.180
kids that had a perfect attendance.

27
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.290
And it was good to interview him that way because he's at that time,

28
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.920
at that time when his mom was still alive,
he was such a down,

29
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.170
down to earth humble guy and actually shy and shy.
Like he was really shy,

30
00:01:46.171 --> 00:01:46.830
still wet.

31
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.600
And this was at the time I would see stories about them yelling at sway,

32
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.930
you know?
Yeah.
And I'm like,
this is not the dude that I interviewed.

33
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.020
He's volatile and it goes all over the place.
Yeah.

34
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.410
That's part of why he's actually explosive artists.
Oh,
he's an incredible,

35
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.190
incredible guy.
Those are the people who think different and maybe that's stupid.

36
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.170
Apple ad think different.
Yeah.

37
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.530
There's people that really do think different differently.

38
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.370
That's one of the problems with that.
Apple had to English grammar,
but they,

39
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.390
there's people out there that just have a different vibe there.

40
00:02:19.391 --> 00:02:21.330
They're on a different frequency.

41
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.480
There are different wave length and they're the ones who create great shit,
man.

42
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.800
He has a gift.
I mean,
he is,
you know,
a lot of people outside go,
oh,

43
00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:31.800
he's out there.
He's definitely out there.
WHO's out there too.
Yeah.

44
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.380
But he's a genius.
He is a genius.

45
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.030
He's doing something in a different way and that's a,

46
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.040
that moves our cultural long.
That's what it's like.

47
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.130
That's what when you're doing stand up,
right?
Like if you're,

48
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.450
if you were nailing something,
if you really locked down something and boom,

49
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:52.110
you put out a live on the sunset strip or a delirious or something like that,

50
00:02:52.111 --> 00:02:55.080
you're changing culture.
You're,
you're making people,

51
00:02:55.081 --> 00:02:57.910
people are going to spread out in these ripples.
Yeah.

52
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.380
We're going to go to their job in the morning like we saw Michael,
Yo,
holy shit.

53
00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:04.050
He does his joke about his cat and whatever the fuck it is,

54
00:03:04.051 --> 00:03:05.790
wherever the choke is,
and people would be crying,

55
00:03:05.791 --> 00:03:10.080
laughing and that there's ripples to that as positive ripples.
You change things.
