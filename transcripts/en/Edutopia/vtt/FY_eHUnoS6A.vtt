00:00:09.156 --> 00:00:11.986
&gt;&gt;All right, everybody listen up.

00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:15.256
&gt;&gt;Narrator: When Barry Guilliot
speaks, his students listen.

00:00:15.256 --> 00:00:18.446
&gt;&gt;Barry: So you're all able to leave
a legacy for our seventh-graders

00:00:18.446 --> 00:00:20.726
for next year by planting
these seeds.

00:00:21.056 --> 00:00:24.056
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It could be his
imposing 6-foot, 5-inch frame,

00:00:24.156 --> 00:00:27.256
or it could be his
impressive background.

00:00:27.256 --> 00:00:29.866
&gt;&gt;Barry: I was a bouncer in a
barroom while I was in college

00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:33.666
in a popular place on Bourbon Street,
and I was a sergeant in the Army

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:37.386
for five years, and I
figured, after all that,

00:00:37.386 --> 00:00:38.816
it really prepared me just perfectly

00:00:38.816 --> 00:00:41.406
to be a middle-school
teacher [laughs].

00:00:41.576 --> 00:00:44.296
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Mostly, people listen
to Guilliot because they've come

00:00:44.296 --> 00:00:47.286
to believe in his crusade
to transform education

00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.516
through service learning.

00:00:48.576 --> 00:00:50.596
&gt;&gt;Barry: Stick your
finger down in the hole

00:00:50.596 --> 00:00:51.866
and drop both seeds in there.

00:00:52.156 --> 00:00:53.026
Cover it up good.

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:56.296
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At Hurst Middle
School in Destrehan, Louisiana,

00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:59.436
his seventh-grade students
learn about the environment

00:00:59.436 --> 00:01:02.596
by preserving part of
it, their own backyard.

00:01:02.976 --> 00:01:05.036
&gt;&gt;Barry: This is a project
called Coastal Roots,

00:01:05.476 --> 00:01:09.316
and the Coastal Roots is to help
the kids appreciate their wetlands

00:01:09.316 --> 00:01:12.056
and give them a feeling of
ownership by doing something

00:01:12.056 --> 00:01:13.546
to help stop the wetland loss.

00:01:13.546 --> 00:01:15.726
One of the key ways of doing
that is by planting trees.

00:01:15.906 --> 00:01:19.276
Having the kids being able to grow
the tree from seeds just makes

00:01:19.276 --> 00:01:20.146
such a big difference to them.

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:22.316
They can see how it all
starts from this little thing.

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:23.926
Plus, that's what we have
to teach them anyway.

00:01:24.156 --> 00:01:26.446
Everything that we do has
to be standards-based.

00:01:26.506 --> 00:01:28.636
If it's not standards-based,
we don't do it.

00:01:28.716 --> 00:01:31.676
So not only are they learning,
but they're also helping out.

00:01:31.676 --> 00:01:34.246
They're making a difference,
and that, in middle school,

00:01:34.246 --> 00:01:36.126
where they're really trying
to figure out who they are

00:01:36.576 --> 00:01:40.116
and where they're going, being able
to be a positive, contributing member

00:01:40.536 --> 00:01:42.386
of the community, I
think, is so important.

00:01:43.176 --> 00:01:46.556
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Guilliot started the
Wetland Watchers program in 1998

00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:50.826
after seeing the educational value
of a service-learning trip he took

00:01:50.886 --> 00:01:53.926
with seventh-graders to the
nearby LaBranche Wetlands.

00:01:55.336 --> 00:01:59.006
His students now plant trees,
monitor water quality...

00:01:59.276 --> 00:02:00.386
&gt;&gt;What's our temperature reading?

00:02:00.536 --> 00:02:01.626
&gt;&gt;26 and a half.

00:02:01.626 --> 00:02:04.426
&gt;&gt;Narrator: ...and educate
others about the wonders of

00:02:04.636 --> 00:02:06.846
and the threats to their ecosystem.

00:02:06.846 --> 00:02:07.026
&gt;&gt;Student: Hi.

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:08.906
Welcome to the Louisiana
Wetland Watchers.

00:02:08.966 --> 00:02:10.956
Today we will talk about
the American alligator,

00:02:10.956 --> 00:02:12.416
which is native to Louisiana.

00:02:12.626 --> 00:02:15.396
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The program started
with meetings to gain the support

00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:18.216
of a few local businesses
and government agencies.

00:02:18.216 --> 00:02:20.586
&gt;&gt;Man: The feedback I get from
our new business partners is,

00:02:21.056 --> 00:02:21.936
"This is amazing!

00:02:21.936 --> 00:02:23.246
I wish I had known about it sooner."

00:02:23.696 --> 00:02:27.946
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Today the program has 35
partners who donate time and money

00:02:27.946 --> 00:02:31.156
to the project's yearlong
activities, which culminate

00:02:31.246 --> 00:02:34.096
in a Wetland Celebration at
the end of the school year.

00:02:35.406 --> 00:02:37.786
&gt;&gt;Kimberly: We initially started
off with roughly five volunteers.

00:02:37.786 --> 00:02:40.816
We're now up to fifty
this year that solely work

00:02:40.906 --> 00:02:43.486
with the LaBranche Wetland Watchers,
which is absolutely incredible.

00:02:43.726 --> 00:02:47.976
&gt;&gt;Man: How about this
area right through here?

00:02:48.756 --> 00:02:49.196
&gt;&gt;Louisiana.

00:02:49.916 --> 00:02:50.646
&gt;&gt;Man: Louisiana, exactly.

00:02:50.646 --> 00:02:52.226
&gt;&gt;Lorel: When I go out
there with the students

00:02:52.226 --> 00:02:54.826
and I see them throwing their
nets in the lake and I'm like,

00:02:55.096 --> 00:02:56.966
"One of those children are
going to fall into that lake,"

00:02:57.376 --> 00:03:00.166
but they haven't yet and
hopefully they never will.

00:03:00.476 --> 00:03:02.056
But I think it's just
important for them

00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:03.666
to get involved in the whole lesson.

00:03:03.786 --> 00:03:06.566
You know, not just to read about
it, not just to hear from teacher

00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:09.346
about it, but to actually live it.

00:03:09.466 --> 00:03:12.976
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Even in the classroom,
learning involves hands-on activity.

00:03:13.176 --> 00:03:14.746
&gt;&gt;Barry: Have you all ever
seen an alligator before?

00:03:14.746 --> 00:03:15.686
Do they have sharp teeth?

00:03:15.686 --> 00:03:17.356
Ooh, does he nip at you?

00:03:18.016 --> 00:03:20.406
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Seventh-graders
become experts in a subject

00:03:20.406 --> 00:03:22.736
by sharing their knowledge
with preschoolers.

00:03:23.316 --> 00:03:24.986
&gt;&gt;Girl: This is an
Australian Bearded Dragon.

00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:28.726
He's native to Louisiana, and if you
want to touch him, you can touch him

00:03:28.726 --> 00:03:29.976
with two fingers on his lower back.

00:03:30.576 --> 00:03:33.116
&gt;&gt;Kurt: This represents the
scales of the alligator.

00:03:33.906 --> 00:03:38.176
Hard, tough, this is to keep it
away from its natural predators.

00:03:38.416 --> 00:03:41.796
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Fun is also a key
part of the learning process,

00:03:41.796 --> 00:03:45.226
as in this illustration
of alligator adaptations.

00:03:45.616 --> 00:03:46.666
&gt;&gt;Kurt: Please stick
out your left hand.

00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:48.196
I said "left."

00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:48.376
&gt;&gt;Students: [Laughter]

00:03:48.376 --> 00:03:52.416
&gt;&gt;Kurt: Okay, you need to spend
a little more time at school.

00:03:52.656 --> 00:03:56.476
Now, the hand is webbed
on an alligator.

00:03:56.776 --> 00:04:01.596
&gt;&gt;Kurt: This has probably been my
favorite class in my school so far

00:04:02.126 --> 00:04:05.746
because it's the one that's
been the most interactive

00:04:05.746 --> 00:04:07.136
and most interesting to me.

00:04:08.266 --> 00:04:09.106
&gt;&gt;Waggle your tail.

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:12.656
&gt;&gt;Kurt: I've been able to learn
a lot more through these programs

00:04:12.976 --> 00:04:15.816
than I probably have sitting
behind a desk copying notes off

00:04:15.816 --> 00:04:16.466
of a chalkboard.

00:04:16.976 --> 00:04:20.326
&gt;&gt;Okay, they use that big old
tail to sway it back and forth,

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:22.596
and it shoots it through
the water like a bullet.

00:04:23.236 --> 00:04:26.666
&gt;&gt;Kurt: Mr. Guilliot is probably one
of the best teachers you can get.

00:04:27.296 --> 00:04:30.546
He's kind of like a big kid, and
he'll do the activities with you

00:04:30.906 --> 00:04:33.106
where you can see firsthand
the right way to do it

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.006
and the fun way to do it.

00:04:34.116 --> 00:04:34.746
&gt;&gt;Barry: Good job, guys.

00:04:34.746 --> 00:04:35.616
Now keep up the good work.

00:04:36.256 --> 00:04:37.726
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Even in
the face of gloom,

00:04:37.726 --> 00:04:40.316
Guilliot maintains
his sense of optimism.

00:04:40.616 --> 00:04:43.416
When a downpour forced the
cancellation of a field trip

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:46.126
to the wetlands, he
asked his team of experts

00:04:46.126 --> 00:04:47.996
to bring their exhibits
to the school.

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:49.686
&gt;&gt;Barry: All right, we
got a special treat here.

00:04:49.686 --> 00:04:52.516
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The rainfall
even provided a rare treat.

00:04:52.516 --> 00:04:54.006
&gt;&gt;Barry: Christian
caught this outside

00:04:54.006 --> 00:04:55.446
of his house in the flood yesterday.

00:04:55.706 --> 00:04:58.766
Even though he looks like a snake or
something like that, he's amphibian,

00:04:58.766 --> 00:05:01.466
and Miss Cheryl is going to tell
you all about him right now.

00:05:01.756 --> 00:05:03.396
&gt;&gt;Cheryl: It's called
an amphiuma, okay?

00:05:03.396 --> 00:05:05.436
&gt;&gt;Barry: And you know
what's neat about teaching

00:05:05.436 --> 00:05:07.786
like that is assessment occurs
in so many different ways.

00:05:07.786 --> 00:05:10.536
If I'm just lecturing, I can
look and see who's still awake,

00:05:10.536 --> 00:05:12.626
but I can't really see
who's understanding.

00:05:12.726 --> 00:05:14.856
&gt;&gt;Student: Oh, so, he's black on
the top and white on the bottom?

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:16.836
&gt;&gt;Cheryl: That's right,
just like a lot of fish.

00:05:16.876 --> 00:05:18.326
It's a type of camouflage.

00:05:18.716 --> 00:05:21.556
&gt;&gt;Barry: When we're busy jumping into
it and they're fooling with stuff

00:05:21.556 --> 00:05:23.956
and moving it around
and all that, I can see.

00:05:23.956 --> 00:05:26.846
I can go over and ask them,
"By the way, what is that?"

00:05:26.916 --> 00:05:29.206
&gt;&gt;Barry: Why would it be white
on the bottom and dark on top?

00:05:29.336 --> 00:05:30.446
&gt;&gt;So it could probably hide itself.

00:05:30.446 --> 00:05:32.156
&gt;&gt;And looking up, it
probably blends with the air.

00:05:32.156 --> 00:05:33.466
&gt;&gt;Cheryl: That's right,
blends with the sky.

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:34.966
&gt;&gt;Barry: When you're looking
down, it looks like the mud.

00:05:34.966 --> 00:05:37.476
If something's underneath and
looking up, it looks like the light.

00:05:37.476 --> 00:05:37.986
Very good.

00:05:37.986 --> 00:05:40.136
&gt;&gt;Barry: And that's an
on-the-spot assessment right there.

00:05:40.136 --> 00:05:41.846
You see, do they understand
it or not?

00:05:42.226 --> 00:05:44.636
&gt;&gt;Man: What would you all think
would fall out of the water first?

00:05:44.796 --> 00:05:45.366
&gt;&gt;The heaviest.

00:05:45.546 --> 00:05:48.666
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Guilliot sees the
value of having more than one voice

00:05:48.666 --> 00:05:50.396
of authority in his classroom.

00:05:50.396 --> 00:05:53.476
&gt;&gt;Man: Now, you can actually see the
particles of sand with your bare eye.

00:05:53.546 --> 00:05:55.626
&gt;&gt;Kind of like little crystals.

00:05:55.766 --> 00:05:59.786
&gt;&gt;Barry: As I know I'm not a soil
expert, where I can call in my ag

00:05:59.786 --> 00:06:01.886
and forestry guy from
Louisiana Ag and Forestry.

00:06:02.176 --> 00:06:04.226
He's been studying dirt for 15 years.

00:06:04.446 --> 00:06:07.716
I understand that they have all these
experts out here that are willing

00:06:07.716 --> 00:06:10.306
to come in and work with my
students, and I want to use

00:06:10.306 --> 00:06:12.976
that so my students are
getting the benefit of this.

00:06:12.976 --> 00:06:15.896
&gt;&gt;Milton: If you look at the first
picture, you see nothing but water,

00:06:16.136 --> 00:06:19.736
and as we've progressed, you can
see now where you have the land.

00:06:20.086 --> 00:06:22.096
&gt;&gt;Milton: You can learn an
awful lot from a textbook,

00:06:22.136 --> 00:06:23.706
but if you can show
them different things,

00:06:23.886 --> 00:06:26.226
it's so much more enlightening,
and a lot of these kids, you know,

00:06:26.226 --> 00:06:28.766
you can just see their
eyes open up and say, "Ooh.

00:06:28.766 --> 00:06:29.756
Ah. Oh, look at this!"

00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:31.696
So, hey, you know you're
getting to them.

00:06:31.696 --> 00:06:35.556
&gt;&gt;We're going to have a beautiful
park out there, and nobody's going

00:06:35.556 --> 00:06:37.726
to realize that hey,
that was once a lake?

00:06:38.346 --> 00:06:41.236
&gt;&gt;Milton: If a little project like
this can have such an impact on them,

00:06:41.496 --> 00:06:43.766
maybe this will ring true
to them and they'll say,

00:06:43.766 --> 00:06:44.986
"Hey, something can be done."

00:06:44.986 --> 00:06:47.406
&gt;&gt;Barry: The factors
that affect pH levels...

00:06:47.456 --> 00:06:51.656
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For Guilliot, empowering
students is the most rewarding part

00:06:51.656 --> 00:06:52.336
of the job.

00:06:52.466 --> 00:06:53.806
&gt;&gt;Acidic rainfall.

00:06:54.016 --> 00:06:56.566
&gt;&gt;Barry: One of the essays
I read said, "If the animals

00:06:56.566 --> 00:07:00.016
and plants could talk, I think
they would say we're their heroes

00:07:00.016 --> 00:07:03.686
because that's the way I feel when
we do our work in the wetlands."

00:07:04.186 --> 00:07:07.416
And it just, you know, it hits you.

00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:09.796
As a teacher, you say, "Oh, my God.

00:07:10.276 --> 00:07:13.796
Something that I designed made
this kid feel like a hero?"

00:07:14.506 --> 00:07:17.926
And I was like, "Man,
that is just so cool."

00:07:18.016 --> 00:07:22.706
And, gosh, even if they don't
remember an adaptation for an animal,

00:07:22.706 --> 00:07:25.016
if they just remember that feeling,

00:07:25.216 --> 00:07:29.196
then I feel like I've been
successful, and I really love

00:07:29.236 --> 00:07:30.586
that responsibility as a teacher.

00:07:30.586 --> 00:07:32.306
I don't want to be a principal.

00:07:32.476 --> 00:07:33.836
I don't want to be a superintendent.

00:07:33.836 --> 00:07:35.776
I want to be a teacher where I deal

00:07:35.776 --> 00:07:37.526
with these kids every
day down in the trenches.

00:07:37.616 --> 00:07:39.576
