00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
I guess glitch is a glitch was too but
 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
I guess glitch is a glitch was too but
it<00:05:23.450><c> didn't</c><00:05:23.690><c> feel</c><00:05:25.090><c> this</c><00:05:26.090><c> one</c><00:05:26.300><c> just</c><00:05:26.479><c> felt</c><00:05:26.780><c> so</c><00:05:27.350><c> I</c>

it didn't feel this one just felt so I
 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.790 align:start position:0%
it didn't feel this one just felt so I

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
mean it was awkward again I guess like
 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.110 align:start position:0%
mean it was awkward again I guess like
how<00:05:30.919><c> glitches</c><00:05:31.130><c> the</c><00:05:31.400><c> glitches</c><00:05:31.700><c> but</c><00:05:31.850><c> I</c><00:05:31.940><c> felt</c>

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
how glitches the glitches but I felt
 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.700 align:start position:0%
how glitches the glitches but I felt

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 align:start position:0%
more comfortable in its awkwardness it

out<00:05:42.919><c> of</c><00:05:42.979><c> it</c><00:05:43.220><c> but</c><00:05:43.370><c> for</c><00:05:43.490><c> the</c><00:05:43.580><c> most</c><00:05:43.700><c> part</c><00:05:43.789><c> it's</c>

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 align:start position:0%
out of it but for the most part it's
 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.670 align:start position:0%
out of it but for the most part it's
just<00:05:44.180><c> sort</c><00:05:44.300><c> of</c><00:05:44.360><c> like</c><00:05:44.419><c> I</c><00:05:44.660><c> think</c><00:05:44.750><c> that</c><00:05:45.110><c> I</c><00:05:45.350><c> was</c>

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
just sort of like I think that I was
 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.710 align:start position:0%
just sort of like I think that I was
supposed<00:05:46.039><c> to</c><00:05:46.130><c> snicker</c><00:05:46.460><c> at</c><00:05:46.669><c> that</c><00:05:46.850><c> but</c><00:05:47.180><c> it</c>

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
supposed to snicker at that but it
 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.510 align:start position:0%
supposed to snicker at that but it
didn't<00:05:48.020><c> work</c><00:05:48.080><c> where</c><00:05:48.590><c> this</c><00:05:48.710><c> one</c><00:05:48.950><c> was</c><00:05:49.160><c> more</c><00:05:49.310><c> like</c>

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
didn't work where this one was more like
 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.659 align:start position:0%
didn't work where this one was more like
just<00:05:49.820><c> the</c><00:05:49.970><c> feeling</c><00:05:50.539><c> and</c><00:05:50.840><c> the</c><00:05:51.620><c> mood</c><00:05:51.979><c> is</c>

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 align:start position:0%
just the feeling and the mood is
 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.469 align:start position:0%
just the feeling and the mood is
supposed<00:05:53.000><c> to</c><00:05:53.060><c> be</c><00:05:53.210><c> kind</c><00:05:53.419><c> of</c><00:05:53.539><c> funny</c><00:05:53.780><c> and</c><00:05:54.110><c> strange</c>

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 align:start position:0%
supposed to be kind of funny and strange
 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.750 align:start position:0%
supposed to be kind of funny and strange
so<00:05:56.479><c> that's</c><00:05:57.380><c> what</c><00:05:57.560><c> I</c><00:05:57.590><c> took</c><00:05:57.740><c> out</c><00:05:58.010><c> of</c><00:05:58.039><c> it</c><00:05:58.160><c> I</c><00:05:58.340><c> I</c>

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
so that's what I took out of it I I
 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.909 align:start position:0%
so that's what I took out of it I I

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:53.350 align:start position:0%
shaded and they blend in very nicely so
 

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
shaded and they blend in very nicely so
it's<00:11:53.470><c> sort</c><00:11:53.649><c> of</c><00:11:53.680><c> a</c><00:11:53.740><c> nice</c><00:11:53.920><c> variety</c><00:11:54.130><c> in</c><00:11:54.579><c> there</c><00:11:54.760><c> too</c>

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:00.750 align:start position:0%
yeah which I like um I think that's what
it<00:11:57.910><c> has</c><00:11:57.940><c> going</c><00:11:58.300><c> for</c><00:11:58.480><c> it</c><00:11:58.930><c> for</c><00:11:59.470><c> me</c><00:11:59.770><c> particularly</c>

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
it has going for it for me particularly
 

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
it has going for it for me particularly
is<00:12:01.420><c> that</c><00:12:01.450><c> I</c><00:12:01.990><c> can</c><00:12:02.800><c> almost</c><00:12:03.010><c> forgive</c><00:12:03.640><c> the</c><00:12:03.940><c> lack</c><00:12:04.240><c> of</c>

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:04.270 align:start position:0%
is that I can almost forgive the lack of

is that I can almost forgive the lack of
story<00:12:04.899><c> and</c><00:12:05.260><c> honestly</c><00:12:05.829><c> it's</c><00:12:06.310><c> probably</c><00:12:06.550><c> one</c><00:12:06.970><c> of</c>

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
story and honestly it's probably one of
 

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.790 align:start position:0%
story and honestly it's probably one of
the<00:12:07.149><c> most</c><00:12:07.240><c> pointless</c><00:12:07.660><c> episodes</c><00:12:08.290><c> there</c><00:12:08.560><c> are</c>

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
the most pointless episodes there are
 

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.910 align:start position:0%
the most pointless episodes there are
yeah<00:12:09.270><c> but</c><00:12:10.270><c> you</c><00:12:10.810><c> know</c><00:12:10.930><c> obviously</c><00:12:11.320><c> you</c><00:12:11.649><c> probably</c>
