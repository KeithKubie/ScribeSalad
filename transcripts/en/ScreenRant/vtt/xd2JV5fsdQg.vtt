00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.410
Everyone wants to be the hero, but it’s
not always worse to be the second banana.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.400
Throughout Hollywood history, some of the
most memorable characters have been of the

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.880
supporting variety, giving their leading man
or woman a helping hand throughout their adventure.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.600
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Greatest Movie
Sidekicks.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.410
Dr. King Schultz – Django Unchained

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.510
On a mission to save his wife from the vicious
Calvin Candie, Django is accompanied by his

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.190
partner and mentor Dr. King Schultz; the man
who not only showed the film’s hero the

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.000
ropes of the bounty hunting business, but
became his greatest friend, treating him as

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.519
an equal during their time together.

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.039
Through their interactions, it was easy to
see that Schultz loved and admired Django

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.410
for a number of reasons.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.969
Their bond is what makes Schultz’s death
all the more upsetting, but also made Django’s

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:56.460
final revenge even sweeter.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.050
The term “sidekick” may sell Schultz’s
role short, but with Django the obvious hero,

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.450
actor Christoph Waltz simply did that good
a job in playing second fiddle.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.540
Ron and Hermione – Harry Potter films

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.990
At a young age, Harry Potter is proclaimed
as the saviour of the wizard world and the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.799
only person capable of stopping the Dark Lord
Voldemort.

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.840
That’s enough to make any teenager crack,
but luckily Harry had his two best friends

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.590
Ron and Hermione to help him along the way.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.860
Throughout the series, the two brought valuable
traits to the table: smarts, loyalty, and

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:31.860
courage.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.950
All of which were useful in aiding Harry complete
his quests.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.439
From playing a deadly game of wizard’s chess
to tracking down the Deathly Hallows, Ron

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.950
and Hermione displayed bravery well beyond
their years to make the trio a well-rounded

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.030
unit.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.710
Walter – The Big Lebowski

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.020
His methods may be a tad extreme for some,
but the rule-abiding Walter is a great friend

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.109
nonetheless.

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:59.179
As the Dude tries to make sense of his mistaken
identity caper, Walter was there every step

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.649
of the way, doing whatever was necessary in
the name of helping his friend.

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.740
It takes a special relationship to take a
crowbar to a new car, or put your religious

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.100
beliefs aside in the name of accomplishing
the mission, and for all their disagreements,

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.660
it’s clear the Dude and Walter are inseparable
pals.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.230
As the film’s hero would see it, they act
as yin and yang, with Walter representing

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.750
the more brash emotion to Dude’s laid-back
worldview.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.520
Not to mention asking the question we often
ask ourselves.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.739
Short Round – Indiana Jones and the Temple
of Doom

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.340
Indiana Jones had many allies, but few could
top the youngster Short Round.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.010
Despite his age, the kid proved that he had
a knack for archeology, with his intuition

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.170
and courage his most valuable assets.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.490
He’s arguably the true hero of the series’
second film, essentially saving Indy from

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.040
mind control and leading the charge in rescuing
the movie’s kidnapped children.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.840
Short Round’s emotional connection with
Dr. Jones made him a fan-favorite, and his

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.349
strong moral compass was always there to guide
Indy down the right path.

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.909
It’s a shame these two never got another
adventure.

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.269
But with Temple of Doom set before Raiders
of the Lost Ark, maybe Short Round played

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.220
a bigger role in shaping the legendary tomb-raider
then fans realize.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.530
Wilson – Cast Away

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.830
When Chuck Noland is stranded on a desert
island, he resorts to talking to a volleyball

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:08.980
to preserve his sanity.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.069
As you might expect, Wilson proves to be an
excellent listener and the best companion

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.069
a castaway could have.

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.689
Resembling a bloody handprint with eyes, Wilson
provided Chuck with an outlet to discuss his

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:22.980
life and personal connections to the outside
world, reminding him of the reason to stay

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.860
alive, and make his way off the island.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:33.100
We’ll never know exactly how Chuck imagined
Wilson responding to his muttering and musings,

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.959
but the volleyball was much, much more than
an inanimate object, offering the final inspiration

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.220
he needed to escape.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.510
And their farewell?

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.530
As heartbreaking as goodbyes can get.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:54.370
Thankfully, the film’s final scene shows
that Wilson is destined to return.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.220
Spock – Star Trek

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.510
A bold rule-breaker like Captain James Kirk
needs someone who specializes in logic to

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.870
balance out his tendencies.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.780
That’s what makes Spock the perfect sidekick
to the Enterprise captain.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.940
The Vulcan’s ability to analyze every situation
and determine the best possible solution makes

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.430
him a valuable ally, and his unwillingness
to let emotions get the best of him ensures

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.390
he’s cool-headed under pressure.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.739
Intelligent and faithful to the point of sacrificing
his life for his crew, Spock compliments Kirk

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.840
in every way, illustrating why they’re destined
to be friends for all time – whether they

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.950
like it or not.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.660
Groot – Guardians of the Galaxy

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.780
Due to his limited vocabulary and general
aloofness, Groot doesn’t inspire confidence

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:35.780
at first glance.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.610
But when push comes to shove, he’s the kind
of friend anyone would be happy to have.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.210
His heart is always in the right place, as
the wellbeing of his friends is his top priority.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.430
Groot also stands for what is right, setting
off to make millions in Marvel’s space adventure,

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.669
but willingly fighting to protect the people
of Xandar from total destruction.

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.340
The emotional center of the team, capable
of turning even the hardened Rocket into a

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.419
big softie, it’s impossible not to tear
up when he shields his teammates from a crash

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.820
landing in the movie’s final battle.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.610
We are Groot, indeed.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.169
Hit-Girl – Kick-Ass

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.750
When Dave Lizewski decides to become the superhero
Kick-Ass, he realizes he can’t do it on

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.750
his own.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.190
Luckily, he meets Mindy, aka Hit-Girl, partnering
up to show organized crime that they’ve

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.340
finally met their match.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.200
Trained by her ex-cop father to become a fierce
crime fighter and seek revenge for her mother’s

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.560
death, Hit-Girl is not your typical kid.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.080
No-nonsense and tough to take down in a fight,
her skills rival those of the older Kick-Ass

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.600
and show that it’s wise to have her on your
side.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.260
Though Dave is told to look after Mindy, it’s
clear she can take care of herself.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.940
Sidekick doesn’t do her justice.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.460
Chewbacca – Star Wars

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.630
Everyone needs a co-pilot, and Han Solo has
the best in the galaxy.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.569
Devoted to Han because of a life debt, Chewie
is always by his best friend’s side with

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:58.669
a heart of gold and a great sense of loyalty.

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.400
His physical strength makes him plenty useful
in a fight against Imperial stormtroopers,

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.840
but his best trait is his moral center.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.070
Motivated more by helping his companions than
selfish smuggler profits, Chewie is instrumental

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.020
in sending Han down the path of becoming a
Galactic hero.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.370
Any Star Wars fan would want a Wookie friend
of their own, and Chewie’s dedication illustrates

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.580
why they really are man’s best friends in
a galaxy far, far away.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.759
Samwise Gamgee – Lord of the Rings

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:26.449
It was Frodo Baggins’s plan to destroy the
Ring of Power by heading to Mount Doom all

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:31.490
by himself, but Samwise made a promise to
never leave his best friend, and in the end,

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.160
the Lord of the Rings trilogy only had a happy
ending because of his presence.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.330
Incorruptible and fiercely loyal, he always
made sure Frodo stayed on task as his burden

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.419
became heavier to bear.

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:45.240
Whenever his master was ready to give up,
Sam would provide words of encouragement and

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.449
motivation to renew his dedication.

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:52.020
Risking his life on several occasions and
showing unbelievable courage, “Samwise the

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.280
Brave” exemplified what a sidekick should
offer.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.820
The fact that he was one of the only creatures
to ever give up the One Ring willingly has

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.020
us convinced he was a hero in disguise all
along.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.160
Those are our picks for the best movie sidekicks.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.330
Are there any we missed?
