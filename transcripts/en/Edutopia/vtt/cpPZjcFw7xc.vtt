&gt;&gt;It's not an "s", it sounds
like it, what does it sound like?

00:00:03.576 --> 00:00:03.656
&gt;&gt;"C"?

00:00:03.926 --> 00:00:04.426
&gt;&gt;There you go.

00:00:04.916 --> 00:00:09.196
&gt;&gt;Donna Barrier: The way we
deliver RTI has everything to do

00:00:09.296 --> 00:00:12.126
with the end results that we've
seen for student achievement.

00:00:12.516 --> 00:00:18.426
Today there is a small discrepancy
between our highest achieving students

00:00:18.946 --> 00:00:20.686
and our lowest achieving students.

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:33.226
&gt;&gt;Beth Rickerman: Our overall vision
and mission would be for every child

00:00:33.456 --> 00:00:38.396
to experience success at their
level, whatever that level may be.

00:00:38.626 --> 00:00:40.886
&gt;&gt;Amanda Kuhlman: RTI is "response
to intervention", it's making sure

00:00:40.886 --> 00:00:45.126
that every child receives the support
that he or she needs at any given time

00:00:45.476 --> 00:00:46.856
and that might change weekly.

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:50.896
&gt;&gt;Mary Krenke: It's a team
atmosphere and over these past years

00:00:50.896 --> 00:00:54.206
with the RTI the walls have come
down, we're all in it together.

00:00:54.206 --> 00:00:56.666
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I could take
some of your kids to rea--

00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:59.236
just for the "Read Naturally" part
if your groups are too big, you know?

00:00:59.356 --> 00:01:00.746
&gt;&gt;Donna Barrier: Through
the years we moved

00:01:00.816 --> 00:01:04.616
from being segmented individual
classrooms to what you see today.

00:01:05.626 --> 00:01:08.766
Everything is done by
the grade-level team.

00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.946
When we first started moving students

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:15.756
about in the building some parents
had a few questions, "You mean,

00:01:15.756 --> 00:01:18.226
my child won't be in
one classroom all day?"

00:01:18.916 --> 00:01:23.526
No, we're going to try to provide
more targeted instruction working

00:01:23.526 --> 00:01:25.926
with them in small groups.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.486
&gt;&gt;The rest of my friends
are gonna join me.

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:29.346
Grab a stool and a pencil.

00:01:29.916 --> 00:01:31.366
Take a look at the first problem.

00:01:31.876 --> 00:01:34.836
&gt;&gt;Mary Krenke: The difference is
between the tiers, tier one, tier two,

00:01:34.836 --> 00:01:37.626
and tier three is tier one
is the general population,

00:01:37.976 --> 00:01:39.486
universal instruction.

00:01:39.556 --> 00:01:41.576
&gt;&gt;The snowman's nose is a carrot!

00:01:41.826 --> 00:01:44.376
&gt;&gt;The snowman's nose is a carrot!

00:01:44.376 --> 00:01:45.386
&gt;&gt;What word should we underline?

00:01:45.476 --> 00:01:47.126
&gt;&gt;Group and Teacher: Carrot.

00:01:47.576 --> 00:01:51.716
&gt;&gt;Amanda Kuhlman: Tier two is when a
student is not seeing their potential.

00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:54.526
They are receiving a small group
in addition to the tier one--

00:01:54.796 --> 00:01:58.876
so outside of my classroom or with
me at a different time of the day.

00:01:58.876 --> 00:02:03.096
&gt;&gt;Melanie Lyons: They're always in a
small group, usually no bigger than six,

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:05.726
with a teacher, with a paraprofessional.

00:02:06.036 --> 00:02:09.136
&gt;&gt;Dara Dutcher: Using an
intervention, using the technology.

00:02:09.226 --> 00:02:10.156
&gt;&gt;Amanda Kuhlman: Oh,
this one looks cool.

00:02:13.156 --> 00:02:15.996
&gt;&gt;Dara Dutcher: Tier three
is even further intervention.

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:18.926
I pull them a separate
time during the day

00:02:18.926 --> 00:02:22.466
to give them an extra
push of instruction.

00:02:22.966 --> 00:02:27.996
&gt;&gt;Melanie Lyons: That is with groups
from one, two, maybe three and they get

00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:30.406
that about three to four times a week.

00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:33.066
&gt;&gt;Our b- buried...

00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:34.406
&gt;&gt;Very good, Norman.

00:02:34.406 --> 00:02:36.526
&gt;&gt;...deep inside the earth.

00:02:36.886 --> 00:02:39.206
&gt;&gt;Brooklyn: Instead of having to
have one teacher the whole time,

00:02:39.206 --> 00:02:42.576
then I get to go to different teachers
and experience, like, new classrooms.

00:02:42.946 --> 00:02:45.446
It was kinda hard to learn my
schedule in the first week,

00:02:45.446 --> 00:02:46.936
but in the second week I got it down.

00:02:47.206 --> 00:02:49.326
&gt;&gt;Dara Dutcher: Okay, if you are one
of Mrs. Rickerman's friends you need

00:02:49.326 --> 00:02:51.296
to grab your Chromes, head
on out to guided math.

00:02:54.096 --> 00:02:55.266
&gt;&gt;Donna Barrier: The students
are very proud of what they do.

00:02:55.266 --> 00:02:59.256
They feel empowered to move
from teacher to teacher.

00:03:00.736 --> 00:03:02.806
They feel in charge of their day.

00:03:03.046 --> 00:03:06.486
&gt;&gt;Heather: My oldest child struggles
in reading, so he goes with a group

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:08.596
of students that are like himself.

00:03:08.596 --> 00:03:11.316
So he's not stuck in one classroom

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:15.346
that has twenty-two kids
with different levels.

00:03:15.416 --> 00:03:19.076
So I think he's gonna get some
individual attention in those areas

00:03:19.076 --> 00:03:21.766
and he doesn't have to
feel like he's out of place

00:03:21.766 --> 00:03:23.436
because he's not at the top.

00:03:23.686 --> 00:03:26.036
&gt;&gt;Amanda Kuhlman: You know, if you
see a child who is completely lost

00:03:26.036 --> 00:03:30.506
in a general ed classroom all day
long that wears on a kid emotionally,

00:03:30.506 --> 00:03:34.356
socially, and academically,
obviously, and with the RTI program,

00:03:34.636 --> 00:03:37.396
they're receiving support
that's planned for them.

00:03:37.786 --> 00:03:40.076
&gt;&gt;The small group I think is
helping, 'cause he feels--

00:03:40.156 --> 00:03:40.496
&gt;&gt;Confident?

00:03:40.796 --> 00:03:41.766
&gt;&gt;He feels confident.

00:03:42.216 --> 00:03:42.296
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:44.176
&gt;&gt;Right. Less threatening, too.

00:03:44.176 --> 00:03:44.966
&gt;&gt;It is less threatening.

00:03:45.056 --> 00:03:46.126
&gt;&gt;In class he's lost.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.046
He's just not--

00:03:47.046 --> 00:03:47.416
&gt;&gt;All right.

00:03:47.486 --> 00:03:50.416
So if you look at our sheets that
we have that show where they're at,

00:03:50.636 --> 00:03:52.726
is there anybody that we need to adjust?

00:03:53.286 --> 00:03:55.796
&gt;&gt;Dara Dutcher: We do have to
meet a lot grade-level-wise.

00:03:55.796 --> 00:03:58.406
We have to share a lot of information.

00:03:58.536 --> 00:04:00.466
&gt;&gt;Mary Krenke: Sitting down
and talking about our students

00:04:00.466 --> 00:04:03.136
that we are concerned about, they're
tier two, they're tier three.

00:04:03.516 --> 00:04:04.526
What can we do?

00:04:04.526 --> 00:04:07.296
'Cause ultimately that is our goal
is to get them back on tier one.

00:04:07.396 --> 00:04:08.486
&gt;&gt;Amanda Kuhlman: You
know, every three weeks

00:04:08.486 --> 00:04:09.976
or so we might have a group of changes.

00:04:10.366 --> 00:04:14.966
&gt;&gt;My A.H. is at a ten and I'm thinking
we might want to bump him to tier three.

00:04:14.966 --> 00:04:15.206
&gt;&gt;Okay.

00:04:15.306 --> 00:04:19.876
&gt;&gt;Our data is consistently showing
that they're making progress.

00:04:20.306 --> 00:04:25.226
&gt;&gt;The other person that's in
your room, Rachel, is J.C.

00:04:25.506 --> 00:04:26.996
&gt;&gt;He is reading like crazy.

00:04:27.146 --> 00:04:27.386
&gt;&gt;No!

00:04:27.386 --> 00:04:30.066
&gt;&gt;Yes! &gt;Right before Christmas
break maybe moving him back

00:04:30.286 --> 00:04:32.196
to tier one and see what he can do.

00:04:32.396 --> 00:04:33.356
That's awesome.

00:04:33.476 --> 00:04:37.936
&gt;&gt;Donna Barrier: Over the years our
special education numbers have greatly

00:04:37.936 --> 00:04:39.856
diminished due to our RTI.

00:04:40.366 --> 00:04:45.306
Today, we only have about four
percent of our student population

00:04:45.306 --> 00:04:47.696
that receives special
education services.

00:04:48.036 --> 00:04:49.706
&gt;&gt;Excellent.

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.816
&gt;&gt;You know, at the end of the year
our students really make gains

00:04:51.816 --> 00:04:54.166
when looking at reading tests.

00:04:54.256 --> 00:04:55.846
&gt;&gt;This type of programming works.
