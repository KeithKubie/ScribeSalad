00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.900
Hi, I'm Pavni Diwanji.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.310
I'm a VP at Google.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.060
I work on Google for Kids.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.970
If I had a chance
to go back in time

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.620
and meet myself as a young
girl, what would I say to her?

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.830
I would say, be
curious, be creative.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.240
Math and art are two of
your favorite subjects,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.040
and that is fabulous.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.810
Keep tinkering.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.670
Cultivate your passion,
because that is going

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.070
to be an amazing life for you.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.300
The second thing I
would say is, remember

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.780
that friend that came and
said, clever isn't cool?

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.100
Don't listen.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.790
Don't worry about what
other people have to say.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.790
You have a very strong core.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.760
Just focus on what you want to
do and what your beliefs are,

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.940
and the rest will
take care of itself.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.030
And then the third thing I want
to say to you is, you are bold.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.440
You're outspoken.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.239
And yes, that means sometimes
you get into trouble.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.400
But that's OK, because bold
means you can think big.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.130
You can go on adventures.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.520
You can follow paths that
no one is going to follow.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.450
And that is what is
going to make life

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.220
an amazing journey for you.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.830
So be you.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.790
Don't change.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.810
You're perfect.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.600
Thank you.
