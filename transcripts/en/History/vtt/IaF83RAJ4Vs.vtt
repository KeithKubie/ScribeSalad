00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.369
MIKE: We're at Bobby's

00:00:02.369 --> 00:00:06.339
And after looking at
his 1967 Jaguar XKE,

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:09.976
and we get back to
the 36 Knuckle engine.

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:13.780
The serial number on
this side is incredible.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.282
You know, obviously, this one
being the low serial number,

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:18.251
and then the belly
number as well.

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:20.453
The other side of the case--

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:22.489
this is the issue with it here.

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.792
So what I know so far is,
it's got a later oil pump,

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:27.794
the heads are
correct, but they need

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:31.798
work, the cylinders are wrong,
the belly numbers don't match.

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:34.300
I'm taking all of this
into consideration

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.370
with trying to gauge
the value of this thing.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.607
The way it sits right now
with what you have that's

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:49.749
correct and incorrect,
I'd do $15,000.

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:52.552
I don't know about 15.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.954
What's your-- what's
your bottom on it?

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:57.490
I guess, bottom, we go 18,500.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.793
What do you think?

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:03.496
With everything wrong with
this engine, the one thing

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:06.332
that's right is that it's '36.

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:07.400
It's first year.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.302
And that's what I'm
hanging my hat on.

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:13.106
And it's a big deal that
Bobby put a number on it.

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:16.075
If everything goes right,
you know-- because I mean,

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:17.877
it needs the correct
push rod tubes.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:19.179
It needs the correct cylinders.

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.281
I mean, there's things to
acquire to build the engine.

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:23.883
But once you get the things
to build the engine, I mean,

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:25.919
it's going to cost 7,000
bucks to build the engine.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.253
Right.

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:29.255
MIKE: I know what it's going
to cost to build this engine

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:31.691
and to get the correct parts.

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:33.726
First engine.

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:35.495
No, I know.

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:38.264
It's not the very-- man,
just think that it was 1001.

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.399
Yeah, I know.

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.000
Well, what is it--
two something?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.836
MIKE: It's 229.

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:44.671
I'm hypnotized by this thing.

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:46.072
I don't want to leave it.

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:50.009
I really feel like, if you've
got a fork, maybe some fenders,

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.178
and you've got an
engine, you can

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:53.480
probably start building a bike.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.715
I want to treat you the
way I would want someone

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:57.717
to treat me with my stuff.

00:01:57.717 --> 00:02:00.253
Because when I'm gone, you
know, I'm going to have a lot

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:01.488
of stuff too, laying around.

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:04.858
And somebody's going to
buy stuff off my family.

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:06.192
I'd do 17 grand on it.

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:16.503
Well, if you give me 17,5000
now, you can walk away with it.

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:20.840
I'm going to do it.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.842
It ain't like you
see them everyday.

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:23.943
I love the low serial number.

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:25.879
I love the history of
it with your family.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:26.980
Your dad was smart
to pick it up.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.082
He was smart to keep
it all these years.

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:30.116
And--
- Stashed in the basement.

00:02:30.116 --> 00:02:31.518
--it's obvious,
looking around here--

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:32.218
BOBBY: Stashed in the basement.
MIKE: --that he understood it.

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:33.086
He understood all of it.

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:34.354
Yeah, live to ride.

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:35.722
MIKE: Well, it's going to
be back on the road again.

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:36.823
I can guarantee you that.

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:38.291
I seen his eyes light up.

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:39.325
I knew that.

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:41.060
That's the one
everybody's always after.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.630
So I'm glad to see that
it went someplace good.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.231
Let's carry it out.
You got that side?

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:47.166
[grunts]
- I'll clear your way.

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:48.701
MIKE: I think Bobby
knows that I'm

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:52.038
the guy that's going to get this
back on the road just the way

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:53.106
his father--
[cash register dings]

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:54.107
--would have wanted.

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:55.208
- All right.
- All right.

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:57.777
You got it?
- [inaudible]

00:02:57.777 --> 00:03:00.013
Treat them like
it's a little baby.

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:02.215
I think my dad's
happy that the motor's

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:03.583
going to be back out there.

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:04.784
I feel good about it.

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:06.185
Hey, man.

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:06.886
We got there.

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:07.787
Appreciate you.

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:08.988
Hey.

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:11.925
I love talking to guys
that are into motorcycles

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:15.628
as much as I am, especially
when it's generational.

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:16.863
God bless you guys.
All right.

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:17.664
Thank you.
- Take care.

00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:18.464
All right.
Be good now.

00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:19.832
See you on the road.

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:24.337
The old man had that big of an
impact on Bobby and his son.

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:27.373
And it's cool to hear
them talk about him

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:31.144
and to see them be in that
space with those bikes.

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:33.980
Because now, it's
their real estate.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:34.914
It's their time.

00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:36.549
[horn honks]
Roll on!

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.284
BOBBY: All right.
