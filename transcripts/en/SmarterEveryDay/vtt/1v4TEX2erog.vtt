00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.000
Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. 
So if you want to become

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.010
smart in any particular field you have to go talk to the experts. 
This is why I went

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.020
to Germany to a guy named Jörg Sprave. [thunder]
Now today we're gonna learn about

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.030
the physics of slingshots but before we do that, 
let's just have some fun shooting.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.030
You're getting Smarter Every Day. 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.060
So today we are in Germany at a 300 year old 
dairy farm in a small village.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.080
Jörg, so what are we gonna do?
- Well we're gonna see Tobias

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.090
shooting, and Tobias is actually the current 
world record holder for the

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.100
strongest handheld slingshot, 
so getting more than a hundred joules

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.120
with the handheld slingshot. 
So we're gonna try to kill this good German beer.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.140
We've been shaking this a bit. Let's hope for the best.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.180
[cheering]

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.200
Oh man.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.210
[laughing]

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.220
Ja. That's the way.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.230
[music]

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.300
[laughing] Oh man.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.340
(Jorg) It's really dark red love the color.
(Destin) Arrgh it looks like a skull.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.370
It's pretty wild
(Destin) It is dark red.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.530
(Destin) Awesome. High five! We give high fives in America.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.300
[laughs]
High five Jörg. Nice.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.630
Elastic is a pretty interesting material.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.640
Alright so here's our graph. 
So if we want to add energy to the system,

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.660
meaning increase the potential energy 
on the bands of the slingshot,

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.700
all you have to do is pull back the bands, obviously. 
But the thing

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.710
about this is when you pull the bands back, 
the further you pull the more difficult it

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.750
gets to pull. Let me show you. 
If you look at this force gauge the further I pull

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.770
the more difficult it becomes. 
If I were to plot the

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.790
potential energy going into the system 
versus the displacement as I pull back,

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.820
because it gets harder it's not a linear graph, 
it's actually a curved function.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.840
So here's something else. As I release the projectile 
and then it begins to accelerate

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.860
out of the pouch down towards the fork, 
it's going to also

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.880
have this curved function because of the 
material properties there, but here's

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.890
the interesting part. 
If you were to add up the potential energy still left

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.940
in the band, and the kinetic energy of the projectile 
going towards the fork

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.960
at any point along the displacement 
going back towards the fork, they would equal

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.990
approximately the total energy that I put into the system. 
OK the last

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.010
property of elastic I didn't understand until I saw some of Jörg's experiments. As you pull the bands

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.030
back they heat up. But if you hold them there and allow them to cool off,

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.050
you're losing energy. 
So what this means is the total potential energy

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.080
in the system is going to go down, 
so your projectile will be slower if you

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.080
sit there and wait and let your bands cool off. 
Why do you think that happens?

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.090
Jörg you want to explain it a little bit?
(Jörg) Yes. Tobias' record shot

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.100
was shooting a 20mm steel ball at 83m/s

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.820
which is 115 joules.
(Destin) OK ready.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.150
(Jorg) How he acheives that is by

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.220
drawing out and firing immediately without any kind of break,

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.280
so that the rubber is still at full force and it doesn't lose

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.290
power through the hysteresis that otherwise happens.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.800
Oooh! [laughing]

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.350
(Destin) Good grief. How thick is this?

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.460
Oh yeah. 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.380
This is a Frustum. A frustum is when you try to distribute a stress throughout a material.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.390
OK here I have two bands and they're C-clamped to the barn, and as I go down the length of

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.400
the band you can see the one on the left is tapered to a smaller width than the one on the right.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.420
So clearly if I put weight on each of them,

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.430
then the one on the left you would assume would stretch more because it has less material

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.450
resisting the stretch right? OK yeah, that makes sense.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.460
So if we were to fire a slingshot with both a tapered band and an untapered

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.480
band, I would assume that the one on the right, the untapered band would

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.530
accellerate the projectile faster right? No. That's not what happens

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.600
at all. And the slingshot community has known this for years but they never had the rock solid evidence.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.610
So that's what Jörg and I did with the Phantom high speed camera. We fired

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.620
two different slingshots at 1000 frames per second. The one on the top here

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.640
is an untapered band, the one on the bottom is a tapered band. The top band

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.660
is clearly accellerating slower than the bottom band.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.670
My theory is pretty simple. Every solid material has what is called a stress strain curve

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.690
Stress is the force per unit cross sectional area on the material as you pull it.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.720
Strain is the percentage that it elongates as you pull it.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.730
You are probably putting more strain energy into the system.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.750
OK in summary, we went to two different continents, I learned two things and I'm gonna

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.770
ask you two questions. First thing I learned. The potential energy in a stretched

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.800
rubber band is conserved, however it is rapidly dissipated in the form of heat.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.810
The second thing, for slingshots a tapered band is more efficient or effective at

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.830
converting potential energy into kinetic energy. Here's a little bonus.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.880
In 1660 a guy named Robert Hooke discovered the law of elasticity, or

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.950
Hookes Law. Here's the interesting thing. The rubber in

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.970
a rubber band does not obey the law of elasticity. I'll leave a link

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.990
in the description so you can read about that, but spoiler alert, some of your physics books might be wrong.

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.000
Anyway, here's the two questions for you. Number one. Why does rubber

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.010
lose energy when it cools off? I.e. I can shoot a rubber band farther

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.050
if I just pull it back and let it go. And the second thing, why are tapered bands more efficient?

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.120
Help me figure this out. I'm Destin. Thank you very much for watching.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.630
Enjoy the outtakes.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.150
Jorg's really good, and I wanted to go from a superficial

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.170
knowledge about how elastic works to a deep understanding. But before we look into the physics

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.180
of slingshots... let's just shoot. I just messed that up.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.200
even though I hit it. Blah! We're using less reactive

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.210
material to fire something faster [goat bleating]
Come on in.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.230
Come on in.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.258
...talk about slingshots. I wanted to learn...

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.275
[whispered] oh no. 

00:06:37.295 --> 00:06:38.290
When I first saw you I

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.340
though you were kind of a sissy so I'm glad to see that you're not. [laugh]

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.350
I'm only talking like this because his hand is

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.370
hurt and he can't punch me.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.390
...so I wanted to go from a deep...

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.990
I'm killing myself here. I can't talk. 

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:03.440
...tapered one actually deflects more. But here's the interesting part. It.. goat.. really.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.460
... I wanted to learn about the elasticity of...

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:12.470
Aah!

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.490
...Jörg Sprave [thunder] Now today we're gonna learn about the physics of slingshots but

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:22.530
before we do that, let's just have some fun shooting. You're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.580
I finally said my words right!

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.080
Now that the lightning's here. [laugh]

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.463
