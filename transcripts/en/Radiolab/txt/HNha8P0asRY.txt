Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radiolab radio from W N Y s. C

Speaker 1:          00:11          hey man, how are ya? Very well. So Aaron set this up. Who we about to meet? So this is skip Sherry. He lived in Brooklyn and that is, we should say Aaron Scott, he's a reporter. We turned us on to skip and Aaron met up. Was skipped because he had this experience that common to a lot of people who moved to New York City. Just tell us where you, where you grew up. I grew up in the country outside of Athens, Ohio on 54 acres of wooded land and I would work all day as a kid in the heat hoeing and picking strawberries, hauling water, planting trees. He'd play in the woods. I loved the woods, but as he got older he knew he couldn't stay in Athens. Why not? Well, he's a musician. He wanted to make a living at it. So he bounced around for a bit. I finally find them finally at age 30 there was no place to go except for New York's. It wasn't a matter that you wanted to live in New York, New York was your last, my last option and he hated it.

Speaker 2:          01:04          It was ugly to me. You know, like, like which too many humans. Too many. Too much concrete. Yeah. No. One theory about autism is that the things that come into an autistic kids brain all have equal value. They don't know how to sort through it. And when I first came to New Yorker was, it was really,

Speaker 1:          01:27          it is pretty overwhelming. I did decide to leave for sure, but then take us to the roof. I was lucky when I first moved here, so he's staying with a friend who lives in this big building in Brooklyn Heights right across from the twin towers. It is 36 stories high and he decides one lonely night to go up onto the roof. And there was this intense fog

Speaker 3:          01:56          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:56          in the twin towers. The bottom of them was covering the fog but not the top. So it was like they were flooding. There's little like a cuticle sliver of moon in the sky and the foghorns are going in. The boats are slowly moving

Speaker 3:          02:12          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          02:12          and there's this Rees and I had this, this brass penny wasn't that my father had given me and I was standing there. I was playing it and that I was really suddenly something clicked. I was like, oh, that must, those are all the bridges. That's the Williamsburg Bridge. That's the Manhattan bridge. There's the Brooklyn Bridge that New York, it's small now.

Speaker 3:          02:37          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          02:37          and I'm looking down at the Statue of Liberty and my grandmother, Anastasia Patty came from Albania and they went to Ellis island. I could see my history there too and I was suddenly hit me like, oh my goodness, this is like a coral reef. You can't see the people, but look at this beautiful strip

Speaker 3:          02:59          fog in the air. It was just the whole city was breathing [inaudible] the whole nature was beating. Everything was [inaudible] breathing. I felt connected on a spiritual level to the city for the first time. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:23          and so skip decided to stay for awhile, for awhile. All over the world. People are now moving. Of course we know this from the country to the city at this point, the world two years ago across this extraordinary benchmark. That's physicist Geoff West. We're more than half of the planet is now urbanized 51% and that made us wonder how do cities work? Is there some deep organic logic that holds all these people together or is writer general era puts it or cities, just these tumors that people on the landscape

Speaker 3:          04:01          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          04:01          I'm Janna. Boom, Ron. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab and our topic today,

Speaker 3:          04:06          cities, cities. I loved it, but I don't know why [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          04:18          All right. So in talking about cities, it's Kinda hard to know where to start because every city has its own DNA, kind of its own unique feel.

Speaker 3:          04:32          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:35          Like for instance, let me just give you my own stupid example here. So every time I go to St Louis to visit my mom, yeah, I'm gay, I'm on the plane. I mean my own kind of groove and I step off the plane into the airport and it's just like with the first step you just hit this wall of something is different. Like you feel the difference in your bone because let's the question I, is he there? Right. I'm here. What gives the city its feel? Oh is this Mr Bob Levine? This is Mr Rob Levin. Mr Bob Levine is a professor of psychology, California State University. And he thinks the answer to that question is time. Time. Did each city warps time in its own unique way? Why should these are my subjects? No, he studied this idea for the past 30 years in all kinds of different ways. We looked at things like a percentage of people wearing watches. How long does it take bank tellers in each city to change a $20 bill? Really? Yeah. And then we, we, we looked at talking speed. Hawkings yeah. We'd get on the phone and uh, called post offices since that seemed like something that would be available every place and make a standard request.

Speaker 4:          05:39          What'd you tell me the difference between regular mail certified mail and insured mail. Okay. Certified is when you just need someone to sign for it.

Speaker 1:          05:46          Then he says they'd calculate the number of syllables per second

Speaker 4:          05:50          regular mail. Just close your mail. You know at the out of Utah,

Speaker 1:          05:53          Salt Lake City, Utah, 2.73 syllables per second. Then if you want bootcamp receipt car to come back

Speaker 4:          05:58          to your house, Springfield mass time on the phone.

Speaker 5:          06:02          Yes, 3.4 or five syllables per second and

Speaker 4:          06:05          certified is when you want,

Speaker 5:          06:08          not really sure where it's from because the tape lost the id but it could be Nashville,

Speaker 4:          06:13          her failing and nick would want to know who you want to return more three

Speaker 5:          06:17          and if it is Nashville, 2.65 syllables

Speaker 6:          06:20          low. Well Springfield is like fume, but the whole talking thing was just really a prelude for Bob. It got him into what he, I think he's most known for and what we find most fascinating. Uh, we actually looked up at walking speed walking.

Speaker 7:          06:34          Yeah. Well what I would do is I would get into a new city. I am in Mumbai, India, Jerusalem, [inaudible] Chiang Mai, Thailand. We actually put out a call to radio lab listeners everywhere. We in Buchanan in Liberia to help us repeat the study. Hey, good morning Radiolab. I'm recording from Dublin in Ireland, downtown Oslo, Copenhagen. Why are we getting to a new city? And step one, I would scope out main business and shopping near [inaudible] street step to get out some street or roll of screen. I red strings, 60 feet long. 20 meters means over here we wouldn't say feed really. Step three, use that string to measure out the distance. You just have to roll out this and you take the one end to the sidewalk and I would just make a mark step four and go under covers. Get into Carter and uh, it'd be cool, you know, act like you're reading a paper or waiting for somebody. Alright, found myself a discrete place. Found a pretty nice spot here. You use a stopwatch? I would use a stopwatch. Stopwatch. It's trusty beef watches working. Ready? Oh, you're ready? Boots. Okay, I'm ready.

Speaker 8:          07:40          Wow.

Speaker 5:          07:43          I don't know what goes quiet the minute I want to start. Brilliant text. Delvin this experiment was actually harder than you would think. I love people. This is not very easy to do. Timing was an issue. People trying to sell you stuff. Oh No, no. I don't need this too shy. Betty Boucher. I look in my corner. I just don't, can't, no patients don't care. Okay.

Speaker 7:          08:02          Are you ready? Boom. All together. Now,

Speaker 8:          08:06          Doug Walks. Step, step, step, step, step, step, step, step.

Speaker 5:          08:15          Actually, it didn't sound like that at all. They weren't in sync. As you can imagine, every city had its own beat guard

Speaker 7:          08:22          snippets. Yes, yes, yes, yes, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep. Which on some level we knew still

Speaker 5:          08:31          change was pretty amazing. Stop. Tough line to Oslo. 14.4 seconds. 27 seconds. You Canon, Liberia. Wow. So team 0.8 Wayne is Eris 12.13 Mexico City, 10.1 seconds. Copenhagen, 21.5 seconds. Yeah. Nine 11.57 Portland thing and a half seconds. Jerusalem. Just to break it down on the high end, you've got steps, steps you're on it's step, step,

Speaker 1:          08:56          step, step. That [inaudible] steps. She was 9.5 and that's 10.4 who take on average 10.76 seconds to cover 60 feet. Compare that to Buchanan. Liberia step, step, step, step, step, step. Let's get around something that actually own the head. So you've got a teen pink blouse whose walkers covered the same distance in about 21 seconds, 21 seconds. So if you want to think about it in football terms, by the time the Dubliner has scored a touchdown, the gripe from you, Kevin Lay Bierria is somewhere I guess around midfield like in this spooky thing according to Bob Levine is if you do these under the same conditions, same place, you will get the same time. These times don't change. Dublin is always about this steps you're on. It's step, step, step and Buchanan. Liberia is always around this yet step, step, step Manhattan is we found is right about here. And usually that step with thunders step, step, step in pink, no Dublin but not bad. But why the consistency, what is it? What is it that makes that walking speed?

Speaker 9:          10:03          Yeah. Where does it come from? You know, I mean there's anybody beating the drum. How well can you change the walking speed? Say a bunch of us got together and decided that we were just gonna up it by 5% on a given day. Will we get everybody to do it? And will they even notice the difference? Do we make the city

Speaker 1:          10:20          or just the city? Make us

Speaker 7:          10:22          thank you to our blockers. [inaudible] who's the faculty? Liberia. Jerusalem. Eric. Killer man. And Copenhagen went to Oslo. Scott, Portland, Oregon. Harry Sante Nacho. Thailand. [inaudible]. Yes. Go City [inaudible] in Mumbai. Mark.

Speaker 1:          10:41          I'm Nolan. I'm Dublin in Ireland. Perhaps also to Daniel Estrin and an assessment. I don't know, cause they didn't, they didn't say their name. Put them in there. Okay. Okay. So getting back to that question I asked a second ago, why is it that cities develop particular be yes. I mean, is it because the city does it to the people or the people do it to the city? Yeah. And we ran into a couple of guys who may be released, have the start of an answer. Yes. No, a couple of physicists, oddly enough high named Jeffrey West and Leash Benton.

Speaker 10:         11:13          This is Jeffery and there's Lewis on the other side of the table. Cool. Here at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico and lots of bases and stuff. Nothing like the cities we just visited. It's almost biblical in its expanse. Yeah, but blue skies just sort of make you brave and potassium and all those good things. Brave enough. In fact, to claim from their high desert Birch, that eas beats the meter of every city that we've just been to actually has underneath it a kind of logic, if you told me the average speed of walking in some city x or Rochester New York, where walk at about this 60 feet and 12.67 seconds different, don't tell him Rochester. You just tell him the number of beats and we'll tell you the population is maybe one and a quarter billion people, actual population, 1.0 3 million people and the average weight for about $16,000 a year. Actual average wage, $15,588 wow. But let me ask you a precise question. Are you 100% correct? Are you pursuing some things? You will score close to a hundred percent other things, 80%

Speaker 1:          12:30          but if you start with just the number of footfalls per unit of time, they can tell you all kinds of other things about the same place.

Speaker 10:         12:38          I can tell you how much crime there is in the city. Income wages, GDP number college's restaurants, [inaudible], restaurants, theaters, police number patents that are being produced, cultural events per capita, number of theater that libraries, the number of aids cases it's going to have this year. All of these things are correlated in a quantitative, and I use the word predictive fashion.

Speaker 1:          13:03          Wait, are you saying that just from the number of footsteps per given time that you can tell? Can you tell me how many libraries there are? Yes. Could tell me how many you should expect. How many things can you count when you're infinite number, but, but it's limited by the things for which there are data. They've got data from the u s census, that's Jonah Lehrer. He's written about Luis and Jeff and he's the one that Kinda got us thinking about all this paper from Japan, China data from sociological surveys on cell phones. And when they put all these numbers together, they discovered a deep pattern. It's call comes from the flood zone, not the footstep. What do you mean? Having the footsteps are a reflection of this deep and fundamental pattern that governs everything. Just one fact. What is it you really want to know? Yeah. What is it? Size. Size. How many people live there?

Speaker 10:         13:54          Size matters. Size is the largest determinant of all characteristics of the city, right?

Speaker 1:          14:01          They would say, tell me the size of the city, and I can explain the vast majority of all these different variables that we can measure as a city scales up. They say

Speaker 10:         14:11          100,000 to 200,000 the million to 2 million from 5 million to 10 everything about it. All those things that they'd been measuring, they scale up too, but they scale up according to a very simple mathematical formula. It does not matter that New York has big skyscrapers and is on the ocean and the Boise's in the rocky mountains that San Francisco is on San Francisco Bay.

Speaker 1:          14:36          Wait a second. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. That can't be. They can't be. I'll, I was with you right up until the last two. That last point. I mean you go to the Midwest and it's landlocked and then you go to a port city and it's on a port. I mean that's got to matter. It matters. But these actually are superficial effects and account for only 10 20% of their variation. What they're saying is that those specificities, the, the local history is in large part insignificant, but it is completely overwhelmed by these generic laws of urban scaling. That to me is a very interesting and surprising idea simply because we don't think of cities like that at all. No, we certainly do not. That's because you're not a physicist. So you don't think abstractly in that we're guard. Well, why should I? Because sometimes it can be very useful.

Speaker 1:          15:24          Remember what these guys have done is they've just created eight average profile for every size city. So if you're a 1 million or 7 million or 12 million, here's how many things you should have. Now you can ask, okay, let's look specifically that city and ask, is it overperforming or underperforming? Right. So what are some cities that are over-performing for their size, uh, of the largest cities? San Francisco is quite an innovative city. New York is about average in terms of patents, terms, New York's below average juices. Roughly speaking the number of patents it should for a size you produce for example, a about uh, twice as many patterns as Boston we do. That's something you should have produced many more given the size difference between about what average could they'd counting patents, I mean who may, who do we don't have engine. This is one of the problems with their larger theory, which is that no attention to that they're relying on your data at the u s census collected. So that's a real blind spot. Counting fabulous. If we ever can figure out a way to account. Fabulous. Yes, he has a point. You're not taking into account with it actually the experience of living in a place, well, what this one, a theory cannot do is tell you about the essence of New York, the New York Ness of New York,

Speaker 2:          16:42          so to speak, the soul of the city. And where does that come from? Who knows? I mean, I think that's such a broad question. Well, obviously it has something to do with lots of people being jammed into a tight space environment, bumping into each other, kind of people who moved there. What the physicists we call human friction. And that's a story you can't really tell in math. But yeah, you can hear it. Take skip. He gave producer Aaron Scott a tour of his block in Brooklyn, listen to who he pumps into everyday. So he took us on this tour. Okay. First place we went was this Jamaican body shop. Body shop is in cars. Yeah. Religion specialists. I mean it's basically these, you know, western, these Jamaican guys listening to [inaudible] and hip hop reggae. I like all kinds of music. It's like it's one place and a cross across the street from this as kindergarten, hidden orthodox Jewish cookie bakery. And, and I'm disappointed from that. It's a butcher that, um, sells live goats and chickens and here are the goats. And on the corner of the Hispanic Pentecostal church, every Sunday they give it up to God with this exceedingly enthusiastic

Speaker 3:          18:12          [inaudible]. And I huddle at the window and I think this is the best music in the world. I feel that deeply.

Speaker 2:          18:27          And then across the street from that one is a mosque.

Speaker 3:          18:36          Whoa. Whoa.

Speaker 2:          18:40          It was beautiful on the inside. Wow. Across the street there's this big building and the proprietor of this space is a gay foot fetish film producer. Show me your feet. Show me your feet. Two 80 something. He's got Jamaicans, orthodox Jews and the cookies. Hispanics, Jesus, Allah, goats in gay porn. Show me your feet all on the same block. Absolutely. For me, that's the hammer. The nails. That's the wrong gradients. Now I'm gonna take that home and I'm gonna Assemble it into a song. And when you heard his music, could you hear all that stuff? Some of it is clear than others.

Speaker 11:         19:25          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          19:25          the sounds of the neighborhood, like the reggaeton music of the West indies, auto body shops. He kind of takes them and then filters it through some device that makes it sound like vowels.

Speaker 3:          19:44          [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          19:47          Oddly enough, the day that Aaron spoke with skip was the day skip decided he's leaving New York City and he put in his notice, which I guess makes his latest album, sonic New York, kind of a dear John Letter to the city. You can hear it on our website, radio lab.org and Robert Levine's book for one about walking and time and stuff. Yeah, it's called the geography of time. More information about that too on our website. radiolab.org also, you can subscribe to our podcasts there.

We have been doing this, we're making stories for the podcast, for the radio for 15 years at is 15 years of stories about like, um, I don't know, the science of morality, the metamorphosis of butterflies, legal foundation for the war on terror. All these different stories. I've been doing it for 15 years. So check out our latest episode out of the archives and all of our episodes are available wherever you get your podcasts.

Speaker 13:         21:28          Hey, I'm Janet [inaudible]. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab and our subject right now is cities. So far we've tried to pin down the character of a place with math or with a story or with some music.

Speaker 14:         21:42          Woo.

Speaker 13:         21:42          But it's like trying to take a snapshot of something that's growing and changing all the time. And that feeling that skip had

Speaker 3:          21:50          up on the rooftop, like the city with breathing. Maybe the city really is like a living thing.

Speaker 10:         21:57          Well, yes, in some ways that's exactly right. The evolve, the grow.

Speaker 3:          22:02          Think about it as Jeff West, every day, every minute, incomes, energy, food, trucks, water people out goes garbage ideas, songs, stories, people, energy in, energy out, energy, energy, Huh?

Speaker 5:          22:17          That's just what a city needs to do. Sit Jeff

Speaker 10:         22:19          quote, metabolize food, so to speak, cause without that, organisms and cities and so on will simply decay.

Speaker 13:         22:28          So how does a city stay a lot? What does it really take for a city to grow? Well that question got me thinking about New York and led me

Speaker 5:          22:37          to a place I'd been wanting to go for awhile.

Speaker 14:         22:42          Thank you. [inaudible] I think you're the reverb a little bit.

Speaker 5:          22:50          Where are you underground? Oh, a hundred feet under

Speaker 14:         22:54          brown.

Speaker 7:          22:58          So this is the sound of one of New York City's water tunnels. I'm standing in it. It's exactly what you would imagine. A big tube. It's about nine feet wide, nine feet up, perfectly polished cement. And uh, it seems to just go forever.

Speaker 15:         23:18          So this is basically a, like you might call a smaller artery inside the city's circulatory system. When this is online in a couple of months, it will pump up to 290 million gallons a day, something like that, which is an awesome thought in the literal sense of the word. It's uh, when you walk through the streets in Manhattan, this is Catherine Mallon, the Department of environmental

Speaker 16:         23:46          protection. These water tunnels are anywhere from 200 to 800 feet below your feet. They just there and they're silently there. And when you turn on your tap,

Speaker 5:          23:55          can you take a drink? You are basking in a daily convenience that is born from blood, sweat and death. To explain, you really have to go back to a time when there were no tunnels. Success would be uh, 1790 1800 or so around that time says historian Diane Galicia in New York's population was booming, tripled and 20 years. And you suddenly had a 100,000 people all getting their water from the same spot. A large freshwater pond called the collect. And they had pigs running around by the hundreds and the chamber pots out in the streets and there were livestock and lower Manhattan at the time. People had cows for milk. And so when they died, they had to do something with them. So often she says they'd throw their dead cows and everything else in the pond, the same pond that they were drinking from right now, not surprisingly, as the city grew, people got sick in 1798 there was this yellow fever epidemic, killed a couple of thousand people and cholera and typhoid city officials were like, this has to change.

Speaker 5:          25:04          And uh, as if to accentuate the point in 1835 there was this huge fire and the fire department rushes out to put out the fire, but they can't. It was in December and the rivers froze and they couldn't get water to the fires. If you don't have water to fight the fire, the city burns down. It's pretty simple. Yeah. 700 buildings. So that's our starting point in New York City that could not grow. And by the way, the guy we just heard John Chick Donahue, he's the sand dog part of the long line of guys who blasted New York out of its poopy pon phase and into its future. You ask the question why? Why are you guys cold? Sandhogs why won't you be cold tunnel blasters or earth movers or something that's more, do you have any idea where that name came from? Yeah, it comes from the dictionary really and I loved the look in people's faces when they asked me that and I, that's the answer. It's described in Webster's dictionary as a laborer who digs or works in sand originals sandhogs with the soft ground guys compressed air. That's where you need to backup for a second. When the city decided to scrap the pond in favor of clean water from upstate, it faced a couple of challenges and this is also true. When they decided to build the subway system, namely nature, like how do you, for example, build a tunnel under a river? Well, they was San hucks, Jamie. Dan laid

Speaker 17:         26:24          literally Doug with what we call muck sticks, shovels on the ribbon, 50 60 a hundred feet under the bottom of the ribbon. Men with shovels, excavating ground. That's Nick's socal. I'm a tunneling engineer. Generally it's a dark dank

Speaker 5:          26:41          please. Now the obvious engineering problem is that the river bottom, which is now above their heads is soft sands and silts and gravels. How do you keep that from not falling on your head? That's when a compressed air started being used. The basic idea says nick is these huge pumps would basically pump air into the tunnels at such pressure that it would basically push the ceiling up. Exactly. So the mind doesn't cave in on you. Yeah,

Speaker 17:         27:06          it compressed their holes. That thing from collapsing in on.

Speaker 5:          27:10          Usually the engineers on the shore had to get the pressure just right says chick. Cause if they didn't, you get this absolutely terrifying situation. That is maybe the best cocktail party story ever.

Speaker 17:         27:22          We used to give an award, we haven't given it many years. We call it the Marshall may be award there. We're doing one of those tunnels to Brooklyn

Speaker 14:         27:33          [inaudible].

Speaker 17:         27:33          The men are weapon, the face of the tunnel digging away

Speaker 14:         27:38          very suddenly.

Speaker 7:          27:40          There's a blowout in the face of the wall. Puncture hole develops tiny at first, but it quickly becomes bigger and bigger until it's the size of sort of like an eye. Then a whole head and all the compressed air rushes into that. Okay. Oh, it would be like if you shot a hole through an airplane. All the air with shoal hats are flying into this whole lanterns shovels. Then a guy goes into the hole guy. Yeah, a human being into the whole food and another guy. Boom. Then a third, the third guy must've been the luckiest sand hog in the world. This is an article from the New York Times as I struck the mud. It felt as if something was squeezing me tighter than had ever been squeezed before. He blew through all at 60 feet of water and through the ribbon.

Speaker 17:         28:24          Yup.

Speaker 7:          28:25          To the surface. The pressure blew him right up into the air. You're telling me I was thrown about 25 feet above the water when I came out, but I don't remember that. That's remarkable. Anything

Speaker 17:         28:40          back down and landed right alongside a police boat in the one in the water. So they took him, cleaned him up, he went home, he came to work the next day. That's why they gave him the award. That's why the ward is now. I'm not kidding you.

Speaker 5:          29:01          In the early days, no one kept track of how many people died building New York's tunnels the number. It's probably in the thousands. So wait, this, this right here, this plaque that we're looking at, this flack was a donated. This is Richie fits in and sees the current head of the sandhogs union and we're standing in front of a big stone plaque with two dozen names.

Speaker 17:         29:21          So your memory of all the, uh, people that we lost in tunnels in New York City since 1970, you know, since we started keeping records,

Speaker 14:         29:30          small little photos. Come on here

Speaker 5:          29:31          later. He showed me a picture, which really underlined the point. It's a picture of him on his first compressed air job. Oh Wow. Look at that. This is myself. He's 19. He's huddled with five other guys and they're in this crowded tunnel and they're all black was said, and he points to each guy in turn

Speaker 7:          29:47          dead, dead, dead, dead, had cancer still alive, still alive. If you ask any of the sandhogs why they do this,

Speaker 5:          29:59          mostly they'll tell you what we've got to. The city can't grow without its tunnels. But you also get answers like this from chick. If he says, when you're down there and it's pitch black and you're just walking the wall.

Speaker 7:          30:10          Yeah, 600 foot under Manhattan, you're approximately 30th screen or something. You're in the middle of the greatest city in the world. Nobody even knows you exist. Nobody has it. Nobody has a clue. It just

Speaker 3:          30:27          beautiful.

Speaker 5:          30:30          It's just that a, it's a weird place. It's like being on a planet somewhere. He says when he's literally in this rock that is half a billion years old, he sometimes feels

Speaker 3:          30:42          very

Speaker 7:          30:44          humble. Yeah. We're in the middle of the art then. Yeah. This is, you want to see nature. If it is, that's real, a romantic way of saying it. Uh, the human reality of it is, here's Richie's take. Remember when you were a kid, and I used to give you the an farms and the [inaudible] and farms, we're big. We are ants. Aes is so fricking many of them that if you got a squish a few, and if they gotta use each other to step over each other to, to, to, to keep that whole thing, that's it. That doesn't sound very grand the way you're putting it. Like next reality, our job is to conquer nature. He says, plain and simple. We're builders. Human beings are builders. And collectively there's nothing that we can do. Nothing.

Speaker 3:          31:38          Okay.

Speaker 5:          31:39          October 14th, 1842, oh, it was a huge celebration. Hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers Line Broadway. It was firing of cannon and the ringing a church bell fireworks even. And at the end of it all says Diane, everybody gathered in City Hall Park and they turned a big fountain on and

Speaker 3:          32:04          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          32:04          water shot 50 feet into the air. New York City. We'd never be the same. Now can finally be a city. But here's where you start to wonder a little bit about the real legacy of sees. What you see almost immediately after this moment, according to Diane, is that water usage skyrocketed. Suddenly you had indoor plumbing, all the new buildings were being outfitted with water closets and kids were playing in the hydrants all day long. And to make a long story short, just 10 years later, the city is out of water again. So they get to build more tunnels and then more. And if you follow the water

Speaker 7:          32:40          in those tunnels, backup state, you see that the city has gobbling up reservoirs one after another, dozens, which meant it had to kick people off that land. Well then called eminent domain. Their villages would have to be bulldozed and burned. Cemeteries rooted. Do you see what's happening? I mean you could see this city that we live in as a kind of monster. Just always hungry, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat

Speaker 13:         33:01          second. Because like, like there is another logic available here. Like if you took all the people in New York City, all those New Yorkers, you know, if you had every inhabitant in New York City, suddenly left New York City and moved to small towns all across America, you would need a ton of resources to make that possible. That's Jonah lira again, by the way. So in a sense, New York City saves lots of forests, saves lots of water, and the reason why, well that takes us back to Jeff and Alecia's ideas about cities. So I suppose because it all started years ago, Jeff at the time was studying, uh, this time was living things. Let's go back to biology for a moment. He looked at a huge variety of creatures and for each one he collected your data.

Speaker 10:         33:40          Everything from it's a metabolic rate to length through it's a altar, how quickly it breathes. They discovered something kind of fascinating about creatures as they grow bigger and picker. If you double the size of an organism, you double the number of cells that need to be sustained. You would therefore expect that the energy you need to supply would double. You've doubled the number of customers so to speak. Yeah, yeah. No, no. That is not the case. Instead of doubling, it needs less energy per unit cell to sustain the whole organism. So there is,

Speaker 13:         34:16          I don't know, let's wait a second. That means that the, that the sale is somehow doing more with less. Right. Does it also mean though that an elephant cell somehow is more efficient than a mouse cell? That's correct. Huh. And Jeff says, the way they do that, it's pretty simple. They just move slower. I process energy at a slower rate. So if you take a mouse cell, a cell that lives in a mouse and does its work, it brings in resources without the waste. Bringing in more resources spits out the way it does this with particular beat. But now says, Jeff, if you listen to an elephant cell

Speaker 3:          34:54          [inaudible]

Speaker 13:         34:56          he means no,

Speaker 3:          35:00          it's more than

Speaker 13:         35:01          obviously slower. So it's using less energy [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          35:05          given moment, which makes it more efficient.

Speaker 13:         35:08          And what does that have to do with cities? Turns out cities work kind of the same way in cities. You see the same kind of efficiency

Speaker 10:         35:15          when it comes to infrastructure, electricity, a length of roads, water, lengths of pipes, lengths of electrical cables, gasoline, how much gas is consumed is the point. The bigger the city, the less roads you need per capita. What does per capita mean anyways, per person, per person, the less electrical cable lines you need per capita, the less gasoline stations you need per capita, et Cetera, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          35:38          So every unit of pipe carries more water or more sewage. Every line of electrical wire carries more. Jeff, does that mean then that if, uh, if I move to a bigger and bigger city, do I in a sense become greener the bigger the city I live in? That's a very interesting, very good question. And this is where Lewish and Jeff, I think the case is still a little bit out. And even Jonah, it gets complicated when you ask, are people more or less efficient? This is when everybody starts to throw in all of these caveats and qualifications, all the variable qualifications and ambulations and prognostications and distillations. Let me just tell you what I think. I think you'd better. All right. We all love to talk about how green we are when we live in cities. This is something everybody in the city talks about, right?

Speaker 1:          36:28          Because we are, because we take the subway and the bus we take, we don't draw and driving like the most energy consuming. And listen to me, the analogy that you just gave me, it does not work. Okay. You said that sells as they go from small bodies to big bodies, slow down. Well, cities, the opposite happens. Of course as cities get bigger, each individual unit in that city moves faster. Thank you Jonah. We speed up. That's true. We learned this earlier and this is not trivial. Okay. Cause as we speed up, we bump into more people. We have more ideas, we invent new things, we want more things. We want more or more of rivers from your tastes. New Ideas. More interactions. More human friction. More, more choices. Yeah, a better life. That's what a city is all about. I, I, I, is there anything wrong with that?

Speaker 1:          37:15          No, not at all. But there's all I'm saying is there's a cost to it that we don't acknowledge. Western Betancourt did this back of the envelope calculation where it's long been known that a body at perfect rest of you lie on your bed all day in a coma, you will consume and buy 90 watts of electricity that's cold. Your basal metabolic rate. If you're a hunter gatherer living in some tribe in New Zealand, you will consume about 240 watts of electricity every day. Energy just simply to stay alive, plus the energy you need to hunt and gather. However, if you are living in America, the wattage required to drive your car, run your computer, make your clothes, air conditioning, being able to go to movies on and on and all of the various things that constituted our life. If you add all those up, your lifestyle requires about 11,000 watts of electricity every day, so that's, that's more energy than in blue whale requires.

Speaker 1:          38:04          Now, some of you listening, if particularly if you're an engineer, you may think, wait a second, why are you calling these watts? When it's power through a system power through a human, call them jewels, the technically correct word. And then you'd be right, wouldn't you? But the numbers are the same. So let's, we'll just call them lots. So one way to look at what cities have enabled us to do is basically live like 300 million blue whales in America. Are you sure that cities are causing this development? That it begins and ends with cities? And you can't assign it all to cities, but that psychology of wanting more, that's a city. It's why people come to cities and then the lifestyle that grows up around that gets broadcast out on TV and radios and movies, which are city industries to the country. And if you just take a historical look at this, like the last 300 years have seen more and more consumption, right?

Speaker 1:          38:52          Yeah. And that trend, it's, it's, it's grown in neat parallel with the growth of cities. Um, cities have enabled that kind of growth. Even if you guys are are, are right and we know that half of the planet already is living in cities, 80% of America. So yes, there are more people. I agree with that. More choices asking for more consumption, more energy, more, more, more, more, more, even if that, so cities, because they also are ingenious and they come up with all these new ideas, maybe cities will solve the problem right now. Jet someone somewhere in Calcutta is about to invent the super light bulb elevator telephone pipe that will make it possible for another 200 controlling people to live together in peace, harmony, and beauty until the next round. All right, you go ahead and claim to that optimism and you of course can go hang yourself. So we'll be right back. I remember crawling. That's Jab Radiolab. This is try and con

Speaker 18:         39:51          the city of brotherly love. Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation, enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

Speaker 1:          40:09          hey, I'm Janet. Boom, rotten. I remember grill, which this is radio lab and our subject today is cities and if cities are like organisms and one thing we should say about every organism that's ever been, they die. Yeah they die. So you would think cities would die, you would. But Jonah says no, cities die very, very rarely and they almost never die if there hasn't been a total total catastrophe. Physical catastrophe, which is weird, you know if you think about it, it says Jonah cause like take a company and sometimes it can get very big so that they include hundreds of thousands of employees and yet they die all the time. Of the 30 companies and the original Dow Jones, only three are still on the Dow Jones Index. If you took 30 cities from the 1920s I can guarantee you all 30 of those randomly selected cities would still exist on the map. And the question is why? Why don't they die like every other social organization? What is it about cities that gives them this crazy persistence? That question led us to a place that by all measures should have died long ago. A place called Centralia.

Speaker 1:          41:17          Okay, so we begin on the side of where are we? We're on route 61 in eastern Pennsylvania. Right. This is bad, by the way. He's a producer at radio lab. I know who pat is. Thank you very much. Anyhow, we're waiting for this guy named Tom to meet our professors. He, Tom? Yeah.

Speaker 8:          41:33          Tom [inaudible] asked you, are you doing okay yet? It's up to you guys. When did you get her? Just now. Just now. Just happened to be, can we ask Tom to show us around his town? Probably the best place. He goes up on the hill up there and look, you know, you could look over everything. Okay, sure. So we go up on the hill with Tom. We actually meet up with another time. I'm Dempsey. I was the former postmaster here. We now have two toms, Tom, Tom, or confusing. Any of the four of us stare down into a valley that used to have a town in it. Front of house was all, it was all streets with homes on them all over. Now Centralia is just trees right down here was the a Tom two points system. Trees are a high school over here. More trees, flooding nation's church are still shooting playground right at the bottom of this little hill right here. You can still see the bars. This is where things get a little strange. I mean right next to the swing set where kids used to laugh their little heads off. There's a hole in the ground right there. I can see some steam coming out of the ground spewing steam and that and I would later discover and we got close to it that that steam was really hot. It's hot and wet. Oh My god, Ha.

Speaker 8:          42:46          What? Where exactly is the fire underneath this? Like how far here? 50 feet, maybe 50 feet down. If it is, the smell doesn't bother you guys. What? Smell? You can smell it. It smells like burning tires here. That must be from New York. That's stuck in your nose. Come on. It really did smell put. The thing no one can deny is that underneath our feet there's a web of coal mines that stretches from miles 40 miles in each direction, 30 miles and somewhere in those mines is a fire that's been burning for 40 years and has either destroyed this town or not depending on who you ask. This is pat right here. My name is Mary Lugandan. I'm 82 years old and I lived in Centralia most of my adult life. What year were you born in? If you mind me asking, what year was I born?

Speaker 8:          43:37          1927 Mary Lou gon grew up in a town not too far from Centralia. Really neat little farm town called Burnsville and when she got to central Ella she said was like moving to the city. It had a legion drug store. It had that. It had a couple thousand people, lots of bars was in center and somebody told me one time there were 22 bombs in Centralia. I don't know if that was true cause I didn't frequent. Byron's at that age and all these places that you just mentioned were right on top of each other. So when you were walking around, you'd see people all the time. Just take, for instance, you'd go to the post office after work and show you where the post office was. Tommy would be there sometimes. I was postmaster here for a number of years. Tweet. You're pointing into a forest. It's hard to imagine this.

Speaker 8:          44:20          It is hard to imagine, and yet I walk to the post office because your mail wasn't delivered, so I'd go up to the post office and get my mail and you'd meet people in the post office. You'd meet people coming out of the post office. This was a good football field here. Now it's all growing in. Nobody's cutting the grass. There's bushes growing up in it now, Tommy Dempsey, to have his story, I would be an hour till I got home. Whole hour. This is house and was. Okay. Fast forward, it's Memorial Day, 1962 this is where the borrowers just picked up all their garbage. Magnify the star that I'd say just about right here where I'm standing right now. Tell me points to a little patch of nondescript yellow grass. Like why here? How did it start? Do we have any idea? Well, it started the most likely scenario.

Speaker 8:          45:06          He says, we also heard this from a writer named Joan Quigley, author of the day the Earth gave him, is it people used to heat their homes with coal and maybe somebody threw their ashes into the garbage, which then ended up onto the dump. It caught the whole thing on fire, furniture, rugs, kerosene camps, which John says wasn't that unusual? Some of the former firefighters said out the dumps caught on fire all the time and usually the virus just fizzled out on their own. But this one, for whatever reason before it did wandered a little bit and it found its way over to an old exposed, exposed call vein there. Basically an old strip mine. Yeah. It should have been covered but wasn't. So there was just a big open cavity when the fire got in there and okay, that call, the fire trucks came up here and a hose down the fire until they thought it was out and they left following Betty.

Speaker 8:          45:53          Somebody says, all, we see smoke and steam coming out of the ground up there. [inaudible] came back the next day and they tried to get the fire out and they couldn't very well do it or they weren't getting it cause at that point it was too, I wouldn't know where to start with this mind far. I wouldn't know where to start. The first place that fire came down, it was right underneath Mary Lou's house and from that point on it kind of took over her life. Oh my goodness. Is Your scrapbooks. When we were there, she pulled out these two gigantic scrapbooks. Is it gonna take for men to lift this book? Each book is literally three feet tall and they document in painful detail. How that fire split the town in to, this is how intense I was with this mindful fire that she heaved, opened the book and she showed us this picture of three people crouched on the street in front of a whole, this is my husband, my son and me and husband holding a thermometer.

Speaker 8:          46:42          We dropped this down on it like a fishing pole down on a like you're ice fishing. Yeah. This is their way of measuring the temperature of the fire bill up and what did we read? It was pretty high. A hundred degrees high. 850 or something under your house? No, this was on the street, but the street right in front of her house and the garage. The garage was right. As you can see, that garage here is right there. She showed us another picture of her standing in her garage in front of a trench that they'd dug in inside that trench. You see flames. Oh, we used to go out at night and watched there that, you know, the glowing and the ambers fire up there got so bad that some of Marilu's neighbors actually got government money to leave their houses name where the first people bought out.

Speaker 8:          47:23          Never once, like at the beginning did you think like, oh, maybe we should just get outta here. No, there's a fire a hundred yards. Yeah, never. Yeah. I never went to, no. Instead she did exactly the opposite. My husband, and this was a big official and this was the beginner heals, started writing letters, men Nelligan Musto. We wrote letters to him. We talked on the phone with him. I couldn't tell you all the congressmen. We talked before, governors, all the Harrisburg officials and they were promising everything but the sun. But it never happened. But other than the people who lived on that street, then many, many people in town didn't have to worry or even think about the Mindfire. Nobody ever believed that the fire was, was even serious in some tragedy. My husband, myself and Helen, rumor, it's uptown and the fire is uptown. All that changed on Valentine's Day.

Speaker 8:          48:13          1981 we're up a little bit hotter because of this guy, fellow named Todd Demboski, who at the time was just a boy. I was 1212 year old boy. He's playing outside in his grandmother's backyard. I noticed a small wisps of smoke coming out of the ground, so he went over to take a look. I was like, I bent down to investigate. I noticed that my feet were starting to sink in. It was really soft and it was like quicksand. The more I tried the struggle and more, ah, I was just opening the hole larger. He wound up sliding to my thighs, to my waist until he was, I was under all the way underground surrounded by hot steam. Smoke was so intense. Now it's like rotten eggs. Oh, well. I was screaming for my cousin and his cousin heard him and came running over, blocked me out like a flower.

Speaker 8:          49:09          What happened to him? Changed everything because suddenly reporters were everywhere. Reporters from the evening, Harold's Nightline, national news media, everybody pointing their cameras at Todd. I see smaller flown over to shape was the mind burn when I did. I just thought right through and doing stories about this town that was on fire. The underground coal fires still burn Hodgson and isn't inferno federal attention. Parts of Centralia look like the outskirts of hell would focus on what had to happen for the town. There wasn't long says Joan before. Some of the younger residents, small informal group of young parents organized in March and look is to have anyone down the main street in town. How many people are we talking about here? Couple of dozen with red ribbons around their arms and their wrists and they walked two by two down the main street of Centralia like striking miners. Mary Lou glared at them as they passed. I was bitter. I was bitter with, they claimed they were for helping the town to be safe, but they weren't what they were really for. She figured was getting out there, look for funds to get relocated. She even hated their name, concerned citizens against the Centralia mine fire. She thought, how are they the concerned citizens. She's the concerned citizen. She had been fighting the fire for years. The media was there taking video cameras, filmed the marchers, looping red ribbon over everything, and Mary Lou's neighbor,

Speaker 5:          50:28          Helen cut the red room. It's down because we fought so hard to try to save Centralia. Why did they want to do this? People like Mary Lou and Helen Willmar. They started telling people, no, no, no. Here's why it's safe. Here's why you should say

Speaker 8:          50:41          parents from the other group were on TV complaining about gases in the home. It could be a death house.

Speaker 5:          50:47          It's Mary Lou, Helen and a few others started up their own committee and I did Centralia area mine task force. They got on TV themselves and in the community they started putting up flyers, fact sheets and handing them out. Yep. Door to door. Okay. On a college meeting, daughter at town meetings. The dueling committees would get up there and make their case, but this is a borehole get yelled down, will not protect us when they get old. They get rowdy. Absolutely ridiculous. Families fighting against

Speaker 8:          51:14          families, neighbors against neighbors. There's lambing and you split the town apart. Who's that? David Lamb. This guy, David Lamb, ran a motorcycle shop in town and he was also a member of this concerned citizens organization. [inaudible] early morning and one morning at about 4:00 AM he was sleeping in an apartment and someone threw a Molotov cocktail through his plate glass window. Mary Lou showed us an article from a scrapbook related to lamb's activities as an officer of concerned citizens. Wow, this is no joke. This is like the Sopranos, but worse yet this was really, it was really bad and in the midst of all this chaos, Congress started considering a bill that would basically let them buy out the town. Some observers believed that for about $50 million, Centralia could be totally bought out until the mayor decided that idea, let's hold a referendum,

Speaker 5:          52:02          and the issue was stay or go. In the weeks leading up to the referendum, Mary Lou and Helen again went door to door talking to people. They'd known their whole lives and pretty much everyone they talked to said, I really want to stay. My mother wants to stay

Speaker 8:          52:15          August 11th, 1983 shortly before 10 this evening, Centralia is mayor announced the results. There is 545 boats, boats, cash, 200 voted to stay. 345 voted to relocate. I was crying. Yes, in my heart. I never thought that would happen ever. You thought that everybody would would Wednesday, maybe 40 people might decide or maybe 30 but that was devastating to to know that so many people want it to move. It was and when you look at her scrapbooks, everything stops after that day. Yeah. This is just drawn in papers. Wow. It just stopped so abruptly. Yup. I was always mad and disgusted and I didn't want to, I didn't want to do it no more about it. That was the end. Almost immediately after that vote, Congress bought out the town. People started packing up and leaving. Know. Let me see where it is. I have some, it has the big numbers that ray Lou told us that when you decided to leave, a demolition crew would actually come to your house and paint big red letters like this. A big number one in front of your

Speaker 5:          53:26          house. Like blood was dripping off. Oh, it's like you were marked. Yeah. And what would happen? She says when your house was marked as that your neighbors would see it, they'd get nervous and then suddenly their houses would be marked and then suddenly the whole block would be marked. And I knew every one of them quite well. And I'm thinking, I stopped talking to some of them. She'd see him on the street, she says, and look the other way. I didn't like any of them really. [inaudible] and one day in the fall of 1987, these divisions caused something to happen that is just kind of like mythically bad. Yeah. It involved a married couple who'd been in the town most. She'd been there her whole life. And um, as a couple they were divided. One wanted to stay, one wanted to go. I think it was the wife who didn't want to leave and the husband, why he was a shovel runner and he, he wanted to take the money you get from your location and get out there. Neighbors were moving, had moved the houses around them are being torn down and they had to make a decision and all we really know is that at some point they started to argue and um, and it escalated. He stabbed her to death with a kitchen knife and then drove up to an old stripping pip and set himself in his car on fire.

Speaker 15:         54:37          Wow.

Speaker 5:          54:40          Is, this is going to sound like a strange question, but is there anything about that that makes sense to you? Like why couldn't people let go of this place? It is very primal. Beyond that she really couldn't say why. And we asked Mary Lou who hung on long after the murder, after that referendum, after the town was basically empty. I have no idea what kept me there. I have no idea. You have no idea. No, I knew I just didn't want to move the other street [inaudible] man banners. You got houses down there. Yeah. Today, 11 people live in town was better than his wife, man. My mom and him lived down through the intersection. Tom and Tom pointed them all out from the hill. We knocked on every door, figured we asked them what it is that keeps them living literally on top of a fire. Hi, good evening. Wow. That was the shortest, but none of them wanted to talk to us. Not even the dogs. Oh, okay. All right. But then Tom two took us to one last spot.

Speaker 5:          55:49          Where are we right now? You're in San Ignatius, Roman Catholic cemetery. The cemetery is just a few feet away from the hill where we started and it's a really strange contrast. You go from this steamy hell and then suddenly you're in like Woodsy, Vermont. There's a lot of big beautiful, this is my grandfather and my grandmother. Tom has four generations buried here. Do you know how many people are here, Tom? There's over 3000 burials and this time I Terry along 3000 yes. Plus the thing is says Tom, even the that left fled that fire, continue to come back and be buried in the cemetery, which means this place, the cemetery is the only thing in Centralia that's still growing.

Speaker 3:          56:37          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          56:37          it's suddenly how Joan put it earlier. It is very primal. Made Sense. You can experience your life on a multigenerational planet. This is where my great grandparents are buried, which means in a sense, this town will never die as long as the cemetery is still here. Not even read their name on it this year. This dig it up. Oh, it's under the dirt.

Speaker 3:          57:03          Do a get this up by Shauna.

Speaker 5:          57:11          See it sinking down into the ground, but it's in the, it's in the dirt. No, yes, yes, no. There we go. We can see a dem has c y s y thinks about Walter's for reporting that with me and also to Chris Perkel and Georgie Roland who directed a great documentary about Centralia called the town that was, you can find out more information about that on our website. radiolab.org I'm Robert Krulwich.
