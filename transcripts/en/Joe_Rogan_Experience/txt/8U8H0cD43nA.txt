Speaker 1:          00:00          And there's a history to boxing know that unfortunately, you know, because I care about the sports for my whole life. Um, that it's kind of, yeah, it's got a reputation as being correct. Yeah. And unfortunately, fortunately, and unfortunately, like there's a part, the good part where the history goes back longer, farther than any other sport, any other sport. I mean, it was the first sport in the Olympics, it goes back further. And it was the biggest sport in this country, bigger than baseball. At one time it was that big. I mean, you know, so and now it's, it's not, and it, it's too bad because, and it's too bad that the kids, that the younger people, they don't have the ability to learn about those fighters. So special fighters that were special, they really want, and it was special for different reasons. Like, like Jackie Robinson was special.

Speaker 1:          01:01          We know, we don't have to go into why he was special, but nobody knows that Joe Lewis, who is quiet and everything, but when he was in the army and there was, you know, segregation and all that crap going on, he, he quietly used his position as heavyweight champ of the world to make sure that when he went to movies and they put him in the front row and he saw that blacks weren't allowed to come in. He said, I'm not going in there unless blacks can come in there. When he went to other sort of events where the same kind of junk was going on, he very quietly but powerfully integrated things and said, no, I'm going to make a change here. You, you, you're not going to have me and not have people that look like me, you know, kept out. So he, I never, people I've read about it because I like reading about those things, about history, um, to see how we can be better and, and um, where we've come from.

Speaker 1:          02:05          And there were history of black families, you know, poor black families that would, would get hope from just saying, Hey, Luiz did it. They would tell their kids, Hey Joe, listen, I don't want to hear this. I don't want to hear that. You can't do this. Joe Lewis did it. And so he was that important. That's all, that's the only point I'm making here. He was that freaking important that that history and the history of other fighters like him doesn't have to be black fighters, but that what they fo what they did, what they overcame, where they came from, who Benny Lennon. Um, one of the greatest Jewish fighters of all time. There was a time when, uh, and it's still around, unfortunately there's a lot of antisemitism, but there was a time where, you know, it was tough being a Jew and, and you're growing up and he get caught on kike on, on pronounce it right.

Speaker 1:          02:59          I think it was right. And you get caught. All those kind of, I don't even know what the hell that means. I just know it's a bad name to call ju. And, and you had all that stuff going on and jewels woman thought of being there were thought of moving towards banking in the, they moving towards things will make them money into that. Later on they started doing that but they wouldn't have ghettos and they were trying to pull themselves out. And so at that era, during that time, the twenties to thirties the truth was some of the best fighters because that was their way of getting out. But there was [inaudible], there was another significance to be in a Julie's fighter that a lot of the kids, they won't be thought of as be in Tufts or they got picked on and thought of that they're going to go more towards academic and other stuff.

Speaker 1:          03:49          So there was a weakness perceived not true. None of this stuff is perceived but cause Mark. Yeah. So now all of a sudden Betty Lennon comes along when a sports, the biggest sport in the country and he's the best freaking fighter in a game. And he combed his hair before he got in a ring and he would come out without it being messed. And this was, this guy was, I mean he was, he was Michael Jordan. I mean before that stuff, before Michael joined, before air Jordan [inaudible]. I mean this guy was down only tough. He was not only a champion, which obviously connected to being tough by itself, but it was, he was smart. He was, he was cool. He had pazazz, he was a man and there were Jewish families. You don't hear about these stories, but there were Jewish families I've read and I've heard from people where say, Hey, don't let nobody pick on you.

Speaker 1:          04:52          Benny Leonard is the best fighter in the world. Jews are tough. We're, we're not just smart. We're tough. Benny Leonard shows that. So that kinda history, that kind of polling of people up in many different ways, not just economically out of poverty, but, but emotionally, mentally, because you can be in poverty mentally. You can be in the low place mentally. It doesn't have to be, you know, financially all the time. You know where you have holes in your shoes and you and you're wearing shirts that don't fit now it can be the way you feel about yourself that is without is without Prince 30 with with without value. You have no value for yourself as a person. That's the worst poverty in the frictional world. There's not the lower than that and Joe Lewis and Benny Leonard, they were fighters. They weren't baseball players. They pulled people out of those.

Speaker 1:          05:58          They let people know they had value, that their race had value, their people had value, they had value and that should be known and you can go anywhere and am glad you can because I love all sports. You can go anywhere and you can read about the greatness of the baseball players in a greatness of, of course NFL hasn't been around that long, but the greatness of those players and the greatness of the NBA players, but where do the kids ever get to read and to hear and to see about the greatness of these people, these fighters? V nowhere, very little. Very little. It's not there. Why? Because again, I'm not going to get into craziness, but the powers that be the, listen, it's not marketed properly. I get it. It doesn't have a commission so it doesn't take care of itself the way the U of C, the greatness about the why the UFC grew so much as they marketed themselves in a tremendous way.

Speaker 1:          06:56          So there's nobody, boxing is just there. It takes care of itself. It exists because it's man against man. So it's always going to be there. But nobody's building it. Nobody's marketing and Norman's feeding them monster to make it bigger. It's a plant that's in the corner of, of of your offers that doesn't get sun, doesn't get hot, but it's still there. It's still there. And what I'm saying is that [inaudible] I didn't want to yell because now people are probably happy but, but, but it should be fed a little bit. It should be watered a little bit. But you know, cause of what I just described it

Speaker 2:          07:41          guys like you call that guys like you guys who have a deep appreciation for the history of the sport guy, guys who have a deep appreciation of what it meant when Joe Louis beat max Schmeling guys, guys who understand what it meant when sugar Ray Robinson was the best fighter in the world and everybody knew when he pulled up in a fucking pink Cadillac with a beautiful suit on

Speaker 1:          08:01          and any any made the elevated, he elevated people in Harlem everywhere off. But Harlem, he had, he owned half a Harlem. He owned restaurants in [inaudible] stores and barber shops and everything. And, and you wanted to be there because that's where his sugar Ray Robinson came from. Yup, it was great. Yeah, it's a rich part of history that really does get ignored. Let me tell you somewhere I was Schmeling you brought up, you know, love of obviously stuff and that's why it's nice to talk about which smelling was a hell of a fighter. Joe Lewis was the Brown bomber who was coming up. He was undefeated and I'm strolling, had the great quote before the fight. You know, it's kinda like the babe Ruth thing that they really happen where he pointed out and then he hit on, you know, those, those are great stories, but, but where, what's the real truth behind them?

Speaker 1:          08:55          You know, we don't know. We don't care. We don't care at a certain point, you know why? Because they let us feel good. They let us dream about possibilities and we should all have possibilities to dream about. And they make somebody feel good because, you know, the babe Ruth one was connected to a sick kid. So [inaudible] it's a nice thing. It's where sports can be better than just sports than just somebody participating in it. It can go beyond that. He agreed stronger than that. And that's some of the good stuff about it. And so smelling the great story, he didn't point to, you know, the, to the fence, but he said before the fight, I see something with a, that's my, my, uh, trying to be an accent for the German, you know, but I sound more like Schultz from Hogan's heroes. I don't know why every time you try to do something, like with certain ethnic, you know, pronunciations, um, you, you sounded like you go to one of those sitcoms, you go to one of those places, you know, and when I say somebody, I think my kid, I think my son said, uh, you know, he had watched one of them, uh, and I think he said he sounded like Sergeant Schultz, like from Hogan's, uh, heroes split.

Speaker 1:          10:18          And he said, I see something. And what he saw was that Louis would jab and he would leave. You should never leave your head on a, on a right side because if you leave your head, you know, you move your head to the right side, you're in a path to the right hand, you should actually finish on the left side because then you outside the right hand, you follow. There's the right man over here. It can hit you outside. Right? So he had a habit of, and he had a great trainer. He had a habit though at that point of leaving his head over on the right. So smelling saw something as he said that he could hit him with a right hand. He could time it over the jam. Now smelling was of the ilk of the level of the caliber. It wasn't just about talent.

Speaker 1:          11:05          He could punch it was a good fighter, but it was a pro. What do I mean by that? A lot of guys would hesitate a little bit. Same opening. They might see it, but it was the Brown bomber was knocking everyone out. So they hesitate. They will. They were afraid. Normal lot of people afraid of that word. I mean it's there and without it, we're not alive. So he, they, they might see the same thing, but they want them at a pro level. Pro level is a guy that can do what he has to do and no emotions interfere with doing it. I mean that's my simplest way of Webster's might not say that, but that's what I would say. So they might've seen the opening, but they would hesitate just enough and it'd be gone the door close. Cause it's, it's, it's like life.

Speaker 1:          11:58          It's moments capture moment, lose the moment. And, but this guy was a pro. He, he didn't let that come in there and make them hesitate that, that fear, he controlled it. And if Goldman was there, bang, he was going to throw the punch. So he did and he dropped lose a few times. And you know, he won that fight and was around the stop. The man, I can't remember, maybe, maybe the ninth, but it was late in the fight, but he had heard them and you know, Louis was taking a beating. So Louis Lee went on, he won no world title and um, he'd be Bradick for the title Cinderella man. Great movie. Yes. Maybe, you know, he came from welfare to be in a world champion. That's the product story without getting into it too much. So are you a lose beats sporadic and had to give a percentage, you know, tanking and Aaron might not been around then, but, but the people that told them what to do around taught them how to take advantage of fighters, taught them how, what options were before options were ever known.

Speaker 1:          13:12          You know, eh, the Vladek I think, I forget his name, but Braddock's manager basically made Lewis and his people agree to give him a percentage of his person for the rest of his career to get the fight. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, you could obviously research it and look into how much percentage, Oh, I don't know. I listened. I could say 10%, but I don't want to say definitively because I'm not positive, but, but there was an understanding that you know, you, you're not getting a fight otherwise you won't get the fight now. And listen, like I said, you know, not great guys, but King in Iram, uh, they, they had other guys before them that taught them some of these moves. Right. You know, that Von is so nice, but there's always a history of good and bad. Sure. Always. Who's good? Well, this, there's a shining star promoter out there.

Speaker 1:          14:14          I'll try to think about it. So we, so they go and they are, he wins the title and of course the biggest sport in the country. So all the presses there and there, Joel is the champion, was not yet. Not yet. What do you mean not yet? Just one of the title. Not yet. Not to. I beat that man. He didn't even have to say his name not to, I beat that man. That's how much pride he had. And listen, he's the real deal because it is mine. How could I be champion of a guy knocked me out? Right? So when that fight took place, I mean, you talk about ha, uh, setting a stage, you know, the, nowadays people say, Oh, I'm on a stage. It's a lot of pressure, you know, Hey, I'm not saying it's not, I'm not saying it, but a lot of pressure, you know, almost a lot of people look in, a lot of people, you know, depending on, I, I learned stuff going on, you know, and I, you know, maybe I got a headache, but Joe Lewis had world war two on horizon.

Speaker 1:          15:23          The president of the United States called them up and you had Nazi Germany. He had a guy named Hitler that that is saying that he's got, you know, the master race, it's going to take over the world. Just starting that stuff for not too far away from world war II and you got all that stuff permeating in the air and you've got laws fighting. A guy who of course, you know, propaganda was started by the Germans, if you want almost to me almost invented that word because you had to propaganda minister and you had all these terrible people with Hitler that we're putting out today. The master race that is there that you had to judge y'all win situation Olympics. Yeah. And now you had the biggest sport in the biggest country and the champion of that sport, the heavyweight chair, Joe Lewis, and he's fighting the German fighter shearling the second time now for the title.

Speaker 1:          16:22          And of course you had Hitler nor his psycho fans or these people that were, their job was to promote it, so to speak. And they come and they're saying, we will show the world that we're superior and there's no better way to show it then in a ring. And so Louis has to, he's gotten, he's got to carry all this stuff. I mean take about it. And he's a black guy in a country that, that he still can't go into certain places. T and he's got to carry the whole, he's got to carry the whole country and not let them down. And the president calls, and again, we don't know if there's a legendary story, we don't know if it's completely true, but supposedly the president called him, said, Joe, you've got a windows one for the good guys that that's, that's one of the legends. I don't know if it's true, but I know that, I'm sure he called him, I'm sure he called them and Louis has to go into, it's gotta go into Yankee stadium outdoors and in times square in New York, they used to have it set up where they would do radio because all the fight one radio back then and some of them on fights, on TV, on select cavalcade sports and all that stuff. Fight and I fight. But was, was common along, you know, to stop coming along. But radio was the thing. And so in times square you had the radio speakers outdoors

Speaker 3:          18:03          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          18:04          you know, playing a fight broadcast in the fight. So people out on the streets, they hear the radio and a a, you know, Joe Lewis is walking into the ring and you know, and, and you've got the Yankee stadium, you've got to place full and you've got the whole world of everything I just described. The good, the bad, the evil, the ugly, everything. It's not a movie, it's real life. And you got Joe Lewis and he gets in that ring in here, Nile with all this pressure, wood, wood that, that he's got to save the, basically the United States in a world from, from looking like this, this ugly scorch and, and, and disease of the Nazi party is, is going to take over. The world is greater than us and he and he single handily has to prove that.

Speaker 3:          19:02          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:02          And he, he goes in there and he annihilates the guy in one round

Speaker 3:          19:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          19:07          with all that stuff hanging over them. I think that's the greatest single event in the history of the world. Pull that fighter, pull that fight up and put it in the background. And I think that diet, when you talk about all the things that we're here to talk about, about character, about talent, about presence, [inaudible], about resiliency, about, about caring, about more than yourself, about selflessness.

Speaker 3:          19:35          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          19:36          about strength. When you talk about all those things that we try to say that we care about and that we sometimes look to to be, and very rarely can we be that he was all that he was all of that. And there it is right there. I mean, how great is that? And he stalked a guy. He stalked a guy and his punches was short and powerful and he was the greatest finish in the history of heavyweight boxing because when he hurts you, you didn't survive. He got rid of you. He put punches together and there was short and he was always in position. Look at his legs. He's always in position. You move forward. He takes a little step forward back to give yourself rules. Punches is absolutely beautiful. If you wanted to teach a young fighter how to punch correctly, Joe Lewis, there's no better guy to watch than cholo you saw.

Speaker 1:          20:34          Did you see Joe, what he did of our go? No a minute ago. Smelling tried to catch them with that same right hand. He had knocked him out two years earlier. Go back. They just missed it, but he changed. He stepped out. He changed his distance this time because Jackie Blackburn, who's a great fighter, a black fighter, he was a trainer. He was a great train and nobody hears about Jackie Blackburn what a great fighter he was and what a great trainee was and how he wasn't allowed to fight white fighters and he beat everybody looked at cattle. Love took instead of laying his head on the right like he did the first fight, he changed his range and he made that right-hand miss. Look how calm he is. Look how calm he is. Look how focused he is. It's beautiful. Watch shortness of those punches. That's phenomenal.

Speaker 1:          21:24          I love watches legs. Joe. Watch. Watch how he's always in position. Look at what did we miss? What didn't you see? Go back to sidestep. No, the blinding jab that that sets it up. We don't see what the Jeb was just a Dick boy, just so we can hit it with the right so you don't see it. Right. What a beautiful sidestep to right after he lands a right hand. Beautiful. Look at that. Well that's why he's the greatest finish of all time. Watch, watch, wait. He finishes this guy. What? He's got to go to the body and the head. Head to the body right ahead to the head. Oh, that is so short. And even when he's got the guy hurt, look at the guy. Look at at phenomenal, phenomenal. And he did all of that with everything we just talked about for the last 20 minutes hanging over him. Yeah. He's a history that people don't talk about, but doesn't that make you think a little bit, doesn't it make you feel something about us? Really? Yeah. Well it's one of the reasons why I'm a giants fan of the sport. Yeah. Thank you. I mean that that alone is a, in terms of like historical impact. I agree with you. It's one of the biggest moments in all of sports ever in life, in life.
