00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.520
&gt;&gt; Mary Oey: Good morning.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.090
I am Mary Oey from
conservation division and welcome

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.030
to preservation week at
the Library of Congress.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.840
Preservation week is an
initiative started in 2009

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.820
by several organizations, including
the library, to raise awareness

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.900
for preservation of
cultural heritage.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:45.450 position:56%
Today's event is our second and
last preservation week 2016 program,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.430
and our 78th topics and
preservation series lecture.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.040
Excuse me.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.250
Andrew Robb is head of
Special Format Conservation

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.310
and oversees the care of the
library's 15 million photographs.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.610
He is also responsible

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.660
for the library's preservation
emergency response team,

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.200
and serves on the library's
emergency management team.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.170
He acts as the library's
point of contact

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.320
for federal emergency plans
related to cultural resources.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.460
He has been a co-chair of
the emergency committee

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.400
of the American Institute for
Conservation, and is a member

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.140 position:56%
of the National Heritage Responders.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.110
Andrew received an MS in art
conservation with a major

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.620
in photograph conservation, and
a minor in paper conservation

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.420 position:56%
from the University of Delaware
Winterthur Art Conservation Program.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.510
Welcome Andrew.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:53.270
[ Applause ]

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.570
&gt;&gt; Andrew Robb: Thank you Mary.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.970
Do I have all the mics right?

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.980
Welcome everybody that's
in the auditorium,

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.550
as well as about 78
people out in the ether.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.520
So I hope everybody can hear me.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.500
We have three microphones, it
feels quite impressive up here.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.160
So let's start.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.120
So today's topic is about
heritage emergency management

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.820
and the Florence flood.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.360
I've changed the title slightly
since we put up the announcement

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.860
because there's some things that
I'm going to talk about that are

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.190
from before the Florence flood.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.530
But it's a good touchdown for how
things have developed both up to

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.960
that point, and after that point.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.880
It really is a central moment
in both our field as well

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.560
as in the broader area
of emergency management.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.420
So let's just review a little
bit about Florence flood.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.510 position:56%
Many of us saw the Zeffirelli film
yesterday, which is an excellent way

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.320
of just really getting into
the feeling of that moment

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.780
and how desperate and
horrible it was.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.850
It was in November of 1966, and it
started because of heavy rainfalls

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.120
above Florence that came
down the Arno River and went

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.680
through the center of Florence.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.300
It also flooded close to a third
of the northern part of Italy.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.280
So Venice was also affected.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.790
It was not just a local disaster,
it was a national disaster of very,

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.320
very large, it was very large.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.160
Obviously Florence is a cultural
center, and an enormous amount

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.730
of cultural resources were damaged.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.620
3 to 4 million books and
manuscript materials,

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.080
as well as close to
14,000 works of art.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.530
And many of these truly
iconic works of art

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.330
that certainly grab
the world's attention.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.810
As you can see on the
right, these are pictures

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.370
from a National Geographic
article from 1967 that was,

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.030
it's quite often cited as
a way of the continued,

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.970
people were continually interested
in this and it is quite difficult

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.630
to understand how impactful things
like that article were at the time,

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.240
in a time when we have the
Internet and cable news.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.280
The images of this and the film
were quite important in terms

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.600
of conveying to people
the extent of the damage.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.640
Extremely high waters, very, and
also moving at a very high speed.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.760
So very destructive,
and full of heating oil.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.930
So dirty, moving at great
force, at times over 20 feet.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:43.480
This is the following day, the
rain started on November 3,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.200
flooding started in the very
early morning of November 4

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.680
and this picture is probably
in the afternoon of November 4

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.300
or the following day on the
fifth, probably on the fourth.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.030
You can see the Ponte Vecchio
to orient yourself back here.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.850
The worst flooding is just,
if you're following the river,

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.450
just up the river here
and that's Santa Croche

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:13.320
where them an extensive number
of artworks were damaged,

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.740
and you can see that, you can
see the aftermath below you.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.460 position:56%
The north side of the river was more
badly affected than the south side

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.820
and that's why people
are able to gain access.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.220
It's a little higher ground.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.110
But you can see the
extent of the water

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:35.930 position:56%
after the rainfall has stopped, it's
close to the height of the first,

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.050
the first story of the cloister.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.420 position:56%
So all of the artwork that's at
that level was submerged underwater.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:51.440
Like a lot of emergencies
will have this recurrent theme

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.900
that while they happen
unexpectedly, they don't happen

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.850
in a completely random way.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.810
Florence had had a series of
floods throughout the centuries.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:13.420
Easily four other major
floods in 1333, 1557, 1966,

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.670
and 13 other minor
floods since 1557.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:24.510 position:56%
You can get a sense of the timing by
various markers throughout the city

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:32.460
that are marking the 1557 flood,
the 1966 flood, 1333 flood,

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.660
that these are certainly
witnesses as you're walking

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:42.890
through the the town, looking up
close to 20 feet up of the extent

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.730 position:56%
of what can happen and had happened.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:53.630
We saw a lot of this yesterday
when we were watching the movie

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.620
and just this the efforts
of just the,

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.270
of just reclaiming
the city, enormous.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:05.960
Come back to this, but this
shows you sort of, you know,

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:12.600
even if by the first few days,
few weeks, lots of efforts

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.860
to stabilize very important
works of art

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.930
that were completely
submerged under water.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.610
You can see here the line

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:29.720
of how high the water
got, so very extensive.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.730
The Last Supper was
faced with paper,

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:38.240
a lot of paintings were treated
that way to stabilize them.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.130
In this case, it was on a series
of panels, we'll come back

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:48.200
to this later, but was stabilized
and treated at a later time.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.070
How much later, we'll
get into a bit.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:57.000
So I said it wasn't only artworks,
it was also library materials.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:03.330 position:56%
What we would describe as a National
Library of Italy is actually

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:07.090
in Florence and it
was extremely damaged.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:11.120
It was also in an area that
received a lot of flooding,

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:16.110
close to 70,000 rare
volumes and over a million

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.310 position:56%
and a half general collection items.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:22.860
And you can see the reading room
area is being used as a triage area

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.670
where things are coming
out from the stacks.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:31.840
And this is where you get a
sense of those that came to help

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.840
and assist with the recovery.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:40.510
The mud angels, and it was muddy,
it was muddy for days and weeks.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:46.420
So it's, so that sort of gets
you through the initial response.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:51.830
We saw a lot of that in
yesterday's viewing of the film.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:57.250
The initial salvage, getting
things out from areas that,

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:02.180
so they could be stabilized
and treated.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.340
The story for the Library of
Congress in many ways starts here

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.890
because our founding chief of
conservation, Peter Waters,

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:12.700
was at that time, not at the
library, he was still working

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.300
as a book binder in England.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:19.720
But he was, he came to head the
recovery, the long-term recovery

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:24.100
and treatment of items
after the floods.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:30.300
So this is a lab that he
set up to start that work,

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.860 position:56%
and as part of that work, he brought
in colleagues Don Etherington,

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:35.970
Chris Clarkson, among others.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:39.360
What's interesting is all three
of them eventually came here

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.570
and were essentially many
of our founding leaders

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:43.870
in the conservation division.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:48.160
And I think we carry a
legacy of that experience

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.770
because of the way they set up
the lab and the way they thought

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.790
about dealing with scale,
and the way they thought

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.490
about dealing with
important objects.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:59.290
It was very much formed in
the crucible of Florence.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:03.050
You can see below on the left,
these are items of volumes

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:06.680
that still remain untreated,
but they're stabilized,

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.040
and we'll come back that theme.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.080
It's very similar to
the Last Supper.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.540
Items are stabilized, but
they may not be fully treated

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.320
for years, if not decades.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.550
And I think this is something
that as we look back at Florence

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.160
and we look at other
more recent emergencies,

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.860
we should be more mindful of this

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.880
and speak more clearly
about that difference.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.460
I'll talk about that in a second.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.000
But these are stable, they're
not going to get worse,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.530
but they're not fully treated.

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.220
They're shelved and can be
retrieved and treated as needed.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:42.670
So this leads me to why
am I giving this talk?

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:43.970
I was not a mud angel.

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:52.060 position:56%
I was about one, I was busy watching
baseball, as many of you know,

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.670
that's a great interest of
mine as is monochromatic images

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.990
which is also interesting to think

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:02.910
of how far back these
interests go in my life.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:08.490 position:56%
But I was here when Peter was here,
I'm right back here, all that person

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:14.360
with all that hair,
right there, that's me.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:18.470
So I did get the privilege
of working with Peter

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:22.180
and interestingly we rarely talked
about Florence, we mainly talked

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:25.410
about the point system
and the computers

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:26.710
that were brought into the lab.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:31.120
So, apples don't fall far from the
trees either, I spend a lot of time

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.680
in front of computers now.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:39.870 position:56%
But Peter's impact on the lab was
enormous and it was a real privilege

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:44.380
to be able to work with him and to
just understand where he was coming

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:49.030
from in terms of the
way our lab worked.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:55.530
But as I said, I had an
interest in photography images

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:58.880
and I became a photograph
conservator, so again, that's,

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:03.420
wonder why would you become
interested in emergency response.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:09.100 position:56%
Well, partly because when you have a
lot of photographs, of which we do,

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:15.090 position:56%
they're quite vulnerable and they're
the kind of objects that you worry

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:20.290
about when you have emergencies,
floods, or even smaller incidents.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:28.010
And so pulling all this
together, after Florence 1975,

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:31.420
Peter published Salvage of
Water Damaged Library Materials

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.550
which is an incredibly useful
and practical book even today.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:38.980
Something I still refer to
on a fairly regular basis,

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:42.550
just for practical common
sense ways of dealing

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.200
with large-scale emergencies.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.610
Unfortunately, Klaus
Hendricks [assumed spelling]

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:49.410
at the National Archives
of Canada at the time,

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.590
and Brian Lesser [assumed spelling]
published a really important paper

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:56.130
about the recovery of photographs
in these kinds of incidents,

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:59.760
enormously good compliment to
this article, they really, I mean,

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.760 position:56%
to Peter's book, excuse me, in 1983.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:07.330
And so by the time I was
in school, graduate school,

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:12.280
this was a fundamental text for
me in terms of understanding how

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.790 position:56%
to help and assist people as they
may ask questions or need assistance

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:18.470
in terms of an emergency.

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:24.350
The core thing that comes out of
Florence, among many core things,

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:27.030
besides the development
of professionalism,

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:31.500
of labs like our own, is a real
sense of what can we do better?

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.170
What tools can we use?

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:34.920 position:56%
What kinds of technology can we use?

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:38.740
And it really comes down to
people really thinking hard about,

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:42.970
can we freeze materials,
dry them in other ways

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:47.270
so that we buy ourselves time so
we don't have to worry about things

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:51.470
like mold increasing damage,
because things are waterlogged?

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:55.760
And because of Peter and many
others that were focusing on how

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.740
to improve response and recovery
methods, we typically recommend,

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:04.270
particularly for library materials,
that we, that you freeze it.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.470
If you have the scale and you have
the resources to not freeze it,

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:11.760
and to air dry it, and do, in
some cases, a full treatment,

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.670
that obviously is preferable.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:17.780
But if you don't have
that, those options,

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:21.430
freezing is a very viable solution.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:26.450
And it's something that now
we have a very robust set

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:33.270
of a whole industry around us and a
real sense of experience and scale

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:37.920
where this is a vacuum chamber
that is quite, quite large.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:43.160
So this comes out of
a sense of hospitals,

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.460
law firms, people with records.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.130
Emergencies happen frequently.

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:51.520
We don't always hear about them,
but water instances, they happen.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.300
And a whole industry has
come out, since Florence,

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:59.830
surrounding the assistance of these
kinds of incidents and these kinds

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:04.200
of capacities exist in a way
that they did not at Florence.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:10.760
So we'll circle back to the
Library of Congress where we are,

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.400
where Peter started the lab.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.860
Where he initiated a lot of
important conservation approaches,

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.280
what we now call collection
stabilization,

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.550
which at the time we
called base conservation.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:23.850
How to deal with scale.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:27.090
How to deal with important
objects at the same time.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:28.820
We have three very large buildings.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:34.950
We have close to, I think a hundred
and fifty million objects located

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:37.480
on Capitol Hill in these
three buildings here.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.580
Just to give you a sense if you're
unfamiliar with our buildings,

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.860
three very large buildings
full of collections.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:48.670
And our experience then going
back with, so we have Peter,

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.370
Peter was at Florence, he
came and set up the lab.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:54.590
But at the library we also have
another legacy that has to do

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:59.360
with we've experienced, oh sorry,
I'm getting ahead of myself.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.700
These are some of the hundred
and fourty million things ranging

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.860
from Jefferson's, Thomas
Jefferson's original library,

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:08.490
our second founding library,
I'll get into that in a moment.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.380
Iconic objects like
the Gutenberg Bible,

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:17.130
Declaration of Independence
draft, pre-Columbian objects,

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:23.320
musical instruments, photographs,
as well as many, many, many books.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.000
Some of which are on
the floor unfortunately.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.390
So let's go back to,
so where did we start?

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:33.680
Well, we started as truly a
legislative library in this part

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.540
of the original capital building.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:41.970
Not a very large library, and
not a particularly expansive one,

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:43.930
and it was burned in
the war of 1812.

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:47.880 position:56%
In 1814 the British came down
Maryland Avenue, burned the capital,

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.960
and the library was destroyed.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.930
And why is this relevant for us?

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:55.680
Well in many ways, we are the
way we are because the decision

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.490
to purchase Thomas Jefferson's
library to replace it,

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.440
gave us the mandate
that we still hold

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.470
to have an encyclopedic collection
of human creativity and knowledge.

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.960
We are the only national library
that has such a broad mandate

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.120
in the sense that other national
libraries typically are collecting

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.640
in their, either their
nation or their language.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.210
Close to two thirds of our
new acquisitions in terms

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.420
of just our books are
in foreign languages,

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:24.320
and we have an extremely
broad and collecting mandate,

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.920
both in terms of breadth and depth.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:30.370
And that comes directly because of
the way we responded to the fire

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:32.570
and the loss of our
original library.

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:38.650 position:56%
We grew very quickly during the 19th
century, suffered a number of fires,

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:40.110
and sadly many of the volumes

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:43.310
of Thomas Jefferson's original
library were lost in those fires.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:46.420
And so the building of
the Jefferson building

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.150
in the late 19th century was
in direct response to that.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:51.260
It has very little wood in it.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:56.590
It's made out of metal,
stone, glass,

00:17:56.590 --> 00:18:01.800
in ways that were really meant
to protect items from fire.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.610
So we're very mindful of this, it's
why we have the collection we have,

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:10.760
it's why we have the
mission we have.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:16.690
And we've continued to do this both
in terms of what Peter carried on,

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:20.190
in terms of, I'm including him
here as having worked in Florence.

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:23.910
Obviously he wasn't here at the
time, he had not quite gotten here,

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:30.410
but we do a lot of work in terms
of both outreach, assisting people,

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.910
training people, as well as,
as I'll get into a moment,

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:37.260
working on federal policy and
national policy on this issue.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.330
We take it seriously,
and it's something

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:40.670
that we're quite committed to.

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:43.710
Not just in our part of the
library, but across the libraries,

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.860
as I'll refer to in a moment.

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:52.870
So we talk about broader,
take a step back and look

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:56.100
at federal institutions and
federal cultural institutions,

00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:00.030
we are the first federal cultural
institution founded in 1800.

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:03.590
The Smithsonian follows us in 1846,

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:09.210
followed by the National Park
Service for our natural patrimony

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:14.550
that we have, national
archives is formed in 1934

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:19.370
to aggregate federal records in a
way that had not been done before,

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:22.260
and we have the National
Gallery in 1941.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.430
There are a few other
federal cultural institutions

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:29.440
and I'm not leaving them out,
well I'm leaving them out,

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.100
but I'm including them here.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.620
I'm not including them here because
as we we'll see as we start getting

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.670
into federal initiatives that
have to do with Heritage emergency

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:41.260
and response, these are
the core federal agencies

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.600 position:56%
that both have the technical
experience as well as the background

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.960
of having experience either
losses or contributing

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.210
to other kinds of efforts.

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:50.910
These are the core five.

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:55.170
We talked about support
agencies, there was really little,

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.620
there was really very
little federal support

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:01.220
for collections before the 1960s.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:06.640
And we have the creation of
NEA in 1965, NEH in 1965,

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:14.920
IMLS in 1996 formally, but has
antecessors in 1976 and 1956.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.250
These are support agencies
in the truest sense,

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:19.810
they do not have collections.

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:22.460
They don't, they are not
responsible for them,

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.480
but they support others
who hold those things.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:30.540 position:56%
And we have a very decentralized way
of caring for our cultural heritage.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.440
Other countries have
ministries of culture

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.450
where the national library not
only runs its national collection,

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:37.520
but it runs all the
libraries underneath it.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.480
We don't follow that
model, and NEA, NEH,

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.600
IMLS are ways that we support
the efforts that are happening

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.420
at a state or local level.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:50.440
And they're modeled after the
National Science Foundation

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.930
which was formed in 1950 to do
the same kind of thing in support

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:57.270
of science and other
kinds of efforts.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:03.470 position:56%
One of the reasons why this is going
on, if you're looking at other kinds

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:06.600
of efforts that we've made that
really are, I think, are important.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:12.020
The monuments men and the,
essentially the monuments fine arts

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:16.240
and archives is our formal name,

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:21.380
organized to protect
initially things

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:25.000
in the European theater during
World War II, both to protect them

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:32.090
from being in a warfront and
also in repatriating items

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:35.140
that had been stolen or
looted during the war.

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:39.180
So this is something that as
we're looking at federal policy,

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:43.270
is an important way that
even in times of war,

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.170
there was a recognition
that cultural patrimony,

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:48.220
cultural heritage was an
important, was something important

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:52.310
and important enough that, in fact,
as commander of all of the forces

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:57.680
of allies General Eisenhower
commanded

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:02.660
that all officers take this into
account and officers were seconded

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:07.780
to work with them to protect
these items if it all possible.

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:11.430
One of our founding
fathers in the field

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:16.690
of conservation is George Stout,
and he's here with the helmet

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:19.580
and the N. He was in the Navy,
he was very proud of that.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:23.630
And there, this is where they're
recovering the Ghent altarpiece

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:26.950
that had been removed
during the war.

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:34.190
So in this way, very similar iconic
artworks that attempts were made

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:36.320
to save them during the war.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:41.470
And remember this is really
in the period of 1943 to 1945.

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:49.310 position:56%
So to get into federal legislations,
so we have cultural institutions

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:51.220 position:56%
but we're decentralized in the sense

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:54.430
that those cultural institutions
have a primary responsibility

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:56.800
for their collections.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.740
They don't have as strong a
priority in terms of caring

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.040
for other people's collections,

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.880
we have a cleaner divide
than in other places.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.080
We do have federal legislation
that starts coming into play

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:16.350
to protect both items that
are in the nation that we feel

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:18.460
like are worthy of caring for them.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:24.090
So we have the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966.

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:29.580
And it has some antecessors or
antecedants in 1935 and 1960,

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:33.890 position:56%
but essentially we create a
national register of historic sites.

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:37.270
This is quite important as
we get into some of the ways

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:39.500
in which we respond to emergencies.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:43.800
And it's essentially been amended
to include not just historic sites,

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.480
but also archaeological
objects, shipwrecks,

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.840
Native American material,
both in grave sites as well

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:58.650
as archaeological sites, maritime
areas, battlefields, lighthouses.

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:02.850
And all of these have
a real legal protection

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:07.090
and federal money is involved, and
it requires a review of the impact

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:09.140
of any kind of federal
action on these areas.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:15.830
And this really comes out of a
sense during the 60s that because

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:21.010
of increased building, postwar
building, the highway system,

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:23.380 position:56%
a number of things where the federal
government is actually spending a

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:27.710
fair amount of money that
items and important buildings

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.680
and environments are being lost.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.790
And so this is a way
to protect them.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:33.950
It doesn't always mean the
federal government owns them,

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:35.270
usually it means that they don't.

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:37.550
It just means that these
things have a status

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:42.660
that requires review before
federal action takes place.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:45.360
So the national register is
something you'll see plaques.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.770
If you go over to St. Mark's Church

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:48.630
which is right behind the Adams
[assumed spelling] building,

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:50.340
you'll see it's on
the national register.

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.190
And it's precisely on
the national register

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:55.680
because St. Mark's didn't want to
be the next church that got torn

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.650
down as the library
continued its march east.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:02.430
It's there, that's on the
national register to stop

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:05.970
that from happening in theory.

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:14.550
One of the things though
that's interesting

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:24.140
if you read the highest level
language of, of the NFPA act,

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:29.690 position:56%
it describes that the Secretary of
the Interior is authorized to expand

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:32.500
and maintain a national register
of historic places comprised

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.700
of district sites, building
structures, and objects,

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:38.960
significant in American history,
architecture, archaeology,

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.310
engineering, and culture.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:43.210
So that seems like that
would cover objects,

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:46.540
but in fact it doesn't
cover objects.

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:49.730
Generally, the notion is
is that objects have to be,

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:53.440
they have to be associated
with that site to be covered

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.820
by the national register.

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:58.280
And in fact commentary,
not so much legislation,

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.350 position:56%
but certainly commentary on how to
implement this explicitly describes,

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:06.570
excuse me, that objects that are
in a museum are not appropriate

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:08.050
for the national register.

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:12.100
So when you're talking
about what these laws do,

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:15.480
essentially the built environment,
things that are outdoors,

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:16.840
have a lot of protection.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:21.950
Things that are indoors,
collections, objects,

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:23.380
are not protected in the same way.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.980
And we'll see why that's
important in a second.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:32.890
A comparable set of
legislation happened in 1970,

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:35.790
the National Environmental
Protection Act.

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:38.100
And this is something when
whenever you hear on the news

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:41.050
that there's a project
going on, they're waiting

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:43.850
for an Environmental Impact
Assessment or some kind

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:45.250
of environmental statement

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:48.720
about what the project will
do, it comes from this law.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:54.650
So between 1966, 1970, we have two
fundamental acts that describe how

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:57.500
to take care of the built
environment and how to take care

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.090
of the natural environment.

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:04.200
And the human environment
comes in to play with NEPA

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.170
because the human environment
can include some kinds

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:09.930
of cultural resources, like
cemeteries in particular,

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:12.460
where they're part
of that environment

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.620
so that you have a slight
crossover between these two acts.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:19.150
But again, it does not include
what we would generally consider

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:21.450
as collection objects.

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:28.260
These projects, in particular, we
have another tie to at the library

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:32.250
in that the documentation around
these historic structures,

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.850
the sets of legislation
that have to do

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:38.110
with historic preservation include
the historic American buildings

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:41.580
survey, the historic
American engineering record,

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.120
and the historic American
landscape survey.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.800
And all of those are
Department of Interior,

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:51.680 position:56%
National Park Service projects, that
document that environment and copies

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:55.090
of those items, those drawings
come to us at the library

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.780
and we serve them as
part of our collections.

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:01.800
So we have a very direct link
to that legislation in the sense

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.290
that we benefit from that
and build our collections

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:07.490
around those activities.

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:09.070
This is an interesting example

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:11.260
of St. Michael's Cathedral
in Sitka, Alaska.

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:17.300
It was one of the first buildings
in Alaska to be done as a part

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:21.890
of the HABS work, and
it burned down.

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:26.250
And this is the church that was
built from the HABS drawings.

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:33.310 position:56%
It was rebuilt using this, the
material that we, that we hold here.

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:36.430 position:56%
Landscape survey is somewhat newer,
but it builds on that and it's a way

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:40.800
of documenting a, those
kinds of landscapes

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.820
that are protected in
the 1970 legislation.

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:52.900
So this leads us to something
that's really interesting about,

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:58.670
at least in the United States, what
do we call all of this material

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:03.290
that is generated in terms of
human creativity, human knowledge,

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:06.050
that those, that's what we
use in our mission statement.

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:09.350 position:56%
Is it art, is it cultural resources,
is it heritage, is it collections,

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:14.530
is it historic materials, historic
properties, material culture?

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:17.040
Generally speaking, all
of these terms get used.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:21.580
Increasingly, heritage is being
used as that term to encompass all

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:24.820
of those things, but
keep in mind that all

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.490
of those things have different
legal status in the way

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:29.810
that we respond particularly
in emergencies.

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:31.440
That's why I'm bringing this up.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:35.020
This is not just an American
issue, it's an international issue.

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.990
I was at a conference
earlier in the spring

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:41.400
where we easily spent a few hours
talking about what culture is,

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.240
how you take care of
it, how you define it,

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.230
how you do it in a way
that's appropriate.

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:50.410 position:56%
If you're doing response, how you're
including all the stakeholders

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:52.150
in a cultural interaction.

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:54.790
It can get quite complicated.

00:29:54.790 --> 00:30:00.550
You can think of things in a
hierarchy, national treasures,

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:03.040
historic materials,
personal property.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.960
And this is something I
want to emphasize too,

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.840
that while all I've been talking
about are essentially things

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.500
that are in collections, people
have their own collections.

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:12.800 position:56%
Families have their own collections.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.550
And that becomes an issue too
in how we respond in emergencies

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:17.850
and how we use our resources.

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:24.230
So let's switch slightly
to talk about some terms

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:26.980
about emergencies and disasters.

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:30.850
Florence is a disaster, and it's
the kind of disaster that it's sort

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:35.210
of a keystone if you're looking
at the history of the field.

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:37.610
A definition, it's something

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:40.630 position:56%
where you have severe property
damage deaths and multiple injuries.

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:47.760
And it can be from now in our,
excuse me, in our thinking,

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:52.600
it can be caused by many
different types of of reasons.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.890
It can be a natural disaster, it
can be a technological accident,

00:30:55.890 --> 00:31:00.680
it can be a human caused event,
an act of war, terrorism,

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.400
those are things that
can all cause disasters.

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:10.600
Emergencies tend to be a word that
is somewhat less catastrophic,

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:14.470
but it's something that
requires responsive action

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:16.260
to protect life or property.

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:22.230 position:56%
And then you can go a level down, if
you're looking for a generic word,

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:24.530
you can use the word
incident to describe something

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:26.630
that might be a disaster,
might be an emergency,

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:29.240
or might be actually something
that requires response

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:32.630
but isn't actually even
rising to the level of this,

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:35.560
it's a level down, but it's a more
generic term and I'll try to use

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:42.310
that word as much as I can.

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:48.910 position:56%
So similar to our history, our
timeline with cultural institutions,

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:52.740
federal legislation about cultural
property, emergency legislation,

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.020
it has a similar arc, for many,

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:58.680
many decades the federal government
really does not have a lot

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.080
of legislation around this.

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:03.250
It doesn't really build up
legislation to protect things

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:05.540
at a broad level, it's
devolved essentially

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:08.250
to states and local groups.

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:12.300
The Civil Defense Act in 1950
changes that, it's a response

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:18.610
to the Cold War and it's
very focused on acts of war,

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:27.360 position:56%
the Cold War, fears over atomic war,
it's a very, very specific approach

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.950
that does not include
natural disasters.

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:35.030
And it is only through a series
of pretty catastrophic disasters

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:41.370
in the 1960s, a very bad earthquake
in Alaska, Hurricane Camille,

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:45.910
Hurricane Betsy, that the Disaster
Relief Act is passed in 1970

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:49.910
that tries to create ways that
the federal government responds

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:51.950
to emergencies.

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:56.390
The National Governors Association
in 1978 and 79 really focused

00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:59.490
on this and say that, well you've
done this, but you're not helping

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:00.790
up enough, it's not coordinated.

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:02.890
There are over a hundred
agencies that get involved

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:05.130
on a national level and
yet it's not coordinated

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:06.680
in a particularly good way.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:11.420
And that led to the
creation of FEMA in 1979.

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:15.030
And the founding of FEMA
created two important concepts

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:19.980
that we still follow
today, excuse me.

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:24.870
The comprehensive emergency
management notion,

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:29.320
that is an all hazards approach.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:34.430
We're not just going to confine our
planning to one type of disaster,

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:37.130
we're going to create one
system that can respond

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:39.080
to all kinds of disasters.

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.800 position:56%
And we're going to have a structure,

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.370
in this case incident command
structure, that is scalable

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:46.040
from the smallest incident
to the largest catastrophe.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:50.000
We're going to have a single
comprehensive approach,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.030
and that's important when we start
talking about cultural property.

00:33:55.030 --> 00:34:00.760
The Stafford Act of 1988 truly
codifies what we choose to do

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:04.640 position:56%
with FEMA and the executive agencies
that respond to emergencies.

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.220
So the Stafford Act
is still referred to,

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:13.420
and the Stafford Act is the way
in which we respond to emergencies

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:18.210
and the various plans we have, are
an outgrowth of that legislation.

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:22.550
There's a federal response
plan first drafted in 1990.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:27.550 position:56%
It truly is the first comprehensive,
what we would call, emergency plan.

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:32.080
It's quite focused on
civil defense, but it is,

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:34.810
it is the first real plan.

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:38.760
We then have a national
response plan in 1999

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.080
that incorporates a number

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.690
of what are called
emergency support functions.

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:45.870
And the key thing here is that the
emergency support function notion

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:48.150
still exists today.

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:52.790
Cultural property is in what, is
in emergency support function 11

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:59.160
which is for natural and
agricultural products in 1999.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:03.210
Like for a variety of reasons
it makes sense that in 2008,

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:06.140
ESF 11 creates a fourth
section that is

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:08.630
for natural and cultural resources.

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:10.810
And that's the first time

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:15.140
in a comprehensive way the
cultural property is included

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:17.270 position:56%
in our thinking at a national level.

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:20.600 position:56%
We can go back to that monuments
men experience and these other sense

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:24.330
of legislation and ways
of protecting things,

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:28.540
but in terms of how we respond in
an emergency, it isn't until 2008

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:32.100 position:56%
that we truly have things explicitly
described of what we're going to do.

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:39.250 position:56%
And the key thing there is that a
lot of the focus of even plans today

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:41.870
and strategies and
approaches to responding

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:45.690 position:56%
to emergencies today is very focused
on where we have legislation,

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:48.510
that is our built and
natural environment.

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:53.050
It is not nearly as prescriptive
about what we should be doing

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:56.520
with cultural property that is
inside buildings, collections,

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:59.860
and that's because there is
no legislation around that.

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:05.730
So that's one of the things
where we continue to be involved

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:07.860
with these various plans.

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:11.790 position:56%
The national response framework as
well as the disaster response frame,

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:15.180
the national disaster response
framework which came out in 2011,

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:19.360
which has a recovery
support function related

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:22.710
to natural and cultural materials.

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:26.440
So we serve on that
committee in part to be,

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:29.950
remind people that while many
agencies have authorizations

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:33.130
and budgets for taking
care of historic properties

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:36.370
and natural environments
and mandates to do that,

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:38.050 position:56%
we're there as a voice for the items

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:39.660
that are not protected
by legislation.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:43.320
And it's not that these plans
don't mention it or include it,

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:46.850
but it's an important
thing to keep in mind

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:51.310
that we don't have full complement
of the resources that we,

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:53.210
that our historic structures
and other things have.

00:36:53.210 --> 00:37:00.080
So let's go a little bit into
emergencies, about half way,

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.430
people are going to come first.

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:05.090
This is a very straightforward
safety first kind of notion,

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:07.230
it isn't just a national
policy issue,

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:10.840
it happens at institutional
level or even in a lab level.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.100
Then take care of buildings,
and then you take care of things

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.040 position:56%
or collections or cultural property.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.780
So this is something that's
also part of that hierarchy,

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:20.070
that's part of that
comprehensive approach.

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:23.260
And there is a real
tension that's similar

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.740
to that natural disaster
civil defense tension

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:29.470
of should we have one plan
or a, two different plans,

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:31.690
should we have them be
different or the same?

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:35.030
There's an ebb and flow in
FEMA policy and national policy

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:38.650
about that on a civil defense,
natural disaster front,

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:40.890
there's the same thing
that happens here

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:43.460
of should we really
even be including things

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:45.920
like cultural property in this?

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:49.710
And I'll explain why
that has prevailed.

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:52.960
Let's go, let's just talk a little
bit about what we do when we talk

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.910
about emergency management.

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:57.920
Emergency management as a field,
as a profession didn't really start

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.800
until the creation of FEMA.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.650
That notion of a comprehensive
approach,

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:05.070
that notion of a scalable
approach are core parts

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:09.320
of what emergency managers do, they
did not exist certainly at the time

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:14.180
of Florence and they didn't really
exist until the early 1980s.

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:18.700
There are four key components
to that preparedness, response,

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:21.430
recovery, and mitigation.

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:24.830
It's important to keep this in
mind, you'll see particularly

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:29.820
in early preservation, conservation
literature about emergency,

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:32.610
they'll use one of these
terms, preparedness,

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:34.880
planning, response, recovery.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.870
And really what they should be,

00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:40.510
the word they really should be
using is collection emergency risk

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:43.990
management or heritage
emergency management

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:46.580
or art emergency management,
but it's a cycle,

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:50.040
they're all interrelated, you
need to be doing all of them,

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:54.010
you shouldn't be focusing
just on one of them.

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:56.350
And this is in for
a number of reasons,

00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:59.910
but part of it is a practical one,
emergency managers, our plans,

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:04.500
our national policies, our
work within this framework,

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.270
and by far the fastest way to think

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:09.640
about this is to use
medical analogy.

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.540 position:56%
Preparedness are the kinds of things
you do to take care of yourself

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.660
when you're not sick, but to
keep yourself from being sick.

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:18.810
They could be things like going
to the doctor, having checkups,

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:22.630
having health insurance,
taking care of yourself.

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:25.210
Response is what you do when
something happens to you.

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:27.060
And this is the important
distinction

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.240
between response and recovery.

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:35.540
When 911, when you call 911,
that's obviously response.

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:39.400 position:56%
When you start getting treated in
the ambulance going to the hospital,

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.590
and that starts being
recovery to some extent,

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:45.520
but it clearly is also part
of a response function.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:49.290
As you get into recovery,
you're in the emergency room,

00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:52.610
there's more assessment,
there's some triage that's done,

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:57.570
some assessment, some treatment,
but the goal at that stage

00:39:57.570 --> 00:40:01.040
of the emergency room cycle
is get you stabilized.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:04.130
It's not to fully treat you,
it's to get you stabilized.

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:07.010
You have, you are not going
to get worse, you're alive,

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:11.070
and now some other doctor,
someone else can take care of you.

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:12.370
They can move on to other people

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:15.210
that have life-threatening
situations.

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:19.450
So a component of recovery is
rehabilitation and it's interesting

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:21.920
in many early parts of
emergency literature

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.900
in the conservation field,
this notion of recovery

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.450
and rehabilitation is stated.

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:33.860
But over time, it gets less
priority, it gets less attention,

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.140
and I think that's too bad and
it's one of the things where we're,

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:38.520
I think that's where
we're focusing on now

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.290
and Florence is an
interesting lesson in all that.

00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:43.940
Recovery can take a long time
and that's not surprising.

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:47.260
If you suffer a major health
catastrophic event like a stroke

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:50.800
or a heart attack and you
live, you fully expect

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.920
that you will have a long
period of rehabilitation

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.570
and you might not ever
fully recover.

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:58.450
And that's a very similar
kind of approach

00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:01.270 position:56%
that happens with cultural property.

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:05.460
It's going to take a long time.

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:07.970
These stages overlap,
it's very confusing,

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:12.950
you can have response from,
like say, a people point

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:17.380
of view start happening and
end much before you even get

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:20.550
into the collection space
to start recovering it.

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:23.460
So these terms are very confusing.

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:26.680
This is a well-known
discussion point in all

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:28.530
of the emergency management
literature.

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:33.220 position:56%
And so they overlap, it's confusing,
it's chaotic, and it's important

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:37.350
to keep in mind those terms and to
understand that they will overlap

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:41.800 position:56%
and that long-term recovery really
will go on for months, if not years.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:46.740
One of our conundrums in
cultural property area is

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:48.380
that we have a very limited amount

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:52.860
of time before we start seeing
increased damage from an incident.

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:56.350
Because almost every incident
involves water in some way,

00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:58.640
either as part of the
incident or as part of the way

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.000
of treating incident,
and, say, a fire,

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.860
or as part of some
collateral component.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:05.680
It can be the cause, as in a
flood, but it can also just be part

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.710
of how you're putting out a fire.

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:09.470
Water is a big problem.

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:13.100
Cultural properties, often organic
and mold is a huge, huge issue,

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:14.790
and we don't have that one.

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:18.230
I'm trying to work on this
theme of golden hundred hours.

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:20.860
It's sort of similar to the
golden, I think it's three

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:22.990
or four hours you have if you
have a stroke or heart attack,

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:24.290
you need to get to the hospital.

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:26.640
And that isn't to say that you
shouldn't go to the hospital

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:31.700 position:56%
after that period, but your
chances of a full recovery are less.

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:34.190
This is just the physical
reality of the way mold

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:37.410
and the environment works
on inorganic material.

00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:41.950
So this 3 to 4 day period is a very
tight window when you're talking

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:46.550
about particularly a catastrophic
event, but it's a reality.

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:50.400
And it's something that really
focuses us so much on planning

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:54.190
and preparedness because we'd like
to avoid this in the first place.

00:42:55.480 --> 00:43:00.430
One of the other things that
happens with recovery is that even,

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:03.650
you know, as I go back
to here, you know,

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:07.120
things start returning
back to normal.

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:10.200
When you start having a building
that's completely renovated

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:13.070
and done, people are really
tired of that incident

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:14.700
and they want it to be done.

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:18.170
So usually with catastrophic
emergencies and disasters,

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:21.360
there's some sort of marker
that indicates when people,

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:24.010
in their minds, most
of them are done.

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:27.060
And so with Florence, it's
an exhibition in 1972.

00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:32.610 position:56%
There was a very large incident that
was about Florence restored, 1972.

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:35.540 position:56%
There was a lot of culture material,
and there still is to some extent,

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:39.780
cultural material that's not
fully recovered or treated.

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:44.050
But it's something to be mindful of
too that one of the disadvantages

00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:47.290
of freezing or other approaches
is that it leaves us in a position

00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:50.070
where we have a, we often
have a great deal of work

00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:52.900
after most people consider
everything done.

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:58.420
A lot of these notions
are now enshrined

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:02.980
in the relatively new national
disaster recovery framework.

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:07.220
And it outlines how this
may, how this rolls out,

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:11.080
and this is incredibly important
because as we're integrated

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:14.760
into this, it allows us to be
able to describe in a better way

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:16.880
where we are and how
we fit into this.

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:19.810
And how so much of what our
work is an immediate level is

00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:23.220
with stabilization and not
necessarily with full recovery,

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:27.970 position:56%
that rehabilitation is something
that we have to do in the long-term.

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:32.350
And that's certainly the case
with the Vasari Last Supper.

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:37.150 position:56%
It was still under treatment in 2013
and it was only earlier this year

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:41.490
that the full treatment was
completed, almost 50 years later.

00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:43.590
And that goes to the books.

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:48.350
Most of the rare books that
were in the national library

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:49.700
in Florence have been treated.

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:54.020
But there's a good chunk of
probably close to 8000 books

00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:57.520
that still remain in this
condition and need to be treated.

00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:01.810 position:56%
It's part of long-term recovery and
we should be more explicit and clear

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:05.250
about our expectations when we
talk about what we;re trying to do

00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:07.380
in emergency situations,
what the outcome will be,

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:12.040
what the expectation will be, and
what we mean when we say stabilize.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:17.420
So let's just summarize
a little bit.

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:21.740
We know that we have a lot
of disasters in our country.

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.380
It's across the country.

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:25.850
This is all of the
federally declared emergencies

00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:31.450
that the Stafford Act describes
how to do, from 1965 until 2003.

00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:35.280
A pretty good span of time,
almost 40 years of time.

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:38.940
You can see that there's
virtually no part of the country

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:42.320
that isn't near or
affected by some kind

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:44.420
of presidentially declared
emergency.

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:48.650
That's a pretty significant bar
and some places have a lot of them.

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:54.520
Not surprisingly Gulf
Coast, earthquake areas,

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:57.150
where there's a lot of
snow, a lot of bad weather.

00:45:57.150 --> 00:46:00.450
We know we're going to
have disasters and we know

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:03.440
that we have cultural material
in all of these places.

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:07.780
The national register has almost,
it's in the hundreds of thousands

00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:09.120
of things on the national register.

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:11.720
If we're talking about
national parks,

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.490 position:56%
talking about cultural institutions,

00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:19.490
they're in almost every county
that's delineated on this map.

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:26.000
And we know unfortunately from
heritage preservation health index

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.380
from 2005 that we have a
real lack of preparedness.

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:31.870
That institutions,
particularly small ones,

00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:35.460
do not have disaster
plans that are, that,

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:38.150
where you have trained
staff to implement them.

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:41.090
People are not ready and
that's not good if you're going

00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:42.870
to have all these disasters.

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:47.400
And Hurricane Katrina
really pointed that out.

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:50.660
That while we made a lot of
advances, particularly in our field

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:54.590
in terms of a profession that
did not really exist at the time

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:57.950
of Florence, or was at the
very beginning of existing,

00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:00.730
we have a lot of literature,
we have a lot of experience,

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:04.560
as with emergency managers, we
have a field that has expertise

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:08.450 position:56%
and knowledge that should be able
to handle these kinds of situations,

00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:10.780
but we lack structures,
infrastructure,

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:15.370
and resources to sometimes
do what we know we can do.

00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:18.850
And Katrina really
pointed that out in 2005.

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:22.110
It really, really, really was
a disaster that was eye-opening

00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:25.720
in the sense of all of the
things that we had done.

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:30.110
It was an eye-opening thing
to see how far short we fell.

00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:36.760
It was an enormously large regional
disaster, it covered many states.

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:41.240 position:56%
And one of the great American cities
was under close to 80 percent water,

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:42.880
very similar to Florence.

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:46.330
And while the cultural impact was
not quite as great as Florence,

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:48.070
it was certainly significant.

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:54.400
As was the human cost and the
way in which we responded both

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.480
as a federal government
and as a nation.

00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:02.710
There were a number of things
that came out of the lessons

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:05.540
from Katrina, and it's one of
I think the the stronger traits

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:09.630
of American emergency management
in general is we do learn

00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:11.530
from the past, we make changes,

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:17.960
we attempt to make things
better from what we've learned.

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:22.690
FEMA had become part
of DHS after 9/11,

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:26.010
but it was made more
independent after Katrina

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:31.620
so that it can really focus on
emergency management at large.

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:35.880
Also some other fundamental things
that happened where response used

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:38.710
to be at strictly a state
level, and it was hard

00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:40.290
to coordinate across states.

00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:43.320
Now that's allowed, and by far
the most important thing that came

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:46.490 position:56%
out of Katrina was that public
assistance funding, that's described

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:49.890
in the Stafford Act, was
extended to cultural institutions.

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:55.630
That is cultural institutions that
are nonprofits, that need resources

00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:59.190
to start recovery or
to start a response.

00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:02.800
Those have to be applied for,
you don't get those immediately,

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:05.650
but typically in a
presidential declaration,

00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:07.750
public assistance is one
of the phases and one

00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:09.080
of the things that's authorized.

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.560
And in the past, cultural
institutions generally could not

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:12.860
apply for that.

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:14.540 position:56%
It was something that they had to go

00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:17.690
to the small business
administration for support.

00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:21.840
So Katrina and that legislation
did get expanded in a way

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:26.620
that really did allow for items
that aren't protected in other ways

00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:30.000
to receive some sort of
response in an organized way.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.540
It also showed that just
from the sheer scale,

00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:37.190
that you have less
control, the bigger it is.

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:40.930
And you need to be as
prepared as you can be

00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:43.430
and do what you can if you can.

00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:45.350
One of the things that also changed

00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:49.330
after Katrina was the heritage
emergency national task force.

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:53.440
Originally, the task force
was focused on the wheel

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:58.030
and essentially information and
documents that people could use.

00:49:58.030 --> 00:50:00.540
But it was not really
a proactive responder

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:04.120
in the sense of emergencies.

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:09.070 position:56%
And it really has transformed itself
into a group of organizations,

00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:11.030
Library of Congress is one of them,

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:16.790
that collectively represent the
cultural heritage in our nation

00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:20.290
and try to gather information
in how to respond

00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:22.710
to incidents that happened.

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:25.050
I was at a call a few weeks
ago about the flooding

00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:27.080
in Louisiana around the King River.

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:29.420
So this is something
that's really changed.

00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:33.330
Where this is a small organization
focused on sort of publications,

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:35.720
it's really transformed
itself into a way

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:39.060
that we can respond to emergencies.

00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:45.760
Heritage preservation has come on
some hard times and fortunately one

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.640
of the things that has happened is

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:49.960
that while heritage
preservation no longer exists,

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:54.390
this whole task force has now
been taken on by the Smithsonian.

00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:57.720
So it's an incredibly
important organization

00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:01.970
that ties together
the cultural partners,

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:04.840
be they historic properties,
be they museums,

00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:07.590
be they libraries and archives.

00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:11.560 position:56%
The alliance for response is another
historic preservation effort that's

00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:15.270
been folded into the FAIC, and
it organizes at a local level.

00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:19.930
So that at a city level and a
regional level, there are people

00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:23.470
that are focused on response
for cultural materials.

00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:28.340
We have the Haiti, oh and I
should add, I've left this

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:32.130 position:56%
out even though I mentioned it in my
introduction, that another component

00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:34.510
of this is that the
FAIC started what

00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:37.690
at the time was the collections
emergency response team

00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:40.060
of which I'm a member, that's
now called the National

00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:41.360
Heritage Responders.

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:44.370
That is a group of people
that can be sent nationally,

00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:45.670
sometimes internationally,

00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:48.850
as they were for the Haiti
cultural recovery project,

00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:52.740
to support recovery
and response efforts.

00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:56.490
Doesn't have a great deal of funds,
but it does have a trained cadre

00:51:56.490 --> 00:52:00.070 position:56%
of people, about 100 people that can
go to different places, be deployed

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:01.740
and that technical expertise,

00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:03.560
there's now a mechanism
to deploy it.

00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.420
And that certainly did
not exist at Katrina,

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:08.630
and Katrina really started that.

00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:11.230
The Smithsonian has
really taken a lead lately

00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:13.730
in cultural emergency
management projects,

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:16.500
in part because of
their peculiar identity

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:19.640
as a federal entity, as
opposed to an agency.

00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:22.960
Their trust funds allow them
a flexibility and a nimbleness

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:25.220
that not all other agencies have.

00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:28.060
And they really took
the lead in the response

00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:31.370
to the devastating
earthquake in Haiti in 2010

00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:34.190
and initiated the cultural
recovery project

00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:37.270
and a cultural recovery center
with training and assessment

00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:39.510
that included the National
Heritage Responders,

00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:43.220
but also a large number
of Smithsonian staff.

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:46.060
It's a noteworthy accomplishment.

00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:50.540
AIC followed this model after
hurricane, or super storm Sandy,

00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:52.900
forgive me, a culture recovery
center that was in Brooklyn.

00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:56.410
And this is again a distinction
about when we're talking

00:52:56.410 --> 00:52:59.730
about these different phases that
we need to be mindful of that,

00:52:59.730 --> 00:53:02.280
that in this case we're
really talking about recovery.

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:08.770
A lot of the response was really
done by alliance for response team

00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:12.080 position:56%
in New York City, in particular, and
that we really were in a position

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:15.000
of helping people in
long-term recovery.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.980
Another thing that the Smithsonian
has really been focusing on because

00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:22.000
of Corey Wegner [assumed
spelling] is how

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.820
to safeguard cultural
heritage in areas of war.

00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:28.000
It goes back to obviously
the monuments men.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.350
Corey's been a dogged advocate for
this since her experience in Iraq

00:53:33.350 --> 00:53:36.200
as an officer, and she's
continued to do that

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:38.460
and the Smithsonian has
brought her in the fold

00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:42.010
and they've really been making an
enormous amount of effort to build

00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:46.720 position:56%
on what happened in Haiti, but also
to help with heritage that's at risk

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:49.970
in places like [inaudible].

00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:51.740
So what now?

00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:54.190
You know we're in a
very different place

00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:55.880
in some respects from Florence.

00:53:55.880 --> 00:54:03.280
We have resources, we have
experience, we have knowledge.

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:05.220
What do we need?

00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:08.760
Well one of the things I feel
like we need is we need to know

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.780
when we have an emergency,
where it is.

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:15.090
And we need, in the sense of
where are our collections at risk?

00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:17.220
Where are our institutions at risk?

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:20.780
What do we have, where is
it, and has it been damaged?

00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:23.360
I mean I was just in the call that
I was on where we had questions

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:26.280
about things on a historic
register that we didn't know,

00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:31.120
we didn't know exactly what
was in the affected area

00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:33.810
and we didn't know if
it had been damaged.

00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:36.260
We need to do a better job of that.

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:37.720
We need to be more resilient.

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:39.880
We need to work on
what, in some respects,

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:41.260
people call weak relationships,

00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:43.970
that is not your primary
relationship,

00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:45.960
but the people you know.

00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:48.580
And the most vulnerable
institutions are small ones

00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:51.620
where they don't have a cadre of
helpers or people that are aware

00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:54.730
of them and maybe a
small historical society

00:54:54.730 --> 00:54:57.690
that has a very small
staff of maybe even one.

00:54:57.690 --> 00:54:59.790 position:56%
We need to foster more relationships

00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:02.380
so that those people not
only can ask for help,

00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:03.890 position:56%
but even if they don't ask for help,

00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:06.630
people know that they're
there and will help them.

00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:09.720
And frankly all institutions
need more staff.

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:13.060
The reason that we don't have as
much work on emergency planning

00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:16.240
as we should is I think because
staffs are under a lot of pressure

00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:18.810
and staffs are generally
below the high watermark

00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:21.800
that they had in better times.

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:25.420
It's going to be real
hard to create those plans

00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:27.490
if you don't have a lot of staff.

00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:29.080
And we need to work
as, we need to focus

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:30.910
on vulnerability as an importance.

00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:33.020
Do we want to focus on the
most vulnerable institutions?

00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:36.220
Or do we want to focus on
the most important items?

00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:37.520
How do we balance that out?

00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:39.940
We can do both, but how
do we set our priorities?

00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:41.980
How do we do triage?

00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:46.110
Kazuna [phonetics] is a term that
I learned when I was in Japan.

00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:50.100
I went to Japan in 2011 after
the earthquake at the request

00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:54.350
of the National [inaudible] Library
and it's a notion of fellowship

00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:57.570
and relationships in
difficult times.

00:55:57.570 --> 00:56:01.830 position:56%
And I think that's that element that
I think we can foster as we focus

00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:03.790
on developing plans
and relationships.

00:56:03.790 --> 00:56:06.740 position:56%
Alliance for response is an
excellent grassroots way to do that.

00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:10.700
How do we make those connections
between those folks, people at,

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:12.270
say, at the national level?

00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:13.790
How do we integrate this in a way

00:56:13.790 --> 00:56:16.040
so that we're ready
and we're resilient?

00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:19.650
Let's take just a look at a
project that's really interesting

00:56:19.650 --> 00:56:21.720
in Washington state.

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:25.170
They've been really focusing
on this mapping issue.

00:56:25.170 --> 00:56:28.810
And they have a GIS
system and a mapping system

00:56:28.810 --> 00:56:34.340
that basically maps the whole state
in various ways assessing risk.

00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:38.090
And so one of them is
looking at an earthquake 7.2

00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:39.400
that would happen in Seattle.

00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:41.370
So right here, right
in this area where all

00:56:41.370 --> 00:56:43.570
that red is, right in there.

00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:50.280
This is Seattle right there
and there's, that's the water,

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:54.700
Seattle's over here,
a high risk area.

00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:59.660 position:56%
So one of the things they've done is
they've started to focus on mapping

00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:02.780
where things are and
how they might be.

00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:06.140
So what would happen if there
was a 7, how severe would a 7.2,

00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:09.350
this is the scenario, this is an
earthquake, it would be centered

00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:13.320
around Seattle and have
this ring around it.

00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:17.740
And as you'll see on the right
side, they've added hospitals.

00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:20.460
This is where all the
hospitals are on this map,

00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:23.980
and they're mapped
in degree of damage.

00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:25.870
And this takes into
account a number of things.

00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:29.040
It takes into account not just,
well that it's in the zone,

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:31.710
but why is this, why are these,

00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:35.350
why are these blue even though
they're in the worst area?

00:57:35.350 --> 00:57:36.810
These are newer hospitals.

00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:38.110
They're well-built.

00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:39.900
They're seismically prepared.

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:41.200
They are ready.

00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:43.000
This hospital knows that,
they can incorporate

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.440
that into their planning, and
if you're trying to respond

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:49.660
to hospitals being damaged in the
area, these are not going to be

00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:56.140
as high on your list
necessarily as these.

00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:58.810
They've done it for schools.

00:57:58.810 --> 00:58:01.060
There are a lot of
schools in this area,

00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:02.490
but this gives you the same sense.

00:58:02.490 --> 00:58:06.420
This is something, it's a tool
that both can be used in terms

00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:09.980
of response, in terms of
where are the schools?

00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:12.230
How concerned should
we be about them?

00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:13.960
But also what kind of school it is.

00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:15.890
There's a lot of data behind this.

00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:20.130
But also for schools to get
ready, then they know I'm at risk,

00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:22.800
I'm in a really seismically
active area,

00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:26.150
my building is old, I
need to do something.

00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:27.990
These are things that we don't have

00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:30.310
for cultural institutions
and we should.

00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:32.590
It can be done.

00:58:32.590 --> 00:58:35.890
It's just a matter of who
does it and a will to do it,

00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:37.190
but we spend a lot of time

00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:40.010
on our national emergency
task force calls trying

00:58:40.010 --> 00:58:44.330
to just define what got damage
and what might be damaged.

00:58:44.330 --> 00:58:46.070
We should not be in that situation.

00:58:46.070 --> 00:58:48.910
We should do a better job and
we should do this kind of thing.

00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:52.880
It would help us with our
planning, it would help us

00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:55.400
with our preparedness, and it
would help us make the case

00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:57.860
for why these institutions
may need more staff

00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:59.160
to do these kinds of things.

00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:03.770
And to keep them engaged in that
process of emergency preparedness

00:59:03.770 --> 00:59:07.610
and response and recovery training.

00:59:07.610 --> 00:59:11.050 position:56%
We spend a lot of time on that here,
as many of my audience members are

00:59:11.050 --> 00:59:13.960
on our emergency response team.

00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:17.440
We spend a lot of time on this
because we want to be ready.

00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:19.580
And that's where we
need to support smaller,

00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:22.710
more vulnerable institutions
that need that support.

00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:25.550
And we should keep in
mind that we may have

00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:29.040
to make some difficult
decisions about what we recover,

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:32.570
when we recover it, but we should
also be informed by Florence

00:59:32.570 --> 00:59:36.110
that despite a very devastating
flood and despite a passage

00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:40.240
of 50 years, that all of their
major artworks are treated now

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:41.870
with the completion
of this treatment.

00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:45.470
And it did happen 50 years
later, but it had been stabilized

00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:47.640
and we need to make a
better case for what we mean

00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:49.900
when we say, I've treated it.

00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:52.180
I've completed the recovery effort.

00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:56.050
We recruit, we save the object,
but we may need to rehabilitate it

00:59:56.050 --> 00:59:59.010
and that may take significant
time and funds,

00:59:59.010 --> 01:00:02.160
but that's just the reality
of the way these things work.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:07.510
And the illustration of the books
on the side, it's the same thing.

01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:10.550
There are thousands of books
that still need to be treated,

01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:15.770
but they're stable and they
will eventually be completed.

01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:17.380
So with that, I have a
lot of people to thank.

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:19.670
Many of you are on this list and
if you feel that you should be

01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:20.970
on this list, please
tell me [laughter].

01:00:20.970 --> 01:00:24.650
It's a lot of people.

01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:26.630
This goes back to the
Kazuna [phonetic] principal.

01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:31.430 position:56%
There are a lot of people that you
get to know doing this kind of work,

01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:32.730
working in this kind of area.

01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:35.310
And it's really important, you'll
see this whole column here,

01:00:35.310 --> 01:00:38.780
all of these people here are
library folks that have nothing

01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:43.260
to do directly with collections,
they take care of our building,

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:46.550
they take care of our
infrastructure, they keep us safe,

01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:49.650
but we have a very integrated
approach with collection security.

01:00:49.650 --> 01:00:54.270
It ranges from physical security to
emergency response to environment.

01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:56.420
It's a core part of
what we do and all

01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:58.910
of those folks deserve
a lot of credit.

01:00:58.910 --> 01:01:02.270
And for those out in web land,
if you want to contact me,

01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:03.980
this is the way you can do that.

01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:07.260
You can send your praise
or your arrows my way.

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:10.380
I really look forward to
getting everybody's feedback

01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:12.370
and I know we're almost
done with the time,

01:01:12.370 --> 01:01:14.190 position:56%
but I'm happy to take any questions.

01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:15.990
Thank you very much.

01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:25.280
[ Applause ]

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:29.870
Yeah, it's lunch time,
people are hungry.

01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:31.170
Jeanie.

01:01:31.170 --> 01:01:33.840
&gt;&gt; Just a point of
clarification about the Smithsonian

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:37.080
because of course they are
working with FEMA and the person

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:40.500
at the Smithsonian is
actually, works for FEMA

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:44.120
but has been appointed to
Smithsonian, is that not correct

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.650
or am I misunderstanding?

01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:49.700
I thought that Lori Foley
she actually works for FEMA,

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:52.410
but she's been signed
to Smithsonian,

01:01:52.410 --> 01:01:54.210
is that right or am I incorrect?

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:55.890
&gt;&gt; Andrew Robb: That's
the current status.

01:01:55.890 --> 01:01:59.910 position:56%
Lori Foley used to work at the North
East Document Conservation Center.

01:01:59.910 --> 01:02:02.210
She was co-chair of the
emergency committee with me,

01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:05.550
while I was at ICI I'd
talk with her frequently.

01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:08.340
She then went to heritage
preservation and as part

01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:09.970
of how the different task

01:02:09.970 --> 01:02:16.600
and heritage preservation were
devolved, she was hired by FEMA.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:19.740
But the understanding is that,
I understand is that that,

01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:23.320 position:56%
while she's detailed to the
Smithsonian now, that at some point,

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:26.870
I think the expectation is that
her position will actually transfer

01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:30.990
to the Smithsonian, but
that this was done as a way

01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:34.740
of just making that
transition faster.

01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:38.670
&gt;&gt; And I was just trying to make
that connection between FEMA

01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:41.760
and the Smithsonian and
to clarify that from you.

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.060
&gt;&gt; Lori's actually online.

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:44.360
&gt;&gt; Andrew Robb: Hi Lori.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:47.970
She can correct me if I've
got those details wrong.

01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:54.690
Yes.

01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:57.320
&gt;&gt; How long were you in Japan
helping with recovery efforts?

01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.860
&gt;&gt; Andrew Robb: So that's
the interesting thing.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:07.130
The conversation started, the
request started in late February,

01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:10.950 position:56%
but I did, or excuse me, late March,

01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:13.850
because the earthquake
was in March, March 11th.

01:03:13.850 --> 01:03:18.610
The request sort of
came in late March,

01:03:18.610 --> 01:03:22.770
but I didn't get there
until September.

01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:25.860
So that's one of those things
too about there's a difference

01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:28.300
between what you do when you
start having a conversation

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:31.550
with people right after this
happens, with what happens

01:03:31.550 --> 01:03:36.170
when you're there and really people
are in a long-term recovery mode.

01:03:36.170 --> 01:03:39.280 position:56%
There still were a lot of
devastation, a lot of debris removal

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:43.160
but when we went up
to the Tohoku region,

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:46.500
I was there for about a week.

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:52.350
It was really something of
just, more than anything else,

01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:55.180
being the person to listen
and to encourage them.

01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:57.900
The technical part
of what they're doing

01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:00.970
in recovering those personal
photographs is really amazing

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:07.360
and I think it was something that,
I mean, I gave a very similar kind

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:12.800
of talk there in terms of what I
see in, from the response in Japan.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:17.340
Broadly for culture material, it's
very narrow, and they don't have

01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:19.360
as expansive a way

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:21.750
of interconnecting
these different needs.

01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:24.420
There isn't something like the
heritage emergency national task

01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:29.300 position:56%
force, the cross professional ties,
cross institutional ties are weaker,

01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:35.830
and it really creates problems
when they have a very robust list

01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:39.540
of national treasures, but things
fall off the list very quickly.

01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:44.470
So things like legal records
are, fell to the Department

01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:45.770
of Justice to take care of.

01:04:45.770 --> 01:04:50.630
And it was not a very organized
response, although ambitious,

01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:57.240 position:56%
and it's the kind of thing that
hopefully, that was helpful to them.

01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:59.800
The encouragement I know
was helpful, but I was there

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:04.740
for about two weeks overall
and even at that time, I mean,

01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:06.630
it shows you too with
something like that,

01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:08.380
it really was a national disaster.

01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:10.920
I mean, when I was there,
there were power shortages,

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:13.290
other kinds of issues.

01:05:13.290 --> 01:05:19.400
It was still even six months
after an eye-opening experience

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:21.720
for how devastating
something like that can be.

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:26.650
And I think a real reminder that
while you can prepare as much

01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:32.540 position:56%
as you can, you can be in situations
where even months after the fact,

01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:35.260
you're still falling short on
resources and other things.

01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:47.290
&gt;&gt; Oh. What is the current planning
with respect to climate change

01:05:47.290 --> 01:05:49.180
and all of the projections
with respect

01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:52.640
to sea level rise, stronger storms?

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:57.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Andrew Robb: Well, I mean that's,
you could go back, if I go back to,

01:05:57.710 --> 01:06:01.740
if I go back to this
kind of model, I mean,

01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:03.320
that's why the mapping
is so important.

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:05.000
I mean you can take
a model like this

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.940
and you can apply it
to sea level change.

01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:11.690
Whether you want to talk about
storm surges from hurricanes,

01:06:11.690 --> 01:06:19.100
or you want to talk about a rising
sea, rising water levels, you know,

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:21.730
it's a part of risk management.

01:06:21.730 --> 01:06:23.580
And if you're near
one of these areas

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.970
that should be something
your mindful of and it's why

01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:28.190
on the emergency management
side it's so important to have

01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:30.580
that comprehensive approach
because you should be able

01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:33.680
to then adjust your
risk assessment to take

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:34.980
into account things like that.

01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:39.960
But certainly, proximity to
water is a huge risk factor,

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:41.730
Florence tells you that.

01:06:41.730 --> 01:06:44.830 position:56%
I mean Florence isn't going to move,

01:06:44.830 --> 01:06:49.060
but cultural material that's
near the river is vulnerable.

01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:55.970
As would be things near coasts
or where sea levels are rising.

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:05.660
Okay. I think we're done.

01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:07.510
Thank you very much.

01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:12.310
