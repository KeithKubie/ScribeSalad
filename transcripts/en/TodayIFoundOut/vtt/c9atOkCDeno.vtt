00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.340
Red and white striped, sometimes with a bit
of blue, a barber pole twisting next to a

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.010
small storefront signifies a place where men
can get a haircut, a shave and a bit of masculine

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.010
bonhomie.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.490
But this was not always the case.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.589
Back in the day, the red and white we associate
with good grooming used to represent blood,

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:33.820
bandages, leeches and pain.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.820
Barbers through History

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.550
As long as people have been making razors,
there have been barbers.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.070
In Egypt and other ancient cultures (as early
as 3500 BC), barbers were often priests whose

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.420
main job was to keep evil spirits from possessing
people; they did this by trimming, styling

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.920
and shaving off the hair through which demons
liked to enter the body.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.170
This role morphed into something that much
more closely resembles a modern day barber

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.289
by the time of the Greeks in the 5th century
BC.

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.670
Setting up in an agora, the Greek barber styled
hair, trimmed beards and encouraged gossip.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.750
In Rome, barbers were known as tonsores, and
many well-groomed Romans made a stop at their

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.900
shops part of their daily routine.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.740
Even in the somewhat misnamed “dark ages”,
barbers were in demand.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.819
Many monks, like the Benedictines, embraced
the tonsure, a hairstyle where the crown of

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:25.729
the head is shaved with only a narrow ring
of hair remaining.

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.780
Barbers were employed to manage this grooming,
and in addition, because of papal prohibitions,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.210
barbers were also responsible for conducting
surgeries.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.940
Historically, the Roman Catholic Church believed
that surgery violated the Holy Spirit’s

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.530
temple (the human body).

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.200
In line with this, several meetings of the
church, including the Councils of Tours of

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.010
1163 and 1179 and the Fourth Lateran Council
of 1215, decreed that priests and monks, who

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.540
had a long history of medical and surgical
scholarship, were forbidden from performing

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.540
surgeries.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.741
Although priests continued to conduct research
and serve as physicians for the wealthy, they

00:01:59.741 --> 00:02:03.920
relied on the barbers for surgical procedures
and bloodlettings.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.600
In addition to the wealthy, barbers also helped
regular people.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.090
Lancing boils, setting breaks and amputating
gangrenous limbs were common procedures; so,

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.400
too, was trepanning, a process by which a
hole was drilled into a person’s head to

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.409
let out the evil forces that caused mental
illness and epilepsy.

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.879
Bladder obstructions were treated with catheters
(sometimes inserted through an incision because

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:35.209
the syphilis-wracked patient’s urethra was
completely blocked), and kidney stones were

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.599
removed with minor surgeries.

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.439
But perhaps the procedure most commonly associated
with barbers in the middle ages was bloodletting.

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.680
Using a narrow blade, the barber would open
a vein and allow the blood to pour down into

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.299
a small brass bowl; by way of advertising,
many barbers would display these bowls of

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.590
blood in their shop windows so people would
know they performed the service.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.900
During the procedure, the patient would grip
a white rod to encourage blood flow, and white

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.439
strips of bandage would be used to clean the
patient.

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:07.700
Dirty bandages were washed and hung to dry
on the grasping rod outside of the shop.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.209
For those wounds too tender or hard to reach,
rather than lancing and bloodletting, the

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.579
barber would apply special leeches, known
as Hirudo medicinals, which emitted a natural

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.090
anesthetic and anti-coagulant while it sucked
blood.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.689
These healthy, hungry leeches were typically
kept on hand in a separate brass bowl.

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:26.689
The Pole

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:30.170
The famous pole is a study in semiotics.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.480
The white on the pole represents the bloodletting
rod that was grasped by the patient during

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.480
the procedure.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.459
The red stripes symbolize the bloodied bandages,
often hung out to dry on the pole after they’d

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.879
been cleaned as well as possible.

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.769
As for the rest, things get a little murkier.

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.819
It’s is thought that the brass ball at the
top may represent the bowl of leeches, while

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.470
the brass at the bottom evokes the bowl that
catches the blood.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.680
For those poles that have a blue stripe added,
many believe this represents veins.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.239
Of course, sometime in the middle ages, the
profession of surgeon emerged, and afterward,

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.569
surgeons and barbers competed for customers.

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.919
To end the conflict, Parliament passed and
King Henry VIII approved legislation that

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:13.519
united both into the Barber-Surgeons’ Company
in 1540.

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.650
Subsequent legislation was passed that further
required barbers and surgeons to specialize

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.590
and distinguish between the two groups by
either having a red and white pole (surgeons)

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.020
or one that was blue and white (barbers).

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.630
So from this, perhaps the blue simply originally
represented traditional grooming services.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:42.200
Whatever the case, despite the distinction,
in

00:04:42.200 --> 00:05:06.520
the United States particularly, barbers

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:28.780
still tend to

00:05:28.780 --> 00:06:16.260
use white 
and red in their poles (usually spinning)

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:28.010
as well 
as blue.

00:06:28.010 --> 00:07:04.800
Rather than have its origins wholly in the
original meaning

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:23.050
of 
the

00:07:23.050 --> 00:08:14.360
color scheme, this

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:28.000
is thought

00:08:28.000 --> 00:09:13.889
to have more to do with 
the

00:09:13.889 --> 00:09:54.440
fact that the U.S. flag is, of course, colored
red, white, and blue.
