00:00:00.261 --> 00:00:02.808
- Whereas to factor the
polynomial below as the product

00:00:02.808 --> 00:00:04.324
of two binomials

00:00:04.324 --> 00:00:07.552
and we have n times n minus one plus

00:00:07.552 --> 00:00:10.023
3 times n minus one.

00:00:10.023 --> 00:00:11.441
So I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:13.891
and see if you can figure this out.

00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:17.466
Well, the key is to realizing
that both of these terms

00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.684
have n minus one as a factor.

00:00:19.684 --> 00:00:21.089
Let me just rewrite the whole thing

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:22.854
so we can work on it down here.

00:00:22.854 --> 00:00:26.116
So this is n times n minus one

00:00:26.116 --> 00:00:30.191
plus 3 times n minus one.

00:00:30.191 --> 00:00:33.249
And notice both of them
have an n minus one,

00:00:33.249 --> 00:00:36.054
have an n minus one as a factor.

00:00:36.054 --> 00:00:38.028
So what we can do is factor out

00:00:38.028 --> 00:00:39.224
the n minus one

00:00:39.224 --> 00:00:41.708
or you can view it as undistributing

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:44.514
the n minus one and if we do that,

00:00:44.514 --> 00:00:46.596
we're gonna factor out the n minus one

00:00:46.596 --> 00:00:49.023
and what are we going to have left over?

00:00:49.023 --> 00:00:50.753
Well if you take out the n minus one here

00:00:50.753 --> 00:00:52.123
if you undistribute it out,

00:00:52.123 --> 00:00:55.770
you're just going to be left with

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.185
that n.

00:00:57.185 --> 00:00:58.392
So you're going to have an n there

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:01.155
and then for this second term,

00:01:01.155 --> 00:01:02.955
you factor this n minus one out.

00:01:02.955 --> 00:01:04.452
You're just going to be left with this

00:01:04.452 --> 00:01:07.088
positive three plus three.

00:01:07.088 --> 00:01:08.853
And just like that we are done.

00:01:08.853 --> 00:01:11.453
We have factored the polynomial below

00:01:11.453 --> 00:01:14.925
as a product of two binomials.

00:01:14.925 --> 00:01:17.328
So this is the same thing as

00:01:17.328 --> 00:01:22.328
n minus one times n plus three.

00:01:22.355 --> 00:01:23.690
And once again you can check this.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.292
You can take this n minus one

00:01:25.292 --> 00:01:26.186
and distribute it.

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:30.354
n minus one times n is
this term right over here

00:01:30.354 --> 00:01:31.655
n times n minus one

00:01:31.655 --> 00:01:34.186
and then n minus one times three

00:01:34.186 --> 00:01:36.252
is this term right over here.

00:01:36.252 --> 00:01:37.551
n minus one times three

00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:40.705
or three times n minus one.
