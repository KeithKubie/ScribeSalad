00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:00.767
( chuckling )

00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:03.237
Well, can I just say
I love it here

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.972
and I definitely wanna
be your housemate.

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:07.374
Awesome,
great, um...

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:09.343
I do need to warn
you about one thing.

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:11.211
So you haven't met
Amy yet, she's great.

00:00:11.245 --> 00:00:12.346
She does have
a boyfriend

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.749
who comes over a
lot and they fight.

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:18.352
Oh, well, all couples
fight, I think.

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:20.220
Uh, it's crazy,
it's really shocking

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:22.022
the things that
they say to each other.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.924
( voices approaching )
All your thoughts are...

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:25.692
Here we go.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:27.928
...from elderly people,
from old people, yeah.

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:29.363
You know what you are,
you're a poop person.

00:00:29.463 --> 00:00:30.330
I'm a poop person?

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:31.565
God pooped
in his hand,

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:32.633
threw it at earth
and you're that poop.

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.035
Oh, our Lord and Savior
poops in His hand?

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:38.105
You know what, I hope
you have to sneeze like...

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:39.706
and it just doesn't
happen for you.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.675
I hope that you get
stuck in traffic lights

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:42.943
and you just miss
the green one!

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:44.211
( gasping )

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:46.813
I hope that the next time
that you go to a wedding

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:48.682
you're wearing the
same dress as someone else

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.184
and it becomes the
joke of the night.

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:51.885
You have to take
pictures with that person.

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:54.655
Well, I hope that next time you
watch an episode of "Homeland"

00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:58.058
that the DVR cuts out before you
see scenes from the next week

00:00:58.091 --> 00:00:59.259
so to find out
what happened

00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:01.061
you have to just
like ask around the office

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.864
or look online like
a homeless person!

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:05.966
And I hope that the next
time you go to a concert

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.101
that the band doesn't play
the song you wanna hear

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:11.872
and instead, they just play
songs off their new album!

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:13.073
Oh, God!

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.708
Or like a jam session
or something...

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.777
I think we might need
to call the police.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.079
Katia, get in here,
he's lost his damn mind!

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:20.747
Whoa, Oh, my God,
Oh, my God.

00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:21.882
David, put
that down.

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:22.883
David, this
isn't you.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:23.884
You don't wanna
do this.

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:25.752
( screaming )

00:01:25.786 --> 00:01:31.091
( crying )

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:35.562
You need to leave
right now.

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:38.432
Is that what
you want, Amy?

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:40.100
What I want,

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.770
is for you to accidentally
sit on your cell phone.

00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:46.106
And I want you to touch
four P's in a row

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:48.642
to someone you haven't
talked to in a long time.

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:51.111
You know what-- I hope the next
time that you take a shower

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:52.880
the shower curtain
clings to you

00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:55.215
and no matter what you do,
you can't get it off you.

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:57.317
You can get it off you,
but for the rest of the day,

00:01:57.351 --> 00:01:59.186
you never really
feel clean!

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.655
Get out!

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:03.056
Get out!

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:04.291
He's sick.

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:05.759
Get out!

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.761
And I'm not coming
back here ever.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:10.631
Unless this
blows over.

00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:13.300
( sobbing )

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.135
It's over now, okay?

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.171
He almost went
so insane...

00:02:17.271 --> 00:02:18.205
I know.

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:19.506
There was a
moment there.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.707
Hey, this is Karen.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.242
She might move
in with us.

00:02:22.376 --> 00:02:23.877
Hi.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.080
You didn't even tell
me you're moving out,

00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:28.182
you dumb ( bleep )?

00:02:28.282 --> 00:02:30.384
I'm sorry you guys,
this is my boyfriend.

00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:31.385
You know what?

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:32.352
You're the ( bleep )!

00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:33.520 line:0%
 
y don't you get
your ( bleep )

00:02:33.554 --> 00:02:34.855
out of your
( bleep )!

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:36.623
Why don't you get the
( bleep ) out of your ears

00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:38.091
and get your skank-ass

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:39.459
and get the rest of
your ( bleep ) out here.

00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:41.195
You know what,
I hope you rot in hell

00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:44.198
after you watch every single
person you love die.

00:02:44.231 --> 00:02:46.733
You are a white trash
piece of ( bleep ).

00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:50.103
You are the reason why your
stepmother killed herself.

00:02:50.137 --> 00:02:51.438
Oh, my God!

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:52.573
Get back here.

00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:55.242
You are a ( bleep )
( bleep ) ( bleep ).

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.411
She's great.

00:02:57.444 --> 00:02:58.412
She's so cool.

00:02:58.445 --> 00:03:00.547
Yeah, she's
really nice.
