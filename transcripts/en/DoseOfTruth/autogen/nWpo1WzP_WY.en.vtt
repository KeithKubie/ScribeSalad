it's not you know you might think well
it's only revenge on other people

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090
it's only revenge on other people
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.790
it's only revenge on other people
because you've developed hatred for

because you've developed hatred for
 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.860
because you've developed hatred for

not just hatred for people I would say
 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.500
not just hatred for people I would say
it's hatred for being itself and the

it's hatred for being itself and the
 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.510
it's hatred for being itself and the
desire to take revenge on being for the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520
desire to take revenge on being for the
 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.940
desire to take revenge on being for the
outrage of the tragedy and suffering

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950
outrage of the tragedy and suffering
 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.240
outrage of the tragedy and suffering
that's associated with being and maybe

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250

the tragedy and suffering that's being
part and parcel of your own life and

part and parcel of your own life and
 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.360
part and parcel of your own life and
that makes you embittered and then past

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370
that makes you embittered and then past
 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.430
that makes you embittered and then past
embittered becomes outraged and past

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440
embittered becomes outraged and past
 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.979
embittered becomes outraged and past
outrage becomes well homicidal or even

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989
outrage becomes well homicidal or even

something like the Columbine shootings
 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.510
something like the Columbine shootings

that's what it looks like to me and
 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.300
that's what it looks like to me and
that's a state of mind that's truly

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310
that's a state of mind that's truly
 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.130
that's a state of mind that's truly
hellish and you could get there by

anything like that he's pretty old so
 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.600
anything like that he's pretty old so
you know there's also also also the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610
you know there's also also also the
 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.450
you know there's also also also the
possibility of some kind of neurological

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460
possibility of some kind of neurological
 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.639
possibility of some kind of neurological
pathology that that might be

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649
pathology that that might be
 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.690
pathology that that might be
characteristic of him you know some

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700
characteristic of him you know some
 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.789

degenerative neurological disease there

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799
degenerative neurological disease there
 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.429
degenerative neurological disease there
was a kid years ago at the University of

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439
was a kid years ago at the University of
 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.560
was a kid years ago at the University of
Texas at Austin who climbed up on the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570
Texas at Austin who climbed up on the
 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.810
Texas at Austin who climbed up on the
tower there and shot a number of people

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820
tower there and shot a number of people
 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.340
tower there and shot a number of people
with a high-powered rifle and he had a

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350
with a high-powered rifle and he had a
 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.350
with a high-powered rifle and he had a
fast growing tumor on his hypothalamus

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360
fast growing tumor on his hypothalamus
 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.440
fast growing tumor on his hypothalamus
and had reported like these being

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450
and had reported like these being
 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.080
and had reported like these being
overcome with extreme feelings of rage

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090
overcome with extreme feelings of rage
 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.380
overcome with extreme feelings of rage
and so that's another possibility but I

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390
and so that's another possibility but I
 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.550
and so that's another possibility but I
would say

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560
would say
 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.750
would say
the embitterment hypothesis is the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760
the embitterment hypothesis is the
 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.120
the embitterment hypothesis is the
strongest one I would also say - I

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130
strongest one I would also say - I
 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.550
strongest one I would also say - I
noticed the Steven Pinker tweeted this

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560
noticed the Steven Pinker tweeted this
 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.470
noticed the Steven Pinker tweeted this
today is that one of the ways of

today is that one of the ways of
 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.150
today is that one of the ways of
controlling this sort of thing would be

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160
controlling this sort of thing would be
 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.940
controlling this sort of thing would be
for the press to agree not for there to

for the press to agree not for there to
 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.250
for the press to agree not for there to
be a blanket agreement not to publicize

of the people who do the shooting
 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.410
of the people who do the shooting
because there's also this really what

would you call it arrogance it's a kind
of arrogance and pride last-ditch

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310
of arrogance and pride last-ditch
 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.520
of arrogance and pride last-ditch
arrogance and pride that that is

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530
arrogance and pride that that is
 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.220
arrogance and pride that that is
associated with the fantasies that drive

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230
associated with the fantasies that drive
 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.350
associated with the fantasies that drive
this sort of behavior and the fantasy is

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360
this sort of behavior and the fantasy is
 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.170
this sort of behavior and the fantasy is
something like well after I do this

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180
something like well after I do this
 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.330
something like well after I do this
everyone will sure know the who the hell

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340
everyone will sure know the who the hell

I was you know even though maybe I was

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380
I was you know even though maybe I was
 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.260
I was you know even though maybe I was
ignored or unhappy when I was alive

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270

who I was and what I did then you know
 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.010
who I was and what I did then you know
so there's this underground desire for

so there's this underground desire for
 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.250

might be preferable to being ignored and
 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.780
might be preferable to being ignored and
so you know there's a lot of talk about

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790
so you know there's a lot of talk about
 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.760
so you know there's a lot of talk about
gun control and that's understandable

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770
gun control and that's understandable
 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.440
gun control and that's understandable
especially with regards to automatic

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450
especially with regards to automatic
 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.920
especially with regards to automatic
rifles hmm

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.420
rifles hmm
although I also understand why the

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430
although I also understand why the
 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.740
although I also understand why the
people who are gun owners are afraid of

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750
people who are gun owners are afraid of
 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.330
people who are gun owners are afraid of
allowing what they regard is one of

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340
allowing what they regard is one of
 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.009
allowing what they regard is one of
their fundamental rights to be infringed

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019
their fundamental rights to be infringed
 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.789
their fundamental rights to be infringed
upon but it would certainly be useful if

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799
upon but it would certainly be useful if
 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.039
