00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.980
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Good
evening everybody.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.130
My name is David Plylar
and I'm a music specialist

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.750
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.610
It's really great to see you here
tonight for our next installment

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.360
in our exploration
of the collaboration

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.950
of the Isamu Noguci
and Martha Graham.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.380
Two 20th century masters
whose work continuos

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.610
to resonate far beyond the
confines of their own life times

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.210
and many artistic arenas.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.580
We are very pleased tonight to
be able to present Dakin Hart,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.210
senior curator at Noguchi Museum.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.220
And the title of his talk,
as you can see on the screen,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.360
is Sculpting Beyond the Pedestal:
Isamu Noguchi's Sets for Dance.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.130
As part of our Martha Graham
at library festival week,

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.070
we've been very fortunate and being
able to present these very close

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.500
up looks at the relationship
between Graham and Noguchi.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.840 position:56%
Last night, we heard the perspective

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.630 position:56%
of the Graham artistic director
Janet Eilber, a dancer who performed

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.080
with Noguchi's breath taking
mythic set design for many years.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.880
Tonight, we hear the curatorial
perspective from someone

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.090
who oversees the Noguchi Museum's
exhibitions and collections,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.090
archives and public programming.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.220
You'll see a nice line and
Dakin Hart's bio in our program

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.820
that he has the daily good
fortune to collaborate

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.130
with Isamu Noguchi in absentia.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.490
Before joining the
Noguchi Museum staff,

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.460
Dakin worked as an independent
curator and writer and served

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.480
as an assistant director of
the Nasher Sculpture Center,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.680
artistic director at Montalvo
Center for the Arts, and later,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.390
assistant to the director of the
Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.340
It's been very rewarding
to collaborate

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.550 position:56%
with him specially my colleague Anne
McLean worked very closely with him

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.320
in developing this
miniseries focusing on Noguchi.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.660
And both he and his colleague
Janine Biunno were very generous

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.400
to the library with their
time and with their ideas.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.940
Without them, we would
not have been able

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.580
to reproduce the beautiful
images that you've see

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.550
around of Isamu Noguchi's work.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.680
And we've able to share
throughout the festival.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.230 position:56%
We would also like to acknowledge at
this time again the generous support

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.100
of Dr. Sachiko Kuno and
Ryuji Ueno in helping

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.350
to make these events possible.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.510
So, without any further ado,
please welcome Dakin Hart.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.030
[ Applause ]

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.450
&gt;&gt; Dakin Hart: Thank
you so much David.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.880
It's an honor to be here.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.110
I'm very excited to be here
talking about Noguchi and Graham.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.100
It was, obviously, a really
important relationship in his life

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.720
and it's one of those things I
was just saying to a new friend.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.210
That I didn't expect that when
I went in the Noguchi Museum

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.690
that I would end up
having a relationship

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.140
with the Martha Graham
Dance Company.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.440
But, it's been wonderful.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.130
And Janet and I did talk
together just a couple a weeks ago

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.140
in the studio at Westbeth
in New York.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.700
And they put out three of the
sets, did an open rehearsal.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.940
And we are able to go-- and the
entire audience who's able to go in

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.250
and amongst the sets, walk
on the sets, lay on the sets,

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.310
play with the sets, touch the sets,

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.560
and that's the great
privilege for me, too.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.990
I deal with these sets
everyday or bits

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.670
and pieces of these sets everyday.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.610
But in the museum, we
threat them as artwork.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.500
So, when I touch them,
I touch them with gloves

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.530
and I try not to touch
them very much.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.430
So, having the chance to get
up there and actually jump

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.490
under Costa's [assumed
spelling] bed is a great thrill.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.760
And these sets really don't come
to life until they're in the midst

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.060
to Martha's choreography.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.160
That was the reason for being.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.700
So, we try not show them isolated.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.290
We tried to always show them in
the context of the choreography

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.720
because they're really
are only an artwork kind

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.870
of consolidated all as a whole.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.480
So, tonight, we're going to try to
answer a question which is really

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:17.190
to try to explain how Noguchi ended
up where he ended up 80 years on

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.900
but do it through the lens of
dance because dance arguably is one

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.440
of the two or three things that
really went in to the Booyah Base

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.130
of his especial brain and
makeup that allowed him

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.160
to be truly avant-garde and really
shift the terms of sculpture.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.410
So, what we're looking
at are two images.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.420
This is Noguchi as a teenager.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.110
He-- You may or may not
know, apprentice for a time

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.780
to Gutzon Borglum who
made Mount Rushmore,

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.710
who was a terrible
human being, who--

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.770
a racist and just really
awful person.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.860 position:56%
And told Noguchi at 18 that he would
never a sculpture to give it up,

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.620
forget it about it and
go back to med school.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.610
And Noguchi listened to him very
briefly and-- but in the end what,

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.750 position:56%
you know, sort of the bread and the
bone allowed and Noguchi, obviously,

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.440
did not listened, ultimately.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.750
And so we're looking at him making
for a public audience a copy

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.860
of Borglum's sculpture of Lincoln.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.230
And this was a very, very quick
kind of proof of his virtuosity.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.770
At this point, he'd only been
sculpting for really a few months.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.790
And he just had that special
thing that Raphael called Disegno,

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.860
which is the connection between
eye, hand, and imagination.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.290
He just had it.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.170
And on the right, we're looking
at a bust of George Gershwin.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.570
So, Noguchi for about 10 years
really was a academics sculpture.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.680
This is, again, in
his early to mid-'20s.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.120
And he made a living by doing
what he called head busting.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.580
And that meant making portrait
heads of well-known people,

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.570
bold face names in New York City.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.230
And it was also a way to try to
get commissions for real sculpture.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.930
He hated doing it by
the way, but he did.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.880
So, how he ended up here, on the
left we have Beinecke Library.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.380
This is the Sunken Garden Project,
working with an architected

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.410
that he collaborated
with over and over again.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.120
It's an amazing project.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.520
It is-- He referred to these
as gardens even though it looks

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.220
like an enclosed courtyard and
it is an enclosed courtyard.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.620
Very conceptual in white marble,

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.040
contains really symbolic
elements representing the sun,

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.180
the earth and chants.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:43.740 position:56%
And on the right, we have a Black
Slide Mantra which is working slide.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.070
It happens to weigh 80,000 pounds
and be made of black granite.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.410
And it took so several
years to make.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.260
But it is a working slide.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.380
And that's where he really
ended up in his heart.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.240
Now, the other sort of great--

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.560
late in life work that I want to
mention just way of setting things

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.200
up here is the museum itself, which
a lot of people think of as one

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.960
of his greatest artworks.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.400
And we try to not monkey
around with it too much

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.500
because it really is
a total work of art.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.880
And here, we're looking at
a section of the garden.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:22.480
OK. So, Ruth Page is a wonderful
dancer and choreographer,

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.560
who's a perfect contemporary
of Martha Graham's.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.260
But is not very well-known,
because she's from Midwest.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.830
And she really made her career in
Chicago, in and around Chicago,

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.530
although she was an
international traveler.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.960
She performed at Hirohito's
investiture as emperor in Japan.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.510
She was the only western
artist to perform there.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:46.860 position:56%
She performed shortly after the
revolution in Russia, took the train

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.200
to Moscow and performed there.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.760
She really was an amazing person.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.130
And Noguchi worked with her
before he did with Martha Graham,

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.520
sort of a little known
Noguchi story.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.920
And he fell madly in love with her

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.760
at an arts clubs at
Chicago performance.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.860
He was there with an exhibition and
he-- she was seating behind him.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.140 position:56%
And they just hit it off right away.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.630
What we're looking at here
is a kind of chicken and egg

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.680
that we haven't been
able to resolve.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.050
On the right is a sculpture
called "Miss Expanding Universe".

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.410
And on the left is Ruth Page
in Sack Dress that Noguchi made

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.340
for her, made with his own hands.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.730
You can see it encloses
her feet and her hands

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:33.040
and it's nipping of the ways.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.520
And there's a clear physical
relationship between that

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.340
and the sculpture on the right.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.080
The piece that's hanging
from the ceiling

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.690 position:56%
on the right is cast aluminum and he
is holding the plaster model for it.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.960
And what you can see is a
very proprietary sort of way.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.490
What's important about
this, as you can see

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.620
that in the sculpture he's turn her
into a constellation and has tried

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.530
to set her among the stars.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:03.480
And this idea of expanding universe
comes from a series of lectures

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.670
and then ultimately a book that
Sir Arthur Eddington wrote,

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:09.460
published in 1932,
the exact same year.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:13.480
And Noguchi likely saw
a lecture in Cambridge,

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.280
Massachusetts with Bucky Fuller.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.810
And this lecture was called
the "Expanding Universe".

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.490
The book he published is called
the "Expanding Universe".

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.190
And basically, for a
sophisticated lay-audience,

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:32.210
what he did was explained the
ramifications of Einstein's theory

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.110
that energy and matter were more

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.560
or less the same thing
at different speeds.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.540
And that, space and time
are basically can warp.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:46.800 position:56%
And what's extra ordinary about this
and Ruth is in away demonstrating.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.410
On the left, she's just playing.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:51.860
It's a wonderful image and you got
to see some of her sense of humor.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.790
But, on the right, we're seeing a
still essentially from the dance

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.630
that she made that was called
the "Expanding Universe"

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.530
where she performed
all over the country.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.660
It debuted in Grand Rapids, Iowa.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.320
And she sent him-- a little town.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.560
She sent him a telegram, Noguchi
a telegram the next day saying

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.720 position:56%
that she worried-- she was concerned

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.560
that she had seriously
upset the town's people.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.910
That there were some indications

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.650
that it maybe hadn't
gone over all that well.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:27.030
But that she felt very good
about their quote unquote "baby."

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:28.780
And that she was going
to keep working

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.790
on it and keep performing it.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:38.760
Here she is on the stage and she
took it among other dances to Japan

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.540
on tour and with a wonderful
modernist dancer, German modernist.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:47.040
And what one thing that we know
we know it from a gossip column

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.410
in Chicago actually, but
it's the only details we have

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.340
about the rest of the stage.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:57.060 position:56%
There was a scrim at the back of the
stage which they had poked holes in

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.360
and then there were
lights behind the scrim.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.660
So it was meant to
look like a starry sky.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:05.760 position:56%
So she's performing against a starry
sky, incredibly simple concept,

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.110
incredibly probably
very rough execution,

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:13.230 position:56%
but it must have been pretty poetic
with her essentially becoming a kind

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:18.860
of amorphist cloud, you know, sort
of galaxy dancing around on stage,

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:23.880
which brings me to sort of
specifying this long digression.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.830
This is Ptolemaic Universe which
being kind of lived with for

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:30.640
about 1500 years before
the Copernican revolution.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.510
And what you can see,
what's meaningful about it

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.710
in this context is how tidy it is.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:40.360
For a long time we imagine that
the universe was this incredibly

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.950
Euclidian world of
concentric circles

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:46.620
with us at the center of course.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.540
The earth is at the center here.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.950
And what the Einsteinian
revolution really did was

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:58.390
to really dramatize the fact

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:04.880
that not only was the universe
not centered around humanity,

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.400
but that it was not in any
way shape or form tidy.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.370
And this is kind of a better look

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:14.920
at what an Einsteinian
universe might look like.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.510
You know, it's a big blob that's
expanding very, very quickly.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:20.810
If you think about it, this is one

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:25.020
of those mental shifts that's
not unlike the French revolution.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:28.440
You know, kind of a moment
in-- or the moon landing,

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:33.290
a moment in mankind's understanding
of itself when it totally shifts.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:35.350
They're not only are we not
at the center of the universe

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:39.460
but the universe is not a clean
and tidy mathematical place.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:40.760
Well it is mathematical,

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.440
but the rules that it follows are
incomprehensible to most of us.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.550
This is all hugely
important backdrop.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:50.510
I mean, it will surprise
you that I'm saying that.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.030
But Noguchi, this is what
was in Noguchi's mind

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:55.030
when he was working with Ruth Page.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:59.650
So-- And the third wheel in the
relation ship was Bucky Fuller.

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:04.570
So they are seriously trying to
understand what it means to live

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:06.930
in this new Einsteinian universe.

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:11.550
And he is trying to capture
that and it is changing the way

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.030
that he thinks about space.

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.150
It's changing the way he
thinks about what kind

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.190
of sculpture he wants to make.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:22.230
He doesn't want to make tidy
Ptolemaic, Euclidian sculpture.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:26.010
He wants to make untidy, crazy,

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:32.040
truthful to nature
Einsteinian sculpture.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:37.000
Now, the way that sort of relates
to Graham and Ruth particularly

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.600
because it would be a couple
of years before he would work

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.150
with Graham for the first time.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:45.960
Here, she is on the left and she
is performing in a tube dress,

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:51.060
wool jersey, and she's performing
Lamentation, which is from 1930.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.790
Have any of you seen Lamentation?

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:54.700
It is in-- still in [inaudible].

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.290
It's wonderful dance.

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:59.820
The company last year did a kick
starter campaign to raise money

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:04.440
to get five young choreographers
to create Lamentation variations,

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.610
which were by enlarge really
terrific, really interesting.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:15.450 position:56%
So the Lamentation is as most Graham
things are an inward turning dance,

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.390
you know, tightly coiled.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.780
Graham like to say, you know, she
always would talk about the hands

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.460
and when in doubt make a first.

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.220
You know, turn the hands
inward not outwards.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.820
Noguchi was an outward
spreading kind of guy.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:33.220
His first real self-portrait is a
sculpture I'm not showing called

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.910
"Glad Day" which a
William Blake takeoff

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:39.440
of just a spready gold
figure kind of ready

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:42.460
to take off into the firmament.

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:46.170
And you can see that's what
Ruth is doing here on the right.

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.700
So it's a pretty start contrast.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.680
But it's a really useful
one to understand

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.940
because that's what he brought
into his relationship with Martha.

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.750
Now they've known each other a long
time before they worked together.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:02.620
They probably got to know each
other in 27, 28 right around there.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.070
They were part of the same circles.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.200
They're going to the same cafes.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.470
They both were sort of
enamored Sandy Calder.

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:12.380
They both helped to perform
Calrder's Circus which was kind

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.410
of wonderful, if any of you
have seen it at the Whitney.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:19.450
It used to be a kind of traveling,
movable feast of performance.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:23.890
And a lot of artist participated in
it because it was fun and, again,

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:27.330
expanding the notion of sculpture.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:31.300 position:56%
So when they finally-- well, so just
kind of quick, quick interlude here.

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:34.430
Noguchi in between
before the Martha--

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:39.320
first Martha project did
exactly what expanding universe,

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:43.220
kind of suggested which is to
try to break out of the mold

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.790
and do something different
in the sculpture.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:48.710
So this is one of a couple
of projects that he developed

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:52.140
and then proposed in
his wonderful way

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.550 position:56%
to the Works Project Administration.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:56.940
So he was brought on
board as one of the artist

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.400 position:56%
to the Works Project Administration.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.320
This is the beginning
of the depression.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:07.670 position:56%
And the problem was that they didn't
believe that this was sculpture

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.610
and they didn't believe
that is was built.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.990
I think they thought that he
was having them on actually.

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.770
And they kick-- They
actually kicked him out.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:19.030
They revoked his status as a Works
Project Administration artist.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:24.000
This is called "Play Mountain" and
it's meant to be one city block.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.130
And he proposed it and in full
seriousness he presented this

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:31.360 position:56%
to Robert Moses as well who had
already taken over at the Department

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.900 position:56%
of Parks in New York City on his
long ascent through the ranks there.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:40.300
And he laughed him out of
the room basically and said--

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.820
I think what Noguchi said
exactly was, "I earned nothing

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.980
that day but his undying enmity."

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:47.470
And that proved to be the case

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.200
because Noguchi would spent 40
years trying to make a playground

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.730
in New York City and never succeed.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:54.780
We'll talk a little bit
more about that later.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.540 position:56%
This is a wonderful thing, you could
see it's sort of Mayan step pyramid.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:00.690
It has water feature which
is down at the bottom

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:04.560
and a huge diving board, it
could also be drained and used

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.160 position:56%
as a concert area performance space.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.920
And then you could see at the
top there's a long looping ramp.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.960
So that was meant to be a kind--
it's an all weather play mountain

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.940
because that was meant to be
sliding hill in the winter.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.720
And you can see if they
built this thing somewhere

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:27.380
in New York City we'd still be
pleased, but it was never realized.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.840
Although kind of a
version was posthumously

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.350
in a park outside Sapporo in Japan.

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.470
This is the other one
of those projects.

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.700
This is called "Monument
to the Plow".

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.060 position:56%
And this was meant to be more than--

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:47.220
about 1200 feet on a side
at the base and the idea was

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.960
that it would be in crop rotation.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.600
So the four sides of the pyramid
would be planted and through

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:58.360
out the year and done in such
a ways to make it sustainable.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:03.170
And the face of each one was meant
to be sort of 40 acres in the plow.

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:08.480
So plowable by one person
in a day with a steel plow.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.820
And the whole idea was
that it was celebrating.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.790
So his great mentor Edward Rumely

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:18.460
who was an American industrialist
the kind great [inaudible] sort had

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.010
told him that Ben Franklin

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:24.410
and Thomas Jefferson had invented
the steel plow between them

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.580
and that they believe that it was
the thing the tool that was going

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.470
to settle, quote unquote,
settle the American West.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:33.750
They didn't invent the steel plow
John Deere invented the steel plow.

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:36.050
But they popularized it hugely.

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:39.510
And so, this-- you-- it's
a little bit hard to see.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:42.170
But at the very tippy top of
this pyramid there's a cap--

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:47.880
a smaller concrete pyramid which
is toped by a big rippling ribbon

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.740
of stainless steel,
though it was meant

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:53.420
to be an abstract celebration
of the plow.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:54.960
Noguchi's thinking a lot about--

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.660
Noguchi went to high school in
Indiana, Rolling Prairie, Indiana.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.170
He was meant to go to a
school called Interlaken,

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:04.560
not the music school, but another
one that Edward Rumely had founded

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.650
which was the premise
of the school was

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:10.550
to create great American
industrialist by having boys--

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:15.670
it was all boys, learn
to do in a hands on way.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:17.940
So they built the whole
school by hand.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:22.220
And they did internships with local
factories and the whole idea was

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.920
to have managers and then
eventually owners of companies

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.100
who really knew how to do
things with their hands.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:32.130
And then Noguchi took that to
heart he was a very physically

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.430
intelligent person.

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:36.470
That's one of the things that
he and Martha shared so closely.

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:41.500
You know we tend to underrate
all forms of intelligence other

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.150
than the linguistic kind.

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:45.660
You know, we sort of overrate
linguistic intelligent,

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.960
but there are a lot of other kinds

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.530
and physical intelligence
is one of them.

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:51.700
And he and Martha Graham
are about physical geniuses.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.800
This is the thing that
he designed from scratch.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.230
You may have heard of but
there's a little clock case

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.780
and there's the radio and
there's the baby monitor

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.300
and that Noguchi made in the '30s.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:05.780
And that both those cases he just
design the case for mechanisms

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.080
that somebody else had made.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.730
In this case, this is
really his invention.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:10.570
This is called musical weathervane.

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:16.630 position:56%
And basically the idea is that it is
a weathervane that's internally lit

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:18.650
with a bulb and it has slots in it.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.690
You can see it looks little
bit like the side of a shark.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:25.890
Those are really gills and wind
would blow through from the front

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:29.450
and then pass through
the gills and make music.

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:30.750
What kind of music?

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.050
I'm not sure.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:33.350 position:56%
Probably would bit of that pleasant.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:37.580
But his thought was that it would
end up on if everything went right,

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:40.090
the roof of every barn
in the Midwest.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:41.390
That was his hope.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.780
And he really was working
to the heart land.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.270
That is where his heart was at.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:47.920
It's where his brain was at.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.910
And, you know, I think
it's projects like this

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:53.140
that really prepared
him to work with Martha.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:56.480
And the sort of the mystery why
they didn't work together earlier,

00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:03.190 position:56%
he did propose a project, probably
around 1928 to her and Leon Theremin

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:05.110 position:56%
who invented the Theremin, you know,

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:08.140
the first electronic
music device basically.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.950
We have him to blame
for the synthesizer.

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:13.470
Not-- He's not really to blame.

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:18.240
But the Theremin rod is a rod that
would emit sound when touched,

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.220
you know, has a field,
electric field around it.

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:23.450
And just by touching or getting
close to it you affect the field.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:29.580
And Noguchi's idea was to plant an
entire field of these rods on stage

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:33.860
and then have Martha dance through
them and the idea would be that she

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.620
and Theremin who also
written music, very good music

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:40.620
that they would write the
choreography and the score together

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.950
so that the score and the
choreography would be identical.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:47.810
So that as she dance, she would
produce the score as well as--

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:50.030
I mean it's such an amazing idea.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:53.300
That's where Noguchi's
mind was and both she

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.260
and Theremin probably just look at
and like he was nuts and said no.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.350
So it didn't happen.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.520
But I think she probably
thought he just wasn't ready.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.820
He was significantly younger.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.510
He's half a generation
younger than she was.

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:08.280 position:56%
And she was much further ahead and
they were both after the same thing,

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:12.980
which is to really change
their respective media

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.020
in a meaningful was.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.210
But she-- again, she was
just sort of more developed.

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:19.890
So, she maybe just
been waiting for him

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:22.330
to catch up with her, and he did.

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:26.230
So, we'll just take a quick
look here at Frontier.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:30.210
So here is the entirety
of the set for Frontier.

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:32.650
This is 1935.

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:36.710 position:56%
Martha, you know, was famous for not
having sets and not needing sets.

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:39.200
That was one of the
contributions that she was making,

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:45.060
which was to divorce dance
from all the froufrou

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:50.640
and to make something really
stripped down and clean and direct.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:56.050
And so it took her awhile to come
back around to integrating sets

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:58.330
in someway into the work.

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:02.280
And it's kind of wonderful
that this is such an early one

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:07.610 position:56%
and she really couldn't pick
anybody better than Noguchi to do it

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:13.550
because what they shared in common
was this interest in abstracting

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:15.740
in order to universalize.

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:18.450
And they both had a really
great bed of knowledge

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:20.920
by this point for doing that.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:28.350
And so she had proposed to him that
he do railroad ties receding away

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:31.950
from the audience towards
a vanishing point

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:33.700
at the back of the stage.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:38.670
And the worse way to get Noguchi
to do something was to suggest it.

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:41.730
So, he dismissed that out of hand.

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:45.580 position:56%
But it gave-- you know, she was
really brilliant and I encourage any

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:48.850
of you, if you haven't, to go on
the Library of Congress' website

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:53.360
in database, because they have
so many documents available.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:58.400
And they're available by PDF, in
large JPEG, and you can get clips,

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.340
but also original programs.

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:03.300
You know, for long time
Martha didn't write program,

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.320
which was really frustrating
for those people trying

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.340
to understand what she was
doing, but she did write letters

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:11.410
to her collaborators telling
them what she was after

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:14.660
and she's a wonderful writer and
wrote at great length and a lot

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:18.110
of that is available on the
Library of Congress' website.

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:21.230
So anyway, we have-- that's why we
have a sense of what she was after

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.150
and what Noguchi came
up with instead.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:29.920 position:56%
So, we have a rail split, split rail
pose fence and with single piece

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:35.770
of rope that's knifing up off
stage in either direction.

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:38.240
So, you know, I think it's
worth trying to figure

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.460
out what he was trying
to deliver for her

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:45.780
and it's an idea not unlike what we
find in Albert Bierstadt, you know,

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:48.280
he's trying to capture something,
obviously, they both were

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:52.630
about this idea of the American
West, manifest destiny, you know,

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:58.210
there's a wonderful theory that was
really had qualified by this point,

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:03.070
but not that much before
this called the Turner Thesis

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:04.880
or the Frontier Thesis.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.150
Total-- Really worth reading about.

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:12.610
But his basic theory was that the
American people developed indirect

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:15.320
response, or the kind of
the American way our base--

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.970
our core DNA developed
indirect response

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:21.340
to confrontation with the Frontier.

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:26.760
And so perpetually as we move
west continuing to be in dialog

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:30.700
with this idea of a Frontier and
that it's what's really responsible

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:34.010
for the development of democracy
that it's really what's responsible

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:38.710
for development of egalitarianism
and pluralism and all of the values

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:42.830
that we like best about
our democracy.

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:46.680
Really interesting thinker that's
still a really important tenant

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:51.210
of a lot of teaching of the
Frontier and the American West.

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:59.530
So this is the basic idea that she
proposed, as he said railroad ties.

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:02.400
So, it's just worth looking
sculpturally for a second

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.790
at the way he flip this notion.

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:08.870
First of all, he didn't want it
to be purely terrestrial, right?

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:12.580
What the rope does is that it
doesn't just add into the distance,

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:15.100
which it does, because it's
still has a vanishing point,

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.400
but that vanishing point
is an anchor, right?

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.100
It ties it to a specific
place on the earth.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:23.970
That's one thing that Noguchi
is just sculpturally speaking is

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:25.330
really, really good at.

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:29.060
It's very difficult skill, but
it's one that he excel that,

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:31.270
which is to combine specificity

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:34.620
and abstraction just the right
quantities and just the right way.

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:37.000
You know, there's always--
in his abstractions,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.540
there's always enough what I call
metal Velcro for you to connect to,

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.480
but there's nothing so specific
that you get bored because as soon

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:49.020
as you kind of answer it, you
know, you get tired of it.

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:53.200
So there's nothing really
to get too specific about,

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.980
but he did give her an
anchor point on the planet.

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:01.990
But he wanted to the vanishing
point or the lines to becoming

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:06.200
from outer space, to becoming from
off planet and I think that's--

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.760
it's a lovely twist on her idea,

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.830
because it does something
to the idea of Frontier.

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:15.960
And what so genius about Martha,
of course, and characterizes--

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.280
I'm just to skip ahead
of here for a second.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.930
This characterizes their
collaboration from beginning

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:24.400
to end is that she took it, she
run with it, she made it better,

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.390
she built the kind
of the whole concept

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:28.170
of the dance around it in the end.

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:31.480
If you look at that thousand
yard stair she has going, right?

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.860
She's looking off into eternity.

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:39.200
And she is-- she--
people do talk about this,

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.810
but it's easy to get lost what a
brilliant characterizer she was.

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:45.600
She was really a wonderful actress.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.320
And then, she could convey
so much with so little

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.530
and that's what she's
doing here standing

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:55.230
in front of this fence, right.

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:58.540
She's sort of a figure head, right.

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:03.080
She is on the prow of America.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.690
It's such-- just a
beautiful simple image.

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:09.190
And particularly the way she set
herself against the fans, you know,

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:11.950
so that she is a vertical
post at the center.

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:14.540
I sort of skip over some
other wonderful imagery here.

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:19.640
Here, she's making herself the
fence, becoming one with the fans,

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.730
but she's able to do because,
you know, she's obviously famous

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:26.560
for her leg lifts,
unbelievably strong and able

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:31.870
to go truly parallel here on
one foot, pretty stunning.

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:37.420
So she's really mimicking
in a way this parallelism.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.030
So, we're going to jump
ahead a little bit.

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:45.480
That was their first work together

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.400
and it would be their only work
together for about 10 years.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.700
Noguchi was doing other thing.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.020
She was doing other
things, the depression.

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:53.320
There was a lot going on.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.200
Noguchi was actually
doing pretty well.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:00.690
And he did not lower
his sights, did--

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:04.460
his ambition only mounted
over this period.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.040
So, what we're looking at here
is the Ford-Chassis Fountain.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.520
This is a fountain that he made
for Ford Motor Company's pavilion

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.910
and the World's Fair,
3940 World's Fair.

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:17.220
And, it's a very peculiar thing.

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:23.120
At the top of this post with--
I think I maybe able to--

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:27.580
that didn't work-- is a Ford V8.

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:32.210 position:56%
So, it's celebrating-- this fountain
celebrates the Ford Drivetrain.

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:34.970
It's such a crazy idea.

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:37.190
So, vaulted up into
the air at the tip

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:42.320
of the fountain is an engine block
and then there's a crankshaft

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.470
that runs down to the base.

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:49.270
And then parallel to it-- yes, so
you can see a tire down at the base

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:53.600
and it's on a strut and it has--

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:57.050
it's in a wheel well and
this is a working fountain.

00:29:57.050 --> 00:30:02.080
So, water came shooting up over
the tire and hit the crankshaft

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.810
and then spun down
around the crankshaft

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:06.730
into the basin of the fountain.

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:12.290 position:56%
This is 22 feet tall and it stood at
the center of the Road of Tomorrow,

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:16.560
which was like one mile long track,
amazing thing where you could go

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:20.110
and test the latest Ford
Lincoln cars driving

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:21.830
around Noguchi's fountain.

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:26.160
Made out of magnesite, which
is a totally unstable material

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.290
that was a competitor for
awhile of Portland cement.

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:31.700
But it failed because
it's not chemically stable

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.690
so it eats itself alive.

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:36.280
We have a number of
pieces made of this stuff.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.940
Noguchi never met a new
material he didn't like.

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:43.490
He always tried new things,
new tools, new technologies.

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:45.790
He's a technology geek.

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:49.330
Anyway, so that's what
he's thinking.

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:54.060
This is a nine ton stainless
steel panel he made and a kind

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.850
of socialist realist mode.

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:57.150
It's still there.

00:30:57.150 --> 00:30:58.450
This is Rockafeller Center.

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:01.410
It was on the Associated
Press building and you can see

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:03.930
that it's celebrating
the four freedoms sort

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:07.570 position:56%
of before they were fully enumerated

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:09.810
but this is really
celebrating the press

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:12.210
as the protector of our freedoms.

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:13.510
It's an amazing thing.

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:17.190 position:56%
It was the biggest stainless steel
panel ever made and Noguchi insisted

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:20.730
on grinding it most of it
himself into the dismay

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:26.610
of the unionized labor force at
the metal works where it was cast.

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:30.210
He also was hard at work
on playground ideas.

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:34.390
And so this is all equipment,
these are models of equipment

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:38.440
that he designed at the request
of a parks director in Honolulu

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:43.320
who was prepared to do this
and then very sadly died

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.610
and didn't get a chance
to realize it.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:47.830
One in a long string
of disappointment

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:50.180 position:56%
for Noguchi on the playground front.

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.760
Coming out of that, he
came back to New York

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.930
and designed what he
called contour playground.

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:58.890
This was a response to
the Parks Department

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:01.820
because they criticized his play
equipment for being too sharp

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:03.350
and maybe being dangerous.

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:05.810
They were really just trying
to give him a hard time.

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:10.540 position:56%
So he made a perfectly swoopy
playground called contour playground

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:13.650 position:56%
with no right angles, no hard edges.

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:16.810
And the concept was that this
would fit somewhere seamlessly

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:20.470
into Central Park and that
it would be indistinguishable

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:22.410
from the surrounding landscape.

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:26.240 position:56%
And the beautiful idea that
Noguchi enumerated was that he said,

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.950
he wanted people and he
was just starting to think

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:32.420
of as an environment maker at
this point that he wanted people

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:36.680
to experience his environments
as man first experience the earth

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:40.270
with kind of the sense of
discovery in this awe and sense

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:43.550
of the sublimity of it all.

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:44.850
Here's another.

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:47.930 position:56%
Look at it and you can see how
actual playground equipment would be

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:50.620
integrated into the park.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:53.650
Robert Moses laughed this
one out of the building, too.

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:58.380
Now, we come back to-- back
around-- we're mid-war here now.

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:04.200
And the set for this is just
next door, which is so amazing.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.520
And they're going to be
performing on it in the place

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.080
where it was originally performed.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:11.200
And what's so fantastic, so
Martha Graham has just had a bunch

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.310
of new sets made because they
go through them pretty fast

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:17.500 position:56%
because they-- there's a lot of wear
and tear from moving these things

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.750
around and then actually
performing on them.

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:21.390
You walk on them, jump on them.

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:26.210
The dancers are big beefy, the
men, especially, big beefy people.

00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:29.510
It's amazing that they
survive as long as they do.

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:33.340
So here we are looking at
the first installation.

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:34.640
This is not a model.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:37.150
This is actually the
set as it was installed

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:39.020
in the auditorium next door.

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:42.470
And you can compare this
with how it looks now.

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:47.040
It is, had-- you can see that they
did a lot to cover up all of the--

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.260
well, actually the decoration is
very similar to what's in here.

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:53.090
So it's got a lot of molding
and wind [phonetic] skidding

00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:55.030
and they covered it all up.

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:56.480
That's all Noguchi.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.770
So that's probably cut fabric and
the kind of wavy bits at the top.

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:03.510
And I was just talking with Janet.

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:08.140
They had to on the roof frame
the kind of a long member

00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:11.080
of the roof frame that
goes off stage to the left.

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:15.630
They had to cut that in half and
put a joint in it just a couple

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:17.590
of days ago to get it in there.

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:21.020
Because all of the molding and the
wind skidding is right in the way.

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:24.470
And this stage is about a
quarter of the size of the stages

00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:26.150 position:56%
that Martha Graham usually works on.

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:29.710
You know, it's incredibly
compressed and compact.

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:32.370
But you can see Noguchi
and Martha both coming back

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:36.410
around to this Frontier America
idea and developing it further.

00:34:36.410 --> 00:34:39.820
And she gave him incredibly
explicit requirements.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:41.120
We have another fence.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.510
She wanted the inside and
the outside of a house.

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:45.910
She explained things like
with the racking chair

00:34:45.910 --> 00:34:49.540
which has become quite famous,
that Noguchi made out of plywood.

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:52.530
She said that she wanted
the bones of a chair

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:54.090
or the skeleton of a chair.

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:57.850
And what she liked about Noguchi
was what she called his astringency

00:34:57.850 --> 00:35:02.130
that he kind of cut everything away
like acid that he boiled it down.

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:04.780
And you can see that's
exactly what he did here.

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:07.530
And this is the first
of a long series

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:11.070
of pieces I'm really
fascinated by Noguchi's rocks.

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:15.080
So you can see the black kind
of ovoid with lines on it.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.380
That's just for purchase.

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:19.090
So that when the preacher
figure jumps up on

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:21.610
to it he doesn't go
sliding right off again.

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:27.550
But that is a rock which rock by
way of being a soapbox, right.

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:29.800
This is his perch where he gets up.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.200
And it's nice to think
about those connections.

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.250
You know, they're-- they
both are very youngin.

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:36.300
They're both thinking
about Greek mythology.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.950
They're both always
rooted in the ancient past.

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:41.290
That's another thing they
really share in common.

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:44.170
And Noguchi is thinking about
the fact that in any community,

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:45.690
probably in the history
of the world,

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:48.430
the first soapbox is
always a rock, you know,

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:49.900
before there's anything else there.

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:55.570
That's what you get out on
top of if you want to declaim.

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:59.780
So, we're just going to go
through and look at some

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:04.210
of these great 40 sets in order
to just really quickly touch

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:05.940
on these cultural values.

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:09.570
I'm sure Janet was great
on program last night.

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:13.570
So I'm going to kind of stick
more to values as cultural values.

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:18.620
This is Herodiade set which
is a take off on the Salome.

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.500
These are both-- they're all--

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:24.090
in this period, they're all pretty
much biblical or mythological,

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:29.420
the basis for the dances
and Martha again brilliantly

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:31.160
developing program.

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:35.090 position:56%
The funny thing is, although Noguchi
was also very talented in this area,

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:37.740
Martha usually did that
with the composers.

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:41.350
And Noguchi would often come
into these projects pretty late.

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:44.760
I think she just partially knew
that she could leave it till late

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:47.880 position:56%
and that, once things were developed
enough he would give her just what

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.970
she needed to kind of take it off

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:52.510
in another direction
in just the right way.

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:57.700
And I think she used him in order
to kind of cut through the program.

00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:01.050
Because again, she would develop
and it would be so sophisticated,

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:03.520
there were so much of
it, so much language.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.100
That I think she got to a point
where she needed to break away

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:09.540
from all of that and Noguchi
did that with his sets.

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:13.280
You know, he made it super
simple, super elemental.

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:16.420
And once she had all
that research binder,

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.590
it was just what she needed
again kind of to shoot her

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:21.490
out on the right trajectory.

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:24.500
So what we're really looking
out here is a bedroom set.

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:28.230
And the piece on the left
is a mirror, hard to believe

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:31.550
but it comes right out of the
sculpture that Noguchi was making

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:34.370
and exactly the same time,
the interlocking sculptures.

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:39.220
But it's a mirror in the form of a
kind of skeletal Herod, you know,

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:43.180
truly terrifying idea that
Salome would look into the mirror

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:47.130 position:56%
and what she would she is this kind
of hulking skeletal figure of Herod.

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:50.150
And the way Martha
explained the program--

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:53.750
again, she tended to abstract
and abstract and abstract

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:57.030
and by the time she got to writing
in her program what she was doing

00:37:57.030 --> 00:38:00.220
by this point, you get like
two sentences that are really,

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:02.290
really vague, brilliantly vague.

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:04.810
So at the center we have a stool

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:08.080
and on the right hand
side we have a close rack.

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:10.820
And so, it's really
again, it's a good war set

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:12.900
but it's just a pretty
threatening good war set.

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:16.360 position:56%
Because, of course, the coat rack
looks like something that, you know,

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.330
Peter was crucified on

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:21.260
and the stools really
not all that comfortable.

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:25.020
But it's an environment
for self reflection.

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:26.320
You know, that's really what it is.

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.360
It's an interior, sort of--

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:33.010
this is inside Salome
or a person like Salome.

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:36.500
Martha explained it
as her as the waiter.

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:39.480
That she's somebody who's
waiting and waiting and sort

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.990
of terrible circumstances with
her attendant and trying to figure

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:44.800
out what's going to happen to her.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:48.510
And this is sort of-- well, the
mirror in particular is the--

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:53.180
that sort of the specter of what
is going to happen or might happen.

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:56.520
And the-- what it's so meaningful
for Noguchi or what's so important

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.150
for Noguchi because of
course, here this is--

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:01.920
again, going back to
the Parks Department.

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.800
To many people this is not
sculpture, was not sculpture,

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:09.030
but Noguchi despised the
balkanization of creativity.

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:11.360
You know, he thought the idea
that he was a different person

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.720
when he designed a table
versus when he made a piece

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:15.020
of sculpture was idiotic.

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.720
It just didn't make any sense.

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.720 position:56%
So I don't turn off half of my soul.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.820
I'm the same person
and I approach it

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.560
with the same level of seriousness.

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.720
So here our contemporaneous
piece of sculpture

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.510
and a contemporaneous
actual piece of furniture.

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:33.070 position:56%
The Herman Miller coffee table on
the right, which is a lot of people,

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:35.920
maybe the most famous coffee
table of the 20th century.

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:40.470
And on the left, his largest
of the interlocking sculptures

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:41.870
which is a piece that's
on permit view

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:43.670
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:44.970
It's a Kouros.

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:46.460
It's nine feet tall.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:49.870
But it's totally disassemblable,
packs flat.

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:51.960
The table packs flat,
too, by the way.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.820
Major Noguchi value,
flat packability.

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:57.320
He thought like an industrial
designer whether he was making

00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.270
sculpture or lanterns
or anything else.

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:03.580
He thought-- And he thought in
terms of flat materials and how

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:08.020
to take flat material stock
which was cheap and easy to move

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:12.120
for him alone and then turn it in
to something three dimensional.

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:16.830
And those values just happen to
coincide perfectly with set design

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:19.580
because that's what you
want in a set as well.

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:23.380
So we're going to spend just
a second on Cave of the Heart.

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:26.870
This is a really great set
for understanding a lot

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:29.830
about the way Noguchi's three
dimensional imagination worked.

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:31.310 position:56%
I apologize for the quality of this.

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:32.610
This is a still.

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:34.530
It's very hard to find photographs.

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:38.380 position:56%
We don't actually have one in our
archives of the entire set together.

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:40.320
It's always sections of it.

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.520
So this is the set
for Cave of the Heart.

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:45.060
On the left, you see a
number of just small pieces

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:47.010
down the floor, those
are the islands.

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:49.930
And then at the center is a piece
that he referred to as aorta.

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:52.720
And then on the right,
two pieces together,

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:55.400
the spider dress and the serpent.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.290 position:56%
And those are connected but then
they get this connected at one point

00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:01.840
because the spider dress is a
garment that Martha would put

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:07.200
on in her role as a kind of Medea
figure, an avenging angel motivated

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:11.810 position:56%
by rage and revenge and really fury.

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:16.380 position:56%
But what's going on here that's so
neat and where Noguchi really locked

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:19.080
in is if you look at the islands,

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:21.880
they're the smallest
thing on the stage.

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:25.940
And when the-- this male
figure you can see is sort

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:27.950
of a stride the islands right now.

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:31.290 position:56%
He makes them look very small and
you get the sense of uberous, right?

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:33.430
The sort of over-winning
pride and this idea

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:36.680
of clauses [phonetic] striding
across the islands of Greece,

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.110
owning the islands of Greece,
dominating the islands of Greece.

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:43.560
He's playing really great
games here with scale.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:47.760 position:56%
And that is the most important
thing that a sculpture does, can do.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.240
It's the most important tool

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:52.080
in a sculpture's toolbox is
an understanding of scale.

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:56.280
And it's set against a
model of the human heart.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:00.610
And the idea of Cave of the Heart,
of course, is that we're journeying

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:04.680
into the dark deep
recesses of the human heart.

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:08.270
In this case sort of at its
worst because, you know,

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:09.900 position:56%
Medea is a horrible avenging figure.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:13.580
She kills her own children
to punish her husband, Jason.

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:15.950
Jason is the wonderer, the seeker.

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:18.570
He's the figure who's
striding the islands.

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:23.300
So this picture of him stomping
all over Greece is also a sort

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:24.970
of her projecting, right?

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:27.600
It's-- you can imagine her.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.110
If you're going to write her
in contemporary dialogue today

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:33.100
which she would accuse Jason
of, you know, it's easy to come

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:37.400 position:56%
up with dialogue and sort of, again,

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:42.200
him as his over-winning
prideful jerk, essentially,

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:47.350
which of course he was because he
dumped her for a younger princess.

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:50.290
Now, she was the granddaughter
of Helios.

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:52.380
So you don't really want to mess

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:55.010
with the granddaughter
of Helios, the son.

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:58.270
And that's why Noguchi made
for her this spider dress.

00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:03.310
And she wanted again something
elemental but he gave her something

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:07.310 position:56%
that she turned into this incredible
weapon because when she puts it

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:09.870
on she whirls around with this.

00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:14.040
It's made out of brass wire
and the wire spin and wobble

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:16.520
and catch the light in
all sorts of directions.

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:19.850
So she became-- she becomes
this kind of avenging,

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:23.960
spinning ball of fiery death.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.510
It's really something.

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:27.360
I don't think he knew.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:32.380
He almost-- in fact, he says, he
very rarely knew or had a plan

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:34.880
for what she would
do with these things.

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:38.720 position:56%
And I think what she like is that he
gave her tools that were so simple

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.010
that she could do a lot of
different things with them.

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:44.470
So they didn't-- they're not-- they
don't force her into any action.

00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:46.750
They don't imply an interpretation.

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:49.480
They don't-- they're not directive,

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.950
which is really extraordinary
if you think about it.

00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:57.230
He was making set elements
which should be descriptive

00:43:57.230 --> 00:44:00.460
and illustrative in nature
but he was giving her things

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:04.150
that were just these little kind
of bundles of the ambiguity.

00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:08.560
That then she turned into
whatever she turned them into.

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:13.520 position:56%
So here, we're just getting a better
look at the specific elements.

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:24.290
So Errand into the Maze, this
quickly followed Cave of the Heart.

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:26.820
This is another journey
into the self.

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:32.760
The maze is again the human heart
and it's a take off on Theseus,

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:39.090
the Minotaur, Ariadne and-- but
really what it is a sort of--

00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:43.110
she described it as
a fight against fear

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:45.340
that we all have great
fear inside us.

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:50.090
And in this case, she
triumphs over fear.

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:53.560
But what's-- again, so neat if
you were ask, if I was asked,

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.540
I'm a pretty simple minded person.

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:59.650
If I were asked to do Theseus and
the Minotaur thing, of course,

00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:01.710
you immediately go-- you
have to do a maze, right?

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:03.220
So how do you do a maze?

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:06.270 position:56%
And what so need about that is in a
maze there's a really enticing idea.

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:09.990
Like for somebody who thinks about
environmental sculpture and wants

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:13.240
to make spaces and spaces
that human body moves through

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.270
and it just seems like tailor-made.

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:17.280
Of course, you are making a maze.

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.790
But of course, that's
not what Noguchi did.

00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:21.610
He didn't get for a maze
because that's simple,

00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:24.310
too simple, too directive again.

00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:29.850 position:56%
So the kind of wishbone thing at the
left ends up being the sort of maze

00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:35.870
and it gets a rope kind of wrapped
between it and ends up looking

00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:40.810
like knitting needles with knitting
on it and she assembles that

00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:45.730
and then disassembles it and breaks
through it in beautiful ways.

00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:48.690
And you can see there's a
lot of tethering going on

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:50.870
but the tethering is
all ambiguous as well.

00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:55.140
You have this kind of lying mittens
runs off from the base of the line

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:59.100
to which the moon and
the sun are connected,

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:02.550
floating up in the heavens.

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:12.910
Here's the Minotaur-ish figure
with Ariadne and here's the maze

00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:15.710
at left with Ariadne performing.

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:18.560
This is not Martha in this case.

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:22.440
But it's-- again, it's
a really good indication

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:25.010
of just how in sync they were.

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:27.590
You know, she was probably
expecting a maze,

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:29.230
a labyrinth of some sort, right?

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:32.670
And she was probably ready to
tell him, I don't want a maze,

00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:33.970
you know, it's too simple.

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:35.270
Don't give me a maze.

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:36.990
I'm sure he saw her
coming a mile a way.

00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:43.340 position:56%
So in the post-war years he-- again,
his mind was out questing far away.

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:46.330
This is a wonderful thing that
was never built for reasons

00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:47.790
that it will be become
immediately obvious.

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:50.320
This is called Sculpture
to be Seen from Mars.

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:53.070
And it was meant to
be 12 miles long.

00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:56.240
And the base of the nose
would have been a mile wide.

00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:01.990
And that's funny but sadly that
the basic premise of the piece is

00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:06.450 position:56%
that this is following obviously the
dropping of the two nuclear bombs

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:12.120
or atomic bombs which for Noguchi
was really the end of his optimism.

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:16.310
You know, he was a
technologically utopian.

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:18.520
His best friend was Bucky Fuller.

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:20.380
So he believed that engineering

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:22.830
and technology could
fix everything, right?

00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:26.300
Eventually, engineers would
provide free power to everyone

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:29.580
and clean water and all the things
that we all need to survive.

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:31.020
But the dropping of the bombs

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:34.060
for him was really put the
end to that for awhile.

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:37.950
And so this was meant to
be a cenotaph to humanity.

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:42.030
So the idea was that once we
bomb ourselves into extinction

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:47.260 position:56%
that when some alien race, a million
years from now came towards earth,

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:49.650
which is probably still
radioactive at that point

00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:53.410
that they would stop somewhere
nearby like Mars and take a look

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:55.610
at the earth and try to
figure out what happened

00:47:55.610 --> 00:47:59.450 position:56%
and here would be this face that
would say, "Hey, something was here.

00:47:59.450 --> 00:48:01.340
At some point something was here."

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:05.040
It's meant to be a kind of a
lasting proof to civilization.

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:09.490
And Noguchi talked to a guy into
New Jersey into making this.

00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:12.160
And the guy had already
set aside the land

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:15.270
and they had raised some money
and in the end it fell apart.

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:20.920
But it just gives you a sense
of where Noguchi's mind went

00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:24.030
after these projects with Martha.

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:27.280
He spent the next 10 years
almost off and on traveling

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:31.900
around the world, trying to find
a social purpose for sculpture.

00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:33.350
That was really important to him.

00:48:33.350 --> 00:48:35.140
He didn't want to just make things.

00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:36.760
He never wanted to make things.

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:39.440
Maybe this is a good point to
explain the title of the talk,

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:41.030
Sculpting Beyond the Pedestal.

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:46.060
Noguchi had a beautiful phrase
which was that he thought

00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:49.990
that we should look beyond what
he called the false horizon

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:55.060
of the Museum Pedestal, which is
a beautiful phrase for the kind

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:59.910
of the insularity of object
making for placement in museums.

00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:02.750
That's the last thing
really that he wanted to do.

00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:06.350
The only things he wanted to make
for small rooms were useful pieces

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:08.230
of furniture like a coffee table.

00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:10.680
So he's looking at things
like this which is--

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:13.700
there's a series of
astronomical observatories

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:18.830
in India called the Jantar Mantar
and they are all instruments,

00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:20.830
astronomical instruments.

00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:23.490
And this is the one that greatly
influenced the development

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:26.980
of that slide that we saw earlier
and that we'll look at again.

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:31.890
These are basically 18th century
follies built by the governor

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:36.720
of a province in India who had some
very good European instruments,

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.940
small one, table top ones.

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:44.240
And he had a theory, which is that
if you take the small instruments

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:48.010
and you make them bigger that
they could be a lot more accurate.

00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:52.140
So he built an entire
miniature city of instruments

00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:55.100
to measure various
things in the heavens.

00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:57.820
It turns out, unfortunately,
that all that happens when you do

00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:02.540
that is you magnify all of the
error that's in the instruments.

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:06.560
So, his instruments were atrocious.

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:09.480
They did not yield good
results and he went back

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:12.060
to his tabletop versions and
tried to get better versions.

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:13.590
But they still exist.

00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:17.690
You can go visit them and the
best ones remaining are in Delhi

00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:22.760
in Jaipur and Noguchi
visited them many times.

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:26.890
And he traveled to Japan for
the first time, in a long time

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:29.330
since 1931 after the war in 19--

00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:32.610
first time in 1950 and went
around to all the great sites

00:50:32.610 --> 00:50:35.500
of all Japan including
Katsura Imperial Palace.

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:40.280
This is an image, looking
from the old show in palace,

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:44.380
out across what's called
the moon viewing platform.

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:45.680
It is wonderful thing.

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:48.510
It's just a simple bamboo
platform that sits out--

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:52.350 position:56%
just out from the side of the palace
and it's just an open platform

00:50:52.350 --> 00:50:55.430
and that's it and you're just
meant to go out and sit on it.

00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:58.270 position:56%
What I used to-- what I've called--
we probably all called Indian style.

00:50:58.270 --> 00:50:59.940
But my daughter now
calls criss-cross,

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:05.180
apple sauce which is cross-legged
and looked up into the sky.

00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:09.450
He's also looking inward.

00:51:09.450 --> 00:51:13.320
And one of Noguchi's great talents
and this is one that's also related

00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:15.480
to dance, is the ability
to flip back

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:17.820
and forth between micro and macro.

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:21.250
So he's thinking galactic,
Sculpture to be Seen from Mars.

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:23.170
This piece is called Mitosis.

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:24.810 position:56%
So he's also thinking cell division.

00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:28.640
And he's flipping back and forth
between cell divisio and galactic,

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:30.130
cell division and galactic.

00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:33.580
And somewhere in there is
this space of the theatre.

00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:35.120
What so great about the theatre is

00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:37.630
that it's a totally
conceptual space.

00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:40.010
It is whatever size like
we saw with frontier.

00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:44.950
It is whatever size you can manage
to devise away to define it as.

00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:49.400
It can be as big as the heavens
or it can be as small as the space

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:52.610
between two people standing
at a fence at a rail fence.

00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:55.610
And Noguchi, I think that again,

00:51:55.610 --> 00:52:00.210
this work in theatre was
really important component

00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:05.450
of feeding his ability to look big
and small at the same time close

00:52:05.450 --> 00:52:09.140
and far away at the same time.

00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:13.760
This is a great environment and
another one of the Sunken Gardens.

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:15.410
Now we're kind of in the flow.

00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:17.810
We're doing kind of a look
at Noguchi's whole career

00:52:17.810 --> 00:52:20.350
through these connection
to dance and this a piece

00:52:20.350 --> 00:52:23.690
that he made Chase Manhattan
Bank that's still there

00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:29.010
and it's made using big river
rocks taken from the Uji River

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:30.830
which is a sacred river in Japan.

00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:33.010
Close to Katsura, actually.

00:52:33.010 --> 00:52:36.980
And he went and dragged
these rocks out of the river

00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:38.720
or bought them from stone sellers.

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:41.590
Got them wherever he could,
ship them back to New York

00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:44.590
and built this wavy,
again, this is--

00:52:44.590 --> 00:52:46.860
it's a little hard
to see in this angle

00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:50.480
but this is a wavy
plaza full of water.

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.270
It's a water fountain in the end.

00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:56.070
But it is a description
of Einsteinian space.

00:52:56.070 --> 00:53:00.780
So you have all of these great
radial crossing lines and every one

00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:04.210
of these rocks ends up
being kind of a star system.

00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:07.540
It's really-- It's just
a beautiful poetic thing.

00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:09.680
So, we're going to look
at kind of a little bit

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:12.130
of where Noguchi ended up.

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:17.350
Again, ambitions, lots of ambition.

00:53:17.350 --> 00:53:21.400
This is an early piece of
play equipment called Octetra

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:25.300
and here it is in front
Spoleto Cathedral in Italy.

00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:27.120
It's a pretty nice combination.

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:29.170
It's still there not in
front of the cathedral now,

00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:32.760
it's in the cathedral
garden but this is--

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:36.560
what's so great about this piece
is that it is-- it's architecture,

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.980
it's a structural system
and it's a piece

00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:41.410
of monumental sculpture
all at the same time.

00:53:41.410 --> 00:53:46.140
It crosses all of those lines and
vibrates and all of those realms.

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:50.930
And Noguchi turned to finally,
this is the only Noguchi playground

00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:52.900
that exist in United States.

00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:55.580
It's in Piedmont Park
in Atlanta, Georgia.

00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:59.100
It's just recently been
renovated for the second time.

00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:01.700
It was renovated right
for the Atlanta Olympics

00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:05.260
and Herman Miller paid to
renovate it a couple of years ago.

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:06.620
So it's looking terrific again.

00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:07.920
There are play cubes.

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:09.420
There's a triple slide.

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:11.350
You can see poking
above the triple side,

00:54:11.350 --> 00:54:14.940
a swing kind of a big
lightning bolt thing.

00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:16.950
That's a swing in a single plane.

00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:19.640
It doesn't have any A-frame to it.

00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:21.550
It's just a single plane.

00:54:21.550 --> 00:54:22.850
It's just really stunning thing.

00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:26.300
And he designed it to teach
kids about centripetal force.

00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:29.770
So everyone of the swings
is at different length.

00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:32.580
So by swinging on the different
lengths, you learn a lot

00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:35.310
about momentum and how
to develop momentum.

00:54:35.310 --> 00:54:39.800 position:56%
The only problem with it is that
the longest of the swings is so long

00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:43.320
that you can get going so fast
that you can really hurt somebody.

00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:49.060 position:56%
And so now, Consumer Product Safety
Commission standards preclude swings

00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:50.360
of that length.

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:51.660
So they had to remove it.

00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:53.990
So there's a gap in it now.

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:58.130
But anyway, that is
also what we end up with

00:54:58.130 --> 00:55:03.270
with Noguchi is he gets interested
in making sculpture that's really

00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:09.060
about providing the body with
an environment to move within,

00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:12.290
you know, just like a stage set
but not something that stage,

00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:15.690
something that exist in the real
world and something that, again,

00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:18.380
really important value
is not directive.

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:22.150
He really believed in
free-form open play.

00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:25.880
He believed in making things that
allow you to come at them a lot

00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:28.910
of different ways and use
them a lot of different ways

00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:31.200
and that was really unusual
at the time and is part

00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:35.090
of why his playgrounds didn't
take off early on and that the--

00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:38.110
it's one of the great tragedy
of Noguchi playgrounds is

00:55:38.110 --> 00:55:40.080
that he didn't get a
chance to development--

00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:41.380
to develop them, excuse me.

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:45.310
So the ideas are sort of
set in amber and, you know,

00:55:45.310 --> 00:55:49.050
I wished he'd had 40
years to develop his ideas

00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:52.520
and because he really is in
a lot of ways the grandfather

00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:58.020 position:56%
of the playgrounds that we see today
which are so much more imaginative.

00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:03.420
At the same time, he is making
work that's bigger and bigger.

00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:06.340
And when he does make
sculpture, large scale sculpture,

00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:09.650
this is at Storm King in Upstate
New York, if you haven't been.

00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:10.950
Wonderful place.

00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:12.250
Worth going.

00:56:12.250 --> 00:56:15.720
He made the big-- first big site
specific piece for Storm King back

00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:17.810
when it was just empty
rolling hills.

00:56:17.810 --> 00:56:19.790
It's not at all empty
rolling hills anymore.

00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:21.370
It's pack with sculpture.

00:56:21.370 --> 00:56:25.040
But they lock the top
of this hill for him

00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:29.910 position:56%
and he placed this piece called
Momo Taro which came out of finding,

00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:33.680
a bolder, that he fell in
love with that was so big,

00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:36.420
that they couldn't move it
without cutting it in half.

00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:40.220
So, it became a piece that was
about a rock that was cut in a half

00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:44.050
and then cord out and it kind
of relates to an old folk tale,

00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:47.700
Japanese folk tale about
an elderly couple who pray

00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:49.060
and pray and pray for a child.

00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:52.640
They don't get a child and pray and
pray for a child and eventually,

00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:55.760
they get a child that
hatches out of a peach pit.

00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:57.630
So this is meant to be
sort of the peach pit.

00:56:57.630 --> 00:57:02.770
And what's beautiful about it is
that Noguchi said that forevermore,

00:57:02.770 --> 00:57:05.920
one of the conditions of giving
the sculpture, making the sculpture

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:10.120 position:56%
for Storm King was that people be
able to interact with it physically.

00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:12.680
And people do and it's wonderful.

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:15.870
It's really-- It's a neat thing
to go up and curl a lot inside

00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:19.590
and become a fetus in the
womb of a Noguchi sculpture.

00:57:19.590 --> 00:57:22.430
It's quite a feeling.

00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:25.420
This is an amazing thing
in Costa Mesa, California,

00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:27.230
if you ever find yourself
in Costa Mesa,

00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:29.150
California which I don't recommend,

00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:33.210
just kind of generally
but UC Irvine is there.

00:57:33.210 --> 00:57:34.800
It's not all bad.

00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:36.160
So if you are there,
go through this--

00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:40.250
this is in the middle an
industrial park of all things,

00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:47.050
a wonderful pretty open-minded
real-estate developer named Henry

00:57:47.050 --> 00:57:51.840
Segerstrom in Orange County,
commissioned this from Noguchi.

00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:56.210
And basically what it is is a
miniature version of everything

00:57:56.210 --> 00:57:57.770
in the state of California.

00:57:57.770 --> 00:58:01.970
It's meant to be-- it's meant to
be a condensed one plaza version

00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:03.270
of the state of California.

00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:06.510
So, every tree in it is a
specimen tree, there are 78--

00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:09.480
or 28 different species
of trees in it.

00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:13.110
You can see there's a
rushing stream coming

00:58:13.110 --> 00:58:15.970
out of the totally conceptual
mountain that's at the right

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:17.510
that kind of that grand
thing that looks

00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:19.770
like the Jantar Mantar staircase.

00:58:19.770 --> 00:58:22.050
There's a little, miniature desert.

00:58:22.050 --> 00:58:26.120
There's a redwood forest that
you have to mount to hill.

00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:29.390
Not a big hill but still hill to
get op into because of forest,

00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:32.290
redwoods up and the Sierras.

00:58:32.290 --> 00:58:37.600
It's really a stunning thing and it
is a complete universe unto itself.

00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:42.150
And that's really where Noguchi's
ambitions took him is this idea

00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:43.590
of making environments.

00:58:43.590 --> 00:58:48.080
But not environments that
are not self-aware and that--

00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:50.060
that's one of those
theatrical connection.

00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:52.490
So it's California scenario, right?

00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:54.070
It's a concept of California.

00:58:54.070 --> 00:58:55.810
It's an idea of California.

00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:59.890
It's an-- California that is
meant to be like a stage set

00:58:59.890 --> 00:59:03.920 position:56%
and that it ask you to interact
with it or ask you to figure out how

00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:07.900
to interact with it, you know, you
can't take the concept out of it.

00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:09.490
That's what so neat about it.

00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:13.280
And that's a fundamentally
theatrical idea or an idea

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:16.950
that comes out of the management
of the theatrical space.

00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:25.850 position:56%
So this is a piece or combination of
play cubes that are in Piedmont Park

00:59:25.850 --> 00:59:31.240
and it put together a little
combination here, you know,

00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:34.890
piece of the right permit
collection, Metropolitan Museum

00:59:34.890 --> 00:59:39.000
of Art, a different kind of
Kouros at the left, right.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:45.220 position:56%
A little boy on a pedestal and which
of these is near to Noguchi's heart?

00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:51.760
It's really easy, you know, he
was after the left hand version

00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:55.120
that he wanted to make a
base that every little kid

00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:59.860
on the planet would want to get
up on top of and be a sculpture,

00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:02.040
you know, for a brief
period of time.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:04.260
And that little boy looking
off into the distance,

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:08.850
this thing is only six feet tall,
this little piece of play equipment

01:00:08.850 --> 01:00:10.890
and he's only in Piedmont Park.

01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:14.920
But like Martha Graham, he's
looking out into eternity, right?

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:19.240
He is-- well, he really is
a Kouros, you know, he is--

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.920
he could be [inaudible], you know,
he's on the [inaudible] of a ship,

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:24.500
he's looking out into the distance.

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:28.280
It's really such a lovely thing
and Noguchi wanted to make pieces

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:32.200
that would inspire that
kind of head space.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:36.490
I always say about Noguchi when
Noguchi is working really well,

01:00:36.490 --> 01:00:40.050
it feels like an airlock just
closed behind you in your mind.

01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:44.280
You're transported somewhere
else in this-- a microcosm.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:48.720
Even with something as simple
these cast concrete cubes

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:51.820
and that really again comes
straight of Martha Graham.

01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:58.020
This is at that joint talk I was
talking about open rehearsal.

01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:01.920
So this is Lloyd Knight, a
wonderful Martha Graham dancer

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.950
on Jocasta's Bed.

01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:07.270
He's playing Oedipus and
he's making the point

01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:12.840
that he owns her afterwards because
he's come in, he solved the riddle

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:19.000 position:56%
and Jocasta, his mother is now going
to be his wife and that's going

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.010
to be their marriage bed.

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:26.630
He doesn't obviously know anything
but he thinks he knows everything.

01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:34.630
So, kind of a dirty secret
of the Noguchi Museum,

01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:38.260
I'm contractually obligated to
mention Noguchi's relationship

01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:41.890
with Brancusi before ending.

01:01:41.890 --> 01:01:44.270
Not really, but it's
kind of like that.

01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:47.150
I try not to but in this
case, it's irresistible.

01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:50.080
So there's the little sculpture
at the far left of this right next

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.960
to the bed is called
Little French Girl.

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:56.870
And the reason I'm showing
her is because she pops

01:01:56.870 --> 01:02:00.890
at in Noguchi's studio photography
again and again and again

01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:04.740
and here she is standing in
the shadow of Madame Pogany

01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:09.630
on a pedestal, her mother, you
know, presumably in this way.

01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:13.700
Brancusi in 1927-1928
when Noguchi was

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:17.300
in his studio was making
what he called mobile groups.

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.910
And I just want to-- I want to show
this because it's really important

01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:22.770
to realize Noguchi is not
the first person to think

01:02:22.770 --> 01:02:24.600
about sculpture in
a way that he did.

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.330
It came from a lot of
different sources and one

01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:32.300
of the most important is Brancusi's
studio which at this point was a--

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:36.480
like a theatre, function
like a theatre.

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:40.310 position:56%
So Brancusi was constantly arranging
and rearranging the sculptures,

01:02:40.310 --> 01:02:44.570
the bases and the furniture and
really unlikely combinations.

01:02:44.570 --> 01:02:46.510
So that bases would
become sculptures

01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:48.010
and sculptures would become bases

01:02:48.010 --> 01:02:50.630
and furniture would be
whatever it wanted to be.

01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:55.240
And a piece like Little French Girl
really became an animated figure

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:56.910
running around through the studio,

01:02:56.910 --> 01:02:59.800
finding herself in
different scenarios.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:03.670
Here's another-- she's standing
right in the midst of what looks

01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:06.870
like kind of rubble but actually
this is a Brancusi studio

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:10.490
at its happiest with all of
these sculptures spread around in

01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:15.890
and amongst raw materials and then
finally she gets her start turn.

01:03:15.890 --> 01:03:20.240
So here she is standing next
to an endless column looking

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:25.420
up at a piece called cup, which is
just carved out of wood on the top

01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:27.970
of what is acting like a
kind of so [inaudible].

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:31.700
But I have a two-year-old and he
spends all of his time like this,

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:34.780
you know, just looking up
at surfaces that he wants

01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:38.110
to pull things down off of.

01:03:38.110 --> 01:03:42.220
So this is a great-- you know,
there's a lot of DNA in here

01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:46.240
for the Noguchi that I've tried
to present to you tonight.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.920
And so I'm just going to leave you

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:50.830
with another image
of a slide mantra.

01:03:50.830 --> 01:03:54.370
This is the white Slide Mantra that
was made to be the center piece

01:03:54.370 --> 01:03:57.450
of Noguchi's Venice
Biennale exhibition.

01:03:57.450 --> 01:04:02.030
He represented the US in
1986 and he put at the center

01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:07.360
of the American Pavillion, a
slide and a usable slide at that

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:11.790
which at the time was really
something and there was a rumor

01:04:11.790 --> 01:04:14.540
that he was going to win
the Golden Lion Award.

01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:16.970
He was 82.

01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:18.650
He had an amazing career.

01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:20.680
The show was called
"What is Sculpture?"

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:23.690
He'd really earn the right to
ask that question again and again

01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:25.680
and again by this point
in his career.

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:29.160
But because he included Akari
lamps, which were considered

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:34.220 position:56%
and this is going to sound hilarious
a crafts commercialization of art.

01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:36.870
You know, now art is nothing
but crafts commercialization.

01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:40.600
That's-- Venice Biennale
is sort of, you know,

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:42.830
less elegant than a
Mercedes Showroom.

01:04:42.830 --> 01:04:47.950
But anyway at the time, he did two
things, he presented the lanterns

01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:50.500
and then he had a working
slide at the center of his show

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:54.870
and that just was too much for
European art critics especially.

01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:58.510
But there's a wonderful story
that I want to leave you with.

01:04:58.510 --> 01:05:00.680
He's standing in the Pavilion.

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:03.950
This is in Bayfront Park in
Miami, where the piece is now.

01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:06.390
Visit it if you're ever there.

01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:08.720
It's another failed
park projects, sadly.

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:10.640
And this is just the remains of it.

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:13.190
But so he's standing there with
Issey Miyake who's a friend

01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:14.640
of his, the fashion designer.

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:17.250
And Miyake they were
watching kids just cycle

01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:19.320
down the slide again
and again and again.

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:21.630
He said, "Isn't it
weird to have kids all--

01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:23.110
running all over you sculptures?

01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:24.410
That must be strange.

01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:26.460
You know, that's-- you don't
make sculpture for that?

01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:29.890
And Noguchi said, "No, that's
exactly what I make sculpture for.

01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:31.360
What I think about them sliding

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.640
on my sculpture is I think
they're going to learn a lot

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:38.480
about sculpture with their butts."

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:42.530
And where I started,
the great fortune

01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:47.910
of having the Martha Graham Company
used Noguchi's sculpture everyday,

01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:49.210
every year.

01:05:49.210 --> 01:05:52.590
They still have 14 or so
out of the 19 or so dances

01:05:52.590 --> 01:05:55.080 position:56%
that he made such for in repertoire.

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:58.310
They breathe life and
soul and purpose

01:05:58.310 --> 01:06:00.890
into those things every
time they touch them.

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:03.200
And that's exactly
what Noguchi wanted.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:07.270
I think it would probably
be among the proudest facts.

01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:10.290 position:56%
And, you know, they ran in lock step

01:06:10.290 --> 01:06:13.590 position:56%
so much their entire careers I
would think of them as like the Adam

01:06:13.590 --> 01:06:15.630
and the Eve of the
American modernism

01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:18.420
and of the pluralistic version
of it that we all believe in.

01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:23.280 position:56%
They-- Sort of at the very end of
his life there's a wonderful moment,

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:26.910 position:56%
when the museum opened he was famous

01:06:26.910 --> 01:06:28.730
for not showing up
to his own openings.

01:06:28.730 --> 01:06:33.360
In fact, he made a cutout
version of himself as a void

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:35.990
so it was not himself as a figure,

01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:38.790
it was himself a void
cutout of a piece of wood.

01:06:38.790 --> 01:06:43.270 position:56%
So he was absence as presence and
he gave that to his dealer and said,

01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:45.020
"I'm not coming, but
you can use this."

01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:49.980
So he-- it was an hour and a half
into the opening of the museum

01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:53.710
and he hadn't showed up and
there was one very simple reason

01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:58.160
because when he finally did enter
about two hours into the opening,

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:01.950
he entered in arm-in-arm with
Martha and she had been late

01:07:01.950 --> 01:07:05.620
and he wasn't going to walk into
his own museum until she showed

01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:08.190
up because he knew what an
important moment it was.

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:12.080
He knew how symbolic it would be
and he knew what they had meant

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:14.360
to each other and he knew what
they meant to the 20th century,

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:16.540
especially in American art making.

01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:20.510
And that's really the best picture
I think I can leave with you

01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:22.040
with in terms of understanding.

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:25.470
Their importance to each other
and her importance to him in terms

01:07:25.470 --> 01:07:29.200
of developing the way he thought
about what sculpture should be.

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.000
Thank you very much.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:48.190
[ Applause ]

01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:51.310
I think we're supposed
to take some questions

01:07:51.310 --> 01:07:54.950
if anyone has anything
would like to please?

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:56.680
&gt;&gt; David Pylar: Would you
mind just waiting for the mic.

01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:57.980
&gt;&gt; Dakin Hart: Oh sorry.

01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:00.250
I think we have a microphone.

01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:01.550
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:08:01.550 --> 01:08:02.850
Thank you so much that was great.

01:08:02.850 --> 01:08:08.910
Question, are there any mockups,
copies or originals of the sets

01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:11.130
in the museum, Martha Graham sets?

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:12.670
&gt;&gt; Dakin Hart: Yeah.

01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:16.770
It's something that I
think about all the time.

01:08:16.770 --> 01:08:20.060
We have bits and pieces
and it's terrible actually.

01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:22.310
It makes very, very
hard to show them.

01:08:22.310 --> 01:08:24.880
We have a couple of
original things, we have--

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:28.100
they made some casts of
great pieces like the chair,

01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:30.300
the great chair from
Appalachian Spring.

01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:34.190 position:56%
They together again in their '80s,
they were both thinking about legacy

01:08:34.190 --> 01:08:36.510
and how they were going
to keep their museum

01:08:36.510 --> 01:08:38.460
and companies going respectively.

01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:41.830
So they chose a few great iconic
settlements and they cast them

01:08:41.830 --> 01:08:45.300
in bronze and then they
each took half and sold them

01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:48.680
to help raise money to support
the museum and the company.

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:54.620
And so we have a couple of those
but what we really would like to do

01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:57.050
and we're talking with Graham
about doing this and we're looking

01:08:57.050 --> 01:09:02.180
for joint funding is to reengineer
all the sets for the 21st century

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:04.460
because every time Martha
Graham travels to Europe,

01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:07.970
it cost him about $40,000
to get the sets their

01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:10.120
and $40,000 to get them back.

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:13.620
They take up a huge container
and they're very, very heavy.

01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:15.650
And they're so heavy
that they're not--

01:09:15.650 --> 01:09:19.220
they hurt them selves because
just moving them around back--

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:20.880
the bigger something is
and the heavier it is,

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:22.940
the more danger it is to itself.

01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:25.630
So we're really interested
in working together

01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:28.840
with a great industrial
designer to redesign them

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:33.330
in some new material whether it's
carbon fiber or aluminum and use

01:09:33.330 --> 01:09:37.410
that principle of flat packability,
so that they can be broken down

01:09:37.410 --> 01:09:40.340
and maybe be able to
ship the whole thing

01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:44.100
in like one-tenth the
weight and half the volume.

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:46.660
And we-- I'd love to have
a set for the museum, too,

01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:48.400
so that we have something
to exhibit.

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.640
But it's-- he wasn't
precious about them.

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:55.140
So we don't have a single one of
the original models for these sets.

01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:57.510
We have photographs,
but none of the models

01:09:57.510 --> 01:09:59.810
which I would dearly love to have.

01:09:59.810 --> 01:10:01.110
Maybe they're out there somewhere.

01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:02.510
There are a lot of
important lost Noguchis.

01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:05.110
So keep your eye open
at flea markets.

01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:08.070
And if you see something that
looks like that little chair,

01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:09.370
it might be that little chair.

01:10:09.370 --> 01:10:13.390
&gt;&gt; I just want to know if there's
going to be another opportunity

01:10:13.390 --> 01:10:17.430
like in New York to interact
with three or four of these sets,

01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:19.540
because I'll go there
if there is, you know.

01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:20.840
&gt;&gt; Dakin Hart: Yeah.

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:22.140
I know it was really
an amazing event.

01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:26.740
In that picture I showed of Lloyd,
they did their open rehearsal

01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:28.600
and then the audience
flooded that stage

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:30.700
and you could go do
exactly what he was doing

01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:32.120
which is walk down the bed.

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.590
I think they're going to
do more and more of that.

01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:36.470
That was a Kickstarter campaign.

01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:38.520
Do you all know Kickstarter?

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:39.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:41.120
&gt;&gt; Dakin Hart: You know a
way to raise money online.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.420
&gt;&gt; So if you donated so much
money you got to go this thing.

01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:44.160
&gt;&gt; Dakin Hart: Yeah, it
wasn't even very much money.

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:48.230
They are really trying to open
up and be more interactive and,

01:10:48.230 --> 01:10:50.170
you know, I don't know how much
you all know about the history

01:10:50.170 --> 01:10:52.980
of the Graham company, but
it was on its last legs.

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:55.630
I mean it was really went
through an incredibly tough period

01:10:55.630 --> 01:11:00.390
and LaRue Allen and Janet
Eilber deserve so much credit

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:04.320
because they really have brought
it back, breathe new life into it.

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:06.490
And they're trying to do exactly
what we're trying to do which is

01:11:06.490 --> 01:11:11.610
to make the vision of a
really unique person live

01:11:11.610 --> 01:11:13.020
on in a meaningful way.

01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:15.350
You know, we're not
trying to run sort

01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:17.790
of [inaudible] graphic
organizations.

01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:22.480
It's not-- The museum is
not a Mosque or a Mausoleum.

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:26.640
You know, we really want it to live
and be contemporary and current.

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:28.420
And that's what Graham is
doing with his program.

01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:30.440
That's what they're doing with the
help of the Library of Congress

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:31.940
by commissioning new work.

01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:34.760
They're doing a lot more
work with new choreographers,

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:37.180
contemporary choreographers.

01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:38.760
There are so many parallels.

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.100
It's really, really interesting.

01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:41.890
But I imagine they'll
do a lot more of it,

01:11:41.890 --> 01:11:43.190
because it was a huge success.

01:11:43.190 --> 01:11:44.490
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:11:44.490 --> 01:11:46.790
&gt;&gt; Dakin Hart: Sure.

01:11:49.780 --> 01:11:54.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So I just want to give a plug for
your museum which I think is great

01:11:54.090 --> 01:11:57.000
and it's very easy to get
to if you're in Manhattan.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.080
It's just across the river and
great article about it last Friday,

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:02.780
I think it was in the
New York Times.

01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:06.610
But I have a question about
the Herman, are there any notes

01:12:06.610 --> 01:12:10.540
that he had written
about his ideas for that?

01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:13.870 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dakin Hart: It's a one
throwaway line in his autobiography.

01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:15.170
&gt;&gt; Uh huh.

01:12:15.170 --> 01:12:17.130
&gt;&gt; Dakin Hart: And scholar named
Robert Tracy did a little bit

01:12:17.130 --> 01:12:20.480
of work on it, trying to nail
it down and he did find a couple

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:23.890
of details, but there's
basically nothing.

01:12:23.890 --> 01:12:25.340
&gt;&gt; Because obviously there's a lot

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:28.160
of interactive art
installations now that--

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:32.750
I mean, he was the
precursor of all that.

01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:34.050
&gt;&gt; Dakin Hart: Yeah, [inaudible]--

01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:35.350
&gt;&gt; Yeah, oh absolutely.

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:36.650
&gt;&gt; Dakin Hart: You know, if any
of those projects had been made--

01:12:36.650 --> 01:12:37.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:40.020
&gt;&gt; Dakin Hart: You know, Michael
Heizer is busy in the desert trying

01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:43.470
to make the city a
Mayan City basically.

01:12:43.470 --> 01:12:47.380
&gt;&gt; So, on the material side
the stone and his wood,

01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:49.340
did he ever do anything in glass?

01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:50.640
&gt;&gt; Dakin Hart: Oh yeah.

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:51.940
&gt;&gt; OK.

01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:53.240
&gt;&gt; Dakin Hart: He did.

01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:54.540
He tried-- He used everything.

01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:55.840
You know, he also worked awhile
with plastic until he just--

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:57.520
at the end he's busy and he said,

01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:59.610
"He couldn't find the
spirit plastic."

01:12:59.610 --> 01:13:03.490
You just never-- but there probably
are plastics now that he would.

01:13:03.490 --> 01:13:06.010
You know, I think he'd
be all over carbon fiber,

01:13:06.010 --> 01:13:09.010
he would be making
computer-based work, you know, he--

01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:11.650
again, he never met new
technology that he didn't like.

01:13:11.650 --> 01:13:12.950
&gt;&gt; Do you have any?

01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:14.250
Because I don't recall
any glass pieces

01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:15.960
at the museum, do you have any?

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.790
&gt;&gt; Dakin Hart: Well, he
made a thing for Steuben.

01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:21.730
Steuben commission
contemporary artist to make work

01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:25.560
and he did a piece,
it's not a great thing.

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:29.320
But yes he did-- trying to think.

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:33.820
I mean, it related to a series of
lamps that he proposed in the '40s

01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:37.380
that were lamps made to order,
they were in plastic and glass.

01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:40.280
But they-- in the end
they just didn't catch on.

01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:43.180
And the Luminaire was
the manufacturer.

01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:45.030
But we just don't know.

01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:46.330
Really none exists.

01:13:46.330 --> 01:13:49.540
So maybe none were bought
or maybe a few were bought

01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:51.910
and they just disappear
and-- you know, or broken,

01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:58.900 position:56%
ended up in flea markets and another
thing to keep an eye out for.

01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:00.200
&gt;&gt; OK.

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:04.910
&gt;&gt; I wanted to ask you about
the dance step was the maze?

01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:06.210 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dakin Hart: Errand into the Maze.

01:14:06.210 --> 01:14:07.730 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dakin Hart: Errand into the Maze.

01:14:07.730 --> 01:14:12.590
And you mentioned that Martha
Graham worked with fear

01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:16.890
and I just wanted what you knew
about her working with the sculptor

01:14:16.890 --> 01:14:20.830
on the fear and how they
collaborated, around in emotion?

01:14:20.830 --> 01:14:24.200
&gt;&gt; Dakin Hart: What's really
interesting in 1946 coming--

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:27.570
he made the anteversion
of Appalachian Spring.

01:14:27.570 --> 01:14:28.870
You know, you have that--

01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:34.000
we have that wonderful Shaker house
basically in fence and, you know,

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.890
it's so filled with optimism
and that frontier spirit.

01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:41.620
He made it work with Ruth
Page in 1946 called the Bells.

01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:47.020
And in the Bells, there's a Shaker
church which is just a raw frame,

01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:51.960
but huge very, very tall like 20
feet tall white painted frame.

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:53.450
It's all hinged.

01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:56.570
So it gets lifted up in a place
and it looks like it's solid.

01:14:56.570 --> 01:14:59.950
But it has hinges spread
throughout asymmetrically.

01:14:59.950 --> 01:15:02.710
So when it's lower
the rail is lowered

01:15:02.710 --> 01:15:05.760
from the ceiling, the
church collapses.

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:09.410
And the theory of this
dance or the program

01:15:09.410 --> 01:15:12.980
of the dance is basically
that Hitler wins.

01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:17.970
And it is a figure that's
kind of a demonic figure

01:15:17.970 --> 01:15:21.280
and it's almost exactly
the same basic premise

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:24.470
because you have a
bride-groom and a bride.

01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:28.700
And in this case rather than raise
a house and get married and go off

01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:33.200
into this great future
life in America, they are--

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:34.920
the bride-groom was killed

01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:38.780
and the specter figure
carries the bride away.

01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:43.870
So that's the difference between
1944 and 1946 because even

01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:47.490
from Noguchi even thought we had
won the war he was so shattered

01:15:47.490 --> 01:15:49.940
by the way that we won the war.

01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:53.530
And by the-- just the effect,
the impact that it had overall.

01:15:53.530 --> 01:15:55.370
So it's something that he's basic--

01:15:55.370 --> 01:15:58.250
I think he really never
recovered from that in a way.

01:15:58.250 --> 01:15:59.670 position:56%
You know, the space program like for

01:15:59.670 --> 01:16:03.450
so many Americans became the
redemption of technology.

01:16:03.450 --> 01:16:07.000
Yeah, the retraining of all of that
technology and all that brain power

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.510
that had been put into
weaponry and putting it off

01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:13.000
to something better
and that helped a lot.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.770
But he had lost that sort
of fundamental optimism.

01:16:17.770 --> 01:16:19.850
I don't know as much about Graham.

01:16:19.850 --> 01:16:22.020
She was always harder.

01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:24.240
She was tougher in every way.

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:28.690
I don't think she was not the
starry-eyed optimist that he was.

01:16:28.690 --> 01:16:31.370
So I don't think she went through
the same sort of disillusionment,

01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:34.220
plus she was so much
more-- he was an introvert.

01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:38.310
But she was really-- you know,
she was a scientist of the soul.

01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:42.710 position:56%
You know, she really that just-- and
that didn't changed really at all.

01:16:42.710 --> 01:16:45.210
Even her source material
didn't change very much

01:16:45.210 --> 01:16:47.050
where it did for him a lot more.

01:16:47.050 --> 01:16:49.240
I don't know.

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:50.540
That's not a very good answer.

01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:54.780
That'd be a really good
questioned to ask Janet.

01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:57.430
&gt;&gt; I was wondering if you could
elaborate on the Ruth Page,

01:16:57.430 --> 01:17:01.210
what you started with, but
then go back to the '20s

01:17:01.210 --> 01:17:04.880
and more Martha was first
and then how did that dynamic

01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:07.470
with the three of them evolve?

01:17:07.470 --> 01:17:09.620
&gt;&gt; Dakin Hart: Well,
I think, after--

01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:12.350
Noguchi stayed friends
with Ruth and then would go

01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:16.830 position:56%
on to do this other performance
with Ruth and the aluminum sculpture

01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:19.290
that I showed you Ruth and
her husband, so Noguchi meet

01:17:19.290 --> 01:17:21.150
up with her husband
after the affair.

01:17:21.150 --> 01:17:22.840
They had a one year affair.

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:27.640
And he tried to get her to
leave her husband and marry him.

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:29.110
Ruth was an amazing person, too.

01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:31.220
So Ruth left her honeymoon.

01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:34.760
She was honeymooning in Monte
Carlo, she got the opportunity

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:38.940
to go audition for Diaghilev
in the Russian ballet,

01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:43.710
which was just nearby down
on the coast and at the time.

01:17:43.710 --> 01:17:47.380
And so she left her new husband.

01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:48.700
No. Well not.

01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:50.380
They were on their honeymoon.

01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:52.430
But they were only few
days into their honeymoon

01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:55.400
and she sent him back to
Chicago and she stayed

01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:57.290
and started and actually made it.

01:17:57.290 --> 01:18:01.130
She was the only American
ever employed by the Diaghilev

01:18:01.130 --> 01:18:03.510
and she went out on tour.

01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:06.630
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:08.010
She's right in between.

01:18:08.010 --> 01:18:11.010
She was a little bit
older than Noguchi.

01:18:11.010 --> 01:18:16.280
She's an amazing figure and the
Chicago Historic-- it's renamed.

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:20.260
The Chicago History Museum has
now digitized a lot of video

01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:22.620
of her dances and they're
worth going to see.

01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:25.180
She made a really amazing
dance in 19, like,

01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:27.780
26 called the flapper
and the quarterback.

01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:31.980
So she really-- She
pioneered Americana.

01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:33.970
Amazing, amazing person.

01:18:33.970 --> 01:18:35.660
Again, she really isn't
very well-known just

01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:37.850
because she worked in Chicago.

01:18:37.850 --> 01:18:39.240
If she had moved to
New York and work

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:43.050
to New York she would have been
every bit Martha's equal, you know,

01:18:43.050 --> 01:18:46.040
different obviously but--

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:48.240
&gt;&gt; Ellen Landau has
written a couple of articles

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:51.170
about Martha Graham's
influence on Noguchi.

01:18:51.170 --> 01:18:53.470
I don't know if you're familiar
with them or if you could comment

01:18:53.470 --> 01:18:56.850
on her influence on how
Noguchi presented his art.

01:18:56.850 --> 01:19:02.050
She's talking specifically
about murals in Mexico.

01:19:02.050 --> 01:19:04.160
&gt;&gt; Dakin Hart: Yeah, I
mean so Noguchi did--

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:08.090
this was another one of
those Noguchi had a thing

01:19:08.090 --> 01:19:09.850
with Frida Kahlo.

01:19:09.850 --> 01:19:12.720
He was very friendly
with Diego Rivera.

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:17.960
Rivera invited him down to Mexico
to do a mural in a public market

01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:23.550 position:56%
and there are a lot of American
artist who went down to do projects.

01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:27.180
These were people who are
involved with the WPA mostly or--

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:31.030
but they were kind of sidelined
WPA people like Noguchi

01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:34.620
and Diego Rivera offered
this amazing opportunity.

01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:35.920
So Noguchi went down.

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:37.220
It's still there.

01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:38.520
It's been restored.

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:39.820
It's in pretty good shape now.

01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:42.250
And it is pure social realism.

01:19:42.250 --> 01:19:43.910
It's very like-- the
figures are really

01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:45.310
like what you saw in
the press panel.

01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:48.300 position:56%
But it includes a lot of interesting
little things and actually one

01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:52.270
of the greatest piece of Noguchi a
[inaudible] came of that experience

01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:57.620
because he wanted to include some
scientific notation in the mural.

01:19:57.620 --> 01:20:01.560
And so he decided he was going
to include E equals mc squared.

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:04.990
But he realized that he had no idea
what it meant even though he had

01:20:04.990 --> 01:20:07.270
read his book the Arthur
Eddington book.

01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:11.690
And so he sends Bucky a
telegram for Mexico City

01:20:11.690 --> 01:20:16.050
to New York City saying can you
explain in not too many words

01:20:16.050 --> 01:20:18.040
because he's paying for
the return telegram.

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.610 position:56%
Can you explain E equals mc squared?

01:20:20.610 --> 01:20:25.020
And it is one of the funniest
things ever written really

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:29.660
because it's Bucky who is
notorious blowhard and very hard

01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:33.840
to understand, but always, you
know, wonderful to listen to trying

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:37.780
to condense that down in
explaining E equals mc squared

01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:39.780
in a very compressed format.

01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:42.880
And what's so funny is with the
punctuations of stop, stop, stop,

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:45.800
stop, stop really all
you wanted to do is stop

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:49.100 position:56%
because it just gets worst and worst
and worst, it's so funny to think

01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:51.780
of Noguchi receiving
these telegram, you know,

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:55.570 position:56%
and trying to make head-tails of it
and then he was, oh right, you know,

01:20:55.570 --> 01:20:57.910
I got exactly what I asked for.

01:20:57.910 --> 01:21:02.510
But the Mexico City [inaudible] was
usually important because it's one

01:21:02.510 --> 01:21:06.520
of this formative-- Noguchi is
so much more socially connected

01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:10.970
and socially sophisticated and
interested than people realize.

01:21:10.970 --> 01:21:14.970
Like his interment World War II
which is a hugely important story

01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:19.390 position:56%
and we're coming up on the 75th
anniversary of Executive Order 9066.

01:21:19.390 --> 01:21:21.660
We'll be doing a little show and
I know a lot of people are going

01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:24.350
to be doing shows about
interment one way or the other.

01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:27.740
But Noguchi is self-interned, you
know, he chose to go into a camp

01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:31.540
because he believes so much in this
country that he was willing to take

01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:36.070
on the responsibility of one of
the worst mistakes we've ever made

01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:38.250
and personally try to
help make it better,

01:21:38.250 --> 01:21:40.770
because the war department led
him to believe that if you went

01:21:40.770 --> 01:21:43.430
into the camp, Poston,
which was the biggest camp

01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:44.730
that they would help him

01:21:44.730 --> 01:21:49.000
in redesigning it making it more
humane starting arts programs.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.520
We have a blueprint for
his redesigned of the camp,

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:56.820 position:56%
which was basically kind of
turning it into Paris and, you know,

01:21:56.820 --> 01:22:00.630 position:56%
or as much as close as you could get
to Paris in the desert, in Poston,

01:22:00.630 --> 01:22:02.860
Arizona where it was
like 120 everyday.

01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:06.310
And-- But it was so horrible
and they had lied to him.

01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:08.490
So he wasn't able to do anything.

01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:11.010
And he was-- it turns out
he was totally out of sync

01:22:11.010 --> 01:22:14.950
with the job he's interned there
who we had nothing in common with.

01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:18.170
It was a nightmare for him and he
tried to get out after two months.

01:22:18.170 --> 01:22:20.370
But once they had him
they wouldn't let him go.

01:22:20.370 --> 01:22:22.680
And it took months
in the end for him

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:25.900
to win his release even hough
he wasn't subject to interment

01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:28.040
because he was a resident
of New York.

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:29.920
Not a resident of the West Coast.

01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:33.700
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I think we have
time for one more if anybody.

01:22:40.090 --> 01:22:41.650
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

01:22:41.650 --> 01:22:43.510
When you were talking about
the high school he attended

01:22:43.510 --> 01:22:45.140
in Indiana [inaudible] understood

01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:48.300
that school had been
founded by the industrialist.

01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:51.110
And so there was a great focus
on getting the children to work

01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:53.080
with their hands and invent things.

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:58.120
Was-- Did Noguchi begin
to work sculpturally

01:22:58.120 --> 01:22:59.860
or spatially at that age?

01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:03.530
I had read that he-- when he
was in med school at Columbia

01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:05.540
that he took a night
course in sculpture

01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:07.770
and that's where the flame was lit.

01:23:07.770 --> 01:23:09.250
But was it earlier?

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:10.550
&gt;&gt; Dakin Hart: It was
much earlier than that.

01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:12.940
Yeah. And it's really all
down to his mother who was one

01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:14.650
of these figure like
Martha, you know,

01:23:14.650 --> 01:23:17.350 position:56%
is a person with just absolute will.

01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:22.210
His mother was a Bryn Mawr
girl, Irish-American stock

01:23:22.210 --> 01:23:24.780
and she was not married
to his father

01:23:24.780 --> 01:23:28.540
who is a famous Japanese poet,
but was editor, [inaudible] an ad

01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:31.090
in the paper, New York,
she's from Brooklyn

01:23:31.090 --> 01:23:37.160
and she followed his father,
Noguchi is born in Los Angeles

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:40.830
and followed his father to
Japan, she spoke no Japanese,

01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:44.430
she had no job but she
decided that Noguchi

01:23:44.430 --> 01:23:49.610
who at the time was Sam Gilmore
because he actually was unnamed.

01:23:49.610 --> 01:23:52.780
They just called him Boy
for the first three years

01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:56.340
because his father wanted
to name him, you know,

01:23:56.340 --> 01:23:59.670
that was the father's
right to name the son.

01:23:59.670 --> 01:24:02.490
So they just call him-- well, they
had a bunch of different names.

01:24:02.490 --> 01:24:06.310
They call them Yo, which is
short for Yonejiro, his father's.

01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:09.050
But-- So he went Boy-- Yo and Boy.

01:24:09.050 --> 01:24:12.290
And so he finally got named
when she took him to Japan.

01:24:12.290 --> 01:24:16.100
But in the meantime his father
had started a Japanese family.

01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:18.400 position:56%
So they couldn't even stay with him.

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:21.040
That was very awkward
and Noguchi spend--

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:24.130
but Noguchi went to
elementary school in japan.

01:24:24.130 --> 01:24:28.780 position:56%
But his mother they built their own
house and his mother plan the house.

01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:30.990
Noguchi is about eight at the time.

01:24:30.990 --> 01:24:35.100
And Noguchi apprenticed to the
carpenter who is building the house

01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:39.650 position:56%
and learn to do basic planing and
sort of simple task that he could do

01:24:39.650 --> 01:24:41.460
as well as some decoration

01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:43.590
and he made some decorative
panels for the house.

01:24:43.590 --> 01:24:46.270
And he also did this
for his garden then.

01:24:46.270 --> 01:24:49.650
It really his first major work
was the garden around their house.

01:24:49.650 --> 01:24:51.500
And his mother gave
him that responsibility

01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:53.630
and said she wanted to
him to do the garden.

01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:57.030
And it's a wonderful story
because it had a water feature.

01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:59.930
But for the water feature he
needed a really good rock.

01:24:59.930 --> 01:25:03.480
And everyday he walked
across the neighbor's land

01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:06.890
and on the neighbor's land
there was a beautiful rock.

01:25:06.890 --> 01:25:08.590
And so he tells the story.

01:25:08.590 --> 01:25:09.890
It's just a lovely story.

01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:13.670
So he stole the rock and made
it a part of his water feature.

01:25:13.670 --> 01:25:17.230
And he said that as long as they
were in that house everyday,

01:25:17.230 --> 01:25:21.930
he feared that the neighbor would
come over and recognize the rock.

01:25:21.930 --> 01:25:25.530
Now Noguchi even at eight was
a sort of person who thought

01:25:25.530 --> 01:25:28.390 position:56%
that people recognize specific rocks

01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:30.970
because he recognized
specific rocks.

01:25:30.970 --> 01:25:33.490
He recognized the quality
of this rock.

01:25:33.490 --> 01:25:36.730
And so from his point of view he
had stolen this neighbor's greatest

01:25:36.730 --> 01:25:41.580
treasure to make the center piece
of his garden and he would continue

01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:45.370
to do that as we saw with the
Chase Manhattan sunken garden.

01:25:45.370 --> 01:25:48.110
He bought all that rock
before he had the job.

01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:53.580
And then he used it as leverage to
guilt his friend, the architect,

01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:57.470
into making sure that he got the
job, because he's already taken all

01:25:57.470 --> 01:26:01.960
of this rock out of Uji
River to do the commission.

01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:03.570
So he was thinking about
it for a long time.

01:26:03.570 --> 01:26:08.080
And the school only, you know, it
only increased and the clock case

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:11.340
that I mentioned called
"Measured Time" was a commission

01:26:11.340 --> 01:26:16.900
from that man, Ed Grimley who
was his first great mentor

01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:18.850
and really supported him.

01:26:18.850 --> 01:26:22.560
Noguchi was a genius for
biting the hand that fed him.

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:26.350
He designed this case for
Grimley and it was a big success

01:26:26.350 --> 01:26:27.660
but it was a high price point

01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:30.320
because it's a very
sophisticated shape in Bakelite.

01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:33.250
It was expensive to make and
Grimley said, "This is so great,

01:26:33.250 --> 01:26:34.550
we're making tens of thousands.

01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:35.850
They're selling.

01:26:35.850 --> 01:26:37.200
We want to do a cheaper version."

01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:41.180 position:56%
Grimley's vision was this was the
very first timer clock for the home.

01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:45.080
So for timing your Turkey it
had a 2 hour timer, wind timer,

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:49.550
and it was based on timer
clocks from industry, you know,

01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:53.010
clocking clockout clocks which
were very, very accurate,

01:26:53.010 --> 01:26:56.290 position:56%
they were the most accurate ones
going, so he repackaged one of those

01:26:56.290 --> 01:27:00.150
for he home to go on every
stove in America, again,

01:27:00.150 --> 01:27:04.250 position:56%
[inaudible] thinking, efficiency and
improving the home and all of that.

01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:07.210
So Noguchi designed this
case, so Grimley asked him,

01:27:07.210 --> 01:27:10.310
"Can you design another one
that's less expensive to produce?"

01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:12.260
And then there's like all this
humming and hanging, you know,

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:15.390
weather, like maybe kind
of possibly square-ish.

01:27:15.390 --> 01:27:18.140
And Noguchi wrote back to
him and said not only no,

01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:21.070
but hell no anybody
could make you a box.

01:27:21.070 --> 01:27:22.460
I won't do it.

01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:26.230
Maybe if you let me go back to the
original one I can make it better

01:27:26.230 --> 01:27:28.450
because Grimley had n
to let him model it.

01:27:28.450 --> 01:27:31.260
He'd had to draw it and then
it was produced from drawings.

01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:33.490
But he really wanted
to hand model it.

01:27:33.490 --> 01:27:36.410
So he offered to improve it, which
surely would've made it like two

01:27:36.410 --> 01:27:38.210
or three times as expensive.

01:27:38.210 --> 01:27:42.690
Sorry that was another
long digression

01:27:42.690 --> 01:27:46.100
but Noguchi is full great stories.

01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:47.840
Thank you again.
