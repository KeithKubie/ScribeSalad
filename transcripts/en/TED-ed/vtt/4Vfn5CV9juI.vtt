00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:10.711
Living with her family high above the ground

00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:13.720
in the northern tropical forests of Colombia,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.800
you will find Shakira,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.557
a cotton-top tamarin with a penchant for conversation.

00:00:19.557 --> 00:00:22.159
Say, "Hola!"

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:23.732
Though you may not realize it,

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:25.546
this one pound monkey communicates

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:27.821
in a highly sophisticated language

00:00:27.821 --> 00:00:30.379
of 38 distinct calls

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:35.676
based on variations of chirps and whistles.

00:00:35.676 --> 00:00:37.133
The response she just gave is

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.649
known as a "B chirp",

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.422
a call often directed at humans.

00:00:41.422 --> 00:00:44.356
To appreciate the complexities of Shakira's language,

00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:47.062
let's learn a few chirps and whistles,

00:00:47.062 --> 00:00:49.107
then examine how their combinations

00:00:49.107 --> 00:00:52.400
form grammatically structured sequences.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.651
The chirp Shakira used to greet us

00:00:54.651 --> 00:00:56.708
comes from a class of calls known as

00:00:56.708 --> 00:01:00.067
single frequency modulated syllables.

00:01:00.067 --> 00:01:04.057
This class is made up of short duration calls, or chirps,

00:01:04.057 --> 00:01:11.097
and long duration calls, like screams and squeals.

00:01:11.097 --> 00:01:13.457
Researchers have determined that there are eight

00:01:13.457 --> 00:01:15.809
different types of chirps categorized by

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:22.116
stem upsweep, duration, peak frequency, and frequency change.

00:01:22.116 --> 00:01:25.868
In addition, each chirp has its own unique meaning.

00:01:25.868 --> 00:01:30.467
For example, Shakira's "C chirp" is used

00:01:30.467 --> 00:01:32.352
when she is approaching food,

00:01:32.352 --> 00:01:36.770
where as her "D chirp" is only used

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.251
when she has the food in hand.

00:01:39.251 --> 00:01:43.297
Single whistles also exhibit a unique intention with each call

00:01:43.297 --> 00:01:45.475
and just as there are eight different chirps,

00:01:45.475 --> 00:01:47.656
there are five different whistles.

00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:49.328
Based on frequency modulation,

00:01:49.328 --> 00:01:53.162
single whistles are subdivided into four categories:

00:01:53.162 --> 00:01:59.616
squeaks, initially modulated whistles,

00:01:59.616 --> 00:02:05.718
terminally modulated whistles, and flat whistles.

00:02:05.718 --> 00:02:07.736
The language's quality of unique intention

00:02:07.736 --> 00:02:09.713
is wonderfully exemplified by the category

00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:12.463
of initially modulated whistles.

00:02:12.463 --> 00:02:14.695
These whistles change based on the proximity

00:02:14.695 --> 00:02:17.954
of Shakira to other members of her family.

00:02:17.954 --> 00:02:21.018
If Shakira is greater than .6 meters from her family,

00:02:21.018 --> 00:02:25.768
she'll sound a large initally modulated whistle.

00:02:25.768 --> 00:02:28.573
But if she's less than .6 meters from her family,

00:02:28.573 --> 00:02:33.071
she'll sound a small initially modulated whistle.

00:02:33.071 --> 00:02:35.069
Now that we've learned a few chirps and whistles,

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.309
Shakira wants to show off by taking you

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:40.804
through a quick day in her life with these calls.

00:02:40.804 --> 00:02:44.076
While heading towards a feeding tree for her first meal of the day,

00:02:44.076 --> 00:02:46.611
she says, (monkey noise),

00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:50.583
a call most often used in relaxed investigations.

00:02:50.583 --> 00:02:54.499
However, suddenly she spots the shadow of a hawk.

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:57.039
"E chirp" for alarm.

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:00.362
This call alerts her family to the presence of this predator,

00:03:00.362 --> 00:03:03.531
and Shakira jumps to the safety of an inner branch.

00:03:03.531 --> 00:03:05.141
The coast seems clear,

00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:07.751
so Shakira makes her way towards her dad.

00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:09.429
Wait, wait. Who is that?

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:12.130
Ah, it's her younger brother, Carlos.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.452
Cotton-top tamarins often squeal during play wrestling.

00:03:15.452 --> 00:03:21.243
Uh-oh. He's playing a little too roughly, and Shakira screams,

00:03:21.243 --> 00:03:23.478
alerting her parents to help her.

00:03:23.478 --> 00:03:26.396
Her dad makes his way towards the ball of rolling fur

00:03:26.396 --> 00:03:28.036
and her brother stops.

00:03:28.036 --> 00:03:29.219
Shakira shakes herself

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:31.210
and scratches herself to get the hair on her head

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.055
back in place.

00:03:33.055 --> 00:03:36.714
Then Shakira spots another group of unfamiliar tamarins

00:03:36.714 --> 00:03:39.205
and hears their normal long call.

00:03:39.205 --> 00:03:42.981
She turns to her family. (Monkey noise)

00:03:42.981 --> 00:03:47.079
Did you catch that? First there was a chirp, then a whistle.

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.074
This is what's known as a combination vocalization,

00:03:50.074 --> 00:03:53.758
a phrase that contains both a chirp and a whistle.

00:03:53.758 --> 00:03:57.739
These are two calls strung together to convey a message.

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.922
The combination of these two elements

00:03:59.922 --> 00:04:02.455
alerts her family to the presence of another group,

00:04:02.455 --> 00:04:05.964
the "F chirp", and the distance they are away,

00:04:05.964 --> 00:04:07.826
the normal long call whistle.

00:04:07.826 --> 00:04:11.073
In other words, Shakira just said a sentence.

00:04:11.073 --> 00:04:14.280
Her simple demonstration is just the tip of the iceberg.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.715
She's got trills, chatters, multiple whistle calls,

00:04:18.715 --> 00:04:23.390
more combination vocalizations, even twitters.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.060
Yet sadly enough, we may not get to hear

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.324
everything she has to say.

00:04:28.324 --> 00:04:31.289
Mixed in with chirping sonatas from high above

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.056
is the constant thud of a machete chopping trees.

00:04:35.056 --> 00:04:37.855
Shakira's habitat in Colombia is being cut down,

00:04:37.855 --> 00:04:39.466
piece by piece,

00:04:39.466 --> 00:04:40.814
and if we don't work to protect

00:04:40.814 --> 00:04:43.331
the critically endangered cotton-top tamarin,

00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:46.089
it will become extinct in our lifetime.

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:48.099
If the chirp from one tamarin to the next

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:51.030
has proven to be more than just idle chit chat,

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.793
imagine what else we have left to discover.

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:56.294
Imagine what else Shakira can tell us.
