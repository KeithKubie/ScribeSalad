00:00:00.131 --> 00:00:02.990
(clanging)

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.980
- [Narrator] Over the
course of human history,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.065
fuel for industry has come in many forms.

00:00:08.065 --> 00:00:11.010
But one of the major
drivers of development

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.730
in the current technological age

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.440
is a highly volatile element

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.113
that makes up only .002%
of the Earth's crust.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.249
Such a rare commodity has
become the bedrock of industry

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:27.433
and may be the key to the
future of civilization.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.060
Lithium, a soft, silver gray metal

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.745
is the third lightest
element in the universe.

00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:40.600
Originally discovered in 1817
in a piece of volcanic stone,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.049
lithium was named after the
Greek word for stone, lithos.

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:47.060
Every since its discovery,

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.490
lithium has been found to
be incredibly versatile

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.110
including strengthening glass

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.340
and refining metal alloys

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.070
but probably the most
popular use of lithium

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.803
is in lithium batteries.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.660
Holding a charge for longer
than traditional batteries,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.550
lithium batteries are often used

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.163
to power devices as small
as smartphones and laptops

00:01:08.163 --> 00:01:11.123
and as large as electric vehicles.

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:15.790
The versatility of lithium

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.069
has helped catapult many
technological developments

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:23.069
largely due to the metal's
unique chemical properties.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.028
Lithium is classified as an alkali metal.

00:01:26.028 --> 00:01:27.870
When combined with water,

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.640
the metal forms alkalis or chemicals

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.120
that stabilize acidic solutions.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.170
Additionally, lithium is heat resistant,

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.660
having extraordinarily high
melting and boiling points

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.830
causing it to be capable of
storing large amounts of energy.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.340
Lithium is also highly reactive

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.860
in that it readily loses
one of its electrons

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.083
to form new bonds, thereby
creating a positive charge.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.590
All together these
properties allow the metal

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.380
to serve as the receiving point

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.690
of negatively charged particles

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.280
helping create a powerful
electrical current

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.873
in lithium batteries.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.870
But because of lithium's reactivity,

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.530
it does not naturally occur

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.333
in its pure elemental metal form.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.890
It's often found as a
component of chemical compounds

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.401
and sourced from hard rock minerals,

00:02:22.401 --> 00:02:27.401
sea water or salt water
reservoirs called brines.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.460
Lithium deposits are
scattered around the globe

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.640
but over 75% of the world's
entire supply of lithium

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.693
is found in Chile and Bolivia.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.160
Within the past few decades,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.270
the presence of lithium in
these South American countries

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.500
has drawn the attention of
federal and commercial entities

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.140
from around the world

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.740
hoping to extract one of
the most sought-after,

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.863
natural resources on the planet.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.890
By extracting a natural
resource as valuable as lithium,

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.700
these entities may fuel and help shape

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.723
the future of technology and industry.
