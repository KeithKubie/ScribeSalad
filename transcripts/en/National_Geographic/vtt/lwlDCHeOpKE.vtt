( intro music )

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:07.941
( audience applause )

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:09.275 line:0%
Hello everybody.

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:10.576 line:0%
Thank you for coming.

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:14.613
<i>The story I'll tell you tonight.
 What is that story?</i>

00:00:14.613 --> 00:00:16.516
<i> Well, it's about the
 evolution of diet.</i>

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:19.985
<i> About our ancestral ties
 to the food we eat.</i>

00:00:19.985 --> 00:00:21.654
<i> And it's easier said
 than done because</i>

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:23.556
trying to find
places in the world

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:25.525
where market food is
not affecting our

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.226
way of eating is
quite difficult.

00:00:27.226 --> 00:00:30.296
<i> So, Afghanistan...
 when you look at the map</i>

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:32.264
<i> there is an area that was
 never touched by war.</i>

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:34.099
<i> It's called the
 Wakhan Corridor.</i>

00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:36.436
<i> And at the end of it
 is a high altitude</i>

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.805
<i> plateau that is very
 difficult to reach.</i>

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:43.175 line:0%
<i>On this plateau there is Kyrgyz
community of about 1,500 people</i>

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:46.145 line:0%
<i> living at 14,000 feet,
 all year round.</i>

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:47.480 line:0%
<i> You might as well
 be on the moon.</i>

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.615
<i> You know you are way
 above tree line</i>

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:52.652
<i> Nothing grows except grass
 and two tiny things</i>

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:55.754
<i> in summer for about a
 month-month and a half.</i>

00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:58.224
<i> You will get rhubarb
 and white onions.</i>

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.526
If you are vegetarian,
it will be a slow death.

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:01.861
( audience laughter )

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:03.863
<i> And so grass feeds
 the animal,</i>

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:06.633
<i> the Kyrgyz are
 pastoralist nomads.</i>

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:08.601
<i> So they have yaks,
 they have goat,</i>

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:10.670
<i> they have sheep,
 they are pastoralists.</i>

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.904
<i> They live off their herds.</i>

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:13.172
<i>This is what makes them survive</i>

00:01:13.172 --> 00:01:15.341
<i> in this desert
 like environment.</i>

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:18.577
<i> Of course milk is a big
 part of their diet</i>

00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:22.281
<i> Any dairies and a lot of side
 product as well from milk.</i>

00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:24.951
<i> They have a great
 intimacy with the</i>

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:27.687
<i> animal world that
 really touched me.</i>

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:29.122
They even talk to each other
in the way

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.423
they would talk
to their horses.

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:31.591
It was quite
surprising at first

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:32.792
when people whistle
to call for my

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:34.527
attention I was,
"hey, I am not your horse"

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:36.195
but that's how it is.

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:38.231
Such an intimacy
that if you want

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:40.533
<i> you can even go and
 check your camel's teeth.</i>

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:41.901
( audience laughter )

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:44.470
<i> It was a little,
 young camel who was</i>

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.172
<i> nibbling on everything
 he could see.</i>

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:47.272
<i> Quite lovely.</i>

00:01:47.272 --> 00:01:48.874
<i> Division of labor is often,</i>

00:01:48.874 --> 00:01:50.809
<i> the young boys will
 learn how to</i>

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:52.678
<i> herd the yaks with slingshot.</i>

00:01:52.678 --> 00:01:54.280
<i> You see he is holding
 a slingshot.</i>

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.582
<i> You just whip away and
 scare off the yaks.</i>

00:01:56.582 --> 00:01:58.884
<i> The girls go and get water
 or milk the animal.</i>

00:01:58.884 --> 00:02:00.252
<i> Getting water is not simple.</i>

00:02:00.252 --> 00:02:01.787
<i> You don't turn on the
 faucet there.</i>

00:02:01.787 --> 00:02:04.557
<i> These are three daughters
 of the Hun,</i>

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:07.293
<i> the tribal chief of that
 community of people.</i>

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.829
<i> And they go up in the morning,
at you know, quite early morning</i>

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.296
<i> and they are going
 to get water.</i>

00:02:11.296 --> 00:02:13.832
<i> And getting water
 means breaking ice,</i>

00:02:13.832 --> 00:02:16.002
<i> finding the place
 where the spring was</i>

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:17.536
<i> breaking the ice,
 getting water,</i>

00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:18.871
<i> bringing it back to camp.</i>

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:21.106
<i> Meaning going back
 to the "yurt".</i>

00:02:21.106 --> 00:02:24.777
<i> The yurt is like the
quintessential nomadic habitat.</i>

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:27.947
<i> It's made of felt, so it
 comes out of the animal.</i>

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:30.949
<i> Outside it's very barren
 and you enter this yurts</i>

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:32.218
<i> and it's just full of colors.</i>

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:33.786
<i> It's really impressive,
 the contrast</i>

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:36.089
<i> between this outside
 and this inside.</i>

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.524
<i> And so you make tea.
 You make tea with milk</i>

00:02:38.524 --> 00:02:40.927
<i> and with milk you
 often boil it in</i>

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:43.062
<i> this big pots you
 can see here.</i>

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:45.665
<i> She's straining the milk
 into the pot.</i>

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:48.067
She's going to boil it
on slow fire

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:51.236
over dung fire usually
because nothing grows there

00:02:51.236 --> 00:02:53.406
so they use dry dung to cook.

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:55.675
<i> And then you'll get this
 kind of curd.</i>

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:58.444
<i> And they let it dry on
 the roof of the yurts or</i>

00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:00.813
<i> sometime on this rattan
 things outside</i>

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:03.882
<i> and it will become
 hard as stone,
 like real stone.</i>

00:03:03.882 --> 00:03:05.518
<i> It's not an expression
 hard as stone.</i>

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:07.019
You need another
stone to break it.

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.522
And this milk, this...

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:12.958
"Kurut", it's called,
will be used in winter

00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.061
when the animals don't
give so much milk.

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:17.463
<i> They also make butter
 that they some time</i>

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:20.099
<i> keep in the stomach
 of a sheep.</i>

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.534
<i> It preserves really well
 and it's easy to transport</i>

00:03:22.534 --> 00:03:25.304
<i> and it's very highly prized
 in that part of the world.</i>

00:03:25.304 --> 00:03:27.740
<i> So that would be
 your typical meal.</i>

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.475
<i> Slices of butter,
 milk tea with</i>

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:31.577
<i> salt in it often
 and then "naan".</i>

00:03:31.577 --> 00:03:33.579
<i> Naan is the flat
 bread you see here.</i>

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:34.981
So then you tell me,
"where the hell

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:36.682
do they get flour to
make naan?"

00:03:36.682 --> 00:03:38.484
I say, "hold on, I'll show you."

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:39.318
So it's easy--

00:03:39.318 --> 00:03:40.920
( audience laughter )

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.322
It's very easy.
You go down to your
Whole Foods store,

00:03:43.322 --> 00:03:45.057
the organic one,
you know.

00:03:45.057 --> 00:03:46.092
Seriously.

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:48.027
<i> So you get on yaks,</i>

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:50.596
<i> you bring all your friends,
 you get a bunch of guys</i>

00:03:50.596 --> 00:03:53.199
<i> pile up the yak with stuff,
 you take some</i>

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.102
<i> extra yaks and you
 go for long walk.</i>

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:57.936
<i> Two times in winter,
 in summer maybe</i>

00:03:57.936 --> 00:03:59.906
<i> two-three times
 and you go down.</i>

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.473
<i> In winter it means going
 over a frozen river.</i>

00:04:01.473 --> 00:04:03.209
<i> That's the only way
 in and out of the</i>

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.111
<i> high altitude plateau
 where they live.</i>

00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:07.914
In 2008, when I went in
winter the place had not

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:10.883
been visited by a
foreigner since 37 years.

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:12.251
The last time people
were there...

00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:14.354
foreigners, was in 1972.

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:15.855
That's how remote
that place is.

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:18.057
<i> You sleep on your
 way in camps or in</i>

00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:19.892
<i> shepherd huts or in
 caves like this.</i>

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:21.994
<i> And then you might drop
 your iPhone in a cave.</i>

00:04:21.994 --> 00:04:24.029
( audience laughter )

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:25.965
<i> He was looking for water,
 didn't get any.</i>

00:04:25.965 --> 00:04:28.601
<i> We melted snow and
 make some tea.</i>

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:31.136
<i> You change your yak.
 So, you go with 20 yaks,</i>

00:04:31.136 --> 00:04:33.339
you'd come back
with 15, for example.

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:37.010
<i> You trade, you barter your
 five yaks for flour,</i>

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.080
for cigarettes, for matches,
for candies whatever

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.250
mostly flour and then you
load it back up and go back.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.884
<i> Look at that how
 much work that is</i>

00:04:45.884 --> 00:04:48.087
<i> just to get flour
 for your community.</i>

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:49.756
<i> It's a harsh environment.</i>

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:52.325
<i> This girl just walked in
 after herding her animals</i>

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:54.661
<i> her cheeks are burned
 by the cold,
 it's not make up.</i>

00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:57.463
<i> They use everything
 on the animal.</i>

00:04:57.463 --> 00:05:00.966
<i> You kill the goat, you gather
 the blood that you might cook</i>

00:05:00.966 --> 00:05:03.068
<i> And you eat
 absolutely everything</i>

00:05:03.068 --> 00:05:07.072
<i> you singe the head on fire,
 you'll boil the head.</i>

00:05:07.072 --> 00:05:08.541
<i> You know,
 apart from the horns you'll</i>

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:10.510
empty the bones
to eat the marrow

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.145
then you throw it
out and the dogs

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:14.080
around camp will
finish this thing.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.915
So there is no waste,
you can't afford waste.

00:05:16.915 --> 00:05:18.650
Then you get presented
as a guest with

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.819
<i> this beautiful
 platter right here.</i>

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:22.654
<i> And if you're a knowledgeable
 guest you know that</i>

00:05:22.654 --> 00:05:24.390
<i> what you're going to get
 is right in the middle.</i>

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.859
<i> You see that white area,
 they really go for the fat.</i>

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:29.795
<i> The fat is highly prized.
It's the glory of the shepherd.</i>

00:05:29.795 --> 00:05:31.563
<i> He brought his herd
 to the best-fed</i>

00:05:31.563 --> 00:05:34.299
<i> grass to get this
 very fat tail mutton.</i>

00:05:34.299 --> 00:05:35.768
<i> These are called
 fat tail mutton.</i>

00:05:35.768 --> 00:05:37.303
<i> You learn to love that.</i>

00:05:37.303 --> 00:05:39.372
You know, sure they have to
exercise themselves so much

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:42.041
it's such a cold environment,
it's a totally logical thing.

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:44.644
<i> So there I am with
 my red jacket</i>

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:47.846
<i> trying to gulp down an eye of
 a goat, I think they gave me.</i>

00:05:47.846 --> 00:05:49.649
That gave me my nickname
when I was there.

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:52.752
I was called<i> Koz Jede</i>
which means eye-eater.

00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:54.487
But they would-- the kids
would be really scared

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:55.687
when the older one
would be like,

00:05:55.687 --> 00:05:57.323
"hey, watch out this eye-eater
is coming over there."

00:05:57.323 --> 00:05:59.025
( audience laughter )

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:03.529
<i> So, you know, this is
 tea time among Kyrgyz.</i>

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:04.964
You walk out and
the girls are just

00:06:04.964 --> 00:06:07.300
munching on what's
left over from lunch.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.034
They love meat.

00:06:09.034 --> 00:06:10.570
( speaking in Kyrgyz )

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:13.406
( whistling )

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:16.676
( sound of wind blowing )

00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:27.120
( sheep bleating )

00:07:02.855 --> 00:07:05.191
( elderly woman
singing in Kyrgyz )

00:07:16.802 --> 00:07:20.773
( sound of water flowing )

00:07:28.747 --> 00:07:30.850
( speaking in Kyrgyz )
