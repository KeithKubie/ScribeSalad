1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.600
Well might bring notes. No, sometimes you remember things.

2
00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:08.601
Boom and we're live sometimes like I have to remember things like if there's a

3
00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:10.260
thought that popped in my head or something,

4
00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:14.550
I just forgot I need to write things now. Too many ideas to slip away.

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.700
They slip away. But one thing you said a while ago,

6
00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:21.840
which I've tried to start using the voice memos on my phone and I'm not very

7
00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:24.510
good at it. You say you record straight. That's probably a good time.

8
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.670
It's really good. I'm trying to make it fun.

9
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.960
I've got like an old school Elvis microphone and like a 1950s style cord into an

10
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:34.590
old recorder and I'm trying to use that a bit more because we were talking about

11
00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:37.380
hunter s Thompson. I liked the idea of recording stuff as I'm moving,

12
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:40.230
but it's a habit I'm not getting into right now.

13
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.100
I think recording anything, like when you have an idea that you go, goddammit,

14
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.350
this is a good idea. Like grab it, grab it.

15
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.550
I think as Neal Brennan said it best that he looks at his notebook like a net

16
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.510
for catching ideas. I like that. I love that. Why am I always driving though?

17
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.830
I'm always drivers. Always. Cause I think when you're in the zone,

18
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.410
like you driving, there's something about like you,

19
00:01:05.411 --> 00:01:08.280
you know how sometimes you could be like miles away and you're like,

20
00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:12.960
how the fuck did I get here? Like you're sober. Yeah. That's terrifying.

21
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.850
And you're like, how did I drive miles? I evidently changed lanes. I,

22
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:22.500
you know, I know where I'm going. Everything was in inside the lanes but I was,

23
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.930
I'm barely there. What is that? I don't know. I don't know.

24
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.650
You get in the zone cause you're so accustomed to doing it and you're tuning in

25
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.350
to everybody around you and sometimes you probably are better driver when you're

26
00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:34.200
doing that because you're not being conscious. You just, just,

27
00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:38.400
just being aware and just being in the moment, feeling the road. Yes.

28
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.840
Being present. It's very nice.

29
00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:42.810
But my best ideas come then and have no way to record them.

30
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.940
But I think it's because you're in that weird mind state.

31
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:49.080
A lot of people also get the same thing when they walk. Um, a lot of writers,

32
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.800
what they like to do is they like to write and then they like to go on walks and

33
00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:56.820
think about the writing and the idea is that when you're on the walk you just

34
00:01:56.821 --> 00:01:57.990
get, you know, left right,

35
00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:00.780
left getting a little bit of cardio and going up hills and you,

36
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:02.150
all you're thinking about is your,

37
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.420
you're like breathing and you're moving and those eyes just sort of bounce

38
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:09.570
around the back your head and get washed like during a washing machine.

39
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.910
Like what, what's in there? Like a filtration system.

40
00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:13.430
Just kind shaking him through. Yeah,

41
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.890
because you're not doing anything else other than walking. Right.

42
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.450
You just walk in and the ideas are just bouncing around in there or running the

43
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.520
same thing. Again, you must find that an idea pops in my head and I'm like,

44
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:26.880
I'm definitely going to be remembering this and next thing I'm into bowls to the

45
00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:31.680
wall and dad dead and then it's gone. It's gone forever. Anyway. Yeah.

46
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.530
Mitch Hedberg had a funny joke about that.

47
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.950
If he keeps a note by note pad by his bed,

48
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.670
because every now and then like he'll have some sort of an idea that he needs to

49
00:02:41.671 --> 00:02:44.070
write down. Or if you don't have a notepad,

50
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.610
I have to pretend that it wasn't a good idea. I'm paraphrasing.

51
00:02:47.611 --> 00:02:49.020
I did a terrible job paraphrasing.

52
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:52.860
I couldn't remember exactly how it was worded, but it's like, yeah, that thing,

53
00:02:52.861 --> 00:02:55.810
like ideas are strange, man. I entertained for awhile.

54
00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.090
The idea that ideas were life forms that because a,

55
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.240
we don't think of them like, look, there's a lot of different life forms, right?

56
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.691
I mean,

57
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:09.691
there's squids and there's chimps and there's barracudas and there's hawks.

58
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:13.150
There's a lot of different life forms. There's insects. I mean,

59
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.670
it's a lot of different ones. Wood,

60
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.110
if that's what ideas were and that what they're doing is just making their way.

61
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:22.960
And the more you nourish them, the more they grow,

62
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.870
the more you pay attention to them, the more they,

63
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:30.871
they propagate your out your head with new ideas and then you take action on

64
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:34.630
those ideas and it creates everything the world's ever seen that humans have

65
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:38.680
created. All that stuff comes from ideas, everything from cars to buildings,

66
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:41.980
to planes, all that comes from ideas. 100% of it,

67
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.180
but yet we don't even think about what the ideas are like what the fuck is that?

68
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.810
You just get some random new way of looking at things.

69
00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:54.811
What is happening is this is just pure calculation or are you interacting with

70
00:03:55.751 --> 00:03:59.710
some sneaky little influencer that wants to give you credit for it? Like, God,

71
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:02.780
Dan Hardy, you're so smart with these ideas. You should,

72
00:04:02.781 --> 00:04:05.950
you know what you should do should build that build. And then you're like,

73
00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:07.690
I'm gonna build this fucking building.

74
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.530
I'm gonna ride hardy right on the side of it. God dammit. And you'd do it all.

75
00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:15.610
And Gold. Like, where is that coming from? We owe the ego. Oh, you know,

76
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:20.611
men in the toxic masculinity and their desire for building things may be,

77
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.610
or maybe ideas made that dude build that thing. Maybe.

78
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.640
Maybe ideas were so clever the way they got you and talk to you like a siren,

79
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:32.230
pulling you into the rocks. Come on already.

80
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.320
Build that fucking building and go and do it. I'm into it all. USC,

81
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.310
subscribe it to the idea. The idea is all collective,

82
00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:43.090
so when you have an ideas that have the ideas available to other people in the

83
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:45.580
world, if they're tuned in to be able to collect the idea,

84
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.360
I think it's entirely possible that a lot of people are thinking exactly the

85
00:04:49.361 --> 00:04:51.100
same way you think when you're thinking.

86
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.700
I think that there's a lot of fucking people thinking right now and there's a

87
00:04:57.011 --> 00:05:02.011
lot of sharing information through podcasts and and Twitter and Facebook and

88
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.220
youtube videos and all the different things that people are doing and it,

89
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.010
it's not outside the realm of possibility that we share some sort of common

90
00:05:14.051 --> 00:05:16.120
thread psychically,

91
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.420
you know that there's some connection that we have with each other.

92
00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:22.210
We know we'd like to be around each other, right? Like logically,

93
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:25.120
I'm not talking woo. People like to be around each other.

94
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.170
When you hear someone talk about, Oh, I'm just alone, or I want to be by myself,

95
00:05:29.171 --> 00:05:32.890
like [inaudible] fucked up person. Like most people,

96
00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:36.490
I mean not for a little bit of time. For a reset. Miss your friends. Yeah.

97
00:05:36.491 --> 00:05:39.160
That's wonderful. That's a good idea. It's probably really healthy,

98
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.230
but like those people that liked them,

99
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.670
Ted Kaczynski type dudes just want to just moved to the middle of nowhere and

100
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.820
bind themselves and be a fucking nomad. Like, hmm. Why?

101
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.880
Most of us don't want that. Most of us want to be around each other. Well,

102
00:05:51.881 --> 00:05:54.700
how come? Well, we feel good and it's like a little drug.

103
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.910
We feel good around our friends and our loved ones. We could,

104
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.890
<v 1>we feel good. Like there's something happening here. Right?</v>

105
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.720
So there's an exchange of information.

106
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.520
<v 2>Yes, but I have to manage that because I, it exhausts me.</v>

107
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.050
You know what I mean? You did a two of the spots,

108
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.250
the podcasts that you've done with Henry Rollins that I've listened to have just

109
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.500
blown my mind. Awesome.

110
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.590
And there are so many things that he sees that of that's he's my spirit animal.

111
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:21.950
I think there's a voice inside my head that is Henry Rollins and some of the

112
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:24.890
things he says, it just resonates with me.

113
00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:29.510
And the idea of being around people a lot of the time is just exhausting.

114
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.540
I like to be able to pull away and that's when I feel I'm my my best for like

115
00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:35.180
four hours a day. I can give like a lot of energy.

116
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.590
<v 1>Yeah, no, you definitely need a balance of it,</v>

117
00:06:37.591 --> 00:06:39.570
but you don't want to be completely absent of it.

118
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.600
What it is is it's some in some way or another,

119
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.730
we feed off of each other good and bad, right? And good people,

120
00:06:47.731 --> 00:06:49.290
people that you enjoy being around,

121
00:06:49.291 --> 00:06:53.400
you feed off them in a very positive way and it's very fulfilling and addicting

122
00:06:53.401 --> 00:06:56.040
and you want to do what they do and you want to help each other and you won't

123
00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:57.870
want to like feed off of each other. Y'All want to help.

124
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.070
It was a powerful community where you love each other and then there's people

125
00:07:02.071 --> 00:07:03.960
that are super negative too, you know?

126
00:07:03.961 --> 00:07:07.980
And if it's all about what kind of current,

127
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.900
what kind of circles do you traveling?

128
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.760
If you get fucked over as a child and you just get tossed into a bad circle

129
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.500
really early on, that's one of the primary causes for life sucking,

130
00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:24.450
right? You're a kid and you're born in a shit situation with abusive people.

131
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:30.030
Abusive neighborhood danger, crime, fuck man.

132
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.340
Right from the jump. Just fucked over.

133
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.000
<v 2>Changed your perspective for life changes the way that you interact with people</v>

134
00:07:36.001 --> 00:07:39.270
all the way through your life because of, you know, yeah. Those early beliefs.

135
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:44.090
<v 1>It's crazy that so little is done to stop that.</v>

136
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:49.070
So little is done to mitigate that in terms of like how much effort is put into

137
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.520
trying to ensure that people are educated or or or somehow or another weed.

138
00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.120
There's no real to explain to someone what it's like to be a parent until you're

139
00:08:02.121 --> 00:08:05.030
a parent. Yeah, you can talk about it til you're blue in the face,

140
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.680
but if you're talking to crazy people,

141
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:10.190
you're never going to know how good they are at it anyway. Like how,

142
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.430
like if you take someone who's like a crazy abusive person,

143
00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:15.650
what words could you ever say to that person?

144
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.380
Stop them from being crazy or abusive or there,

145
00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:20.960
is there a string of words that you can say,

146
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:25.220
well you could convey the way you feel about it in a way that would cause them

147
00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:27.320
to go, wow, I should probably stop being a piece of shit.

148
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.470
<v 2>I Dunno. I think it's, you know,</v>

149
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.980
it's zero to six in that it's those first six years is when you,

150
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.740
when you develop patterns that influence you for the rest of your life,

151
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:39.280
it's like the program that's embedded in you. And like, from that point on,

152
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:40.690
all of the decisions you make,

153
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:45.190
all of the relationships you develop that put through that filtration system of

154
00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.140
those first three, first six years of your life.

155
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.770
And I mean this is where psychedelics have have helped me be, you know,

156
00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:55.290
be able to go back and like unpack some of that stuff and try and figure out

157
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.020
what influence man and like, you know, memories that you're like,

158
00:08:58.021 --> 00:09:01.590
you bury down that you don't, you don't remember for the rest of your life.

159
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.320
They'll influence decision making all the way through your life.

160
00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.430
<v 0>Yeah. You know,</v>

161
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.360
you have to like those and there's little memories that little little pit stops.

162
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.950
Like they, they, they exist. No matter what you do.

163
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:16.540
He'd be in the middle of doing something.

164
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.420
You go back to some weird regret you have when you're 18 you go, ugh,

165
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:22.210
what are you doing there?

166
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.410
<v 2>Do you ever have those moments now though, where you,</v>

167
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.530
there's a moment where you stop and you think that that was a significant

168
00:09:27.531 --> 00:09:30.650
moment. Like I've just experienced a significant moment in my life.

169
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.380
There's now going to change the way that I think moving forward.

170
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.630
Like you must have a lot of those conversations that you have.

171
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:40.630
<v 0>Yeah. Sometimes in the conversations. Yeah. Um, but I feel like if you've, if,</v>

172
00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:45.200
if you think like that, like it's nice to think like that for a second.

173
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.060
Do like take that in. Wow, that's pretty cool.

174
00:09:47.061 --> 00:09:49.910
But ultimately it doesn't do you any good.

175
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.520
It's like recognizing that you're in this crazy moment.

176
00:09:55.580 --> 00:10:00.530
It's like you, in many ways it's like paralysis by analysis.

177
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.750
Like you're like, oh my God, this is happening.

178
00:10:02.751 --> 00:10:04.370
And then you're just talking about it happening.

179
00:10:04.371 --> 00:10:08.120
But now it's not happening anymore because now you're just talking and now

180
00:10:08.121 --> 00:10:10.910
you've fallen into this, you know, it's just the moment.

181
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:14.300
You got to appreciate it, talk, talk it through. So you're all,

182
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:19.040
y'all get it whenever it was, whenever cool thing it was. But yeah.

183
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:20.443
Um,

184
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:25.510
in terms of like the number of events that you see in your life that shape you

185
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:32.410
and impact you in a way that make you reassess where you're at.

186
00:10:32.481 --> 00:10:37.220
Like as a person, like what life is like those,

187
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.740
uh, those are so critical. And if you don't have those,

188
00:10:39.741 --> 00:10:42.770
if you just have like this flat plain of nothing happening,

189
00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:43.850
going to the same job,

190
00:10:43.851 --> 00:10:48.410
I think that's what makes people fucking go crazy more than almost any other

191
00:10:48.411 --> 00:10:52.880
aspect of this life. It's just monotony and boredom and no,

192
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.050
no thrills, no challenges and not that makes you scared.

193
00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.060
<v 2>Yeah. I, and I think it's difficult to see that when you're in it though, right?</v>

194
00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.550
I think, you know, I think we're both fortunate enough to be in a place,

195
00:11:03.551 --> 00:11:05.110
and I was, I was with a good friend yesterday,

196
00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.480
Tim Hendricks getting tattooed and we were having the same,

197
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:12.040
the same conversation. He's in a place where he's, he's in control of his life.

198
00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.530
You know, he's living in the place that he wants to live.

199
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.760
He said he can walk his kids to school for the next 10 years. You know, he's,

200
00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:21.370
he works in the Tattoo studio that he got his first professional tattoo in.

201
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.550
Like he's living his dream and he's got all these businesses that support what

202
00:11:24.551 --> 00:11:28.310
he's doing. And I, where we're in a similar situation as well.

203
00:11:28.311 --> 00:11:32.860
And I can see all the people around me now that are caught in that monotony and

204
00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:36.970
they can't see it. And this, it's just so difficult to break that.

205
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.440
Do you know what I mean? It's so different.

206
00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.290
<v 0>Difficult, so easy to talk about once you broke through it.</v>

207
00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.230
That's why concepts like the secret of such horse shit,

208
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:50.710
just because you made it [inaudible] like your mind make made you make it.

209
00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.010
Like there's a lot of variables, men like to say that

210
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:58.570
<v 1>you have your finger on the pulse of all the variables that we're in charge of</v>

211
00:11:58.571 --> 00:11:59.680
making you successful.

212
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.670
<v 2>That's so silly. [inaudible] right? You could be a life coach.</v>

213
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.700
What do you think about life coaches? They freak me out. How,

214
00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.820
how can someone coach your life, uh, that well,

215
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.560
dependent upon how much personal experience they've had, that's the problem.

216
00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.590
Hmm. Depends, that's completely dependent upon, cause he,

217
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:21.340
I'd want someone ancient, if I was looking for a life coach,

218
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:26.470
I don't want someone that was like, yeah, at least 90 at least.

219
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:27.941
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

220
00:12:27.941 --> 00:12:32.941
Someone was like a war torn past and wrote poetry and climbed mount.

221
00:12:33.161 --> 00:12:36.420
I said, kill the shark. Different lives.

222
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.600
But it's just most people that are doing that,

223
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.770
this is no disrespect because I think that some of them actually provide some

224
00:12:44.771 --> 00:12:47.530
legitimate fuel. Um,

225
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.430
they give people some words that could encourage them.

226
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.580
And even though they've never really accomplished anything,

227
00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:57.610
they're not necessarily doing anything negative cause they're propagating good

228
00:12:57.611 --> 00:12:58.444
ideas. They're,

229
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:03.160
they're promoting healthy values and healthy ways to live life.

230
00:13:03.161 --> 00:13:07.500
But let's be honest, bitch, you ain't done shit. Like,

231
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.650
it's weird. It's weird to be given advice when you ain't done shit.

232
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:15.250
And some people have done things, some people are legitimate. You know,

233
00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:19.000
some people, uh, like Jocko Willink, you know,

234
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.940
and that guy's giving motivational advice. You know who he is.

235
00:13:21.941 --> 00:13:25.450
You know what he's accomplished as a, as a navy seal, as a martial artist,

236
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:28.690
he's a, he's a chef. He's the real deal.

237
00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.500
And when he talks to people and talks about discipline and you know,

238
00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:36.430
establishing a core relationship between your squad and all the people you work

239
00:13:36.431 --> 00:13:39.130
with, like he's, you really believe it. You buy it.

240
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.830
It's why David Goggins works.

241
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.590
You know that fucking savage is out there running right now.

242
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:47.740
Well while we're talking, he's running down the street.

243
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.950
There's some people want to keep you soft. It's running down the street,

244
00:13:50.951 --> 00:13:52.030
making youtube videos.

245
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.690
There'll be out there for fucking five hours today just running. He's an animal

246
00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:57.340
<v 2>dude. I tell you, I'll be honest though,</v>

247
00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.470
I was in Uruguay at the weekend and like jet like took me out it,

248
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:05.080
it killed me. I don't know why. No Man. I'm pretty good. I fast on the planes.

249
00:14:05.081 --> 00:14:07.870
I don't eat anything when I'm in the air. That's supposed to be a good trip.

250
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:11.200
Right. Works really well. I stopped using it towards the end of my career.

251
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:15.790
It's something about your circadian cycle and you have breakfast in the time and

252
00:14:15.791 --> 00:14:18.790
time zone that you're leaving and then when you arrive in the next place,

253
00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:21.820
you have breakfast at that same time and kind of kicks you over in it and it

254
00:14:21.821 --> 00:14:24.910
works. But for some reason this time it killed me and I'm like,

255
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.270
I'm laying in bed and it's freezing cold South America.

256
00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.260
I just assumed it was going to be warm. It was not warm. It was,

257
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:36.820
it's the southern most capital city in South America. It was freezing cold.

258
00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:41.170
How cold? I Dunno, I don't, I don't do temperatures. It was cold. My foot,

259
00:14:41.171 --> 00:14:44.440
my phone, my face burned. When I stepped outside Christ,

260
00:14:44.441 --> 00:14:47.590
it was called like zero, like zero degrees. Maybe I'm being a pussy,

261
00:14:47.591 --> 00:14:51.650
but it was called. That's how I decided. I mean, you know,

262
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.120
when there's a coastline there,

263
00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:55.940
I always try and make the most of it because I live in the city center.

264
00:14:55.941 --> 00:14:59.420
I live in the Midlands. Like I'm like, you know, I'm nowhere near a coast.

265
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.390
Right? So when I'm near a coast, I want to make the most of it.

266
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.580
But I had no warm training clothes.

267
00:15:04.581 --> 00:15:08.780
So I'm out there running and the reason I was out there running on my lungs felt

268
00:15:08.781 --> 00:15:13.150
like there were bleeding was because you put a Instagram message,

269
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:17.480
Instagram post up saying something about not being lazy and it just, it got me,

270
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:20.570
I was like, I picked it up. It was the first post that came upon Instagram.

271
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:24.290
I was still laying in bed and I was like, I'm a see Joe next week.

272
00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:27.590
I've got to be, I'm going to be inspired in this moment. So thank you.

273
00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.360
<v 1>Well I'm my pleasure. I'm,</v>

274
00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:33.740
I'm very thankful for you and I'm thankful for all those people that there's

275
00:15:33.741 --> 00:15:37.400
legitimate people that make posts like that, that are fuel their mental fuel.

276
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.810
You know like when Goggins makes a post or when Jocko makes a post or my friend

277
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:46.280
Cam Hanes makes a post. I've read those posts and I fucking want to get going.

278
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:49.080
I want to get going cause I know they're getting after it. It's,

279
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:52.400
it sounds so like for people who are not into exercise,

280
00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.500
for people to think that we're macho assholes,

281
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:58.250
this is like an excellent place where you would criticize like, God,

282
00:15:58.251 --> 00:16:01.010
it's so cliche. What are you going to go get after it?

283
00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:06.850
I'm telling you there is great value spiritually and doing something hard for

284
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:11.960
sure. It is. There's something about it. It makes it makes you a better person.

285
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:14.090
Sounds ridiculous,

286
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.840
but all my favorite people can fucking push themselves.

287
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:22.160
All my favorite people work out hard because when they do it,

288
00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.270
it breaks down bullshit better than anything else you can do.

289
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.960
Just breaks down bullshit. You know who you are when you're done.

290
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.820
You know when you bitched out,

291
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:35.840
you know when you've started coasting the last 30 seconds of around, you know,

292
00:16:35.841 --> 00:16:38.690
you know all that man can't lie to yourself.

293
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:44.440
It's the grand exposure of who you are and it only comes during like extreme

294
00:16:44.841 --> 00:16:48.530
duress. It only comes when you're doing something that's hard. It's fuck.

295
00:16:48.531 --> 00:16:52.490
Whether it's Roland Jujitsu or running hills or doing yoga,

296
00:16:52.491 --> 00:16:55.250
it comes in those moments where you want to fucking quit.

297
00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:55.920
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

298
00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.590
It's been a while since I've been in California and I was actually reminiscent

299
00:16:58.591 --> 00:17:01.500
on some of those late night legend sessions back in the day.

300
00:17:01.501 --> 00:17:03.450
Do you remember those days? Those were great.

301
00:17:03.451 --> 00:17:06.300
I even took a drive past the place and I just, these, it's empty.

302
00:17:06.301 --> 00:17:07.230
There's nothing in there now,

303
00:17:07.231 --> 00:17:11.040
but I took a drive past it and I remember like we were in there till like 10 30,

304
00:17:11.041 --> 00:17:14.970
11 o'clock at night. The windows steamed up and they were good nights.

305
00:17:14.971 --> 00:17:15.661
Just that grind.

306
00:17:15.661 --> 00:17:17.940
I'm trying to bring that back because I've just open my own gym,

307
00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:22.570
a hottie wallet. It's my dream of not wanting to, the place we're at. Um,

308
00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:25.860
it's in the Midlands in Coalville near less show like 10 website house.

309
00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.820
You get to Holly Wall at MMA dot Coda.

310
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:30.150
You spell that out because you got an English accent, Bro.

311
00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.100
H A l D Y L W A double l h e a d, uh,

312
00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.300
mma.co. You guys didn't get myself in Jimmy Wallet,

313
00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.530
my longtime friend training partner. So

314
00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:46.440
<v 1>yeah, he's a famous UK MMA fighter. He's a thug. He's a beast. He's beautiful.</v>

315
00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:50.250
Yeah. So that's great man. That's, that's those legend days, man.

316
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.130
<v 0>It's one of those places where I'll drive by getting a stall Jack. I'm like,</v>

317
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.790
aw man. We had fun in that place. Yeah, crazy wars.

318
00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:00.510
It was just such a great place to train and it's such a great environment.

319
00:18:00.511 --> 00:18:03.930
A great gym. They set it up perfectly. It was such a bummer when that went away.

320
00:18:03.931 --> 00:18:07.000
I was like, ah. They were good nights. Yeah, man.

321
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.270
My joy still clicked from your side control pressure.

322
00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:13.680
I would always ask me like, what? So what? What's Joe's,

323
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.350
what's Joe's grappling like? Is it like loads of 10 planets stuff?

324
00:18:16.351 --> 00:18:18.780
I might not really know. He's like fucking ions.

325
00:18:18.781 --> 00:18:22.080
People out into the canvas with these entities shoulders and he's like,

326
00:18:22.081 --> 00:18:26.220
people don't get you strong top game. And I always think back to it. Sorry Dude,

327
00:18:26.221 --> 00:18:30.390
I got to click kid y'all. That's not for me. That was from the telcos.

328
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:34.240
Condit fight. That was from a VDI though. You got v toward yeah.

329
00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:38.160
You sparred with V tour? Yeah, quite a bit. Why didn't you call me?

330
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.400
Call me before you think about doing something like that. I would say, well,

331
00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:46.770
you fucking let me play you a highlight reel. Fuck away from that guy. Oh,

332
00:18:46.771 --> 00:18:50.190
of course he did. He's terrifying. Yeah. When was this?

333
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:54.380
That was a extreme couture. So when I was living here, I used to drive out to a,

334
00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:57.180
um, I used to stay Shawn Tompkins House. Was he fighting?

335
00:18:57.181 --> 00:19:01.920
Two Oh five then or 85. Oh, this was a, he was fighting an affliction. I was,

336
00:19:01.921 --> 00:19:06.090
I was helping him train for that. It was e Terry Martini for in affliction. No.

337
00:19:06.091 --> 00:19:09.390
Was it? Yes, it was, I think, I think it was,

338
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.270
he only had one fight in affliction. Right. Men Flesh.

339
00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:16.020
One vendor did affliction. I had some wild shit. They did all the money at that.

340
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.950
Which fit when a fatal for Tim Sylvia. Holy Shit.

341
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.910
Holy Shit. That was wild. When fatal knocked on our Lawsky.

342
00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:28.650
Holy Shit. People don't bolt those reflection fights. They will. They will.

343
00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.480
Yeah, they will cut cards. But it was, yeah,

344
00:19:30.481 --> 00:19:33.600
it was extreme couture and it was in the boxing ring that was right in the door

345
00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.510
and it was fight week. So there were fans in the gym,

346
00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:40.330
people taking photos and we were on the elevator platform as we told Balfour

347
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.320
with some dude that no one's ever seen, it's got a Mohawk. So everyone's like,

348
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.480
this guy's going to get fucked up by veto Balfour.

349
00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.240
So everyone's watching and I'm like, I'm like moving.

350
00:19:48.241 --> 00:19:51.840
And I'm like trying to stay away from him using my footwork and my job and like

351
00:19:51.841 --> 00:19:54.420
it was just trying to march me down and I caught it with a couple of,

352
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.920
a couple of jabs and a cheeky left hook and he stepped in and blasted me with

353
00:19:58.921 --> 00:20:03.360
this cleanup or cut. Oh, I was eating soup for a week. Yeah, man,

354
00:20:03.361 --> 00:20:07.680
don't do that. Yeah, he was so fast. He's ridiculously fast.

355
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.650
Yeah, you don't need that in your life. Not Anymore.

356
00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:14.280
He's not able to weed towards big and fast.

357
00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:18.810
He was like the first guy that burst onto the scene that had like real boxing

358
00:20:18.811 --> 00:20:20.280
hand speeding combinations.

359
00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:23.250
You remember when he fought Trey Tellerman and people thought he was used to guy

360
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:28.430
because he was only 19 but he came up with his hands wrapped with MMA gloves on

361
00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:33.470
and was throwing red wrestling shoes. Warrington.

362
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.140
He had wrestling shoes when he fought Vander Lee too, you know, for, I took off.

363
00:20:37.141 --> 00:20:40.650
So yeah. Holy Shit. Well, you know what's really interesting about vittores,

364
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.120
people think of him as a kicker,

365
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:46.650
but he really didn't start kicking until later in his career. You know,

366
00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:50.260
it's Kinda crazy when you think that he knocked out Dan Henderson with a kick.

367
00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.170
Luke Rockhold with a kick. Michael Bisping with a kick.

368
00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.110
He knocked these guys out with head kicks. Spinning kids. Yeah.

369
00:20:56.111 --> 00:20:59.380
Well some of them. Yeah, but he did with a, Bisping was just a lead.

370
00:20:59.381 --> 00:21:03.940
A round cat, right? Wasn't it left round care? Yes.

371
00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:04.870
We all kicked man.

372
00:21:04.871 --> 00:21:08.110
The second wheel kick probably ever threw in a fight and turn straight back to

373
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.620
stance slow. Didn't spend all the way through. He's a fucking serious athlete,

374
00:21:11.621 --> 00:21:12.100
man.

375
00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:17.100
That's like the kind of kicking technique that you would get if you are a black

376
00:21:17.141 --> 00:21:20.200
belt at taekwondo and your teens. You know what I'm saying?

377
00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:24.520
For him to pick that up deep into his thirties because he'd never threw kicks

378
00:21:24.521 --> 00:21:26.290
like that. Right. He would throw,

379
00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:31.530
he would throw crazy hands and mostly he would throw like some low kicks or

380
00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:36.640
things like that. But he started throwing wild head kicks and shit. And it,

381
00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:40.150
I think also something might've had to do with the fact that he broke his hands

382
00:21:40.151 --> 00:21:42.910
many times. Like many, many times.

383
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:47.260
Like I think he had something like seven or eight hand operations. Oh yeah.

384
00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:50.350
So when I've never had a problem with crazy, you got lucky man.

385
00:21:50.351 --> 00:21:53.680
You got this hand structure. I think it's because, cause I was,

386
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:56.230
I put up a video to the day of me hitting the uh,

387
00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.760
the maze bike with no gloves on.

388
00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.770
And I do that quite a bit and I've always done it.

389
00:21:59.771 --> 00:22:03.040
And I think for the first sort of five years of my training,

390
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:04.840
everything we did was with no gloves.

391
00:22:04.841 --> 00:22:06.550
You must've done the same thing with take one though. Right?

392
00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.420
And like I always think now boxes go straight into a gym and they wrap their

393
00:22:10.421 --> 00:22:14.320
hands before they do anything. So they never get that structure of the hands.

394
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:15.303
You know what I mean?

395
00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:19.240
I think there definitely is some benefit to doing some hand strengthening for

396
00:22:19.241 --> 00:22:23.440
sure. There's no detraction and it's no the detriment doing it.

397
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:25.930
It's gotta be good for you. I mean you're doing something where your,

398
00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.960
that's your weapon. It's two of your biggest weapons.

399
00:22:28.961 --> 00:22:31.240
The ones that land the most are these two hands.

400
00:22:31.241 --> 00:22:33.280
And if you could make a more strong,

401
00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.560
it only makes sense that that would be good. Make them.

402
00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.710
And also if you made them more muscular, right? If you just did a lot of,

403
00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:43.330
you would actually make them heavier. You know, like you really not much,

404
00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.790
you know like how much more meat you got in your hands.

405
00:22:45.791 --> 00:22:47.770
If you have like a thick hand versus a thin hand,

406
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:52.120
it's probably a couple of ounces. I've got quite small hands and thumbs as well.

407
00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:54.460
That's the other thing. If you punch as hard as vi tour,

408
00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:59.110
you better have some fucking George Foreman hands to go with that speed and

409
00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:01.150
power. You know? So maybe that's like,

410
00:23:01.151 --> 00:23:03.940
there's a lot of great boxers even with those big gloves.

411
00:23:03.941 --> 00:23:06.490
Like Floyd Mayweather broke his hands multiple times. Yeah,

412
00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:10.240
just hit people really hard. Hit them hard on the forehead.

413
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:13.300
You're fucking handbrakes. What about Chris Lieben?

414
00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:16.330
He never broke his hands today. Guys made out of metal. Exactly.

415
00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:19.990
That's metal life. You could take his hands off and put them on veto. Boastful.

416
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:23.920
That's the make the weapon. He fires bombs at people bare knuckle. It's,

417
00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:27.560
it's crazy to see him. Did you see his last fight though? And Dakota Cochran,

418
00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:30.370
we've got this giant um, gash in his forehead.

419
00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:31.870
One of the worst cuts I've ever seen.

420
00:23:31.871 --> 00:23:35.800
It didn't makes me rethink my support of a fuck.

421
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.110
Cause I was saying that MMA should be bare knuckle.

422
00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.290
I remember we had this conversation in the back in the Middle East a long time

423
00:23:41.291 --> 00:23:42.124
ago. Yeah.

424
00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:45.590
There's some that have that same repetitive conversation forever because it

425
00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:50.591
doesn't make sense to me that we have this unrealistic advantage of having your

426
00:23:51.741 --> 00:23:56.030
wrist wrapped and having knuckle protections on it. It seems like why can I,

427
00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:59.990
how come someone can elbow you in the face but they can't hit you with a bare

428
00:23:59.991 --> 00:24:02.630
knuckle. They can shin you in the face.

429
00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:06.410
I think about as hard as some people kick and then shitting you in the face

430
00:24:06.411 --> 00:24:09.290
like, oh that's okay, but then you've gotta think,

431
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.020
I mean what MMA would look like if we took the gloves off,

432
00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:15.920
we'd look like a real fight. This, the thing is like the gloves,

433
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:20.270
it doesn't help anyone other than the person who's throwing their punches

434
00:24:20.271 --> 00:24:22.190
because it protects your hand. But it may,

435
00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:24.980
it gives you an unrealistic expectation of what you could do with your hands.

436
00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.010
Cause they're all padded up. But I still think people,

437
00:24:28.011 --> 00:24:30.320
you know the people that are fighting Ben Knuckle right now,

438
00:24:30.321 --> 00:24:32.690
we've got an unrealistic perspective of, of,

439
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:36.980
of what boxing is with no gloves. Like, if you look back to the,

440
00:24:36.981 --> 00:24:40.310
any of the old photos or drawings of the old band are call boxes.

441
00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.310
Their stance was so much different than,

442
00:24:42.311 --> 00:24:46.160
I mean back then Nichols were coding and they were hitting with the front two

443
00:24:46.161 --> 00:24:47.600
knuckles with a back fist.

444
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.350
Like I think if if being a call box and had a started around, you know,

445
00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.020
around the same time as the UFC started,

446
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:56.450
it would develop and it would look very different.

447
00:24:56.451 --> 00:24:59.470
Right now everybody stand in like boxes like gone,

448
00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:02.750
14 ounce gloves on when they're sparring and they're throwing punches.

449
00:25:02.751 --> 00:25:05.720
Like they've got to like they've got gloves on, there's no, you know,

450
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:09.050
they've not made that adjustment yet to lean back and start using that lead hand

451
00:25:09.051 --> 00:25:09.650
better.

452
00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:12.560
So do you think that you're going to see that and there's bare knuckle boxing

453
00:25:12.561 --> 00:25:15.020
guys they're going to develop like that old timey style.

454
00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.770
I start jabbing with those strong for folks who don't know,

455
00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:22.360
the strong two knuckles are the ones that are right next to your,

456
00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:25.910
your index finger and your fuck you finger. Those are, uh,

457
00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:27.350
those are the two strong ones.

458
00:25:27.351 --> 00:25:32.351
And if you look at my friend John Lee who is a national taekwondo champion and

459
00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:35.930
one of my mentors taught me a lot when I was in Boston.

460
00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:40.070
We used to punch bricks so often that he didn't have two knuckles.

461
00:25:40.071 --> 00:25:44.900
He had one solid knuckle. It was so crazy. It was this on his right hand.

462
00:25:44.901 --> 00:25:49.610
It was like what a knuckle where a knuckle would be and another knuckle would

463
00:25:49.611 --> 00:25:53.420
be. All of it was covered by this like thick callus.

464
00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:57.800
Have you ever seen like when too to have those knuckles from breaking boards and

465
00:25:57.801 --> 00:25:59.090
bricks and Chet? I've seen,

466
00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.510
I've seen the callous knuckles but I've never seen one one combined.

467
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:04.400
See if you can find a photo of this cause it's,

468
00:26:04.401 --> 00:26:08.540
I've seen it on other martial artists before but you have to be one hardcore

469
00:26:08.541 --> 00:26:12.340
mother fucker to turn your hand into her hammer. One of my spots.

470
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:15.470
It shouldn't that my, one of my parts of tricks is my shins though. Oh really?

471
00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.330
Cause I've got conditioned shins from Thai boxing.

472
00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:20.920
They're still like none of the nerves have come back and that's amazing.

473
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:25.310
And they're like, it's it all calcified. And Shits and sounds like the table,

474
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:26.201
but it's like like the,

475
00:26:26.201 --> 00:26:30.920
the bone collapses down on itself and then you get like this thick chunk of

476
00:26:30.921 --> 00:26:33.350
bone, right? Or the front of the, of the shit of the Shin.

477
00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.590
So it's a different kind of bone, like a calcified bone.

478
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:39.270
The way it was explained to me is that the, if you,

479
00:26:39.271 --> 00:26:40.940
if you take a cross section of the bone,

480
00:26:40.941 --> 00:26:44.400
it looks like ladders stacked up next to each other and what you do is you

481
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:48.660
collapse the rungs on the first front set of ladders and that collapses down in

482
00:26:48.661 --> 00:26:53.460
itself and those two pieces calcify and then that becomes a thicker outer wall.

483
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.550
And then you do the same thing. So you've collapsed the,

484
00:26:56.790 --> 00:27:01.590
like we used to do bottles and draw him and rolling pins and all kinds of stuff

485
00:27:01.591 --> 00:27:03.480
to like try and condition the shins.

486
00:27:03.481 --> 00:27:07.140
Like it's the best way because everybody has a d. That's what I heard.

487
00:27:07.141 --> 00:27:08.350
Heavy bag all day.

488
00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:12.720
I've got a big old sandy heavy bag in my gym and I just kicked that all day.

489
00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:14.490
Kevin Ross said he would make me one.

490
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:19.440
He's gonna make me a sand one that you could just kick with your shins. Nice.

491
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:22.740
Yeah. That's what he told me he does. I'm like, Jesus Christ. Yeah.

492
00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:25.350
You've got to put some rags in there with the sand just to give it a bit of

493
00:27:25.351 --> 00:27:29.340
movement. None of Kevin Roscoe and star. I'm going to take it like a man.

494
00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.940
I'm going to just fuck my shins up.

495
00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:37.320
It's I'm the same thing apparently is the process that happens with cauliflower

496
00:27:37.321 --> 00:27:41.920
ear is a calcification because when you get internal bleeding, as explained,

497
00:27:41.921 --> 00:27:45.450
explained to me. Remember I am a moron and I'm definitely not a doctor,

498
00:27:45.451 --> 00:27:49.500
but as it was explained to me that when you have blood inside the tissue that

499
00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:54.501
that blood can calcify and that's why your your ears when they get cough are

500
00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:58.560
they're so fucking hard. It's just literally, it's like a rock in there. Damn.

501
00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.680
I used to just get it out. I used to just have some insulin needles.

502
00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.070
Good for your diabetic. Yeah. Good for you.

503
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:08.580
There's a lot of people that want that, that nonsense with their ears. Listen,

504
00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:13.140
listen, no disrespect to people who have it because many of them are my heroes.

505
00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:16.140
You know, because it's part of the game for Jujitsu.

506
00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:20.250
But if you have the option right now, not if you already have the cauliflower,

507
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:23.160
God bless. But if you got the option right now,

508
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:26.880
you really should drain your fucking ear because that's how the reason why your

509
00:28:26.881 --> 00:28:30.390
ear hears a certain way, like all that, like sound comes through there.

510
00:28:30.391 --> 00:28:31.224
You can hear it.

511
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:36.360
I have like little tiny pieces of chunks of little hard stuff. You know,

512
00:28:36.361 --> 00:28:38.810
places where I had like a little bit of cauliflower here, but I always wore it.

513
00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:42.140
Your guards? Yeah. Yeah. You did. You always, I, no, fuck you man.

514
00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:46.020
I'm going to here because it crazy. Very knuckle boxing legend,

515
00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:50.910
big Joe Joyce, dip tans and petrol ahead of brutal, brutal fights.

516
00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:55.620
Oh, is this, that Irish guy would been hardest stone is what he said.

517
00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.520
It's hard to stone rock-hard. Let me hear this Fella Code.

518
00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:04.500
Can we hear it on talk? Yeah, he's a, this is a traveler. Why is it,

519
00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.560
why isn't it okay to say Gypsy anymore? What happened? I don't know.

520
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.840
Is that not accepted anymore? That's what I heard. What was your thinking?

521
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.910
Because kids are coach and I him to cook them and then I do not tell them.

522
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:19.830
Okay. Just stop right there because we don't understand that what you're saying.

523
00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:22.440
I wouldn't say, I wouldn't refer to him as a gypsy.

524
00:29:22.441 --> 00:29:25.480
I would refer to him as a pikey that said, oh pikey. Yeah. Um,

525
00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:28.650
well they call themselves travelers as well. Right?

526
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:31.800
It's a w it's these weird distinctions, you know? Yeah. That's,

527
00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:34.650
I probably offended a bunch of people there, which I didn't mean to do,

528
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:37.950
but absolutely. A bunch of tough motherfuckers, but yeah, for sure. Yeah.

529
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:41.040
Really tough motherfuckers. Nicky Holt's skin, isn't he a,

530
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:44.080
does that run from that, that show? I think he is.

531
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.680
He's a very pretty Tyson fury for sure. Tyson furious for,

532
00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:50.020
she used to train in the same boxing gym as him.

533
00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:54.270
Like he used to have the ring the hour before me and I remember watching him and

534
00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:56.920
he was just like this big whole kin monster walking around. Dude,

535
00:29:56.921 --> 00:29:59.920
he's so improved. Closely tall. Yeah. Ridiculous.

536
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:03.290
He's so tall and long and he moved so good for a big heavyweight.

537
00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:07.030
Nice dude though. God Damn, he's a great guy. He's a sweetheart of a guy.

538
00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:12.700
He really genuinely cares to reach out to people and tell them that if you are

539
00:30:12.701 --> 00:30:13.810
going through depression,

540
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.150
if you're dealing with in suffering from mental illness,

541
00:30:16.151 --> 00:30:19.810
talk about it and get help because I almost killed myself and now here I am,

542
00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.800
champ of the world. Feeling Great. Yeah. I'd love to see him again. Sandy Ruiz.

543
00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.500
I would love to see that too. I might. We'll see that.

544
00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:28.030
I think we'll see all these fights.

545
00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:32.650
Andy Ruiz's not looking forward to fighting in Saudi Arabia apparently. Yeah.

546
00:30:32.651 --> 00:30:37.180
Why is it there now? Look again one more time. I'm a moron.

547
00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:38.170
I'm not a fight promoter.

548
00:30:38.171 --> 00:30:42.310
I don't know what the fuck goes on behind the scenes with lawyers and I don't

549
00:30:42.311 --> 00:30:44.410
know what the contract said that he had,

550
00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.500
but what I had heard was that he had to fight in England.

551
00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.410
Like that was in the contract. That's what I had heard,

552
00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:54.090
but that could be horse shit. Yeah. I have no idea. Maybe.

553
00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:57.190
Maybe it says in the contract that they have the right to tell him.

554
00:30:57.191 --> 00:30:58.060
I shouldn't have even said that.

555
00:30:58.061 --> 00:31:01.600
I heard that because I don't even remember who told it to me. But the point is,

556
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.960
there's a story that just came out that he does not want this fight to be in

557
00:31:04.961 --> 00:31:07.930
Saudi Arabia. I think he wants to fight in New York again. He,

558
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:10.380
he said he doesn't trust it over there. You know,

559
00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:13.240
like he doesn't trust it in England either. He doesn't trust the fight.

560
00:31:13.241 --> 00:31:16.660
Joshua and England, he's like, no, no, no. [inaudible] I get it. I mean,

561
00:31:16.661 --> 00:31:21.340
he's the champ now. He can call his shop. Yeah, he's the champ man.

562
00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:25.030
Super Nice Guy. If you met him. No, I have not met. He's great.

563
00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:28.180
He was also one of your podcasts. He's great. Listen to that. It's a good dude,

564
00:31:28.181 --> 00:31:29.350
man. Genuine as fuck.

565
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:33.880
And boy does he have like fluidity and efficiency in his punches.

566
00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:36.610
No wasted movement. Yes. Yeah. And the other thing I was to,

567
00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:40.700
I was talking to Tim Hendricks about we would discussing box and he's,

568
00:31:40.701 --> 00:31:44.710
he actually trained at the Ruca gym with a j Jason Perilla.

569
00:31:44.711 --> 00:31:48.480
He's got a couple of them, couple of fights, huge Jason Pirlo Fan. He's very,

570
00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:52.360
very good coach man. Very good in the corners. He's great.

571
00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:56.320
Like his advice is great and you see like the advancement of his pupils,

572
00:31:56.410 --> 00:32:00.700
he's got that deep voice and he doesn't toot his own horn ever. No, not,

573
00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:04.030
you know, that guy just stays under the radar and just kicks ass.

574
00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:07.090
I'd like to see a couple of young fighters go to his gym cause he's like,

575
00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:11.060
like the old guard kind of leaving now like thing and like sidewalk.

576
00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.720
I'm not sure where she, what she's gonna do now. Like,

577
00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:17.230
well I think people are gonna you know, up and coming,

578
00:32:17.231 --> 00:32:19.060
people that are in that area for sure going to go.

579
00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:20.860
It's one of those things where it's like,

580
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:25.030
there's so many great trainers now that for fighters it's like,

581
00:32:25.031 --> 00:32:27.370
where do you want to live? Do you want to live in San Diego?

582
00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:29.800
Do you want to live in la? Do you want to live in Vegas?

583
00:32:29.801 --> 00:32:30.640
Like where do you want to live?

584
00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:33.130
Like you just have to figure out where you want to live and then find somebody

585
00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.510
who's going to match up with your style,

586
00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:39.650
assuming you're realistically at the level that you could benefit from such a

587
00:32:39.651 --> 00:32:44.240
move, you know? Yeah. Kind of spoiled for choice really. Yeah.

588
00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:46.100
I was at American top team the other weeks back.

589
00:32:46.101 --> 00:32:49.700
I spent some time with Conan Silveira and I mean that guy better than that.

590
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:52.670
Blaze is a wizard. He's a wizard. And so as Dean,

591
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:56.720
Dean Thomas has one of the best, um, Instagram pages with advice,

592
00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:00.600
advice for young fighters. And he had a great one today that I texted him.

593
00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:05.080
So this genius advice telling him that one of the biggest things that inhibits

594
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:10.000
her progress is, uh, not looking at themselves honestly, not looking at their,

595
00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.440
their, what they're strong at, what their, what they're weak at.

596
00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:15.840
I think it helps to have a good sense of humor that was a fighter, you know,

597
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:17.990
with him, with him, I've been such a good sense of humor.

598
00:33:17.991 --> 00:33:20.300
It can be critical about himself and not take it to heart.

599
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:22.160
And I think there are a lot of fighters that are,

600
00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.640
you know that that too delicate to be, to be honest with themselves.

601
00:33:25.641 --> 00:33:30.540
Like how many fighters they get knocked out and they don't watch the fight. Lot.

602
00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:34.280
Lot don't want to experience it. They don't want to see it, you know? That's,

603
00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:35.121
that's crazy.

604
00:33:35.121 --> 00:33:38.150
To me that seems to be like an essential part of the learning process.

605
00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:42.950
Maybe in their mind they know what happened and they don't want to experience

606
00:33:42.951 --> 00:33:44.180
the bad feeling again.

607
00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.370
And what they're just going to do is just get through this,

608
00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.180
learn and improve that. They don't need to see themselves getting left hooked.

609
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:52.640
They know what happened. I dropped her hand,

610
00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:54.170
I was like burying it deep down inside.

611
00:33:54.171 --> 00:33:57.560
You never remember it exactly how it played out as well I'm sure.

612
00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.590
But unless it's final, right? Like if you,

613
00:34:00.591 --> 00:34:04.220
if you wake up and you've got flat lined and you look up and you see the

614
00:34:04.221 --> 00:34:08.870
highlight of you getting hit and then you barely remember it and I mean,

615
00:34:08.871 --> 00:34:12.580
how much of that is going to help you to watch that, right? Like I dunno,

616
00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:17.270
like how much is it going to help Ben Aspirin to see horror amounts for doll

617
00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.390
land, that knee on him? Yeah. I mean, well the, the thing is with that,

618
00:34:20.391 --> 00:34:24.320
that was, I'm not saying it was, it was a less technical circumstance,

619
00:34:24.321 --> 00:34:28.340
but it was one of those kind of wild circumstances, which, right. I mean,

620
00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:31.010
the only thing that he could have learned from it is the fact that mass valor

621
00:34:31.011 --> 00:34:33.650
probably figured out that he shoots with his head to that side.

622
00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:35.140
You know what I mean? So, which is why might,

623
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.230
as Fidel did the circle to make him force, you know, put his head on that side.

624
00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:40.970
Yeah. So it was in the right place, dude. It was genius. It was,

625
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:43.460
he was beautiful. It was checkmate with one move. Yeah.

626
00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:46.700
That's what it was because it was one moved, there was no, there was no buildup,

627
00:34:46.701 --> 00:34:50.270
there was no setup. So like a fight lasts a couple of minutes.

628
00:34:50.271 --> 00:34:53.270
I think there's a lot to be learned from that. And like the process in which,

629
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:57.150
you know, you went through to open up and look for the knockout. Yeah,

630
00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:01.040
like the conduit fight for me. I've watched that thousands of times.

631
00:35:01.041 --> 00:35:04.760
I used to walk through casinos in Vegas and it was playing on a highlight rail

632
00:35:04.761 --> 00:35:07.220
on the TV. I'm like, here we go again. You know,

633
00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:09.980
like I know exactly what went wrong. You know,

634
00:35:09.981 --> 00:35:13.130
I learned so much from that and I remember opening my eyes and thinking,

635
00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:16.010
I'm just feeling different. Don't you feel though like,

636
00:35:16.011 --> 00:35:20.750
I mean now at this stage of your career, you know, you've become this,

637
00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:21.290
uh,

638
00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:26.290
celebrated commentator as well and you can look back and you have so many

639
00:35:26.361 --> 00:35:29.780
highlights. Like there was so many great moments of your career.

640
00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.840
Like you could acknowledge that the bad moments are there,

641
00:35:32.841 --> 00:35:36.590
but they can't sting like they use stick. No, they don't. I mean, I,

642
00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.100
I've always a good sense of humor. I've

643
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.800
<v 2>always been able to tell, always have, I've always been, I mean, you know,</v>

644
00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:42.650
I got punched in the face. I,

645
00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.120
I get reminded of that line after the conduct flight all the time.

646
00:35:45.121 --> 00:35:48.270
When you interviewed mates, first thing I thought to myself, I mean it's,

647
00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.390
you've always gotta be able to laugh at yourself because you, you're exposed,

648
00:35:51.391 --> 00:35:52.440
you're very, very vulnerable.

649
00:35:52.441 --> 00:35:54.500
You're in front of millions of people putting your,

650
00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:57.660
your basically your health on the line, you know? Um,

651
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:00.480
so I think having a sense of humor has always helped.

652
00:36:00.481 --> 00:36:05.481
And I think also now being able to look back from where I am now and look at my

653
00:36:06.031 --> 00:36:07.980
career and go, well, I attend fights in the UFC.

654
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:13.550
I went for up title fight for down and then I pulled it back for two and that's

655
00:36:14.191 --> 00:36:16.410
where it kind of ended. So I had, I had a bit of everything.

656
00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:19.230
I had a taste of everything. I had the quick rise.

657
00:36:19.231 --> 00:36:23.970
I was in a Komen event and my second fight, you know, O two arena in London,

658
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:26.700
69 second knockout on top of the world,

659
00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:31.650
Marcus Davis after that was just ridiculous because of the buildup to it.

660
00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.680
Then Mike Swick, I'm fighting for a world title. Holy Shit,

661
00:36:34.681 --> 00:36:35.514
what's happening here?

662
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:39.930
Next thing I'm facing off against Jewish San pier and then I had like a,

663
00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:45.210
I had like a four month process after that of looking back at it with everybody

664
00:36:45.211 --> 00:36:46.920
saying, Oh, you just need a bit of take down a fence.

665
00:36:46.921 --> 00:36:48.240
You just need some take down a fence.

666
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:51.180
And I'd started to believe that in my own head and thought I was really,

667
00:36:51.181 --> 00:36:55.740
really fucking good. And I did. I mean it went like you were really fucking,

668
00:36:55.741 --> 00:36:59.340
yeah, Ben. I know. I thought you were better than you were. Absolutely. I did.

669
00:36:59.341 --> 00:37:00.030
Yeah.

670
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:03.870
And then I looked at conduit and this is where my ego took over and I looked at

671
00:37:03.871 --> 00:37:05.220
him and I thought to myself, what the fuck?

672
00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.730
He's not going to do anything to me like he's awkwardly slow.

673
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:12.840
You Strike and sucks. He's very predictable. He's not getting punching power,

674
00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:14.190
you won't be able to take me down.

675
00:37:14.191 --> 00:37:16.560
Like this was the whole conversation I was having in my head going into the

676
00:37:16.561 --> 00:37:20.130
fight. I was, I was just, there was no way he was gonna he was gonna beat me.

677
00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:21.390
Wow. You know?

678
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:26.390
And that's where that was a good turning point for me because that put me back

679
00:37:26.611 --> 00:37:27.930
on the track where I should've been.

680
00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:31.320
And I'd already started to veer off after the GSP fight because the rise had

681
00:37:31.321 --> 00:37:34.860
been so quick fall flights. So I, because I experienced that,

682
00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:38.340
it's nice for me to be able to, I try not to talk about it,

683
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:42.390
but to relate my experiences when I'm watching other fighters coming up.

684
00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:43.530
You know, I can,

685
00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:46.890
I can put myself in their shoes because I've probably experienced something of

686
00:37:46.891 --> 00:37:50.600
where they're at for sure a high or a low, you know? So I,

687
00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:54.540
I look back and I think maybe my career prepared me for where I'm at right now.

688
00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:58.330
<v 1>Oh, for sure. I think the best commentators for sure, or former fighters,</v>

689
00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.810
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing in there, man. Let me see. Comedian,

690
00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.630
you set the bar so high, please come on. It's a,

691
00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.990
it's a great job for me. It's a lot of fun,

692
00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.990
but I think it's best expressed by former fighters because there's,

693
00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:14.110
if they could do everything that I can do, which most of them can,

694
00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:18.970
the big thing that's missing with me is not having fought in the UFC where they

695
00:38:18.971 --> 00:38:22.050
can relay that and it's very important. I've seen a lot of it. I,

696
00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:24.570
I understand what's going on, but there's a,

697
00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:28.260
an additional perspective that someone like you can provide. Michael Bisping,

698
00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.540
who I think he's also excellent at. Of course, DC somebody,

699
00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:35.750
probably my all time favorite guy to work with. Dominick cruises.

700
00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:37.840
Excellent attitude as is Paul Felder.

701
00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.770
It's like there's something unique about the perspective of, Oh, you know,

702
00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:42.640
he used to be really fucking good at it. Frank Mir,

703
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:47.350
Frank May as it was grades to give them a job. Somebody give him a fucking job.

704
00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:50.370
Yeah. But then I would say the same thing about Jimmy Smith. [inaudible] Smith.

705
00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:52.640
Excellent. Yes. Was excellent. I know that, you know,

706
00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:57.890
I think the UFC had decided that they wanted to use their former fighters more

707
00:38:58.391 --> 00:39:03.010
and sort of give them a career option after fighting, which you know,

708
00:39:03.011 --> 00:39:06.010
we look like Rashad Evans, he's really flourishing there.

709
00:39:06.011 --> 00:39:10.060
Tyron Woodley is already kind of establish himself as being a big time

710
00:39:10.061 --> 00:39:13.570
commentator while he was the champ after he who was a champion.

711
00:39:13.571 --> 00:39:16.240
Doing more of that. Those the more guys do that,

712
00:39:16.241 --> 00:39:17.650
the more they're going to see like,

713
00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:21.120
oh well there is a life in sports after competition.

714
00:39:21.121 --> 00:39:24.550
I can make a great living still be involved in the sport that I love,

715
00:39:24.551 --> 00:39:28.720
that has given me so much and I've given so much to, and it's all a cool thing.

716
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:29.583
It's like you get,

717
00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:33.130
and I think I encouraged more of them to do podcasts like shop,

718
00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:37.150
you know like shops kind of carved the path in terms of like ex fighters

719
00:39:37.151 --> 00:39:42.151
becoming a successful at podcasts and so many people go to him for,

720
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:45.280
you know, what's your take on Canelo versus triple g?

721
00:39:45.281 --> 00:39:46.960
What do you think's going to happen with this?

722
00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:50.140
Is Deontay wilder ever gonna Fight Tyson fury again, like those,

723
00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:54.100
those like for coming from a former fighter man, people really dig that.

724
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:57.790
It's a unique perspective and any, if you can get good at fighting,

725
00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.740
you can get good at talking. True.

726
00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:01.810
You just figured it to learn it that way around.

727
00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.530
Get the fights in Len first and then figure out how to tell people about it.

728
00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:09.490
I often think, you know when I'm talking to people though, like Anthony Smith,

729
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:10.990
when I, when I speak to him,

730
00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:13.570
I always think to myself as soon as he's done fighting,

731
00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:16.230
he can get across straight over into, into broadcast.

732
00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:20.710
A lot of her speaks so well and every time I find a fighter and I failed that

733
00:40:20.711 --> 00:40:22.410
about them, I always make sure I tell them. Yeah,

734
00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:25.750
because although you don't want to think about it when you're a fly too,

735
00:40:25.751 --> 00:40:26.710
because you always want to think,

736
00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:28.420
well of course you're going to become the world champion.

737
00:40:28.421 --> 00:40:31.150
Of course you're going to be massively successful and not have to worry about it

738
00:40:31.151 --> 00:40:34.300
because that's the only mindset that you should have as a fighter of course.

739
00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:39.270
But there is life after fighting and you know what I've realized is that if I'd

740
00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.940
have had other options like planned when I was fighting,

741
00:40:42.941 --> 00:40:45.460
I would have had a lot less pressure when I was fighting.

742
00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:47.260
This is my advice that I would say,

743
00:40:47.261 --> 00:40:51.490
I would say for sure if you're the type of person that needs to concentrate on

744
00:40:51.491 --> 00:40:55.180
one thing at a time and that one thing is fighting, just fight.

745
00:40:55.660 --> 00:41:00.100
But if you're interested in doing it in any way, you don't have to think like,

746
00:41:00.101 --> 00:41:03.730
this is my way out. You could just say, this is another cool thing I do,

747
00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:07.540
so don't fuck with your head. Don't fuck with your head and say, hey,

748
00:41:07.541 --> 00:41:12.190
maybe when I retire this would be my career. Like man, stay in the game.

749
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:16.000
But you can just get good at stuff too and just be zen about it.

750
00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.720
The more you put pressure on, like maybe it's time for me to move on.

751
00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:23.320
Maybe it's time for me to be like, guys can head fuck themselves.

752
00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:25.720
You don't want to fight when you're head fucked.

753
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:28.450
We've all seen guys fight when their head fucked and you're like,

754
00:41:28.451 --> 00:41:31.360
what happened to him? Oh, he broke up with his girl. Oh,

755
00:41:31.361 --> 00:41:34.020
this happened or that happened or someone, the family died.

756
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.280
<v 0>Like he [inaudible]. Yeah.</v>

757
00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:39.380
That's why Paul fell to flights like it's always his last fight because he knows

758
00:41:39.381 --> 00:41:41.870
he's got a good commentary gig. When he, when he retired,

759
00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:46.030
guys alluded to say he is a lunatic. He's great. He's awesome.

760
00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:50.990
You know he's a theater major. Yeah. I mean she's like super well-spoken guy.

761
00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:52.190
Yeah. He's a quite a gentleman.

762
00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:55.130
We bring him in if they bring them in for the European ones,

763
00:41:55.131 --> 00:41:58.530
we worked on a Moscow together and a few of them, she's very Yemen.

764
00:41:58.531 --> 00:42:01.460
Barboza too is going to be chaos.

765
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:05.090
That's a crazy for as long as that motherfucker lasts, that's going to be quick.

766
00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:06.440
That's going to be crazy. Yeah.

767
00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:11.050
Barboza has been in some fucking wars is amazing. Holy Shit.

768
00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:14.570
I just did the fastest switch kick I've ever seen in my life. Oh, for sure.

769
00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:19.070
And it's, it's the placement as well. It's the timing and placement of it.

770
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:21.980
It's stunning how fast it is though, man. It's stunning.

771
00:42:21.981 --> 00:42:24.500
Like when you see it in real life, you're just like, Jesus,

772
00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:29.780
I've seen a fucking thousand people throw switch kicks. Probably. Yeah,

773
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:33.560
but there's one that stands out. It's Barboza Lord Jesus. Ridiculous.

774
00:42:33.561 --> 00:42:36.740
Like a world champion tie. That's what it looks like.

775
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:39.480
He was down at American top team. I was there a few weeks ago. Um,

776
00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:42.650
and just watching him hit pads and move around and stuff. It's, dude,

777
00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:45.950
there's no, he's the best kicker in the sport. In my, for my money,

778
00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:48.140
like his leg case, the first guy to stop,

779
00:42:48.141 --> 00:42:51.920
two guys would leg kicks a Hatfield Dale Avera,

780
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:56.000
and I'm [inaudible] dude a wrestler.

781
00:42:56.510 --> 00:43:00.950
It was just like, he, he's a fucking lethal kicker man.

782
00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:03.730
The first guy that ever stopped somebody with the wheel kick Terry at them.

783
00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:09.050
No God. How many times have we seen that? Fuck man, that's on everything.

784
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:12.860
Oh fuck. Well, I remember thinking like, Terry's gotta take some chances here,

785
00:43:12.861 --> 00:43:14.750
but if you take chances, he could get knocked out.

786
00:43:14.751 --> 00:43:18.620
So I was literally saying that when he got hit with a wheelchair,

787
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:23.240
he's a fighter that I think would benefit from that weight class between one 55

788
00:43:23.241 --> 00:43:27.660
and one 70 Mike Lolo. Mike Lula was the other guy who stopped leg kicks.

789
00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:33.050
Oh, I knew. I'd remember you remember. You remember the Joe Aldo? Uriah favor.

790
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:35.180
What's that? Wasn't in the UFC. Sorry, what was it? Another one.

791
00:43:35.181 --> 00:43:39.500
A fight right before that he Marcello gold critiques outside the UFC stopped Ya

792
00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:44.420
dude. He's fucking lethal. Led kicks are horrific. The only one,

793
00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:48.650
his clothes was all done in this crime. Oh Man. Against Uriah Faber.

794
00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:49.631
I did that.

795
00:43:49.631 --> 00:43:52.340
I did a show with the favor of the week after and he came in on crutches.

796
00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:55.100
He's old leg was like, you know the, the eggplant Emoji.

797
00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:56.890
That's basically what he's like. Look, Scott,

798
00:43:57.110 --> 00:44:01.970
ridiculous people don't understand you're a grave risk of infection when you

799
00:44:01.971 --> 00:44:04.950
have that kind of bruising all throughout your life. That is a,

800
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:06.890
that could go terribly wrong,

801
00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:10.830
but that was a terrible leg injury that shows you how fucking tough you,

802
00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:14.810
Ryan Faber is ridiculous to in these back. It's not just that too.

803
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.711
How about the fight?

804
00:44:15.711 --> 00:44:20.060
When he fought Mike Brown and he broke both his hands broke both his fucking

805
00:44:20.061 --> 00:44:20.540
hands.

806
00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:23.870
So he's throwing elbows and kicks and he's trying to keep this guy off him.

807
00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:25.310
Yeah Dude.

808
00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:28.880
And he's back as well and he's been wanting to see him against the Huda Dude.

809
00:44:28.881 --> 00:44:31.010
I to see it too. I mean it came close.

810
00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:33.780
Seemed like this is almost something that really could happen.

811
00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:38.280
Cause like when he knocked out Ricky Simone, everybody was like, what? Yeah,

812
00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:41.580
like what, this is crazy. You're right. It comes back.

813
00:44:41.581 --> 00:44:45.480
He starch and people and good fighters knocks out a good fighter.

814
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:49.290
A young up and coming. Talented kid just catches him. Perfect.

815
00:44:49.291 --> 00:44:52.080
And like damn Uriah favors in the hunt. Yeah.

816
00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.560
And then everybody loves him and so he starts talking shit to say who don't.

817
00:44:55.561 --> 00:44:57.870
So Udo starts talking shit to him and you're like, wow.

818
00:44:58.380 --> 00:44:59.910
But first so Hutto has to fight.

819
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:04.380
Valentina Shevchenko and Amanda Nunez apparently sees new shirt.

820
00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:09.030
He's got inter gender champion shirts. Yes, yes, yes. [inaudible] love it.

821
00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:12.860
I love it. Henry. I'm in your corner. You keep this out. Come on.

822
00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:15.880
No more rabbits out of hats. No more cake.

823
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:20.310
So he's got people excited about flyweight man. Yeah, but dude,

824
00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:24.300
you got to teach you stuff. I love it. Like, Oh man,

825
00:45:24.301 --> 00:45:27.480
this might as well be pro wrestling. Now look at this. Everybody's in on it.

826
00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:32.700
Let me say it. Look at that Inter gender world champion.

827
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:36.850
It's all in gold on a black shirt. God bless you Henry. Pseudo Scott.

828
00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:40.650
God bless you. That's terrible. I mean he's fucking handcuff me in his way.

829
00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:42.660
He's arguably,

830
00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:46.440
if he's not the most accomplished MMA fighter in history,

831
00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:50.760
he's the most accomplished combat sports athlete. That's an undeniable,

832
00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:55.080
that's undeniable Olympic gold medalist and two division world champion.

833
00:45:55.081 --> 00:45:58.650
He can do whatever the fuck he wants to do without let him wear that shirt and

834
00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:02.630
let him go crazy. You let him do whatever he wants. That's Henry pseudo.

835
00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:03.790
He does what everyone wants.

836
00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:08.580
I think the girls are all in on it and I think it helps everybody cause

837
00:46:08.581 --> 00:46:10.620
everybody's getting pumped up about it. It's a joke.

838
00:46:10.621 --> 00:46:13.410
Amanda Nunez thinks it's a joke she posed with them.

839
00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:16.380
Valentino ship chank goes in. Both fights him though.

840
00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:21.400
They would both fuck him up too. No, I'm just kidding you. You know,

841
00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:26.400
you really don't want to see 135 pound man ever fight Amanda Nunez. You know,

842
00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:28.110
you don't want to see it. You don't want to see it.

843
00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:32.730
But I'll see Amanda Nunez fight anybody else and I'll see Valentina Shipp tenco

844
00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:34.390
fighting anybody else. I mean, would,

845
00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:39.180
it would be horrible if you saw like a man's world champion fight a woman's

846
00:46:39.181 --> 00:46:42.000
world champion and he fucked her up. That would be terrible. I feel awful.

847
00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:43.530
I would never ever want to see that.

848
00:46:43.531 --> 00:46:47.280
I was offered a fight against Jermaine [inaudible]. She's hot in a scary way.

849
00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:52.360
Scary. Valentino [inaudible] hot in a scary way. Yeah. You know what I mean?

850
00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:55.050
I mean that with all due confidence, all due respect, rather,

851
00:46:55.051 --> 00:46:57.390
I'm a giant fan of hers. I think she's me.

852
00:46:57.391 --> 00:47:00.720
I had a conversation with a dream killer Bolanos you know,

853
00:47:00.721 --> 00:47:05.160
gas on Bolanos from a Moitai and now he fights. Um, it's funny,

854
00:47:05.161 --> 00:47:08.280
in Bell tour, uh, we were talking about her and he, he said,

855
00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:11.940
I think she has the best fight IQ of anybody,

856
00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:15.030
like maybe better than anybody in the sport man or woman. And I was like,

857
00:47:15.031 --> 00:47:15.990
I can't argue with no,

858
00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.900
I mean you watch that last fight against Liz Carmouche and I know a lot of

859
00:47:18.901 --> 00:47:21.330
people complained that it was a, you know, it was a slow fight but,

860
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:24.390
and this is something I realized actually during that fight,

861
00:47:24.391 --> 00:47:27.330
sometimes you need to see the whole lot to get and to really appreciate what's

862
00:47:27.331 --> 00:47:28.164
going on.

863
00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:31.900
Like sometimes you need to see like an elevated shot of the whole space because

864
00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:36.420
her ability to control that space with the threat of doing something and their

865
00:47:36.421 --> 00:47:38.920
ability to cut people off. What is she doing here?

866
00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:42.850
[inaudible] she's breaking down the superman. Oh yeah.

867
00:47:42.851 --> 00:47:47.350
See she's hot in a scary way. In a bond villain kind of way. Yeah. Yeah.

868
00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:51.190
Will you like please? She throws US spinning back list differently as well,

869
00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.990
which I think there's a good reason for,

870
00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:55.360
because most people are throwing their spinning back face with their arms

871
00:47:55.361 --> 00:47:58.150
straight and then breaking the forum is when she throws it,

872
00:47:58.151 --> 00:47:59.650
she's throwing it with her elbow down,

873
00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.320
which means that if she hits with the forearm is hitting both bones.

874
00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:04.660
Interesting. And I think that's, I think that's the,

875
00:48:04.661 --> 00:48:09.220
that's the reason that you might, right. I mean it makes sense. The um,

876
00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:12.790
it is harder to break the bone that way. Right. And I would think so.

877
00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:18.250
Is it though? Let me think. Let me think if that makes sense.

878
00:48:18.251 --> 00:48:21.250
You've got to hit one button, it's going to be weaker, but if you block it,

879
00:48:21.251 --> 00:48:24.820
you want to block it with the edge. You never want to block it like that.

880
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.250
I'll give you blocking the kick. You don't want to take it like that.

881
00:48:27.251 --> 00:48:30.100
That's how your arm snaps. I wouldn't block a kick. I would take it on my,

882
00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:33.100
on my half to block a kick. What if you get stuck here?

883
00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:37.030
What do you do if you get stuck here? Yeah, but your kicks coming over.

884
00:48:37.031 --> 00:48:40.170
I'm tooken up. I'm taking it on the bit on like the meat of my arm. Okay.

885
00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:42.580
Wherever that, wherever that I'm taking the kick hopefully.

886
00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:46.750
But if it hits your forearm where wouldn't you rather take her for forearm than

887
00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:48.490
the face? For sure. For sure. For sure.

888
00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:50.680
But wouldn't you rather have it hit here than here?

889
00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.110
It seems like here's gonna folks who listening.

890
00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:56.950
We're describing the outside of the laid of the bone,

891
00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:00.430
which would be like the edge of a two by four versus the flat part of a two by

892
00:49:00.431 --> 00:49:03.760
four. I think if you kick the flat part it would break.

893
00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:07.150
Whereas if you kick the edge it probably is a little bit more durable you think?

894
00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:09.880
I think so. Someone listen to them as, yeah,

895
00:49:09.881 --> 00:49:12.780
I think the problem is actually catching it flat like you're,

896
00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:17.500
it's one of those things where it's, it's not the bone.

897
00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:22.330
The size difference is so huge that that little bone is going to break.

898
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:25.480
Like if someone's a really good kicker like your Francis and Gyno kicks your

899
00:49:25.481 --> 00:49:29.020
arm, some big giant dude with power. It's this parts can break.

900
00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:32.380
It's not his shin. Shit's not gonna break days. When Anthony Johnson kicked me,

901
00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:35.410
I felt like someone had hit me with a tree. See, that's what they look like.

902
00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.660
Wow. They look weird. They don't look like you.

903
00:49:37.661 --> 00:49:38.980
What you would think they would look like.

904
00:49:38.981 --> 00:49:41.170
I was looking at the bones of the forearm. Right now.

905
00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:44.510
You have a delusional idea what your bones look like. Yeah.

906
00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:45.970
I thought they were core.

907
00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:52.750
It's weird that that's our shape, right? That's what keeps us together.

908
00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:56.620
Just kind of all floating together. This weird fucking hard stuff.

909
00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:00.310
Hard stuff that allows us to articulate as we move through earth,

910
00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:04.360
but then you see other animals like octopus, no hard stuff at all.

911
00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:05.890
Nothing scares the shit out of me.

912
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:10.900
They're weird with little clip going around at the snail that had a parasite in

913
00:50:10.901 --> 00:50:15.240
it that this the parasite took over and it's like pulsing in its eyes and a

914
00:50:15.241 --> 00:50:17.380
body. You haven't seen? No. Oh,

915
00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:20.110
you know when I think I saw that a long time ago.

916
00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:23.600
Something really similar to that. Now that now that you're saying it,

917
00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:25.600
I love these goddamn things.

918
00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:30.230
I love those grasshoppers that get infected with that water worm that makes them

919
00:50:30.231 --> 00:50:34.400
commit suicide. Oh Dude, dude, I have seen this. Oh my God, this is amazing.

920
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:35.900
So this thing is inside,

921
00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:40.990
it's I like Goddamn amusement park ride. It's trying to trick a bird.

922
00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:43.670
Eat it. Cause it'll repopulate inside the bird and take.

923
00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:46.730
So it's kind of trick a bird. Yeah, cause it's the snails already dead.

924
00:50:46.731 --> 00:50:50.870
I think it's gone. What nature you fucking scary bitch.

925
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:54.350
We've got it pretty good in comparison. Oh my God. We do animal kingdom.

926
00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:59.090
What a tricky, weird way to propagate. Hey look at me.

927
00:50:59.091 --> 00:51:03.800
Come on now y'all know me. Eat me. Come on. Come any eight. Terrifying.

928
00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:08.450
So this aquatic worm, it climbs inside the grasshoppers body.

929
00:51:08.451 --> 00:51:10.010
And then when it's ready to be born,

930
00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:15.050
it makes the grasshopper commit suicide so it can like get in the water and swim

931
00:51:15.051 --> 00:51:18.140
away. Literally talks to grass. I'll be like, come on bitch.

932
00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:21.380
You going over here like in hijacks? It's physical motion.

933
00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:26.330
Makes it jump into water and drown. And then the, where I'm fucking comes up,

934
00:51:26.331 --> 00:51:28.010
it looks as the one with the Stephen King movie,

935
00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:33.010
the fly that lands on the spider and gets inside love inside the spider that

936
00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:36.620
eats it from the inside. And what is, isn't there like a,

937
00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:39.350
a trench law hawk or something that does that?

938
00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:44.060
I stumbled across something similar that's talking about quarter steps,

939
00:51:44.061 --> 00:51:45.560
which we've talked about before. Yes.

940
00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:50.650
They grow on Cicadas have domesticated that fungus and they use it.

941
00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:57.020
Yeah. What cicadas have repeatedly turned the infamous quarter subs,

942
00:51:57.390 --> 00:52:00.230
fung guy, indispensable allies.

943
00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:04.580
What? They grow it on their body.

944
00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:08.110
Is that what he's doing? That looks like an ant,

945
00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:12.500
but [inaudible] is that a Cicada says the relative of the Zombie ant has been

946
00:52:12.501 --> 00:52:17.170
domesticated by CICADAS. Oh Shit.

947
00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:19.040
They were just like, they're running the show. Well,

948
00:52:19.041 --> 00:52:22.520
there was one thing that I saw in the quarter steps mushroom and I don't know if

949
00:52:22.521 --> 00:52:26.060
it's exact, I think there's like many different strains of cordyceps mushroom,

950
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:29.880
but one some particular fun guy might not have even been core deceptive,

951
00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:32.900
but I think it was Jesus. Let me get to the story. Um,

952
00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:37.670
it infects an aunt and the other ants take it away from the colony because they

953
00:52:37.671 --> 00:52:40.490
know that it's going to get to a certain point and then it's going to explode.

954
00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:46.060
So the ant will literally fill up with these spores and then explode and then

955
00:52:46.401 --> 00:52:50.210
the spores get into the sky and land on the other aunts and they all get

956
00:52:50.211 --> 00:52:53.170
infected. And they figured that out. So they take it away from the nest.

957
00:52:53.171 --> 00:52:57.680
Somehow or another, they know that this fucking creepy aunt is like a bomb.

958
00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:01.010
It's like a dead bomb. And inside of it,

959
00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:05.290
the quarter subs machine exploding ant rips itself apart to protects its tech to

960
00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:08.450
tone. What does that say? This is a different one.

961
00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:16.160
Do Google worm infested by fungus?

962
00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:23.090
Yeah. Google that. Try that. Not Worm. Um, aunt. Aunt.

963
00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:27.690
Aunt infested by fungus. But um, this is scary. No, anything,

964
00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:29.040
any fireman's could ride.

965
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:32.130
We just don't think it's terrifying cause they're little [inaudible] it's all it

966
00:53:32.131 --> 00:53:34.620
is. Like if they get too big, we kill them. There's no,

967
00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:38.640
there's no chicken sized spiders running around my yard. The Fuck Outta here.

968
00:53:38.641 --> 00:53:42.270
You're dead. I'm not gonna call scientists. I'm gonna shoot you first,

969
00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:43.260
but then you've kind of got to put,

970
00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:46.770
but then you kind of got to put yourself in that circumstance.

971
00:53:46.771 --> 00:53:51.000
Like imagine that happening to you on that scale to put yourself on that scale.

972
00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:55.680
Ah, dude. If there was cockroaches and fucking giant bugs,

973
00:53:55.681 --> 00:53:59.610
the size of dogs running around, we would have real problems, real problems.

974
00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:01.620
He'd go right through your fucking walls of your house.

975
00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:06.930
Eat everything in there that might eat your baby. Dude,

976
00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:11.960
why are you putting these scorpions and fucking spiders and black widows?

977
00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:16.470
How's it? Black widows were giant. You'd be so fucked. Black widows,

978
00:54:16.471 --> 00:54:19.410
the size of giraffes, just run around Jack and people.

979
00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:21.760
It would change everything about the way we lived. Yeah,

980
00:54:21.761 --> 00:54:23.730
I mean if we didn't have weapons, guess what?

981
00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:27.900
All that shit would be real by caves. Look at that. So here it is.

982
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:31.350
So one of them gets infected and the other ones are going to carry this dude

983
00:54:31.351 --> 00:54:35.690
away because if they don't, he starts growing shit on his head. It's like a,

984
00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:37.020
this,

985
00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:42.020
this fungus somehow or another gets into his body and it starts sprouting this

986
00:54:42.991 --> 00:54:47.991
mushroom out of the top of his head and we're looking at a slow motion version

987
00:54:48.511 --> 00:54:51.870
of this where you're seeing this thing sprout out of this dead ant's head.

988
00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:55.660
It's took three weeks to film this. Yeah. To,

989
00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:58.250
this is like a science fiction movie. It's just, they're,

990
00:54:58.251 --> 00:55:00.120
they're operating on a different timescale.

991
00:55:00.121 --> 00:55:02.550
But if that happens as quickly as you're watching it and this video,

992
00:55:02.551 --> 00:55:06.720
you've freaked the fuck out. And like I say, an exploit growing so quick.

993
00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:09.510
Is it gonna Explode? Is that the gum phenolic? I don't know.

994
00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:12.690
I think that's the idea though. That's, yeah,

995
00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:17.730
it explodes out of its head is what they're sort of saying. Oh, okay. Oh, okay.

996
00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:21.750
That's, oh, kind of a bit dramatic, but I think it does blow spores.

997
00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:23.340
I think some of them, yeah.

998
00:55:23.650 --> 00:55:28.470
See some of them like fill up and then spores blow out of them and those spores

999
00:55:28.471 --> 00:55:31.710
can infect other ends. That's why they were removing them from the colony.

1000
00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:36.660
If your biologists are strong, sincerely apologize for butchering all science.

1001
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:38.040
That's how I style. I stumbled across it.

1002
00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:41.760
There are exploding ants though where they explode. Literally explode.

1003
00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:44.730
I don't know. It's like a whole thing explode,

1004
00:55:44.731 --> 00:55:48.180
but their nests lived to see another day. Their abdomens rupture.

1005
00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:53.670
The whole fun guy. Well, you ever see what they do with leaf cutter ants?

1006
00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:58.560
[inaudible] oh, so ruthless. The women are so monstrous.

1007
00:55:58.710 --> 00:56:01.260
They chop off the man's arm and fuck them to death.

1008
00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:06.600
They chop off his arms and then they carry him away. Yeah, they,

1009
00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:10.350
they find the mail. There must be a reason breeding. They find the mail.

1010
00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:12.390
They say, oh, well you're not going anywhere, bitch.

1011
00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:15.480
Like cut his arms off and then they bring them somewhere to fuck them.

1012
00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:16.920
Make sure this is true.

1013
00:56:19.890 --> 00:56:23.410
I'm pretty sure it's true. I've watched this whole documentary.

1014
00:56:23.411 --> 00:56:28.030
I remember they were a snipping off the arms and legs of the ant and then they

1015
00:56:28.031 --> 00:56:32.320
carried them away. Imagine that's fucking terrifying, dude. They're like,

1016
00:56:32.321 --> 00:56:34.510
this is how we do it. They know how to do it. They're like,

1017
00:56:34.511 --> 00:56:36.970
this is how we do it. We cut off your arms and legs. Then we fuck you to death.

1018
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.780
Imagine how that changes live coaching, dude, if that was the reality.

1019
00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:42.070
If you're a dude, right?

1020
00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:46.690
Because sitting around waiting for a hoard of angry egg, caring women,

1021
00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:49.870
come charging to your door and remove your limbs.

1022
00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:53.530
The terrifying enough women now we don't need to make him any more terrify

1023
00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:59.140
women. Humans are awesome women bugs. That's a weird thing.

1024
00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:01.800
Like there's no, there's no love in the bug world. No,

1025
00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:05.080
I just making honey getting shit. It's something beautiful about that though.

1026
00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:08.140
It's like, it's like pure, you know, it just keeps rolling over it. It's just,

1027
00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:09.910
you know, it's fine. It's rhythm.

1028
00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:13.000
We are the ones that make it complicated with all the other shit that we add

1029
00:57:13.001 --> 00:57:13.811
onto it. Well,

1030
00:57:13.811 --> 00:57:18.790
we've made ourselves so safe and so removed from the whole cycle of life and

1031
00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:22.270
that's amazing that we've done that or that somebody other than us has done that

1032
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:26.860
and then we reap the benefits. But because of that, we look at real,

1033
00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:29.260
the real suffering of the natural world. Almost like,

1034
00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:32.690
cause if it's preventable or if it's bad or if it's, you know,

1035
00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:35.470
it's something we should be sad about. You know,

1036
00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:39.910
but there's some really horrific things that take place,

1037
00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:44.080
especially in the insect world on a daily basis that make you just go, what?

1038
00:57:44.830 --> 00:57:49.060
Like have you ever seen those hornets that fly into the honeybee nes and be head

1039
00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:52.990
everyone. I have seen that. That's terrifying. What? It's like a Japanese horn,

1040
00:57:52.991 --> 00:57:57.770
right? And they fly in and just a few of them and they're a good size as well.

1041
00:57:57.880 --> 00:57:58.713
Other than that,

1042
00:57:58.730 --> 00:58:02.950
like you wouldn't want it any bigger cutters for a face and they just come in

1043
00:58:02.951 --> 00:58:05.170
and chop the heads off for these fucking [inaudible], these,

1044
00:58:05.290 --> 00:58:07.690
these other honeybees. And it's crazy to watch, man,

1045
00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:09.820
because the honeybees can't do Jack Shit.

1046
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:14.380
Just hundreds of them and it's just getting slaughtered. Just thousands of them.

1047
00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:18.400
But then they figured out the way to kill these things is to get on top of them

1048
00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:20.830
and bat their wings to heat up.

1049
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:26.080
So they heat up to the point where it overheats the B and kills it or the Horn

1050
00:58:26.290 --> 00:58:29.770
it and kills it. How did they figure that out? How did they figure that out?

1051
00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:31.210
But that's their strategy.

1052
00:58:31.211 --> 00:58:36.070
Now their strategy is they swarm all over the Hornet and they just keep flapping

1053
00:58:36.071 --> 00:58:38.600
their wings until the overheat. That mother fucker.

1054
00:58:38.601 --> 00:58:40.600
That's the argument for collective consciousness.

1055
00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:42.790
Cause like someone figured that out, one of those,

1056
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:46.600
one of those honeybees get that out and then the rest of them around the world,

1057
00:58:47.330 --> 00:58:49.990
I've probably started using that same tactic probably. Yeah.

1058
00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:54.760
Well that's the Rupert Sheldrake a thought is that the sweet potatoes and the

1059
00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:57.370
police thing, he's uh, he's,

1060
00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:02.260
he had this theory called morphic resonance and um, he,

1061
00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:05.860
one of the things that he was saying was he was talking about studies they did

1062
00:59:05.861 --> 00:59:09.430
with rats and mazes and then if they did a study with a rat and a maze,

1063
00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:14.170
like on the east coast, rats on the west coast,

1064
00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:16.860
if they went through the same maze would get through a quicker. Hmm.

1065
00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:21.250
So it's like they were learning from each other how to get through.

1066
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:22.010
It's almost like they

1067
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:24.980
<v 1>were sharing some sort of an understanding. I mean,</v>

1068
00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:31.460
we want to think that all genetics are the same in terms of like,

1069
00:59:31.461 --> 00:59:31.701
you know,

1070
00:59:31.701 --> 00:59:35.360
you have a child and your child shares your wife's genetics and your genetics

1071
00:59:35.361 --> 00:59:37.520
and this is, this is how it works and this is,

1072
00:59:37.610 --> 00:59:38.930
this is the way people learn things.

1073
00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:42.380
And that might be the way we learn most things.

1074
00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:47.680
But it also might be that we're getting some information from each other in some

1075
00:59:47.691 --> 00:59:51.860
weird way and got a VA and we, but we might be a little detached from it,

1076
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:55.370
whereas rats or out there fucking scratching and clawing and they don't have a

1077
00:59:55.371 --> 00:59:59.360
language, they might be completely tuned into it. It might be that sacrifice,

1078
00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:04.720
that language that we made when we went with language where we lost our ability

1079
01:00:06.201 --> 01:00:10.430
to read each other the way we used to that the read thoughts and ideas where we

1080
01:00:10.431 --> 01:00:13.400
used to, we rely instead on this other thing.

1081
01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:17.300
So it's sort of like when you wear shoes all the time, your feet get soft

1082
01:00:18.070 --> 01:00:19.690
<v 2>for sure. What we, we have, I mean,</v>

1083
01:00:19.691 --> 01:00:22.120
we've done a lot of things to detach yourself from all of that stuff.

1084
01:00:22.330 --> 01:00:23.490
You know what I mean, like and I,

1085
01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:28.420
and I think you know people that like Wim Hoff and Tim Shieff and people like

1086
01:00:28.421 --> 01:00:32.920
that that kind of go back to as far as close back to nature as they can.

1087
01:00:32.921 --> 01:00:36.040
They must be tuning in back into something that, that we're lacking.

1088
01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:39.370
I always feel that like that I want to get closer to that residence and I do

1089
01:00:39.371 --> 01:00:42.790
feel like these, this study with the monkeys on the islands,

1090
01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:46.180
the archipelago and they drop sweet potatoes in the sand of you.

1091
01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:48.560
Have you heard this? Think so, but go ahead. So they,

1092
01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:49.990
they dropped sweet potatoes in,

1093
01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:54.160
I mean this is just a gathering of of wire.

1094
01:00:54.161 --> 01:00:55.480
I remember from reading the study,

1095
01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:58.870
but there was a series of islands or with the same species of monkey on the

1096
01:00:58.871 --> 01:00:59.590
islands.

1097
01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:03.370
They dropped sweet potatoes into the sand on one island and the monkeys went

1098
01:01:03.371 --> 01:01:05.860
over and bit into them and because they were covered in sand,

1099
01:01:05.861 --> 01:01:07.090
they spat them out and left them.

1100
01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:10.300
Some of the younger monkeys realized that if they took them into the sea,

1101
01:01:10.301 --> 01:01:12.760
they could watch the sand off and then they could eat the sweet potatoes.

1102
01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:16.210
And then when they dropped the sweet potatoes onto the successive islands,

1103
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:18.850
they'd already knew to wash them in the sea.

1104
01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:22.940
<v 1>Oh, right. So that's very similar to the Rupert Sheldrake thing.</v>

1105
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.360
That's really interesting. Yeah. Yeah. I really wonder, I mean,

1106
01:01:26.361 --> 01:01:31.361
I really wonder how much like the human race benefits from the collective

1107
01:01:31.911 --> 01:01:35.510
knowledge of everyone involved, not just through the Internet and books and,

1108
01:01:36.490 --> 01:01:39.230
and universities, but maybe even just through consciousness,

1109
01:01:39.231 --> 01:01:42.920
like maybe there's some element of it that's being relayed through conscious.

1110
01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:46.200
<v 2>See, I'm invested in it because if I have an idea,</v>

1111
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:49.440
I automatically think that that idea is now available to everybody else.

1112
01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:53.380
So I need to jump on that shit pretty quick. So I use it as like, oh yeah,

1113
01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:54.660
way of motivating myself.

1114
01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:59.280
<v 1>Yeah, for sure. Right. And if you, you know, if you have an idea,</v>

1115
01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:01.500
do you ever wonder where it's coming from?

1116
01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:05.530
<v 2>Hmm. Liquid all the time. Where is that? All The Times that I've,</v>

1117
01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:09.710
but I've had it like with mushrooms, I used to work with mushrooms all the time.

1118
01:02:09.850 --> 01:02:13.840
I used to work with them. Mushrooms, yeah, same, same office, same office.

1119
01:02:13.841 --> 01:02:14.340
You know,

1120
01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:19.340
they were called the cubicles over colleagues and I would mushrooms,

1121
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:22.350
I've worked with him. I always felt like I was downloading stuff.

1122
01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:25.740
I always felt like it was being pulled into my head from somewhere else.

1123
01:02:26.810 --> 01:02:27.040
[inaudible]

1124
01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:30.520
<v 1>very similar. Um, a lot of people have very similar experiences,</v>

1125
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:34.820
<v 2>so I always feel like I'm receiving it from someone else and I, I think that's,</v>

1126
01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:38.090
it's a good way of kind of detaching myself from it. Not taking ownership of it.

1127
01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.073
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1128
01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.080
Steven Pressfield wrote about that in a really unique way in the war of art

1129
01:02:42.081 --> 01:02:46.160
because he talked about how just showing up and counting on the muse,

1130
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:49.280
like the thinking about the muse as a real thing. You know,

1131
01:02:49.290 --> 01:02:51.230
the music has always been like some,

1132
01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:54.680
the idea is like something's coming to you with these ideas.

1133
01:02:54.681 --> 01:02:56.900
Something like something magical. Right.

1134
01:02:56.930 --> 01:03:01.100
And so I think his idea is to treat it like it is magical and respect it.

1135
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:06.350
And to show up every day at work at the same time and, and some in the muse.

1136
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:10.280
And then if you did just do that with discipline and the act as a professional,

1137
01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:13.880
all this stuff comes to you. Where does it come from? Well,

1138
01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:16.220
let's just say it comes from the Muse. It might not,

1139
01:03:16.550 --> 01:03:20.150
let's just say it does treat it like it does and it works out like that.

1140
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:23.240
It's one of those weird ones. Whereas if you pretend it's magic,

1141
01:03:23.241 --> 01:03:27.110
it kind of works like magic. But if you just analyze the losers,

1142
01:03:27.111 --> 01:03:31.250
neurons firing in my brain and the collective work of all these other people

1143
01:03:31.251 --> 01:03:33.440
that I've ever experienced in movies and literature,

1144
01:03:33.441 --> 01:03:34.910
they're all feeling through Maine.

1145
01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:38.690
So let's not get carried away about the pretentiousness of creativity.

1146
01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:41.720
Might be pretentious. It might be pretentious. Think that way.

1147
01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:46.520
But you might be open to the idea that let's just pretend that it's magic.

1148
01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:47.960
Let's just pretend.

1149
01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:51.680
Just trick yourself into thinking that it's magic and then operate like it's

1150
01:03:51.681 --> 01:03:55.020
magic. But then give it the respect as if it's like, you know,

1151
01:03:55.730 --> 01:03:59.300
piss off a wizard cause you show up late. Right. Show up on time,

1152
01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:03.260
do it and treat it like you're respected. Yeah. It keeps you humble.

1153
01:04:03.261 --> 01:04:07.220
It keeps you appreciative. Yeah, I would say so. I like that there.

1154
01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:09.260
It's not a bad theory, but it's got a lot of holes in it,

1155
01:04:09.290 --> 01:04:11.600
I'm sure a smarter person than us to shoot right down.

1156
01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:18.350
What do you, um, I know, I know know how much you've talked about this,

1157
01:04:18.351 --> 01:04:19.430
but you and I've talked about it,

1158
01:04:19.431 --> 01:04:23.570
that you've been thinking about fighting again. Where are you at with that?

1159
01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:25.923
<v 2>Um,</v>

1160
01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:28.630
right now on what I'm going to do is I'm going to get back in the Usada testing

1161
01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:28.960
pool.

1162
01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:32.890
I have to be in the pool for four months and then once I'm in the pool for four

1163
01:04:32.891 --> 01:04:36.280
months, then I have the option to fight if I choose to.

1164
01:04:36.610 --> 01:04:39.370
I happen to be the first guy they test for mushrooms for sure.

1165
01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.530
The new mushroom test. Absolutely. To you.

1166
01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:47.010
I'll bet I'll be happy test pilot for that. I don't mind that until, yeah, no,

1167
01:04:47.110 --> 01:04:49.660
it's, I mean, so I've got to do four months cause I never officially retired.

1168
01:04:49.930 --> 01:04:52.720
And so the, the whole thing show up at six in the morning.

1169
01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:54.640
You've got to pee in a cup, show your blood. Yeah.

1170
01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:56.400
The problem is I'm on the road all the time and that,

1171
01:04:56.410 --> 01:04:59.890
this is a conversation I've had with Jeff Novitsky is because like I can't give

1172
01:04:59.891 --> 01:05:02.800
them La, I don't know exactly how it works, but as far as I know,

1173
01:05:02.801 --> 01:05:04.750
you have to give them like three addresses.

1174
01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:07.120
These are the places that you're most likely going to be at.

1175
01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:09.250
And if you're not at any of those places,

1176
01:05:09.251 --> 01:05:12.580
you have to let them know where you are. And I always it,

1177
01:05:12.830 --> 01:05:14.530
if you leave in your hotel to go to a pub,

1178
01:05:14.890 --> 01:05:17.050
you have to tell them what you have to. If you're within an hour,

1179
01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:18.610
the place they give you like an hour

1180
01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:21.940
<v 0>or two to get back to one of those addresses. I don't know. I mean,</v>

1181
01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:24.100
you know what? If you're on the hottest of all hot dates,

1182
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:29.190
Jesus Christ Usada the Wicki Cock block and asshole.

1183
01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:32.810
I'm out here trying to get my freak on with this wonderful lady Trump.

1184
01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:36.120
Check my pee at four in the morning. I don't know the fuck Outta here.

1185
01:05:36.270 --> 01:05:37.540
I don't mind though. I don't mind that,

1186
01:05:37.570 --> 01:05:41.740
but I'm going to see my tongue rages and then you know my options are open.

1187
01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:46.310
It would be really nice if there was a way where they could meet.

1188
01:05:46.330 --> 01:05:48.190
I'm talking crazy. Really?

1189
01:05:48.191 --> 01:05:50.650
I should shut the fuck up because now I'm thinking it's creepy because I'm

1190
01:05:50.651 --> 01:05:52.120
thinking like transhumanist shit. I'm like,

1191
01:05:52.121 --> 01:05:56.860
maybe they just have a chip in you like all the time and you just upload every

1192
01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:59.140
day. They know, hey, look at that Dan Howard. He hasn't done anything.

1193
01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:02.350
Everything's good. Vitamin B's a little high, but that's water-soluble.

1194
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:05.930
That's good. Much. That's a bit much. I know to be paid a lot more to

1195
01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:09.400
100% it's a stupid idea. I shouldn't have sex on that,

1196
01:06:09.550 --> 01:06:13.810
but imagine if there was no price and if you had to get a new chip.

1197
01:06:13.811 --> 01:06:15.190
If you fought for a Bella tour,

1198
01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:18.730
then there was problems turning off your old chip cause it was like a,

1199
01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:21.160
like if you get an iPhone, you try to switch to Android,

1200
01:06:21.161 --> 01:06:25.180
good fucking luck cupcake. They're going to ruin you with those I imessages you.

1201
01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:26.890
You're not going to get half of your messages,

1202
01:06:26.891 --> 01:06:28.180
you're all going to be all fucked up.

1203
01:06:28.181 --> 01:06:29.890
So you're gonna have to figure out a way to switch it over.

1204
01:06:30.130 --> 01:06:33.100
So what if when you move over to belt or you get one of those Bella tore chips,

1205
01:06:33.310 --> 01:06:36.040
the UFC chip cancels out to belt or chip,

1206
01:06:36.070 --> 01:06:39.670
everybody gets mad when a few chip would definitely be way different to the one

1207
01:06:39.671 --> 01:06:43.000
I've seen chip on your steroids to shoot some right into you.

1208
01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:47.640
You got the old pride chip in there that keeps switching on every now and then

1209
01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:51.370
it will. Caden all bullshit aside. But what if there was like,

1210
01:06:51.610 --> 01:06:55.840
we know that testosterone levels just in natural human beings,

1211
01:06:55.870 --> 01:07:00.610
it's not fair, right? They're not fair. They're not evenly distributed.

1212
01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:03.460
There's some people that are high testosterone and there's some people that are

1213
01:07:03.461 --> 01:07:07.900
lower testosterone and it doesn't necessarily correlate with success,

1214
01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:11.500
but it's pretty high. It's probably pretty high correlation with success.

1215
01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:12.910
There's something there, right?

1216
01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:18.240
What if there was a way where they would put everybody at the same level

1217
01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:22.040
electronically? They just put this little Flint just chip and they, and they go,

1218
01:07:22.070 --> 01:07:26.290
what's going on is your adrenal glands and your endocrine system are not firing

1219
01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:27.400
correctly.

1220
01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:32.400
So what we'll do is give your DNA the signal to ramp up its production of

1221
01:07:32.471 --> 01:07:35.330
testosterone by 170% I don't like it.

1222
01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:38.140
So you crank it up so it makes your body do,

1223
01:07:38.141 --> 01:07:41.680
it makes your body crank up your growth hormone, your thyroid,

1224
01:07:41.681 --> 01:07:45.880
everything is perfect. So everyone fights at like a perfect level.

1225
01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:48.740
Everyone fights at whatever the number is, but then, but that's,

1226
01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:52.360
that's natural selection play. Now in MMA, I like that natural variance.

1227
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:55.270
That's what like some people have got naturally heavy hands,

1228
01:07:55.610 --> 01:07:57.010
so people are naturally stronger than others.

1229
01:07:57.011 --> 01:07:59.380
Some people have got more testosterone than others, you know, it's just,

1230
01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:03.040
it's a natural advantage, which I like to see play out. And I do too. My g,

1231
01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:04.930
my idea sucks. Terrible idea.

1232
01:08:05.170 --> 01:08:10.170
But how long before we see like some sort of like physical equality,

1233
01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:14.390
we'd have to want it to be implemented differently. You know,

1234
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:19.710
I think that's one of the reasons why I'm so opposed to the idea that everyone

1235
01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:21.980
is the same. You know?

1236
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:26.030
Like there's something good about everyone being the same. Like we're,

1237
01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:29.930
we're clearly not the same. No one's at all. And some people,

1238
01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:33.680
when you run into like certain dudes like Alistair Overeem, you're like, oh,

1239
01:08:33.681 --> 01:08:38.360
okay, you're from another planet fucking size you. How strong that dude is.

1240
01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:41.060
Especially when he's like, when he fought Brock Lesnar, you're like, okay,

1241
01:08:41.061 --> 01:08:42.740
what fucking planet are you from man?

1242
01:08:42.741 --> 01:08:44.420
Cause you're not from planet where I'm from.

1243
01:08:44.690 --> 01:08:48.440
You're so like ridiculously powerful. You know? And there's,

1244
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:51.380
there's other people that just, they're not, you know, they're marathon runners.

1245
01:08:51.381 --> 01:08:53.930
They weigh 130 pounds. You're never going to be any bigger than that.

1246
01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:58.610
There's not even, this is not even, you know, some people are Tyson fury,

1247
01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:02.990
some people are me, you know, some people are Brock Lesnar, some people you,

1248
01:09:02.991 --> 01:09:04.820
it's like fucking, it's not even,

1249
01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:09.380
it's just weird like people where a weird conglomeration of shapes.

1250
01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:12.650
But then the thing is if it was, if it was completely even across the board,

1251
01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:16.160
then there would be an opportunity for one person to be completely superior to

1252
01:09:16.161 --> 01:09:19.460
everybody else. Whereas with the natural selection like you've got,

1253
01:09:19.461 --> 01:09:22.550
you're never going to get Brock Lesnar went in marathons so he can always

1254
01:09:22.551 --> 01:09:26.600
appreciate a marathon runner and what they can do. You know? True. That's true.

1255
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:28.360
Keeps everyone humble. Well it's,

1256
01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:31.670
it definitely shows you that there's merits to all sorts of different shapes and

1257
01:09:31.671 --> 01:09:34.160
sizes. Like particularly marathon runners, right?

1258
01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:37.370
If you want to be able to go somewhere and stay alive, you know,

1259
01:09:37.371 --> 01:09:39.680
you have to keep moving. It's one of the benefits,

1260
01:09:39.681 --> 01:09:44.120
like one of the things that I think inherently we respect about marathon runners

1261
01:09:44.121 --> 01:09:48.140
is they can keep running and we know we can't keep running. So why do you run?

1262
01:09:48.141 --> 01:09:50.600
You run to get away from things or to chase things. Well,

1263
01:09:50.601 --> 01:09:52.310
what have you chasing something and you get tired.

1264
01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:55.250
What if you're running away from something, you get tired, they don't get tired.

1265
01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:57.620
That's admirable. Like it locks into our,

1266
01:09:57.621 --> 01:09:59.990
it's like it gets a part of your psyche. Yeah.

1267
01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:03.770
I've always felt like the optimal like fight condition for like a,

1268
01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:07.400
like a lifelong martial artist is to find that balance between all of those

1269
01:10:07.401 --> 01:10:11.420
things. So you've got, you know, an equal balance of everything. You're not,

1270
01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.340
you don't excel at one particular thing. You know,

1271
01:10:13.341 --> 01:10:15.650
like you get these martial artists that are just, you know,

1272
01:10:15.651 --> 01:10:20.510
these juiced up monsters, right? I can see a glaring weakness in your,

1273
01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:23.270
in your technique already, because I know it's called, it's finite.

1274
01:10:23.271 --> 01:10:24.200
I know it's going to run out.

1275
01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:28.640
And then I look at somebody else who's focused entirely on technique and they've

1276
01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:31.670
gotten no muscle mass and no physicality to them. And I'm like, well,

1277
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.760
I can see the glaring weakness in your technique because you're gonna struggle

1278
01:10:34.761 --> 01:10:39.180
to apply it. You know what I mean? So it's like, yes, finding that goldilocks.

1279
01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:42.170
So in that beautiful balance in the middle. Yeah. Where is that zone?

1280
01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:44.820
I don't know. I've been searching for it for my look for my whole life.

1281
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:47.540
Different with different styles. But here's one thing I can tell you.

1282
01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:52.900
Other than 145 pounds and the 185 pounds every single way,

1283
01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:56.360
classes dominated by a wrestler.

1284
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:59.960
Stop and think about that.

1285
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:04.990
But Henry Pseudo one 25 and one 35 then at one 45 Max Holloway,

1286
01:11:05.241 --> 01:11:09.980
that's one way class. Then you go to 55 cubby motherfucking Neuroma, gun Madoff,

1287
01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:14.130
who's one of the scariest grapplers in the sport. You go up to 70 Camaro.

1288
01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:18.210
<v 1>Uzman and Colby Covington, two fucking beast. Grapplers Yep.</v>

1289
01:11:18.810 --> 01:11:22.350
You go up to 85 you got the exception. That's Robert Whitaker. But guess what?

1290
01:11:22.351 --> 01:11:24.870
I thought he lost against you over marrow. The second fight,

1291
01:11:25.170 --> 01:11:28.470
I thought Ramiro blends three rounds. I thought Romero beat him. I mean,

1292
01:11:28.471 --> 01:11:31.740
and Robert Whitaker, I'm a giant fan of his. I think he's fucking amazing.

1293
01:11:31.741 --> 01:11:33.660
And he's, he a Pitta Mises to me,

1294
01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:38.010
like the best of all well-rounded capabilities.

1295
01:11:38.011 --> 01:11:42.270
His take down defense is excellent. He's a great striker, he's accurate,

1296
01:11:42.271 --> 01:11:44.280
he's got knockout power, he's got everything.

1297
01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:46.620
I just felt like in that second fight,

1298
01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:49.290
it does seem to me that you all had done enough to win,

1299
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:54.820
but I'm open to an argument against that. It was not, it was one egregious,

1300
01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:58.390
like an awful decision where you disgusted by it. It was like, Ooh,

1301
01:11:58.391 --> 01:12:00.420
I think that one, I'd have to go and watch it again.

1302
01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:02.860
But I think you would make a real good argument that you will,

1303
01:12:02.861 --> 01:12:05.250
was the only one that heard him. And you heard him a couple of times,

1304
01:12:05.251 --> 01:12:06.900
particularly in the second fight. Yeah.

1305
01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:10.340
I think I had the last three rounds seal in that fight where he's always asleep.

1306
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:13.800
Thoughts that people always think that he's, you know, people always,

1307
01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:15.870
I've got this perspective of them that he's this really,

1308
01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:18.840
really fast star tree's very explosive and stuff. But he's, he doesn't,

1309
01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:22.440
it just kind of little you him with that slow snow sneaks on you and then

1310
01:12:22.441 --> 01:12:25.650
explode and then go overseas and he's so scary that you don't know what to do

1311
01:12:25.651 --> 01:12:27.540
when he's lalane cause it was on you.

1312
01:12:27.541 --> 01:12:30.510
You don't wanna attack him cause he's so fucking fast.

1313
01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:33.480
You know that guy when he landed that flying knee on Chris Weidman,

1314
01:12:33.481 --> 01:12:38.280
I was like Jesus Christ, he's such a freak athlete man.

1315
01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:41.220
So, okay, that's 85 Robert Whittaker.

1316
01:12:41.221 --> 01:12:45.030
Let's call him that one of two exceptions too. I'll find my weight classes.

1317
01:12:45.150 --> 01:12:47.400
Well let's go to just get done with the male first.

1318
01:12:47.850 --> 01:12:49.150
Cause the females are different animals, right?

1319
01:12:49.450 --> 01:12:53.820
A two Oh five John Jones heavyweight Daniel Cormier.

1320
01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:58.290
I mean that is fucking crazy. There's not a gun. If you wanted to ask someone,

1321
01:12:58.291 --> 01:13:01.860
Hey, I'm a my kids, thinking about becoming a mixed martial arts fighter, what,

1322
01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:04.740
what uh, discipline do you think you should start with first?

1323
01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:09.090
It's either like a traditional martial arts where you learn how to kick when

1324
01:13:09.170 --> 01:13:12.300
you're like real little and just learn a lot of flashy kicks cause you'll carry

1325
01:13:12.301 --> 01:13:15.630
that with you. Uh, and you'll develop leg dexterity.

1326
01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:19.380
But then wrestling for sure wrestling, cause if you're a dominant wrestler,

1327
01:13:19.381 --> 01:13:23.460
that advantage is, if you have, if you're real similar and everything else,

1328
01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:26.580
but you're dominant and wrestling, you're gonna be able to control the clinch.

1329
01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:27.660
You're gonna be able to get the guy down.

1330
01:13:27.661 --> 01:13:30.090
You're gonna be able to do things to them. And it just, you see it,

1331
01:13:30.330 --> 01:13:33.490
it might not be the most, the most glamorous way to win fights. You know,

1332
01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:36.570
like sometimes people get upset that someone takes someone down and just kinda

1333
01:13:36.571 --> 01:13:38.250
hits them while they're down. But guess what?

1334
01:13:38.251 --> 01:13:40.410
They're hitting him and they're doing something to that person.

1335
01:13:40.411 --> 01:13:42.270
That person doesn't want to be done.

1336
01:13:42.330 --> 01:13:44.670
And maybe it's not the most exciting thing for you to watch.

1337
01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:48.900
But as someone who respects what the sport is supposed to be all about,

1338
01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:52.200
the like, what can this guy do to that guy?

1339
01:13:52.230 --> 01:13:55.020
Well that guy can take you down and punch you in the fucking face and you can't

1340
01:13:55.021 --> 01:13:57.780
do anything about it. And even if you get up and you say, I'm not hurt. Okay,

1341
01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:00.570
well you never got up though. Yeah. This is a viable,

1342
01:14:00.571 --> 01:14:04.800
legitimate way to win fights. And the guys who can smash from the top,

1343
01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:07.560
they're the most scary proposition because you can't get up.

1344
01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:10.530
You can't get up and kebabs on there talking shit to you and going,

1345
01:14:10.531 --> 01:14:14.380
come on talk, boom, talk now, boom. Terrifying.

1346
01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:17.310
<v 2>Right. Tariffs can't get them off of you. But that's a c for me.</v>

1347
01:14:17.311 --> 01:14:21.020
I've kind of started to change my perspective because everybody you speak to

1348
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:25.620
kind of divides Ma MMA into, you know, th th the grepping Oz, the ground arts,

1349
01:14:25.621 --> 01:14:27.510
Jujitsu, wrestling,

1350
01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:31.590
and then the striking arts like loosely into three categories.

1351
01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:35.070
But I don't, I don't see wrestling as a part of that. I see wrestling,

1352
01:14:35.071 --> 01:14:36.360
there's like that's the foundation.

1353
01:14:36.361 --> 01:14:38.740
That's the glue that holds everything together. Yeah, I think so.

1354
01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:40.080
I think like when you watch a,

1355
01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:44.160
a fight where someone is winning with just wrestling and very little else,

1356
01:14:44.190 --> 01:14:47.320
that's a bore in flight because it's not a fight. It's a wrestling match. Right?

1357
01:14:47.610 --> 01:14:51.180
The wrestling is the thing that enables you to utilize the submissions or the

1358
01:14:51.181 --> 01:14:55.320
striking and it like, there's something instinctively about is like whenever,

1359
01:14:55.530 --> 01:14:58.950
whenever there's a fight where they're just wrestling or there's someone just

1360
01:14:58.951 --> 01:15:02.400
dominate in the top position and not using it at all, the fans get restless.

1361
01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:03.870
They start to boot because they like,

1362
01:15:03.871 --> 01:15:06.390
they feel like they're being robbed of what, what they came to see.

1363
01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:08.150
And that's my own,

1364
01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:12.000
my only criticism when it comes to wrestling is to use just wrestling.

1365
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:15.090
Like you've got to understand that that is the foundation.

1366
01:15:15.091 --> 01:15:16.980
That's the glue that you bolt everything else onto.

1367
01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:20.640
So that's why it could be so good because he uses wrestling to put people in a

1368
01:15:20.641 --> 01:15:23.610
position where he can beat them up. Or, I mean, chiller Dao,

1369
01:15:23.730 --> 01:15:26.220
he used his wrestling to keep people in a position where he could knock them

1370
01:15:26.221 --> 01:15:29.970
out. But wrestling, that's, that's the glue. That's the part, you know,

1371
01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:32.520
[inaudible] about pseudo is, is that he's,

1372
01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:37.450
and instead of having a method of wrestling, he has principles of wrestling.

1373
01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:40.380
He understands that to break your body down. And that's like,

1374
01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:43.830
I understand that from a striking perspective and it's taken me years to start

1375
01:15:43.831 --> 01:15:47.130
to see that from a grappling perspective as well. Um, you know,

1376
01:15:47.131 --> 01:15:50.070
like training with the old 10 planet guys and stuff,

1377
01:15:50.071 --> 01:15:53.700
like they had quite a quite a um, uh,

1378
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:55.380
what's the best way of putting it,

1379
01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:59.670
an instinctive understanding of how to break down and control the human body

1380
01:15:59.671 --> 01:16:01.620
based on the techniques that Eddie had developed.

1381
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:05.230
And it took me ages to kind of start to figure out that east,

1382
01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:08.040
it's not like I'm not trying to learn techniques to do that.

1383
01:16:08.041 --> 01:16:09.540
I've got to understand the principle of it,

1384
01:16:09.541 --> 01:16:14.280
to break it down and to watch the Hutto chain things together against the

1385
01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:15.030
Demetrius Johnson, you know,

1386
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:18.570
go for the inside rape and then Demetrius Johnson steps out so we ankle picks

1387
01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:19.770
him in the same process.

1388
01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:23.550
Like the principal instead of the method is a beautiful thing to watch.

1389
01:16:23.850 --> 01:16:27.330
<v 1>Does. Also the mental toughness aspect of wrestling that I think is undeniable.</v>

1390
01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:31.440
She teaches you how to be super uncomfortable at an early age and there's

1391
01:16:31.441 --> 01:16:35.190
something about that uncomfortable grind that if you can get through that and

1392
01:16:35.191 --> 01:16:39.750
make that normal for you, you could get through almost anything. And these guys,

1393
01:16:39.751 --> 01:16:41.430
you see them like perfect examples,

1394
01:16:41.431 --> 01:16:45.780
so Hutto versus I'm Mile Mariah's my own rises, lighten him on fire.

1395
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:47.490
In that first round, it looked terrifying.

1396
01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:51.870
It looked like Henry's in real danger of being killed by a far superior Stryker.

1397
01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:55.410
I mean Marlin looked huge. He looked like a beast.

1398
01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:57.720
He's hitting him with these horrific leg kicks,

1399
01:16:58.170 --> 01:16:59.820
but then motherfucker never skipped a beat.

1400
01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:01.650
He just fired back up for the second round.

1401
01:17:01.651 --> 01:17:04.680
He would go bet you right in your face. Yeah, it was crazy. Watch out.

1402
01:17:05.490 --> 01:17:10.490
Is this the second DJ him come back and start dominating Mariah's in the

1403
01:17:10.571 --> 01:17:11.120
Sacramento.

1404
01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:14.420
It was almost like what has happened as someone puts something in Marlin's

1405
01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:18.740
drink, it's like, no. So Hudl is just so God damn tough. He discourages you.

1406
01:17:19.230 --> 01:17:21.770
He freaks people out. I think a lot of people can them out.

1407
01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:24.350
The second fight against Demetrius Johnson with the cough kicks.

1408
01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:28.220
Like when he CalEd Wilson Hayes, I was like, wait a minute.

1409
01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:31.640
Like now he looks like a karate master. Like what the fuck is this?

1410
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:35.300
Like he was fighting like karate guy and lighting Wilson up and I was like,

1411
01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:37.400
this is crazy. And I was like, okay,

1412
01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:41.120
this like when we're talking about v tour learning kicks late in his career,

1413
01:17:41.150 --> 01:17:43.340
this is just a super athlete. This is what it is.

1414
01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:46.040
And maybe the best super athlete we've ever had in the sport.

1415
01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:49.910
Arguably when we think about as physical accomplishments of going from Olympic

1416
01:17:49.911 --> 01:17:54.620
gold medalist in wrestling. Then he went golden gloves, boxing email,

1417
01:17:54.650 --> 01:17:57.710
that whole story about him living in the gym after he won the gold medal.

1418
01:17:57.830 --> 01:18:00.860
Really want to gold medal in the Olympics. This is from will Harris will,

1419
01:18:00.861 --> 01:18:04.580
Harris told me this and I think there's a video about it from will Harris

1420
01:18:04.581 --> 01:18:06.380
productions, but he, um,

1421
01:18:06.710 --> 01:18:11.540
he won the fucking gold medal in the Olympics and then immersed himself in

1422
01:18:11.541 --> 01:18:14.060
boxing and was living in a fucking boxing gym.

1423
01:18:14.061 --> 01:18:17.240
And sleeping in a boxing gym after winning the gold medal in Olympics.

1424
01:18:17.241 --> 01:18:21.410
Just drive that. Motherfucker's got blinders on.

1425
01:18:21.411 --> 01:18:24.380
He's just going for kicking out some demons. There's some demons in that.

1426
01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:28.820
He's working out for show whatever it is. [inaudible] keep working them out.

1427
01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:29.450
I love it.

1428
01:18:29.450 --> 01:18:34.340
I love watching these extreme outliers like guys who can do things like that.

1429
01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.290
And you know, you know Luke Thomas's right?

1430
01:18:36.710 --> 01:18:39.080
Luke comics has a really had a really interesting take on it that I really

1431
01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:42.530
appreciated and agreed with. Said you got to remember that.

1432
01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:47.720
So Hutto early in his career was, it wasn't consistent. He was missing weight,

1433
01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:50.720
you know, it didn't have the best performances. It wasn't the same.

1434
01:18:50.850 --> 01:18:55.850
He didn't have the same focus and then reinvents himself after the Demetrius

1435
01:18:57.350 --> 01:19:02.350
Johnson loss and becomes a fucking demon in the gym and works with all these

1436
01:19:03.010 --> 01:19:06.170
[inaudible]. Who are those people that came here? Is it neuro force?

1437
01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:09.560
What is the, the company that works with them that works on, yeah,

1438
01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:10.880
find the name of those folks.

1439
01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:16.660
So ridiculously scientifically monitored testing of everything he does.

1440
01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:21.770
His workload is Neuro Force One neuro force month. So like these,

1441
01:19:21.771 --> 01:19:23.240
there's fucking scientists working with them.

1442
01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:27.410
So scientists and elite trainers and wrestling coaches and kickboxing coaches.

1443
01:19:27.770 --> 01:19:30.920
And then all of a sudden he emerges as this murderer. Right?

1444
01:19:30.921 --> 01:19:34.640
Like you see when he blasted away a TJ Dillashaw, you're like, Holy Shit,

1445
01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:40.060
like this set this Henry Hutto is a different person than what you saw at the

1446
01:19:40.221 --> 01:19:43.820
beginning of his career. Like he's, he's adaptable. You know, he's so adaptable.

1447
01:19:44.090 --> 01:19:45.500
He's amazing man. I mean that's the,

1448
01:19:45.501 --> 01:19:47.630
that's the thing that's beautiful about it as well as the,

1449
01:19:47.631 --> 01:19:49.970
I mean he's not only adapted from one sport to another,

1450
01:19:49.971 --> 01:19:53.840
but you can see how his style styles adopted as a, as a martial artist as well.

1451
01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:55.580
He's still getting better. I mean,

1452
01:19:55.581 --> 01:19:59.840
I guarantee you getting lit up by Marlin barrage in the first round is going to

1453
01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:02.600
turn him into a better kickboxer for sure. Cause he knows what,

1454
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:05.710
what someone did them, you know, he knows like, wow, Jesus writes this guy.

1455
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:08.060
If guys, this guy could keep this up, you know,

1456
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:12.240
but he wilted under that pressure, that fucking psycho wrestler pressure.

1457
01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:16.510
You know? That's real shit man. Yeah. That's cubby pressure. That's Henry.

1458
01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:17.493
So Hutto pressure,

1459
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:20.310
those psycho wrestlers and you kind of only get that from grind.

1460
01:20:20.370 --> 01:20:21.840
You can only get that from like,

1461
01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:24.670
like forcing yourself through those hours on the mat. Yeah.

1462
01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.310
Don't build that any other way. And if,

1463
01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:30.210
and if you stop and you take some time off that muscle weekends,

1464
01:20:30.211 --> 01:20:32.040
you need to start building that strength back up again.

1465
01:20:32.130 --> 01:20:36.300
You're calcifying you felt your feelings. Oh, he's just my coming a psychopath.

1466
01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:40.890
Okay. The best ones when they're in there, man won't be a wolf.

1467
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:44.550
They're just just plow calcified. You'll feel it. Yeah, I like it.

1468
01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:49.640
There's like a primal breakthrough that you could see in some great fights where

1469
01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:55.640
it's almost like they're down to just the animal and technique.

1470
01:20:56.940 --> 01:21:00.330
Just animal and technique. No more person that's just savagery,

1471
01:21:00.450 --> 01:21:03.000
just wild exchanges and savagery.

1472
01:21:03.210 --> 01:21:06.260
And one guy tried to finish the other guy and they're both getting rock and

1473
01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:09.450
you're like, holy fuck, this could go any way. And even as,

1474
01:21:09.451 --> 01:21:11.460
even as people that appreciate the technique,

1475
01:21:11.461 --> 01:21:13.800
there's still something instinctive about that as we watch it.

1476
01:21:13.890 --> 01:21:17.360
Where like that prime will fail in the car racing.

1477
01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:21.270
What makes everybody so excited when you see a fucking wild, crazy war?

1478
01:21:21.450 --> 01:21:25.380
Everybody gets fired up or they're like gripping like out of Sonya,

1479
01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:29.250
like out of Sanya, Kevin, Kevin, Calvin, Gaslamp. Holy Shit.

1480
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:33.270
That is the epitome of one of those fights. Yeah. That's the Mike Perry.

1481
01:21:33.330 --> 01:21:36.270
I see that. Yes. Dude. That's another one.

1482
01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:41.340
These Jesus Christ fucking nose was like a broken fire.

1483
01:21:41.341 --> 01:21:45.990
Hydrogen just spraying blood all over the back and he still didn't tap. Yeah.

1484
01:21:46.050 --> 01:21:48.900
And some people think he's still wanting to fight. Yeah. Yeah.

1485
01:21:48.901 --> 01:21:51.480
What do you think? So I have to go watch it again and try to score it.

1486
01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:54.570
I think when, whenever it was a close fight or there's like,

1487
01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:59.580
sometimes I like the way a certain type of fighter, the way they, uh,

1488
01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:04.660
like I prefer someone who's doing damage versus someone that take someone down.

1489
01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:06.480
It doesn't do anything. Right.

1490
01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:11.310
And sometimes you'll have a kickboxer who's lighting a guy up for like the first

1491
01:22:11.311 --> 01:22:12.480
minute and a half of the round,

1492
01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:15.570
but then the wrestler take them down and maybe stay on top of them for three or

1493
01:22:15.571 --> 01:22:18.700
four minutes but don't do anything. And they'll give it to the wrestler. Yes.

1494
01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:22.950
Which I'm like, okay, maybe, but it's, I think it's debatable,

1495
01:22:22.951 --> 01:22:25.500
especially if it's 50 50 it's like two and a half minutes down,

1496
01:22:25.501 --> 01:22:26.400
two and a half minutes up.

1497
01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:28.860
Well what happened in those two and a half minutes downs? Yes,

1498
01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:30.060
you held position,

1499
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:34.650
but did you get it back from what that guy was doing to you in the first two and

1500
01:22:34.651 --> 01:22:38.460
a half minutes when he was chomping at your legs and kicking you in the body?

1501
01:22:38.461 --> 01:22:42.450
Like I don't know where to score that. And I think it's not really,

1502
01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:45.250
it's not really clear. It's too subjective. No, he's,

1503
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:47.310
he's always over opinion-based. Really.

1504
01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:51.750
It's down to the interpretation of the person watching and this is how your own

1505
01:22:51.751 --> 01:22:54.870
personal life experiences come into play. If you're a sport Jujitsu guy,

1506
01:22:54.871 --> 01:22:56.600
you're going to say it different to a, you know, a,

1507
01:22:56.620 --> 01:22:59.670
a boxing coach or something like that. And the other thing as well,

1508
01:22:59.671 --> 01:23:02.760
when it comes to like the stats and you look at the total strikes,

1509
01:23:02.761 --> 01:23:05.680
landed significant strikes landed. I always argue

1510
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:08.740
<v 2>some strikes are far more significant than others. Sure.</v>

1511
01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:12.960
Like if you land 50 significant strikes in a, in a round, sorry, in,

1512
01:23:12.970 --> 01:23:15.790
in a fi and someone lands 10 significant strikes,

1513
01:23:15.791 --> 01:23:19.840
but those 10 significant strikes blow you, blow your eye, break your nose,

1514
01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:21.250
knock you down one time.

1515
01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:24.520
It doesn't matter what the other significant strikes did if they weren't as

1516
01:23:24.521 --> 01:23:28.720
significant. And I think like with the Mike Perry Vicenta Luchay fight,

1517
01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:32.170
I would say that that knee was probably the most significant strike of the

1518
01:23:32.171 --> 01:23:35.270
fight. So I'm going to weigh that so much heavier than,

1519
01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:37.900
than in any of the other significant strikes. It's, you know what I mean?

1520
01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:39.590
<v 1>Yeah. I 100% agree with you.</v>

1521
01:23:39.591 --> 01:23:44.591
I think we were living in this compromise of the 10 point must system that we

1522
01:23:44.871 --> 01:23:45.704
don't have to be.

1523
01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:48.550
<v 2>What about the way that pride used to do where they would score the person</v>

1524
01:23:48.730 --> 01:23:50.500
finish finishing stronger as a heavier,

1525
01:23:50.530 --> 01:23:52.180
because that's another argument that comes in.

1526
01:23:52.181 --> 01:23:56.050
If you look at Mike Perry at the end of that third round, you go fourth round,

1527
01:23:56.051 --> 01:23:58.900
fifth round, he's got nothing left like that, noses a mess.

1528
01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:02.620
So then I think instinctively I do that and I try not to,

1529
01:24:02.621 --> 01:24:04.300
I do try and score it per round,

1530
01:24:04.301 --> 01:24:07.930
but I think instinctively if somebody finishes stronger, which again,

1531
01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:10.780
y'all Ramiro against Robert Whitaker, second time around,

1532
01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:14.080
he finished stronger than Whitaker buck, you know, quite obviously.

1533
01:24:14.250 --> 01:24:17.200
And I think that people naturally lean towards the person that is,

1534
01:24:17.710 --> 01:24:19.780
they've overcome the Hump, but start the fight.

1535
01:24:19.781 --> 01:24:23.500
It's almost like you've got a round or two t you can kind of forgive the person

1536
01:24:23.501 --> 01:24:25.120
and they before they take over.

1537
01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:26.640
<v 1>Right. Well, here's a perfect example.</v>

1538
01:24:26.641 --> 01:24:29.910
The first round with Liz Carmouche and Valentina Shevchenko,

1539
01:24:30.090 --> 01:24:35.090
that was a fairly uneventful round in terms of significant strikes landed in

1540
01:24:35.221 --> 01:24:37.500
terms of anybody establishing any dominance.

1541
01:24:37.730 --> 01:24:41.100
Usually you just got to see Valentina dealing with the movement and advancing

1542
01:24:41.370 --> 01:24:44.940
and landing a little bit more than Liz. But that's it. Not much. Right,

1543
01:24:44.941 --> 01:24:46.130
but that's a ten nine round.

1544
01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:49.410
How could a brown where they're scrapping and they're going at each other,

1545
01:24:49.411 --> 01:24:52.590
but no one gets knocked down, but it's a fucking wild, chaotic, crazy round.

1546
01:24:52.770 --> 01:24:54.330
How can that also be a ten nine round?

1547
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:57.740
<v 2>Yeah. Right. Yeah, I hear you. But then, but that's, see that's where,</v>

1548
01:24:57.980 --> 01:25:01.230
that's where people's perspective of fights can, can sometimes, you know,

1549
01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:04.670
lean one way because if someone has a really, really big last round,

1550
01:25:04.671 --> 01:25:08.780
but they've lost the first two people and not seeing it as in as three sections

1551
01:25:08.781 --> 01:25:13.140
of a, of a fight to be scored. If one person's two rounds ahead. Sometimes like,

1552
01:25:13.230 --> 01:25:14.960
like I said, like I was saying instinctively,

1553
01:25:15.230 --> 01:25:19.250
if someone has a strong round you skull towards that person because it was more

1554
01:25:19.251 --> 01:25:21.470
impactful what they did to their opponent. Yes.

1555
01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:23.840
So if you take someone down and control them and hold them,

1556
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:26.390
even if you do that for four minutes of around,

1557
01:25:26.391 --> 01:25:29.300
but for one minute of that round, you get lit up against the fence.

1558
01:25:30.050 --> 01:25:32.840
I'm always going to go towards the person that was doing the lighten up.

1559
01:25:32.841 --> 01:25:36.590
But yes, that was more significant and more impactful on me as a viewer.

1560
01:25:36.710 --> 01:25:38.270
If I'm choosing a tribal leader,

1561
01:25:38.690 --> 01:25:41.840
I'm going for the guy that had the one minute of success on the feet as opposed

1562
01:25:41.841 --> 01:25:43.460
to the guy that was holding him down for four.

1563
01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:44.181
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1564
01:25:44.181 --> 01:25:47.720
Unless the guy who holds them down eventually mountains him like from game of

1565
01:25:47.721 --> 01:25:50.930
Thrones and crushes his fucking head with his thumb through his eyeballs.

1566
01:25:50.931 --> 01:25:55.820
And that was terrifying. That was terrifying. Um, yeah, I see your point,

1567
01:25:55.821 --> 01:25:57.790
I guess. Um, but I,

1568
01:25:58.310 --> 01:26:01.430
I think for sure that there should be another category of,

1569
01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:06.550
of impactful strikes instead of just significant strikes and total strikes.

1570
01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:12.050
There should probably be rocked. Like he got rocked. Like he got like,

1571
01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:14.810
did your legs go and you know when you're covering up,

1572
01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:17.760
<v 2>but then there's a knockdown automatically a 10, eight round.</v>

1573
01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:21.760
<v 1>No, I don't think ten eight is right. I don't think 10 is right.</v>

1574
01:26:21.790 --> 01:26:26.230
I think we should have a comprehensive system that recognizes the fact that

1575
01:26:26.231 --> 01:26:27.640
there's near submissions.

1576
01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:31.270
There's a leg kick that barely touches and there's a leg kick that cripples your

1577
01:26:31.271 --> 01:26:33.550
leg. They should be scored differently.

1578
01:26:33.730 --> 01:26:37.120
We should have like actual numbers that are attributed to these things.

1579
01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:39.820
If we want to have an accumulation of things at the end,

1580
01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:43.300
how much should we count? Total strikes, how much should we count?

1581
01:26:43.301 --> 01:26:46.210
Submission attempts, how much should we count near submission attempts.

1582
01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:49.360
What about submission in times where you're literally saved by the Bell,

1583
01:26:49.450 --> 01:26:53.740
which does happen, right? You're literally like locked up,

1584
01:26:53.770 --> 01:26:58.090
ready to fucking tap and the like. Um, Jens Pulver, BJ Penn, us the first one.

1585
01:26:58.120 --> 01:26:59.950
That's a good one. That's a good one that comes to mind.

1586
01:26:59.951 --> 01:27:03.760
I was going to go with Dylan Dannis his first MMA fight. Okay. Didn't,

1587
01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:04.990
W wasn't the first one,

1588
01:27:04.991 --> 01:27:08.020
didn't even lock up at Doris and the guy got out of it and then he caught him

1589
01:27:08.021 --> 01:27:10.270
with a Darson. The second round. Is that what happened or my thing?

1590
01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:12.700
Am I misconstruing him with somebody else? I don't remember,

1591
01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:17.680
but it's that what I'm going with is there's moments where you go,

1592
01:27:17.681 --> 01:27:22.120
this guy's fucked and then the buzzer rings and you're like, oh,

1593
01:27:22.210 --> 01:27:23.043
he survived.

1594
01:27:23.110 --> 01:27:25.900
But let's see what happens if he comes back and want to say it's tilling dance.

1595
01:27:25.901 --> 01:27:29.110
But I know I'm questioning myself. I've seen too many fights.

1596
01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:30.581
<v 2>Yeah, so what,</v>

1597
01:27:30.581 --> 01:27:33.860
what about if they're knocked and rocked right at the end of the fight?

1598
01:27:34.130 --> 01:27:38.480
Like a Frankie Edgar against gray may not first round. That's interesting too.

1599
01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:42.500
How much is that worth, right? What am I as if the Kulin red,

1600
01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:46.860
an opportunity to add an extra minute to the round extra minute go.

1601
01:27:47.970 --> 01:27:52.040
<v 1>Oh God. Well how about with k one or glory? When they get to three rounds,</v>

1602
01:27:52.041 --> 01:27:56.160
if it's a draw, they go one more round. Everybody goes, fuck it.

1603
01:27:56.740 --> 01:28:00.540
I love it. They thought it was over. You're going to sit back and rest. Right?

1604
01:28:00.770 --> 01:28:03.180
And then the flights is to be more decisive though in the,

1605
01:28:03.310 --> 01:28:05.210
in the first three rounds. Yes. Is it,

1606
01:28:05.390 --> 01:28:09.830
did Dylan Dennis win his first fight in the first round? The second round. Okay.

1607
01:28:10.130 --> 01:28:15.080
So I'm dumb. So the first one was a leg lock. Yes.

1608
01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:18.800
So it wasn't him. It was somebody that landed a fucking Doris,

1609
01:28:18.801 --> 01:28:22.010
like a sick Doris at the end of the first round.

1610
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:24.110
And I want to say it wasn't a Bella Toy,

1611
01:28:24.111 --> 01:28:26.680
now that I think about it was in the UFC. That was the leg lighting.

1612
01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:31.730
Dylan Dannis, who's a top of the food chain, Jujitsu practitioner. He's,

1613
01:28:31.731 --> 01:28:35.120
he's f there's so many guys that if you're going to go to the ground with a guy

1614
01:28:35.121 --> 01:28:38.510
like that, you're in some deep shit push. She's fucking dangerous. Yeah. Yeah.

1615
01:28:38.570 --> 01:28:38.780
He's

1616
01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:41.060
<v 2>out in New York at the moment. The, my, my, uh,</v>

1617
01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:45.390
youtube guys were out there video with him. He's in a real good place to,

1618
01:28:45.530 --> 01:28:50.000
his interview is fascinating and he sees a lot more people see the bravado.

1619
01:28:50.730 --> 01:28:52.490
No, he's great. I think he's, you know,

1620
01:28:52.491 --> 01:28:56.030
he's a very down to earth guy and I think he's, uh, he's just done it on a,

1621
01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:59.500
on a journey until he's, I think he's with the meow brothers at the moment. Oh,

1622
01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:01.970
it was Montel Jackson. No, thanks.

1623
01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:03.540
<v 1>That's first round. Doris.</v>

1624
01:29:04.170 --> 01:29:08.310
I don't think that's it because God damn it now that it wasn't.

1625
01:29:08.311 --> 01:29:09.420
I know it wasn't Dylan Das.

1626
01:29:09.421 --> 01:29:13.680
I'm trying to see what fucking Jujitsu guy was it that slapped on a Doris and

1627
01:29:13.681 --> 01:29:16.830
then finished it the next round. Finished it with a Doris.

1628
01:29:18.030 --> 01:29:18.930
Maybe it was Ferguson.

1629
01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:24.270
It's not going to Nav. This is not going to work.

1630
01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:28.320
I'm never going to remember now cause it's fairly recent, but there's,

1631
01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:33.390
you know that when, when someone's locked up, we've gotten way off track.

1632
01:29:33.391 --> 01:29:36.390
But my point was if someone's locked up in a submission and the buzzer ends

1633
01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:39.420
union, no, that guy was fucked. They was fucked.

1634
01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:43.200
You turn it purple and then the Buzzer rings and he had guys to let go and

1635
01:29:43.201 --> 01:29:46.920
you're like, Ooh, is that a 10 night? That should be worth a lot. 10, seven.

1636
01:29:47.130 --> 01:29:50.370
I don't know man. It's like you're, you're a couple seconds away from death.

1637
01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:54.690
That seems like it should be worth a lot. You try to find a for me. Um,

1638
01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:58.320
who is it? It says what? They dropped the tills scores second round our show.

1639
01:29:58.620 --> 01:30:03.330
No, that was one of the most like obvious Doris chokes you'll ever see.

1640
01:30:03.331 --> 01:30:07.980
Woodley just smooshed him. He smooshed him, but he was so god damn strong.

1641
01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:12.060
Like you could see that Doris coming a mile away and he's not stopping it.

1642
01:30:12.450 --> 01:30:16.740
He just ran that fucking arm through and clamped it on his bicep and crushed

1643
01:30:16.741 --> 01:30:20.370
him. I mean he didn't try to be sneaky with it. He was just dominant with it.

1644
01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:21.121
It was a,

1645
01:30:21.121 --> 01:30:26.121
that's a great example of like the top of the foods that Dennis,

1646
01:30:26.281 --> 01:30:30.000
for me it is remains perfectly. If you're not, I do not.

1647
01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:32.850
You know how long ago was this?

1648
01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:39.210
I was hoping to pop up faster than this. What year is this?

1649
01:30:39.370 --> 01:30:42.030
This is February. Um,

1650
01:30:42.150 --> 01:30:46.270
could be this was UFC Phoenix anyway. All right.

1651
01:30:46.830 --> 01:30:50.460
Doesn't matter. The point being if you did, if you do get caught like that,

1652
01:30:50.461 --> 01:30:53.280
if you do get caught like that and the buzzer saves your life,

1653
01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:56.940
that should be worth a lot. It's got to be, it's got a in the line for sure.

1654
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.530
For sure.

1655
01:30:57.530 --> 01:31:01.440
That's the same as like how's that ten nine like how do you get a ten nine out

1656
01:31:01.441 --> 01:31:02.400
of that? That sounds crazy.

1657
01:31:02.401 --> 01:31:06.000
If there's a ten nine just like Carmouche and Valentino Shevchenko in the first

1658
01:31:06.001 --> 01:31:08.700
round where it's fairly uneventful. Yup. You know,

1659
01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:11.230
and then you've got a w then you've got one round where the fights are nearly

1660
01:31:11.370 --> 01:31:14.640
gets finished and saved by the bell and then their opponent can edge out the

1661
01:31:14.641 --> 01:31:18.000
next two rounds by stuffing take downs and fighting defensively and then they

1662
01:31:18.001 --> 01:31:22.320
went on decision. Yeah. I really think that there's the,

1663
01:31:22.530 --> 01:31:26.310
there's room for growth, there's room for improvement and uh,

1664
01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:31.140
I think that if someone developed some sort of a more comprehensive system,

1665
01:31:31.530 --> 01:31:33.630
like what is a takedown actually worth?

1666
01:31:33.631 --> 01:31:37.800
Why do we have to stick to this ten nine stuff? It's like, Oh yes. It's like,

1667
01:31:37.801 --> 01:31:42.000
oh, I'm going this way or I'm going that way. Let's see your work.

1668
01:31:42.270 --> 01:31:45.630
Like what are you deciding on? Are you deciding on, okay,

1669
01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:51.080
I have take downs versus submission attempt and with the accumulation of leg

1670
01:31:51.391 --> 01:31:51.990
strikes,

1671
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:55.530
I feel like an advantage was gained and even though much wasn't done with the

1672
01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:56.393
takedown,

1673
01:31:56.460 --> 01:32:00.880
it did defensively stop the the attack that he was getting on his feet and he

1674
01:32:00.881 --> 01:32:02.470
was able to impose his will upon him.

1675
01:32:02.471 --> 01:32:05.030
So I'm going to give him ten nine we can go, Ooh, yeah,

1676
01:32:05.170 --> 01:32:09.310
you can talk about this and experts can sit around and try to figure out what,

1677
01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:10.090
what,

1678
01:32:10.090 --> 01:32:14.170
what makes sense to people who have been studying martial arts their whole life.

1679
01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:17.350
What do you think is worth more? Who Do you think won that round?

1680
01:32:17.650 --> 01:32:21.340
I forget about the ten nine if you had a score on the Dan hardy system,

1681
01:32:21.550 --> 01:32:24.250
who do you think won that round? And if we did something like that,

1682
01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:27.880
I think we'd get at least an idea what the territory is.

1683
01:32:27.881 --> 01:32:31.990
But we're confined by ten nine or ten eight or ten seven it's like,

1684
01:32:32.230 --> 01:32:34.180
well who decides who does that?

1685
01:32:34.210 --> 01:32:37.150
Why is a ten seven this one isn't and that one is what? Show me.

1686
01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:39.070
Show me what it is. Show me what happened,

1687
01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:41.120
<v 2>but then we could, we could have a complicates it. I see.</v>

1688
01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:43.070
The benefit in the ten nine thing is it's,

1689
01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:45.110
it makes it more of an instinctive thing.

1690
01:32:45.410 --> 01:32:47.900
Like for me like a take down should be its own reward.

1691
01:32:47.930 --> 01:32:49.070
Like if you take someone down,

1692
01:32:49.071 --> 01:32:50.870
you've put them in a position where you want them,

1693
01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:52.610
that's like awkward and control to me.

1694
01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:56.090
So like controlling the center should be scored just as highly as a,

1695
01:32:56.091 --> 01:32:58.430
as a take down. The take downs got a lead to something for you.

1696
01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:01.910
Oh I disagree because I think it's easier to take control of the center than it

1697
01:33:01.911 --> 01:33:03.620
is to get a takedown. I don't agree.

1698
01:33:04.010 --> 01:33:09.010
Honestly know how long footwork in MMA is is almost primitive really.

1699
01:33:09.021 --> 01:33:10.940
I mean we've like, there are certain people that stand out,

1700
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:13.310
they've got really good foot work, but for the most part there's so many,

1701
01:33:13.311 --> 01:33:17.210
so much bad decision making by people not understanding how to corral someone

1702
01:33:17.211 --> 01:33:17.810
against the fence.

1703
01:33:17.810 --> 01:33:22.220
<v 1>This is an example of why don't agree Tyron Woodley versus Wonderboy.</v>

1704
01:33:22.970 --> 01:33:26.660
Tyron Woodley, let Wonderboy control the center for most of the fight.

1705
01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:28.800
<v 2>But that's like playing God to me. If you,</v>

1706
01:33:28.801 --> 01:33:31.590
if you choose to be backed against the fence and choose to counter strike,

1707
01:33:31.770 --> 01:33:33.480
you're losing until you win a lot of the time

1708
01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:37.490
<v 1>but not as much as being taken down cause tire and wind up doing what he wanted</v>

1709
01:33:37.491 --> 01:33:42.140
to do, which is catch Wonderboy in between these movements and land a big shot.

1710
01:33:42.410 --> 01:33:45.440
And he did it in both fights and he heard them in both fights but both fights

1711
01:33:45.441 --> 01:33:50.120
were a similar strategy of waiting for Wonderboy to fuck up and not a whole lot

1712
01:33:50.121 --> 01:33:52.670
of volume and definitely don't charge at that guy. Yeah,

1713
01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:53.860
<v 2>no it sounds too good.</v>

1714
01:33:54.490 --> 01:33:56.530
Counters take are definitely worth more than controlling the center.

1715
01:33:56.531 --> 01:33:56.930
I don't know.

1716
01:33:56.930 --> 01:33:59.740
That don't mean that to be misunderstood but what I'm saying is that the,

1717
01:34:00.190 --> 01:34:03.100
the goal is the same thing. If you control the center,

1718
01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:05.890
you're putting someone in a position where you can strike them.

1719
01:34:05.891 --> 01:34:06.940
If you take someone down,

1720
01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:10.230
you putting them in a position where you can hit them or submit them. Yeah, but

1721
01:34:10.770 --> 01:34:12.510
<v 1>they're so removed.</v>

1722
01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:16.350
Cause when you're controlling the center you could still get fucked up like you,

1723
01:34:16.351 --> 01:34:17.550
you're not controlling the guy.

1724
01:34:17.910 --> 01:34:20.010
Like if you're moving forward and you control in the center,

1725
01:34:20.150 --> 01:34:22.500
it mean you're definitely forcing the action.

1726
01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:25.840
But people get knocked out that way all the time. I mean,

1727
01:34:25.841 --> 01:34:30.110
do you remember when Jeremy Horn or chairman Stevens was at Dennis Bermudez,

1728
01:34:30.150 --> 01:34:33.450
he caught with that flying knee. Do you remember that?

1729
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:35.660
While he was getting pressed up against occasion,

1730
01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:39.560
<v 2>boom, he explodes out of nowhere to flying. That shit happens for sure.</v>

1731
01:34:39.561 --> 01:34:43.370
But then like [inaudible] you know, yes, we're against the fence rolling.

1732
01:34:43.820 --> 01:34:47.270
That's one of the great ones like [inaudible] but like so he can't,

1733
01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:51.390
it can't be is worth as much. But the thing is say if you say safe,

1734
01:34:51.391 --> 01:34:53.000
you're playing God. Right? If you,

1735
01:34:53.001 --> 01:34:54.420
if you've got somebody in your God and you'll,

1736
01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:57.950
you play 50 minutes or throw in submissions up, nothing comes off

1737
01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:01.130
<v 0>and the other person sits in your guard and lends a few punches.</v>

1738
01:35:01.131 --> 01:35:03.680
The person that I'm the top spot are going to win the fight because they were

1739
01:35:03.681 --> 01:35:06.210
sitting in your God defended submissions and that, you know,

1740
01:35:06.230 --> 01:35:09.440
the defense part is its own reward. Sure. They were in the top position.

1741
01:35:09.441 --> 01:35:12.570
So for me, I always kind of think that like playing God,

1742
01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:14.230
he's very similar to counter strike and, and I'm,

1743
01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:17.060
I was a counter striker all the way through my career, pretty much.

1744
01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:21.980
So my feeling was that I was losing the fight until I landed the strikes to win

1745
01:35:21.981 --> 01:35:22.730
it.

1746
01:35:22.730 --> 01:35:25.910
And the idea of controlling the octagon doesn't necessarily mean you controlled

1747
01:35:25.911 --> 01:35:27.680
in the center. It means you control your opponent.

1748
01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:31.900
So you had this mindset that's an interesting mindset for counterstrike,

1749
01:35:31.970 --> 01:35:33.380
you're probably very productive, right?

1750
01:35:33.650 --> 01:35:37.670
Because you put yourself like to the point where you have to get it back.

1751
01:35:38.110 --> 01:35:41.030
You're already losing. I'm a deficit because I'm giving ground up.

1752
01:35:41.190 --> 01:35:44.540
But the benefit that I'm getting and giving ground is that I'm making them walk

1753
01:35:44.541 --> 01:35:48.980
into the places that I want them to step. MM, right. Yeah. So, so like if I,

1754
01:35:48.981 --> 01:35:51.800
if I'm backing up straight and I'm just being pushed against the fence,

1755
01:35:52.130 --> 01:35:53.590
I'm not controlling the center, the optical,

1756
01:35:53.630 --> 01:35:57.410
but if I'm backing up and pivoting off and catching them with a left hook,

1757
01:35:57.710 --> 01:36:01.450
I'm walking them onto that shot. I would just say that as a counter striker,

1758
01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:03.680
I would have to be more significant in my output.

1759
01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:05.360
Just like if you were a god play,

1760
01:36:05.361 --> 01:36:07.820
you would have to be more significant in your output than you would if you were

1761
01:36:07.821 --> 01:36:11.060
in the top position. That makes sense. Um,

1762
01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:15.170
and it certainly makes sense that there's a benefit for getting someone to fight

1763
01:36:15.290 --> 01:36:18.650
your kind of fight. You know, it's, there's,

1764
01:36:18.651 --> 01:36:23.651
there's so many variables there really in play and some of them are dependent

1765
01:36:23.991 --> 01:36:28.160
upon, maybe you don't really understand what their game plan was.

1766
01:36:28.161 --> 01:36:31.040
Maybe the game plan was fight a really unpredictable fight.

1767
01:36:31.041 --> 01:36:33.620
Something you would never expect from someone with their style.

1768
01:36:34.130 --> 01:36:37.670
Or maybe someone has like maybe some hidden skill that we didn't realize they

1769
01:36:37.671 --> 01:36:40.770
were that good at. And so like, remember when Nick Diaz fought Robby Lauer?

1770
01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:44.030
Everybody thought Nick Diaz is Jujitsu Guy, right.

1771
01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:47.790
Knocked him out with a jab [inaudible] of like a weird right hook. Right.

1772
01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:51.650
But it was, he was beating his ass before that.

1773
01:36:51.651 --> 01:36:54.200
That was what was different about our expectations.

1774
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:59.350
Our expectations were Nick Diaz was his really well-respected Jujitsu player who

1775
01:36:59.511 --> 01:37:04.190
was real tough and young and uh, had had some real good fights. Um,

1776
01:37:04.250 --> 01:37:07.310
I think he started, did he start and w h e c is that where you started?

1777
01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:10.940
Started in some smaller organizations that fight with Robbie.

1778
01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:14.690
Lola was early though, like 37. Oh, very early like that.

1779
01:37:14.930 --> 01:37:16.490
I'll never forget that fight man.

1780
01:37:16.491 --> 01:37:19.910
He came out and he was like stocked and motherfucker and Ravi. Laura was like,

1781
01:37:19.911 --> 01:37:24.770
what? What is happening here? I was like, what the fuck is going on?

1782
01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:29.060
But he out boxed him. That was the thing that was exciting about it. It's like,

1783
01:37:29.061 --> 01:37:29.690
wow.

1784
01:37:29.690 --> 01:37:34.130
Like we thought this guy was just a Jitsu guy and meanwhile what he's doing is

1785
01:37:34.131 --> 01:37:38.630
he's coming out talking mad shit to Robbie Lawler talking shit to him while he's

1786
01:37:38.631 --> 01:37:42.770
punching him in the face. Like that was something that the I, the,

1787
01:37:42.771 --> 01:37:45.890
I love about the Diaz brothers though and not like they've never really had to

1788
01:37:45.891 --> 01:37:50.240
implement wrestling that game too much because they do use pressure mocks in to

1789
01:37:50.241 --> 01:37:53.480
force people to shoot on them. Both have wicked guards, wicked.

1790
01:37:53.660 --> 01:37:57.480
They both have wicked, wicked. You just see wicked guards. You know,

1791
01:37:58.270 --> 01:38:01.290
Nick DHEA is a super respected Jujitsu black belt as is Nate.

1792
01:38:01.630 --> 01:38:04.530
Like in the Jujitsu community. They're like, you know,

1793
01:38:04.531 --> 01:38:08.640
they're recognized as being really high level so they'll just keep punching you

1794
01:38:08.641 --> 01:38:11.160
in the face. So you decided to go to the ground.

1795
01:38:11.310 --> 01:38:13.980
I'd love to tap into some of that knowledge, get their perspectives on this,

1796
01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:15.960
on the sport and the score and you know what I mean? Well,

1797
01:38:15.961 --> 01:38:18.030
I like the fact that they're picking their fights now.

1798
01:38:18.031 --> 01:38:21.270
Like Nate takes some time off and takes a big fight, you know,

1799
01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:25.420
and does whatever he wants. Like I like that. I liked that he can do that.

1800
01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:28.380
And I'm very excited about this fight, this fight with pedis.

1801
01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:33.270
It's fascinating because first of all, Nate Diaz, he's acting like a maniac.

1802
01:38:33.410 --> 01:38:35.760
He's smoking weed during the open workouts.

1803
01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:39.090
He's smoking weed during open workouts. I mean,

1804
01:38:39.091 --> 01:38:43.230
his brother was suspended for like a fucking year for smoking weed back in the

1805
01:38:43.231 --> 01:38:46.770
dark ages. Renee was, yeah, it's like a long time.

1806
01:38:46.771 --> 01:38:50.040
He didn't fight for ages because he wouldn't pay the fine to exactly.

1807
01:38:50.041 --> 01:38:53.880
It's so stupid. And meanwhile the Diaz brothers are right.

1808
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:58.680
So you see Nate Diaz, I see up a workout. Yeah, just CBD,

1809
01:38:58.681 --> 01:39:02.130
Bro. It's just health. It's just he's getting high as fuck.

1810
01:39:02.131 --> 01:39:04.950
That's what he's doing. You can do that. You can do that now.

1811
01:39:05.010 --> 01:39:08.460
As long as you're not high, the day of the fight,

1812
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:12.060
your levels will be fine. I used to stop for weeks before my fights.

1813
01:39:12.061 --> 01:39:15.540
It was awful. Had to back then. Right. Look at him. But he's,

1814
01:39:15.570 --> 01:39:18.480
he's getting so high. It might stay with him for a couple months. Yeah.

1815
01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:22.110
He might fail. The test was when I remember to this in my mind,

1816
01:39:22.111 --> 01:39:22.920
you remember when, um,

1817
01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:27.630
when nick fought to go me and he had like six times the amount and this system

1818
01:39:28.050 --> 01:39:29.520
it was Eddie. He had to be high. What?

1819
01:39:29.521 --> 01:39:32.970
He fought a pot Brownie in the back or something before he walked out. Dude,

1820
01:39:32.971 --> 01:39:36.260
that was an amazing fight. You caught him with a Gogo plot though. Ooh.

1821
01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:40.590
It's realize how God damn good nicked him at everything. Yeah.

1822
01:39:40.770 --> 01:39:44.130
Submissions, you know, fucking remember when he,

1823
01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:47.280
when he fought Cyborg just got him to the ground, submitted them,

1824
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:50.490
stood with them for a little bit and said, okay, that's enough.

1825
01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:53.350
And the pole daily fight, that's the one that always stands out to me.

1826
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.100
Like I came into Nav jungle.

1827
01:39:56.101 --> 01:39:58.560
I never would have thought that Nick Dal's are gonna knock, pull out.

1828
01:39:58.590 --> 01:40:02.400
He took him into the jungle. He took him into the deepest water. He just said,

1829
01:40:02.401 --> 01:40:04.680
let's just go to war. Let's go to crazy war.

1830
01:40:04.710 --> 01:40:08.490
People don't do that with Paul date. Ridiculous. He's terrifying.

1831
01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:11.730
Tenderize the side of my head. Oh my God, Dude.

1832
01:40:11.850 --> 01:40:14.010
I can't imagine getting hit by that guy and that guy,

1833
01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:17.950
his left hand is preposterous. Huge hands as well. Yeah.

1834
01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:20.880
I would tell you about having structure. I mean these massive highlands,

1835
01:40:21.090 --> 01:40:23.460
I couldn't imagine him not having massive hands.

1836
01:40:23.461 --> 01:40:26.430
He has big feet too wide tank of a man.

1837
01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:29.690
But that left hand is just one of the best weapons in the sport. Yeah.

1838
01:40:29.850 --> 01:40:33.090
That's one of those game changer weapons when he clips people and you see him

1839
01:40:33.110 --> 01:40:36.390
like, whoa. I remember being in his colon at one time,

1840
01:40:36.930 --> 01:40:40.880
it was fighting Xavier [inaudible] on cage rage and uh,

1841
01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:42.900
we'd had a late night than not before,

1842
01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:47.130
as we usually did with pole dailies fight nights, cause he's a bit wild. Um,

1843
01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:49.440
so we've been up til like 4:00 AM Friday night,

1844
01:40:49.770 --> 01:40:53.410
Saturday we'd go over to the fights and it was just,

1845
01:40:53.411 --> 01:40:55.210
it wasn't focused on the flights at all.

1846
01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:58.630
It had some kind of noodle pot for breakfast and nothing else.

1847
01:40:58.631 --> 01:41:01.510
And he was just like, he's, he's head just wasn't there. He's just, you know,

1848
01:41:01.511 --> 01:41:04.330
he was one of those kinds of guys that sometimes he would just show up to fight

1849
01:41:04.510 --> 01:41:08.480
at the moment that it was required. And uh, uh,

1850
01:41:08.770 --> 01:41:12.490
professor x, he was like a six foot two Thai boxer. I remember that.

1851
01:41:12.491 --> 01:41:17.010
I remember him. Yeah. Real long. Rangy guy. Very titled, Dude. Yeah, yeah. Uh,

1852
01:41:17.450 --> 01:41:18.490
yeah, he was. Yeah.

1853
01:41:18.850 --> 01:41:21.520
And he got Paul clenched and he was near him and he was hitting him with all

1854
01:41:21.521 --> 01:41:23.560
kinds of stuff and out of no way,

1855
01:41:23.561 --> 01:41:27.820
just this left hook just came creeping over the top of him and he just fell like

1856
01:41:27.821 --> 01:41:30.490
a plank. He knew he could do that to be able to,

1857
01:41:30.491 --> 01:41:33.880
and he knows he can when he hit Lorenze Larkin with that punch,

1858
01:41:33.881 --> 01:41:37.630
I was like Jesus, cause Lorens is a very high level striker.

1859
01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:42.220
Like you remember going Lorenze ran over near Magni and you're like holy shit.

1860
01:41:42.340 --> 01:41:45.880
And he throws that oblique kick to the body like a sidekick and you're like

1861
01:41:45.881 --> 01:41:47.410
Whoa,

1862
01:41:47.740 --> 01:41:51.430
this guy's hitting it with some shit and he's swift on the feet man.

1863
01:41:51.431 --> 01:41:52.540
Like Lorens is like,

1864
01:41:52.810 --> 01:41:57.810
he's got a very unusual style of footwork and movement and it's like a lot of

1865
01:41:57.821 --> 01:42:01.090
guys, you see them trying to decipher it as he's coming at you and then boom,

1866
01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:02.380
the shots are coming.

1867
01:42:02.650 --> 01:42:07.630
So to see him get clipped by Paul and get really hurt and stopped,

1868
01:42:07.631 --> 01:42:08.560
you realize like wow,

1869
01:42:08.561 --> 01:42:13.090
that's how hard fucking Paul Daily Hits and you underestimate how long his arms

1870
01:42:13.091 --> 01:42:16.330
are as well. He's got a unique belt. He's wastes like this big, he's like,

1871
01:42:16.331 --> 01:42:19.880
he's built like a Dorito and he's got really wide shoulders and really long arm

1872
01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:21.730
tall that power's coming from that leverage.

1873
01:42:22.210 --> 01:42:27.130
Were you shocked by his fight with Michael Van and page? Um, no, not really.

1874
01:42:27.380 --> 01:42:29.800
Uh, you know, I think Paul can be, you know, pull, come,

1875
01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:31.510
play the game when he needs to play the game.

1876
01:42:31.511 --> 01:42:34.560
He knows when he's taking risks and when he's not. And you know,

1877
01:42:34.650 --> 01:42:36.850
there was a lot of law on the line for that and for sure.

1878
01:42:36.851 --> 01:42:39.460
But that's the one thing that he always complained about yeah.

1879
01:42:39.530 --> 01:42:40.900
Was when guys took him down.

1880
01:42:40.990 --> 01:42:43.450
Ego can have a say in these things sometimes though, you know,

1881
01:42:43.451 --> 01:42:48.310
and I think a loss is over a bad performances is much worse for Paul when it

1882
01:42:48.311 --> 01:42:50.320
comes to MVP. He didn't never heard the last of it.

1883
01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:52.410
We occupied the same small bit of land, you know,

1884
01:42:53.230 --> 01:42:55.260
you can't go very far in of that, you know,

1885
01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:58.540
without hearing about that kind of stuff. He just wanted to get the win. Yeah.

1886
01:42:58.690 --> 01:43:01.780
I wonder if, uh, yeah, I see what you're saying.

1887
01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:03.490
And I liked that he fought that way.

1888
01:43:03.550 --> 01:43:06.910
I liked that anybody fights in the way that they can win because if someone

1889
01:43:06.911 --> 01:43:08.110
can't defend that,

1890
01:43:08.111 --> 01:43:11.290
I want to know and it's not because I want one person to win over the other

1891
01:43:11.291 --> 01:43:15.820
person, even if it's a bad fight. I like when styles clash and you figure out,

1892
01:43:15.850 --> 01:43:18.430
oh look at this. If that guy just does that to guess what,

1893
01:43:18.431 --> 01:43:21.040
now people know that they could do that to you and other people who were better

1894
01:43:21.041 --> 01:43:23.950
at doing that are going to try to do that to you. Yeah. It's interesting.

1895
01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:25.860
It makes the sport fascinating for show,

1896
01:43:25.861 --> 01:43:28.900
but I would say that Paul didn't get into the fight with the intention of

1897
01:43:28.901 --> 01:43:30.320
fighting like that. Right. I think,

1898
01:43:30.330 --> 01:43:32.770
I think the take downs where we're a part of his game plan,

1899
01:43:32.771 --> 01:43:35.650
but I think he planned on doing a lot more damage on the ground.

1900
01:43:36.100 --> 01:43:39.970
That guy is so fucking slippery standing up Michael Van and page,

1901
01:43:40.030 --> 01:43:40.990
he's so slippery.

1902
01:43:40.991 --> 01:43:45.190
That movement is so crazy to deal with that karate point fighting background.

1903
01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:48.400
They are so good at blitzes. Don't feel like you can get close to him.

1904
01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:52.670
It feels like he's so far away and if you try to move into the danger zone,

1905
01:43:52.700 --> 01:43:55.700
they can get to you before you can get to them and especially Michael Page who

1906
01:43:55.701 --> 01:44:00.620
has those long arms and legs and he's so good at keeping his hands down so you

1907
01:44:00.621 --> 01:44:02.660
don't know where Shit's coming from too. It's all,

1908
01:44:02.661 --> 01:44:05.720
everything's coming from weird angles and the confidence plays in as well

1909
01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:08.750
because he's so confident in what he's capable of. He fights loose,

1910
01:44:08.751 --> 01:44:12.680
which makes him faster. He hasn't fought since the Lima fight, right? No. Yeah,

1911
01:44:12.681 --> 01:44:15.410
that was great. Lima's a murderer.

1912
01:44:15.890 --> 01:44:20.360
He might be one of the scariest guys in the 170 pound division across the board

1913
01:44:20.361 --> 01:44:25.040
and one FC UFC Lima's one of the scariest guys for sure.

1914
01:44:25.070 --> 01:44:29.990
He's boom, boom Alco the lights [inaudible] the fucker. He puts people to sleep,

1915
01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:34.040
you know he does is, he's fucked. When he knocked out chorus cough, I was like,

1916
01:44:35.630 --> 01:44:37.340
Jesus knocks out to everybody, man.

1917
01:44:37.850 --> 01:44:40.940
And his rematch with Rory is going to be very interesting.

1918
01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:43.490
I just always worry about rorys nose, you know,

1919
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:47.240
it's always on my mind when he's fighting because they just don't heal.

1920
01:44:47.420 --> 01:44:51.950
They just never healed properly. How about Michael Parrots? I Dunno.

1921
01:44:52.450 --> 01:44:55.340
How's going to be a long time off? It was on my flight on the way home.

1922
01:44:55.380 --> 01:44:57.740
I mean these eyes was like swollen and stuff.

1923
01:44:57.740 --> 01:45:00.380
He was out when I'm having a rough time. But yeah,

1924
01:45:00.410 --> 01:45:03.280
he but didn't he get surgery while he was in Uruguay? Yeah,

1925
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:04.610
they fixed it while they were there. Oh,

1926
01:45:04.611 --> 01:45:06.530
so you left after he had gotten surgery?

1927
01:45:06.531 --> 01:45:09.620
I stayed for a day after I get so get some rest. Jet Lag was killing me.

1928
01:45:09.710 --> 01:45:13.460
It's good for you. Yeah. How is Uruguay was an interesting, yeah, it was,

1929
01:45:13.461 --> 01:45:16.100
it was cool. I mean the fans were great. You know, they uh, they had,

1930
01:45:16.101 --> 01:45:20.090
we had one fighter on the card from Uruguay, um, gala, Gloria Eduardo category,

1931
01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:23.390
who was, I mean, you just march forward and just tried to, you know,

1932
01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:26.570
tried to bring the fight to his opponent. He was fighting Bandon. I, um,

1933
01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:29.390
it was backing up, trying to counter strike, but the fans loved it.

1934
01:45:29.420 --> 01:45:32.030
In other words, they were rowdy. They were quiet when the fights were going on,

1935
01:45:32.031 --> 01:45:34.700
which was kind of weird because they only, they only finds the,

1936
01:45:34.701 --> 01:45:37.950
I've experienced to do that or the Japanese funds when, you know,

1937
01:45:38.060 --> 01:45:39.980
when the fights going on, they sit quietly, they watch,

1938
01:45:39.981 --> 01:45:43.670
they applaud when there's a position change and there was some good fights on

1939
01:45:43.671 --> 01:45:48.560
the card as well. The A, the Hallean Piven knee as well from, um, uh,

1940
01:45:48.561 --> 01:45:50.930
what's his opponent's name? Bunter in Nigeria.

1941
01:45:51.390 --> 01:45:55.670
Bunter and coin with a clean ne and opened him up a lot of stitches. Oh,

1942
01:45:55.671 --> 01:46:00.110
I saw that. Yeah. Yeah. And uh, did you Jitsu guy that, uh,

1943
01:46:00.111 --> 01:46:04.850
the middleweight guy? Oh yeah. Adolfo Vieira Jesus Christ go good finally.

1944
01:46:04.860 --> 01:46:08.030
Yeah, it probably had pallets is good. I'm surprised that, um,

1945
01:46:08.350 --> 01:46:10.550
I'm surprised that he didn't press forward more to be honest.

1946
01:46:10.551 --> 01:46:13.550
I was expecting to be more aggressive because like via his good,

1947
01:46:13.551 --> 01:46:17.630
but he's like five, six fights into his career. You can still,

1948
01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:20.560
you can still bully him a little bit because he might be unsure of himself in

1949
01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:24.550
the striking a little bit, but he did land a hard job early in the first round.

1950
01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:28.070
I think that like woke them up a little bit. Like he's got heavy hands,

1951
01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:32.120
but the thing is his squeeze is fucking outrageous. Yeah.

1952
01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:36.230
His squeeze is so outrageous. When he wrapped up that head and arm trying,

1953
01:46:36.231 --> 01:46:38.570
I was like, you need no one's getting out of that.

1954
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:42.320
Like there's some dudes that do that head in arm choke like that where you see

1955
01:46:42.321 --> 01:46:46.760
their back look like a fucking some alien creature when all the striations like,

1956
01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:49.010
oh my God, no one's getting out of that. Like you're going to,

1957
01:46:49.470 --> 01:46:52.350
he's going to cut your head off. Like that's horrific.

1958
01:46:52.710 --> 01:46:57.710
Those guys that have that incredible Jujitsu with incredible physical strength

1959
01:46:59.370 --> 01:47:03.730
like the Jack Arrays, Paul Harris. Yeah. Those guys who have the crazies.

1960
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:07.920
You did too, but also ridiculous strength as well are always a scariest. Yeah.

1961
01:47:08.190 --> 01:47:12.130
Look at the size of Golden Ryan now in comparison to some flaws.

1962
01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:17.130
He's terrifying. Keep Jeff Devinsky way the fat guy.

1963
01:47:17.850 --> 01:47:21.870
But that is the thing about Jujitsu is like some of these things have testing

1964
01:47:21.871 --> 01:47:24.960
and people do have tested positive and it's been like a huge disgrace.

1965
01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:28.620
But the ones that don't have testing these dudes, it's the wild west out there.

1966
01:47:28.621 --> 01:47:29.580
They're running rampant.

1967
01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:33.600
I remember Jeff Munson turning to that monster walking around like he'd just

1968
01:47:33.601 --> 01:47:37.230
been chiseled out him. Yeah. He was goddamn fantastic.

1969
01:47:37.231 --> 01:47:41.150
Four character that came to life. Yeah. When Matson was in a [inaudible],

1970
01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:46.290
there he is right there. Jacked or the kids jacked. Yeah, I watched him on that.

1971
01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:49.560
I'm the beast. Oh, what was it? Uh, a quintet.

1972
01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:54.150
I'm in Vegas and he wrote through three guys on that. That is hilarious as well.

1973
01:47:54.151 --> 01:47:58.020
He's done Polaris a few times over in the UK. This is just a monster. Well,

1974
01:47:58.050 --> 01:48:01.680
it all comes out of that. John, Donna, her, uh, Henzel Gracie school,

1975
01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:05.640
what it was Eddie Cummings, John, Donna, her, all those guys. Gary Tonin,

1976
01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:09.820
Nikki Ryan, Gordon, Ryan. Those are, that's some of the cream of the crop of,

1977
01:48:09.870 --> 01:48:11.460
of young Jujitsu players.

1978
01:48:11.550 --> 01:48:15.960
These guys are all savages and I'm really excited that tone is now an MMA.

1979
01:48:16.230 --> 01:48:19.740
You know, because he's doing really well and MMA, he's undefeated and he's,

1980
01:48:19.770 --> 01:48:23.370
he's fucking people up standing up too. He's getting better at standing up,

1981
01:48:23.371 --> 01:48:27.600
but when it goes to the ground, good fucking luck. Good luck.

1982
01:48:27.630 --> 01:48:30.960
And I think people would underestimate John Danaher as an MMA coach as well.

1983
01:48:30.990 --> 01:48:35.580
You know, the experience that he's had like his, his knowledge of MMA is,

1984
01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:39.120
is outstanding. I spent some time talking to him when I was up in Montreal,

1985
01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:42.470
Tristar and like the, the way he,

1986
01:48:42.510 --> 01:48:47.510
he unpacks things and breaks things down and not only not only breaks them down

1987
01:48:47.521 --> 01:48:48.480
for himself to understand,

1988
01:48:48.481 --> 01:48:50.940
but for him to be able to communicate that easily to other people,

1989
01:48:50.941 --> 01:48:53.100
for them to understand is like,

1990
01:48:53.900 --> 01:48:56.880
it takes a special kind of coach to be able to do that. Well, he's a,

1991
01:48:57.450 --> 01:49:01.560
he's a really, really interesting human,

1992
01:49:01.770 --> 01:49:03.270
like if you just sit down and talk to him,

1993
01:49:03.271 --> 01:49:07.440
he's one of the most well thought out people I think I've ever had the pleasure

1994
01:49:07.441 --> 01:49:08.520
of having a conversation with.

1995
01:49:08.521 --> 01:49:13.380
He just thinks things through and irons out all his points before he ever

1996
01:49:13.381 --> 01:49:15.870
expresses them. So when he expresses something to you, it's like,

1997
01:49:15.871 --> 01:49:19.670
let me ask you, this is a lunatic. I need to look to take this.

1998
01:49:19.671 --> 01:49:24.600
This is an edge to him for sure would never forget him sitting in a club in

1999
01:49:24.601 --> 01:49:25.434
Montreal,

2000
01:49:25.710 --> 01:49:29.070
like GSPs there and all of his mates and they're all like dressed sharp and

2001
01:49:29.071 --> 01:49:31.350
stuff. And they were like talking to the girls.

2002
01:49:31.410 --> 01:49:33.000
He had a rash guard on the coast. He did

2003
01:49:35.010 --> 01:49:37.650
harassed God potty pack and a pair of shorts and he was just sitting in the

2004
01:49:37.651 --> 01:49:40.170
club. Just people don't understand.

2005
01:49:40.780 --> 01:49:43.620
John Donner hurts famous for wearing a rash guard to a wedding.

2006
01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:47.940
But he's a Savannah as a special individual, you know this, he's,

2007
01:49:48.060 --> 01:49:51.430
he's on a different frequency. If you never wore a rash guard to a wedding,

2008
01:49:51.431 --> 01:49:55.690
my apologies. But I wouldn't put it bastion. Yeah. Nice. No he did.

2009
01:49:55.691 --> 01:49:58.270
I'm sure he did. I'm sure he show that's a true story. I mean, he is a savant.

2010
01:49:58.330 --> 01:50:01.330
He's um, what he is his, I think he's senior,

2011
01:50:01.331 --> 01:50:06.331
really focused on like transitions and attacks and patterns in Jujitsu and how

2012
01:50:07.391 --> 01:50:12.190
to improve upon, uh, various athletes success and games.

2013
01:50:12.490 --> 01:50:16.390
And he's created these pathways and these guys that believe in them also

2014
01:50:16.391 --> 01:50:18.400
happened to be super dedicated and very talented.

2015
01:50:19.060 --> 01:50:21.460
And then you have that entire Hanzo Gracie team,

2016
01:50:21.461 --> 01:50:26.310
which is just one of the best lineages of Jujitsu in all of martial arts.

2017
01:50:26.370 --> 01:50:30.040
And if you look at what came out of that Henzel Gracie Lee, you know,

2018
01:50:30.041 --> 01:50:33.530
you have Matt, Sarah came out of there. Uh, there's,

2019
01:50:33.630 --> 01:50:38.630
there's been so many high level competitors and a million different martial arts

2020
01:50:39.251 --> 01:50:43.870
organizations. Hanzo is like old school Gracie. I mean he's from the root.

2021
01:50:44.290 --> 01:50:48.220
I mean that's the purest uget so you're going to find in the world. So he's got,

2022
01:50:48.460 --> 01:50:49.293
it's just,

2023
01:50:49.510 --> 01:50:54.510
that's an amazing pool of talent on top of having a wizard like Donna her and

2024
01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:58.330
they're fucking with things and fixing things and finding,

2025
01:50:58.331 --> 01:51:01.780
finding new pathways and how to, how to counter things and how to,

2026
01:51:01.870 --> 01:51:03.610
how to switch things around on people.

2027
01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:07.690
And they have a bunch of systems like backtracking systems, leg locking systems,

2028
01:51:07.691 --> 01:51:09.820
and it's super, super effective.

2029
01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:13.870
And the way he describes it as he's able to cut years out of the learning curve

2030
01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:18.940
or these guys by addressing problems that come up before they come up. I mean,

2031
01:51:18.941 --> 01:51:21.430
he's proven that though in other speed in which Gordon,

2032
01:51:21.431 --> 01:51:22.870
Ryan and Nikki Ryan as well.

2033
01:51:23.320 --> 01:51:28.320
Now I want to say Cummings and Gary Tonin and for sure they all learn from each

2034
01:51:29.051 --> 01:51:29.741
other for sure.

2035
01:51:29.741 --> 01:51:34.600
I mean Eddie is also a big innovator in leg locking and understanding these

2036
01:51:34.601 --> 01:51:39.040
systems and innovating and coming up with new entries and new transitions.

2037
01:51:39.041 --> 01:51:40.000
All those guys are,

2038
01:51:40.330 --> 01:51:43.240
it's like everyone has their own little piece of ingredient that they're putting

2039
01:51:43.241 --> 01:51:47.770
into the stew, but the result is really exceptional in terms of success rates.

2040
01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:52.420
Like they stood out in a world where everyone's trying to kill everybody with

2041
01:51:52.421 --> 01:51:56.350
chokes and armbars and everybody knows chokes and arm bars and they stood out,

2042
01:51:56.530 --> 01:51:58.630
but significantly. Yeah. But was, you know,

2043
01:51:58.950 --> 01:52:01.570
the thing with Danaher as well as to be able to sit on the mountain,

2044
01:52:01.571 --> 01:52:04.480
watch all of those high level guys work against each other,

2045
01:52:04.481 --> 01:52:08.320
like he's seeing the patterns across the mat. This, this is,

2046
01:52:08.321 --> 01:52:11.770
I wish I'd done this early on in my career. I watched fights as a fan,

2047
01:52:11.771 --> 01:52:13.570
but then the further into my career,

2048
01:52:13.571 --> 01:52:15.490
the more I was specific about who I watched.

2049
01:52:15.910 --> 01:52:19.030
I only wants to watch the fights as I felt like I was going to benefit from

2050
01:52:19.210 --> 01:52:22.630
interesting. Whereas now because I watch everything I like,

2051
01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:26.650
I see the patterns and I can imagine because Dan has done it on the mat all the

2052
01:52:26.651 --> 01:52:28.900
time, watching all of these guys every day,

2053
01:52:28.901 --> 01:52:30.700
seeing the patterns in Jujitsu all the time.

2054
01:52:30.830 --> 01:52:34.540
They the same positions that get exchanged over and over again and you know the

2055
01:52:34.541 --> 01:52:36.010
different outcomes for each one.

2056
01:52:36.011 --> 01:52:39.820
And he just seems to have one of those kinds of brains that just absorbed

2057
01:52:39.821 --> 01:52:40.480
everything,

2058
01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:44.380
adds it into his filtration system and then figures out the more high percentage

2059
01:52:44.381 --> 01:52:47.150
stuff and then focuses that as he's as he's syllabus.

2060
01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:51.380
And what's really interesting is if he wasn't injured as badly as he is,

2061
01:52:51.710 --> 01:52:55.880
I mean he probably would have gone on to compete and maybe not been as good of a

2062
01:52:55.881 --> 01:52:56.810
coach. Yes.

2063
01:52:58.070 --> 01:53:03.040
That's one of the more amazing pieces to that puzzle. He was a rugby player,

2064
01:53:03.060 --> 01:53:06.530
fucked his knee up early. They fixed it, but they didn't fix it right.

2065
01:53:06.710 --> 01:53:09.650
And it was always a problem and he was always like kind of leaning on it in a

2066
01:53:09.651 --> 01:53:12.230
weird way and it fucked his hip up.

2067
01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:15.620
So he had to get a hip replacement and now he's going to get a knee replacement.

2068
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:19.430
And he's a guy known for teaching people how to rip people's legs apart.

2069
01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:23.410
It's kind of crazy. Yeah. But he, I mean he's a unique individual though. He's,

2070
01:53:23.670 --> 01:53:23.720
yeah.

2071
01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:27.940
And I think that is the way that his brain works is his perfect for Jujitsu.

2072
01:53:28.010 --> 01:53:28.780
And that's why, you know,

2073
01:53:28.780 --> 01:53:32.390
that's why his brain brain is fed so much by Jujitsu and you sit in my,

2074
01:53:32.430 --> 01:53:33.770
you see him on the side of the mat, you know,

2075
01:53:33.771 --> 01:53:36.410
he's sitting there coaching his guys and it's just,

2076
01:53:37.010 --> 01:53:39.620
it's so calm and it's so well delivered and he's,

2077
01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:43.970
he always says that full name as well as something else I notice which are not

2078
01:53:43.971 --> 01:53:48.500
quite like it, but it stands out. Yeah. Yeah.

2079
01:53:48.980 --> 01:53:52.370
I think it's so important to have these unique characters for us or hobbies.

2080
01:53:52.371 --> 01:53:54.020
And other ones that have these,

2081
01:53:54.021 --> 01:53:57.890
a unique intellectual characters that are involved in their pursuit of people

2082
01:53:57.891 --> 01:53:59.340
beating the fuck out of each other. Yeah.

2083
01:53:59.630 --> 01:54:03.380
It's very interesting because we've not even seen the crossover of the fighters

2084
01:54:03.381 --> 01:54:05.580
that are going to become those people yet either. I mean, you know,

2085
01:54:06.820 --> 01:54:09.260
Dwayne Ludwig is a good example of one of the first to really make that

2086
01:54:09.261 --> 01:54:10.094
crossover.

2087
01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:13.850
Like you look at the way that Ludwick fought and the way that he coaches his

2088
01:54:13.851 --> 01:54:16.910
fighters is so very different. He jokes around about it,

2089
01:54:16.970 --> 01:54:19.870
but I liked that because that shows the evolution. If I,

2090
01:54:20.150 --> 01:54:21.470
when I'm coaching my fighters,

2091
01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:24.150
I wouldn't coach them the same way that I used to fight it. You know,

2092
01:54:25.340 --> 01:54:27.170
it's got to vary a little bit, right?

2093
01:54:27.171 --> 01:54:31.000
Depending upon body size and style and what strengths you come into,

2094
01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:32.120
especially in MMA.

2095
01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:37.480
But what Wayne Dwayne is doing is sort of like learning what he learned from

2096
01:54:37.580 --> 01:54:42.560
everybody, watching everybody but not what he did, which is crazy.

2097
01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:43.020
Yeah.

2098
01:54:43.020 --> 01:54:47.150
He's obviously teaching you stuff that he knows how to do and stuff that he did

2099
01:54:47.151 --> 01:54:47.720
do,

2100
01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:51.500
but that style of footwork and switching stances and movement that you see like

2101
01:54:51.501 --> 01:54:53.720
TJ employ and a lot of his other students employ.

2102
01:54:54.170 --> 01:54:56.510
Like Dwayne's got that like written out.

2103
01:54:56.960 --> 01:54:59.330
He's one of those guys that has a real system.

2104
01:54:59.331 --> 01:55:02.150
Like if you look at his book you're like, Oh my God, this a crazy person.

2105
01:55:02.670 --> 01:55:05.380
It's just like, it's been a great way and a great way.

2106
01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:08.270
It's all like he's got everything written out,

2107
01:55:08.271 --> 01:55:11.120
like all the combinations and all the movements and all the,

2108
01:55:11.420 --> 01:55:14.810
this is not like free for all and just do what feels good. Like no,

2109
01:55:14.811 --> 01:55:18.930
he's got like patterns. He's fallen and he puts those patterns on you and you,

2110
01:55:18.931 --> 01:55:22.490
you see the success rate from his students learning this thing. He was,

2111
01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:26.000
he had a big effect on team Alpha male for the brief amount of time that he was

2112
01:55:26.001 --> 01:55:28.970
there. He saw some good results from some of those guys.

2113
01:55:29.390 --> 01:55:33.110
He's just uniquely obsessed with teaching people how to strike correctly.

2114
01:55:33.290 --> 01:55:33.980
And that's where,

2115
01:55:33.980 --> 01:55:37.760
that's where I think there's a very fine line between like programming a fighter

2116
01:55:37.761 --> 01:55:39.260
and being a computer programmer. You know,

2117
01:55:39.450 --> 01:55:44.010
you get all those systems in place and then that's why like for V as you just

2118
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:45.090
<v 2>mentioned it and GSP,</v>

2119
01:55:45.091 --> 01:55:48.480
they had such a good relationship because it always felt to me a lot for hours

2120
01:55:48.481 --> 01:55:50.960
was like sitting in the corner with these, with these control pattern,

2121
01:55:51.390 --> 01:55:53.250
just kind of playing the game and because he,

2122
01:55:53.310 --> 01:55:56.710
because he'd programmed his fighters so well it was just a, it was pure,

2123
01:55:56.730 --> 01:55:57.720
it was a responsive thing.

2124
01:55:57.721 --> 01:56:02.430
Same with Matt Hume and a DJ and like obviously there's this some level of

2125
01:56:02.431 --> 01:56:05.700
freedom and creativity for the fighter, but they've always got that backup,

2126
01:56:05.701 --> 01:56:08.700
that person in the corner that can tell them something and they know exactly

2127
01:56:08.701 --> 01:56:11.660
what they mean and they just apply it and it works, you know? And,

2128
01:56:11.661 --> 01:56:14.340
and like those, those systems come into play.

2129
01:56:14.430 --> 01:56:17.820
And all the codes that are coming in now is, it's interesting,

2130
01:56:17.821 --> 01:56:19.800
it's an interest in development I think.

2131
01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:24.040
I think that those kinds of fighters will always fall short to the likes of the

2132
01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:28.560
Addison years and the and the Anderson Silvers that can play the game inside the

2133
01:56:28.561 --> 01:56:32.180
octagon. Like the, the thing like Anderson Silva, the,

2134
01:56:32.181 --> 01:56:34.590
I think the most underestimated knockout of his,

2135
01:56:34.591 --> 01:56:38.270
and it was a great knockout but still people don't really fully appreciate it

2136
01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:42.390
was the veto Belfort front kick to the face because Vito was expecting the low

2137
01:56:42.391 --> 01:56:45.930
kick and he brings his shit up to block the low kick as he gets kicked in the

2138
01:56:45.931 --> 01:56:49.740
face. And if you watch it from the opposite angle over veto his shoulder,

2139
01:56:49.741 --> 01:56:53.520
you can see Anderson's looking at his lead leg like that.

2140
01:56:53.700 --> 01:56:55.360
That is so underappreciated cause you,

2141
01:56:55.410 --> 01:56:57.420
you don't see those cells from the replays.

2142
01:56:57.421 --> 01:56:59.640
You don't see the glances and the looks and the,

2143
01:56:59.900 --> 01:57:01.950
the shifts of the body weight and you know the,

2144
01:57:02.190 --> 01:57:06.330
the nuances of the fight that when sometimes I'll watch these replaced 10 15

2145
01:57:06.331 --> 01:57:10.110
times from different angles and all of a sudden I'll see something and it's like

2146
01:57:10.111 --> 01:57:11.790
a light bulb moment. I love those moments.

2147
01:57:11.890 --> 01:57:12.161
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2148
01:57:12.161 --> 01:57:16.060
Anderson had many of those moments in his career where you recognize that he had

2149
01:57:16.061 --> 01:57:20.440
seen a pattern and then he just struck on that pattern and hit pay dirt and

2150
01:57:20.441 --> 01:57:23.890
you're like, Jesus Christ. Yeah, slap Mike's Holloway does it now

2151
01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:27.530
<v 2>first round. He's like his download round. Yeah, he gathers,</v>

2152
01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:28.580
he gathers information,

2153
01:57:28.581 --> 01:57:32.510
he studies that patterns and that's why if you look at Mike's Holloway stats,

2154
01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:36.470
he's, he's first Roundy's percentage of success is low and his outputs low,

2155
01:57:36.860 --> 01:57:41.570
but then as he's success rate increases, so disease output needs ridiculous.

2156
01:57:41.571 --> 01:57:43.340
Like I don't know any other fighter that does that.

2157
01:57:43.710 --> 01:57:46.740
<v 1>No, he's brilliant in that and his output is preposterous.</v>

2158
01:57:47.430 --> 01:57:52.140
Zau Pit is just so outrageous but not as outrageous as Colby Covington's.

2159
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:57.000
Colby Covington might have the most outrageous output in the sport.

2160
01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:00.420
It's outrageous. What about, what about him an Eastman though,

2161
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:04.560
do you think bowls outrageous. It's all who's the better wrestler? Yes.

2162
01:58:04.590 --> 01:58:07.350
Who's the better wrestler and who has more power and who can keep that up for

2163
01:58:07.351 --> 01:58:10.110
the longest cause Colby can keep that shit up for five rounds.

2164
01:58:10.470 --> 01:58:14.670
He's done an amazing job of getting people to dismiss him because they think

2165
01:58:14.671 --> 01:58:15.504
he's a piece of shit,

2166
01:58:17.300 --> 01:58:20.580
but it's with his and hat and all the trash talk that he does.

2167
01:58:20.700 --> 01:58:22.170
It's fucking brilliant man,

2168
01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:25.770
because what he's done is just insult everybody in.

2169
01:58:25.771 --> 01:58:30.771
Anybody get a lot of people talking about him and then fuck people up.

2170
01:58:31.170 --> 01:58:32.490
So it's like, whoa,

2171
01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:35.340
this is a crazy combination because it fucks with their head.

2172
01:58:35.340 --> 01:58:37.050
They don't want to lose to this guy.

2173
01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:40.350
They don't want to hear him talk shit after he beats your ass.

2174
01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:44.950
He's gonna Still Talk Shit. Fuck. There's a slight, I don't know,

2175
01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:46.060
depending upon the person,

2176
01:58:46.061 --> 01:58:49.900
but at least slight burden and experiencing that from a person,

2177
01:58:50.050 --> 01:58:51.190
it might be a big burden.

2178
01:58:51.310 --> 01:58:54.490
Maybe you're one of those people that has a hard time getting fucked with and

2179
01:58:54.491 --> 01:58:56.830
you can't, it keeps you up at night and then it's like a maybe.

2180
01:58:56.950 --> 01:59:00.460
Maybe it diminishes your performance 20% maybe 30% yeah,

2181
01:59:00.670 --> 01:59:04.630
and Colby doesn't get tired. He keeps coming.

2182
01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:06.250
It's terrifying.

2183
01:59:06.940 --> 01:59:10.120
Robbie law just kept bobbing and weaving and hoping for these openings that were

2184
01:59:10.121 --> 01:59:12.520
never there. And didn't you call me just on you?

2185
01:59:12.610 --> 01:59:14.590
He was punching some ridiculous amount,

2186
01:59:14.591 --> 01:59:18.370
like one every 2.4 seconds or some crazy shit.

2187
01:59:18.550 --> 01:59:20.290
He broke the work rate, right?

2188
01:59:20.380 --> 01:59:24.370
<v 2>Yeah, yeah. Something like that. Against Robbie Lawler. No, but Robbie just,</v>

2189
01:59:24.371 --> 01:59:27.580
you know like that first round in particular when he's up against the fence and

2190
01:59:27.581 --> 01:59:30.370
he wasn't even hand fighting the chokes like that.

2191
01:59:30.460 --> 01:59:33.400
It looked like he was kind of coasting for a couple of rounds with the intention

2192
01:59:33.401 --> 01:59:37.180
of getting started later. But then I just, I just think that the,

2193
01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:40.480
the intensity of, of Colby, we just burned him out faster than he expected.

2194
01:59:40.710 --> 01:59:42.960
<v 1>I think when you're an explosive guy,</v>

2195
01:59:42.990 --> 01:59:47.990
like Robbie is where he fires fucking hurricane speed bombs at you just,

2196
01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:49.560
and when he does that,

2197
01:59:49.561 --> 01:59:54.561
he's going 100% 100% Colby never goes a hundred percent if you watch him,

2198
01:59:55.591 --> 02:00:00.591
he's punching like 70% 60% 70% 60% and he just stays on you,

2199
02:00:00.631 --> 02:00:03.960
stays on you. Very Nick Diaz, like in Diaz, early days,

2200
02:00:04.260 --> 02:00:07.590
like when Diaz fought frank shamrock, perfect example.

2201
02:00:07.730 --> 02:00:08.970
Like he just puts that pace on you,

2202
02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:13.200
keeps talking shit and puts that pace on you and he's hitting you a lot so

2203
02:00:13.201 --> 02:00:15.780
you're always tight. Like you're always tightening up, tightening up,

2204
02:00:15.781 --> 02:00:17.880
and it's just draining your battery. Yeah.

2205
02:00:18.210 --> 02:00:22.770
And you don't want to lose this guy cause he's talked so much shit and you're

2206
02:00:22.771 --> 02:00:25.230
like, well he's talked so much shit, but when I get ahold of them, guess what?

2207
02:00:25.231 --> 02:00:28.650
When you get ahold of him, he's great. That's the problem.

2208
02:00:28.830 --> 02:00:32.340
The problem is all those things that fuck with you.

2209
02:00:32.610 --> 02:00:37.010
Plus he's a great fighter. So the meanness, the shit-talking,

2210
02:00:37.230 --> 02:00:41.250
all the, the MAG staff, the strippers, the CR, the cringe. You're like,

2211
02:00:41.490 --> 02:00:44.310
oh my God. Right. And then on top of it,

2212
02:00:44.311 --> 02:00:47.610
the fucking output inside the octagon, you're like, shit,

2213
02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:50.460
he's doing all that and he's fucking me up.

2214
02:00:50.461 --> 02:00:52.650
He might've fucked me up even if he didn't do all that.

2215
02:00:52.830 --> 02:00:55.650
But he does all that and I don't want to lose to him and he's fucking me up.

2216
02:00:55.651 --> 02:00:57.300
It's like, God damn.

2217
02:00:57.340 --> 02:00:59.110
<v 2>Do you think there's a point where Colby thinks,</v>

2218
02:00:59.140 --> 02:01:02.230
you know at any point during his training camp like, Shit,

2219
02:01:02.231 --> 02:01:03.820
I've stacked the odds against myself here.

2220
02:01:03.910 --> 02:01:07.150
I that moment before Marcus Davis where I thought to myself, if I lose here,

2221
02:01:07.151 --> 02:01:09.790
I'm going to like it. I'm going to look really fucking stupid.

2222
02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:14.920
<v 1>I think that Colby is doing a brilliant job of playing a bad guy like pro</v>

2223
02:01:15.981 --> 02:01:19.490
wrestling style and I think he didn't use to do that early in his career.

2224
02:01:19.491 --> 02:01:23.030
He was a hardworking guy who just went out there and fought his ass off,

2225
02:01:23.031 --> 02:01:26.120
but people didn't give a shit and they weren't giving him the credit that he

2226
02:01:26.121 --> 02:01:30.800
deserves and so he turned heel and from that he's become the interim

2227
02:01:30.801 --> 02:01:31.910
welterweight champion.

2228
02:01:32.030 --> 02:01:35.630
He's one of the most talked about guys in the sport he took on a character.

2229
02:01:35.930 --> 02:01:39.170
That's what I think and I think that character is super successful at fucking

2230
02:01:39.171 --> 02:01:43.670
with people you know mean and he can fucking fight man.

2231
02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:48.050
You can't underestimate that. That kind of cardio,

2232
02:01:48.260 --> 02:01:51.890
the kind of cardio is crazy to be able to do that for five rounds.

2233
02:01:51.980 --> 02:01:55.150
That's bananas that that pace is insane. Yeah.

2234
02:01:55.370 --> 02:01:57.470
I'm rubbing Lola's strong as well.

2235
02:01:57.500 --> 02:02:00.830
He's just such a difficult person to hold down. I wonder whether,

2236
02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:03.420
I wonder where the rubber Lola left some of his training camp in a way,

2237
02:02:03.430 --> 02:02:05.060
whether he left some of his effort in the gym.

2238
02:02:05.450 --> 02:02:07.880
I would imagine Robbie Lawler is the kind of God it's still trained.

2239
02:02:07.881 --> 02:02:12.530
Like he's in his 20s like he's like on it every day. Well maybe.

2240
02:02:12.650 --> 02:02:16.010
Or maybe they trained together and when they trained together,

2241
02:02:16.011 --> 02:02:18.170
Colby was getting the best of it. I mean,

2242
02:02:18.171 --> 02:02:21.150
I think they did train together to American top team, you know,

2243
02:02:21.230 --> 02:02:23.030
and maybe Colby knew that he got out, wrestle him.

2244
02:02:23.090 --> 02:02:27.230
He knew if just stayed on him, he would break them and out wrestle him. I mean,

2245
02:02:27.231 --> 02:02:30.110
when someone has an a wrestling advantage, he goes back to this one more time.

2246
02:02:30.111 --> 02:02:33.050
When someone has a wrestling advantage, that is a big deal.

2247
02:02:33.051 --> 02:02:36.440
When you start getting tired and this guy has better technique than you and he's

2248
02:02:36.441 --> 02:02:39.830
not as tired as you are because he's fighting more efficiently and then he gets

2249
02:02:39.831 --> 02:02:43.130
a hold of you and they're like, fuck him on my back. And then you're like,

2250
02:02:43.460 --> 02:02:45.620
God damn it. And then you try to get back up but you can't.

2251
02:02:45.740 --> 02:02:48.680
And the bell's over and you get back up and you are to keep this guy from taking

2252
02:02:48.681 --> 02:02:51.170
me down. Then boom, he takes you down to Dan again.

2253
02:02:51.171 --> 02:02:52.640
He keeps punching you on the feet.

2254
02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:55.700
He keeps hitting you and making you move backwards and you're just looking at a

2255
02:02:55.701 --> 02:02:56.600
land, this big bond,

2256
02:02:56.601 --> 02:02:59.120
but there's never an opening for it and you think he's going to slow down,

2257
02:02:59.121 --> 02:03:03.050
but he never does. So Colby against Habiba a catch weight. What'd you reckon?

2258
02:03:04.630 --> 02:03:08.950
Oh, who outpaces the other one? Dude, they could get Ted Nugent to sing now.

2259
02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:16.160
Fuck. Yeah. Um, I think that's a, an amazing fight.

2260
02:03:16.161 --> 02:03:18.650
If it could be ever did want to fight it 170,

2261
02:03:18.651 --> 02:03:21.260
I think him versus boost mom would also be an amazing fight.

2262
02:03:21.530 --> 02:03:24.650
I want to see Colby and new smart. I mean that's the fight, right?

2263
02:03:24.710 --> 02:03:29.180
I mean and I also think if you're going to have an interim champion,

2264
02:03:29.390 --> 02:03:33.380
you should treat that fighter like it's a champion.

2265
02:03:33.740 --> 02:03:35.930
Like you can't just take their fight,

2266
02:03:36.110 --> 02:03:39.140
you can't take their belt away if they don't want to fight right now because

2267
02:03:39.141 --> 02:03:42.920
they're injured or because they need surgery or I think we have to respect the

2268
02:03:42.921 --> 02:03:47.360
championship title. Otherwise people are going to look at interim championships.

2269
02:03:47.361 --> 02:03:51.590
Like it doesn't mean anything. It should mean as much as a championship.

2270
02:03:51.650 --> 02:03:55.160
Like we're saying you have to fight for the title next.

2271
02:03:55.550 --> 02:03:58.500
So to say that they don't have to fight for the title next and we're just going

2272
02:03:58.550 --> 02:04:01.340
to take that thing away from you. He's taken away like,

2273
02:04:01.341 --> 02:04:03.110
but you're still fighting the person still fight it.

2274
02:04:03.410 --> 02:04:04.670
So they're still the champion.

2275
02:04:04.730 --> 02:04:07.430
They didn't lose you just take it away because what,

2276
02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:12.800
is there a mandatory contender that the WBA the WBC, the IBF?

2277
02:04:12.801 --> 02:04:14.180
No it's just the UFC.

2278
02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:18.590
The FC decides like who fights and who had fights when I'm happy that they have

2279
02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:22.160
interim interim championships. Cause I think there's times and places for that,

2280
02:04:22.310 --> 02:04:25.880
but you've got to treat it like it's a championship and Colby never lost the

2281
02:04:25.881 --> 02:04:26.714
championship.

2282
02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:30.500
He won that interim title against RDA and incredible performance and then they

2283
02:04:30.501 --> 02:04:31.340
just take it away from them.

2284
02:04:31.670 --> 02:04:35.330
I don't think you need to like the problem is sometimes you've got the champion

2285
02:04:35.331 --> 02:04:38.250
defending that belt against another contender and there's an interim champion

2286
02:04:38.250 --> 02:04:39.450
<v 0>that's not available to fight,</v>

2287
02:04:39.451 --> 02:04:42.870
but that doesn't mean you have to strip the title from the interim champion.

2288
02:04:43.190 --> 02:04:46.060
That's still that still, it's almost like a, it's not a placeholder.

2289
02:04:46.110 --> 02:04:48.570
It's like a guarantee that they've got a title shot and their next fight

2290
02:04:48.571 --> 02:04:52.560
regardless injured. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. So what, 12 months? Like a normal,

2291
02:04:52.650 --> 02:04:55.860
like a normal champion. I just think, you know, in this day and age,

2292
02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:57.510
like there's this uh,

2293
02:04:58.470 --> 02:05:01.860
attitude that the fighters need to step up and fight even if they're injured.

2294
02:05:03.210 --> 02:05:07.800
Like that's not good for anybody. It's not good for the ultimate,

2295
02:05:08.610 --> 02:05:12.570
the eventual fight itself, the ultimate product that you're selling the fans.

2296
02:05:12.660 --> 02:05:16.020
It's definitely not good for the athletes. This is hard enough as it is.

2297
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:20.340
I think the solution to all this, and I'm a fucking, I'm beating a dead horse.

2298
02:05:20.650 --> 02:05:23.370
We're weight classes. I love one weight classes, one weight class,

2299
02:05:23.680 --> 02:05:24.513
more champions.

2300
02:05:24.570 --> 02:05:28.740
I keep saying this with these no need to move the one 70 weight class.

2301
02:05:28.741 --> 02:05:32.640
We can't move that. There's too much history there. You you want to go crazy?

2302
02:05:32.641 --> 02:05:35.940
You want to go 55 65 70 no, no, no. I want to say I want to go.

2303
02:05:35.970 --> 02:05:37.530
I want to use the old pride weight class,

2304
02:05:37.531 --> 02:05:41.670
so we do 55 62 60 twos right in the middle. Who are you?

2305
02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:45.260
62 63 that weird number. I'm telling you man. That's the weight class teammate.

2306
02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:47.010
Light welterweight. It's right in the middle of the two.

2307
02:05:47.190 --> 02:05:49.570
Think of the fighters that we get in that weight class. Mass video could,

2308
02:05:49.710 --> 02:05:52.710
could've stopped off there on his way up. Cowboy RDA.

2309
02:05:52.920 --> 02:05:55.500
We've got guys that could move down. I would say Covington.

2310
02:05:55.501 --> 02:05:58.980
Mike Perry could probably make that weight class and then you know the next

2311
02:05:58.981 --> 02:06:03.270
weight class after. That's one 77 that's halfway between the two weight classes.

2312
02:06:03.300 --> 02:06:05.820
You're talking madness. I'm making up these crazy numbers. These are,

2313
02:06:05.821 --> 02:06:08.700
these are the weight class I'm telling you. And then gasoline stops off.

2314
02:06:08.850 --> 02:06:11.970
They're on the way up. Like we were talking about Adolfo Vieira the, uh, the,

2315
02:06:12.090 --> 02:06:14.040
the guy that fought the weekend in Uruguay. Yes.

2316
02:06:14.190 --> 02:06:15.930
I would say he's not big enough for middleweight,

2317
02:06:16.020 --> 02:06:17.790
but I would say too big for welterweight.

2318
02:06:17.820 --> 02:06:20.520
And I would say the same about his opponent as he was light heavyweight in the

2319
02:06:20.521 --> 02:06:21.380
beginning of his career. Yeah.

2320
02:06:21.381 --> 02:06:24.600
But even if you study him next to another middleweight you would be surprised

2321
02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:28.380
while he was interviewing Bisbing Bisbing was interviewing him. I was like, wow.

2322
02:06:28.381 --> 02:06:31.220
Bisping's quite a bit larger than him. Yeah. He's just filled with muscle.

2323
02:06:31.250 --> 02:06:35.400
He's a tank, but you know, so was pro Hi-Rez right? Yeah.

2324
02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:38.340
He was pretty fucking effective with that style. Yeah.

2325
02:06:38.370 --> 02:06:42.720
I loved the idea of more way classes. I think it's easy to sell fives.

2326
02:06:43.620 --> 02:06:47.230
I know, but you know, we're not an idiot. I mean, come on, we can have,

2327
02:06:47.250 --> 02:06:51.650
we could have numbers that I don't know about you. Some people are idiots. Um,

2328
02:06:51.750 --> 02:06:53.700
I just, I don't like the idea of moving well to weight.

2329
02:06:54.420 --> 02:06:57.210
They would just be such a shame to lose that weight class. Oh, that's so silly.

2330
02:06:57.990 --> 02:07:01.860
You know, the usual, in the early days, it was one 99 for light heavyweight.

2331
02:07:01.980 --> 02:07:05.710
I remember those. When Tito Ortiz first made a debut, it was one 99 yeah.

2332
02:07:05.730 --> 02:07:08.190
What was pride? Was that one 90 I don't remember.

2333
02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:12.900
It's Dan Henderson was like either side of the line. He won both, right?

2334
02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:17.040
Yeah. Dan Anderson that people forgot what a fucking savage he was in pride.

2335
02:07:17.790 --> 02:07:22.560
Woo. The monster to took a shot better than anybody that's ever lived. God Damn.

2336
02:07:22.950 --> 02:07:27.480
Here it goes. Okay. Submittal weight was a 205 pounds.

2337
02:07:27.481 --> 02:07:30.870
Welterweight was 183 pounds. Interesting.

2338
02:07:31.050 --> 02:07:34.800
Lightweight one 61 yeah, so those are close.

2339
02:07:35.470 --> 02:07:36.260
That's interesting.

2340
02:07:36.260 --> 02:07:39.640
<v 2>Yeah. I fought at one 61 I've fought at one 60 twice.</v>

2341
02:07:39.850 --> 02:07:43.860
What do you walk around at right now? I'm light now. I'm like 82 wow. Yeah,

2342
02:07:43.990 --> 02:07:44.830
but we're not like I was,

2343
02:07:45.620 --> 02:07:48.610
I always start at training camp over 200 pounds when I was at fighting at

2344
02:07:48.611 --> 02:07:51.940
welterweight. If you fought and you would want to fight welterweight again.

2345
02:07:51.941 --> 02:07:54.900
Right. I bet I'd be open. Yeah. Well to wait, like I,

2346
02:07:55.090 --> 02:07:58.540
I could probably make lightweight if I put one time. Yeah, I'd give it a go.

2347
02:07:58.720 --> 02:08:02.710
I'd give it a go. How much body fat do you think you would try to lose first?

2348
02:08:02.860 --> 02:08:06.880
You would try to lose a lot of body fat first. Get down in the 70s yeah.

2349
02:08:06.910 --> 02:08:09.850
I could probably go back, play six pounds. I could lose without, you know,

2350
02:08:09.851 --> 02:08:14.380
without me looking unhealthy. Do you eat clean? Yes. Even though,

2351
02:08:14.381 --> 02:08:17.710
you know, like not this week I'm not coming to California in and out.

2352
02:08:17.710 --> 02:08:21.460
Burger would eat in and out burger last night. Yeah. I'm having a few like,

2353
02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:24.130
you know, I'm walking over all ground and having a good, you know,

2354
02:08:24.131 --> 02:08:25.260
some memories because a,

2355
02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:29.620
I went to the one oh one cafe and [inaudible] we used to go there after the Thai

2356
02:08:29.621 --> 02:08:34.270
boxing fights and so yeah, in and out Burger is awesome. Old School. I love it.

2357
02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:38.500
But yeah, generally, yes I do. Generally, yes I do. And I tend to eat,

2358
02:08:38.860 --> 02:08:42.310
I tend to eat in a small window of time, so like sort of six or eight hours.

2359
02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:46.240
And that tends to start later in the day because I'm on a weird sleep cycle

2360
02:08:46.241 --> 02:08:49.190
because I mean I'm living in the UK, most of the flights are, you know,

2361
02:08:49.210 --> 02:08:53.050
the main card starting at 3:00 AM on a Saturday. And I'm like, you know, so I,

2362
02:08:53.060 --> 02:08:56.290
so I stepped to watch the fights and sometimes then I worked for into Sunday,

2363
02:08:56.990 --> 02:08:59.890
uh, doing like radio shows and that kind of thing. Stay awake. Yeah,

2364
02:08:59.980 --> 02:09:02.320
pretty much. So then my whole week kinda kicks over,

2365
02:09:02.321 --> 02:09:06.220
so I'm usually getting up at about noon and then started my start eating at

2366
02:09:06.221 --> 02:09:10.870
about six or seven in the evening and I eat for a few hours and then stop train

2367
02:09:10.871 --> 02:09:14.770
late at night as well. Um, and why are you in town right now? Why are you in la?

2368
02:09:15.320 --> 02:09:18.120
Um, well I'm, I'm here for the fights predominantly. I've got my, uh,

2369
02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:21.850
my team in town, my, my youtube guys, the raptors, the, the tills gentleman,

2370
02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:25.870
the gentleman, the other surprise me. Then I was like, are you, yeah.

2371
02:09:25.871 --> 02:09:29.470
So w we started a youtube channel about three months ago and hit 20,000

2372
02:09:29.471 --> 02:09:32.170
subscribers recently, which is all beautiful. What does it tell people?

2373
02:09:32.350 --> 02:09:35.710
So basically we're doing, uh, we've got a few different series.

2374
02:09:35.711 --> 02:09:37.540
The one I'm working on at the moment is the war room,

2375
02:09:37.570 --> 02:09:41.050
which is my breakdowns of the fight. So I do inside the octagon for the UFC,

2376
02:09:41.051 --> 02:09:44.410
but because I only do the main events and the European cards,

2377
02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:47.470
I get so many messages for the fight. So like for this week,

2378
02:09:47.471 --> 02:09:51.900
everybody wanted a Diaz Pettis breakdown and a, a Ramiro Acosta breakdown.

2379
02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:54.310
So I've done both of them and they're up. Um,

2380
02:09:54.460 --> 02:09:58.500
and this is all you independently correct? This is beautiful. Now d,

2381
02:09:58.540 --> 02:10:01.970
Are you allowed to use footage? Yes. The U s here allow me to use, for example.

2382
02:10:02.770 --> 02:10:05.710
Cool. Yeah. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you for that. I appreciate it.

2383
02:10:05.770 --> 02:10:08.890
Excellent. Why wasn't a great, is the thing, I mean,

2384
02:10:08.891 --> 02:10:11.290
I'm a UFC ambassador in Europe, so like,

2385
02:10:11.291 --> 02:10:14.410
my job is to promote the USC and promote the sport. I've just, um,

2386
02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:18.910
I've just taken a job as the head of MMA for UFC gym in Europe as in the UK as

2387
02:10:18.911 --> 02:10:22.190
well. Oh excellent. So we've got a load of gyms opening up. Um,

2388
02:10:22.270 --> 02:10:23.770
and my own gym obviously is opened up.

2389
02:10:23.771 --> 02:10:27.190
And then like the youtube channel was really my main focus cause it's my

2390
02:10:27.530 --> 02:10:27.650
ability,

2391
02:10:27.650 --> 02:10:30.940
it's my way to communicate directly to the fans cause they're constantly asking

2392
02:10:30.941 --> 02:10:34.010
for breakdown. So I can do that. And the raptors are now doing all the

2393
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:36.500
<v 0>media stuff, so their Creighton vlogs and,</v>

2394
02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:40.430
but I mean today I actually feel today I was saying this on the drive over cause

2395
02:10:40.431 --> 02:10:43.250
they want it to come over and meet you, big fans of the podcast and everything.

2396
02:10:43.251 --> 02:10:45.980
So, uh, I brought the, brought them t show in Vegas as well,

2397
02:10:45.981 --> 02:10:48.020
which they blew their mind. Um,

2398
02:10:48.050 --> 02:10:50.810
but they were supposed to be at media day to day interview in the fighters,

2399
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:53.900
you know, as part of their job this week. So I said I feel like a,

2400
02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:55.850
like a pair and taking them out of school for the day.

2401
02:10:56.450 --> 02:10:59.330
Cause when we're done here I'm gonna take 'em to the males, drive through them,

2402
02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:03.800
then open up to Malibu and show some, some California views. Yeah,

2403
02:11:03.860 --> 02:11:05.990
show him the tour. That's excellent man.

2404
02:11:06.020 --> 02:11:08.420
I think you do a fantastic job of breaking down fights.

2405
02:11:08.421 --> 02:11:12.710
I always like your analysis of how things are going to go and a one of the,

2406
02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:16.130
one of the reasons why I was really excited about you being today is because

2407
02:11:16.131 --> 02:11:19.370
this weekend there's, it's a great fight card,

2408
02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:23.810
like the Steve a DC DC rematches an amazing car. Amazing fight for that card.

2409
02:11:24.140 --> 02:11:28.580
I love the card in general, but the Paula Kosta, UL Romero fight.

2410
02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:32.510
That's the one that perplexes me. Like how does that go down?

2411
02:11:32.660 --> 02:11:37.580
What happens when these tool fucking Brahma Bulls smash heads in the middle of

2412
02:11:37.581 --> 02:11:41.750
the octagon? First of all, it's all time. Best body fight ever, right? Yes.

2413
02:11:41.870 --> 02:11:45.980
Oh for sure. Absolutely. They both let the Chisel. That rock is ridiculous.

2414
02:11:45.981 --> 02:11:49.940
Like statues of Gods, both of them.

2415
02:11:50.090 --> 02:11:51.740
If you're going through options for bodies,

2416
02:11:51.741 --> 02:11:56.741
if you could choose like it's flip a coin and these guys getting robbed either

2417
02:11:57.321 --> 02:11:58.030
way,

2418
02:11:58.030 --> 02:12:02.780
whether it coaster Romero might have an advantage cause he's so freakish,

2419
02:12:03.370 --> 02:12:05.450
he's so freakishly built that,

2420
02:12:05.451 --> 02:12:08.510
I mean you can't imagine someone having a better bonding. Yeah,

2421
02:12:08.690 --> 02:12:11.060
you just have a different body. It's just, it's he, the two of them,

2422
02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:12.240
they're look at Yo,

2423
02:12:12.250 --> 02:12:16.010
well look at y'all out and right there when he's posing he doesn't even look

2424
02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:20.990
real. Jesus Christ. He's such a tough dude. The thing, the difference in the,

2425
02:12:20.991 --> 02:12:23.180
in this, in this fight between the two ways that I think,

2426
02:12:23.210 --> 02:12:26.870
well we know Ramiro can fight for five rounds and he will take his time early.

2427
02:12:27.340 --> 02:12:32.210
But Costa comes out throwing guns. Stress, dangerous man. Wild stress is very,

2428
02:12:32.211 --> 02:12:34.970
very, very dangerous. He's got outstanding striking.

2429
02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:38.510
He's got real power and he's fast. He's fast and powerful.

2430
02:12:38.540 --> 02:12:43.490
The thing is though is he is fast and powerful as Gol and you know,

2431
02:12:43.491 --> 02:12:48.140
he's beaten really good guys like Uriah Hall. But this is the cream of the crop.

2432
02:12:48.530 --> 02:12:52.250
I mean he's in there against the mother fucker of all motherfuckers at one 85

2433
02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:56.510
and you talk about a dude who just can explode on you and send you flying

2434
02:12:56.511 --> 02:13:00.590
through the air. Yeah. He ragdolls people. He does peep the shit that people,

2435
02:13:00.591 --> 02:13:03.470
when he's wrestling them and you just go, what the fuck?

2436
02:13:04.010 --> 02:13:07.820
He jumps at them with shots when he knocked out Luke Rockhold with that left

2437
02:13:07.821 --> 02:13:10.660
hand. You're like, what the fuck? Not Shotguns.

2438
02:13:10.670 --> 02:13:13.760
And then steps in boom and then kisses them.

2439
02:13:14.900 --> 02:13:19.880
Get the fuck out of here man. That's David Goggins and say stole souls.

2440
02:13:20.060 --> 02:13:23.960
Yeah, he stole soles is a ridiculous athlete. I'm ridiculous.

2441
02:13:23.961 --> 02:13:28.610
My cell is the pilot Costas undefeated mentality might play into it.

2442
02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:30.290
Play into Ramirez hands a bit.

2443
02:13:31.100 --> 02:13:33.300
Cause cost is going to come crashing forward and Ramiro,

2444
02:13:33.480 --> 02:13:36.930
we'll just take his time maybe. And, and Costa has gas,

2445
02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:38.280
I mean the guest on the ultimate fighter.

2446
02:13:38.281 --> 02:13:41.460
So if he fights hard for a couple of rounds and Ramiro's you know,

2447
02:13:41.461 --> 02:13:45.690
I'm still strong in the third. I think he's a different guy now. Uh, really do.

2448
02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:46.620
Yeah. I mean, I think,

2449
02:13:46.710 --> 02:13:50.790
I think Paul Acosta is at the top of the heap for a real reason now on a lot of

2450
02:13:50.791 --> 02:13:55.530
it is dedication while lead Ishmael. Um, that guy was a lunatic.

2451
02:13:55.560 --> 02:13:58.920
I love that guy. He's training. He's awesome. Yeah.

2452
02:13:59.030 --> 02:14:00.330
And I remember training pride days.

2453
02:14:01.220 --> 02:14:04.230
Paula Kosta is working with them and I've talked to me about them and you know

2454
02:14:04.231 --> 02:14:07.200
how crazy we'll eat it. She's just like keep making shoes his food.

2455
02:14:07.470 --> 02:14:08.310
That's what he kept saying.

2456
02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:12.630
He measures his food like that dude has like everything portioned out.

2457
02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:16.440
He's just like a hundred percent eyes on the prize. He goes,

2458
02:14:16.441 --> 02:14:19.280
that's all he does is train. He goes, this guy doesn't party,

2459
02:14:19.300 --> 02:14:22.710
doesn't fuck around. He's just concentrating on measuring his food and training.

2460
02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:26.400
So what about the money that Ramirez come into recently trying to change his

2461
02:14:26.401 --> 02:14:30.060
mentality? Well, here's the thing, man. I don't know if it's real.

2462
02:14:30.300 --> 02:14:33.270
I Dunno if they're ever going to give him that money really to stare down man.

2463
02:14:35.230 --> 02:14:36.063
<v 3>Woo.</v>

2464
02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:38.740
<v 0>But that's the guy not to tangle with security.</v>

2465
02:14:38.741 --> 02:14:43.000
Steve read on the right hand side. Steve's a bad motherfucker playing games.

2466
02:14:43.330 --> 02:14:47.080
He's got eyes in the dude's eyes like yeah, what the fuck is up?

2467
02:14:47.270 --> 02:14:49.930
He saved a couple of shows in Europe that could have gone very good at going

2468
02:14:49.931 --> 02:14:53.320
south. I'm sure I have a little story for you from the Gdansk show.

2469
02:14:53.321 --> 02:14:55.230
So like I'm standing on stage at the weigh ins,

2470
02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:59.260
I'm announcing the fires as they come out. And um, we have a fight on the card.

2471
02:14:59.261 --> 02:15:02.650
We have a Polish fighter against the Anthony Hamilton.

2472
02:15:03.370 --> 02:15:06.970
And I had the voice come through in my ear saying that that flight wasn't going

2473
02:15:06.971 --> 02:15:07.511
to be walking.

2474
02:15:07.511 --> 02:15:11.260
So just to drop it off the schedule like during the way and to go in and

2475
02:15:11.290 --> 02:15:14.360
immediately I'm thinking that's kind of kind of strange and I'm not sure where

2476
02:15:14.490 --> 02:15:17.350
that obviously, you know, some areas of Poland, there's a racial undertone.

2477
02:15:17.350 --> 02:15:20.950
I wasn't sure whether it was because Anthony Hamilton was gonna get some heat if

2478
02:15:20.951 --> 02:15:22.030
he walks out on stage.

2479
02:15:22.450 --> 02:15:25.690
The next thing I've got quite a unique perspective cause I can see down the two

2480
02:15:25.691 --> 02:15:27.700
tunnels where the fans walk into the floor.

2481
02:15:28.060 --> 02:15:32.740
And I saw this whole bunch of like skinheads with like bomber jackets and boots

2482
02:15:32.741 --> 02:15:36.400
just come marching in and they filled the floor space and then they went, oh,

2483
02:15:36.401 --> 02:15:39.580
went and sat down in one of the blocks and just sat there waiting for him.

2484
02:15:39.820 --> 02:15:44.290
And it was because he was from a rival football from, whoa. Yeah. Oh,

2485
02:15:44.460 --> 02:15:46.630
I'd heard about that. Yeah, that's right.

2486
02:15:46.660 --> 02:15:49.060
I had heard about that and that's why they cancel the fight. Yeah,

2487
02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:52.180
they moved it over to Australia, but like they came around security.

2488
02:15:52.181 --> 02:15:54.700
They came through the glass in the, at the arena just,

2489
02:15:55.870 --> 02:15:59.380
and if it wasn't for Steve that, that, that whole thing would have gone south.

2490
02:15:59.410 --> 02:16:01.840
Like he's the dude.

2491
02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:05.440
You imagine if there was a fucking hooligan brawl in the middle of a UFC.

2492
02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:09.340
Oh man, that'd be awful. Terrible for the sport. Yeah, that'd be terrible.

2493
02:16:09.341 --> 02:16:12.490
Now Steve is a, he's wise man, sees everything.

2494
02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:17.410
How do you feel like Romero and Costa plays out if you had a bank on it?

2495
02:16:17.980 --> 02:16:21.820
If I gave you 100 bucks, we, hi. What do you see how you see this play out?

2496
02:16:22.060 --> 02:16:25.330
I think Costa starts fast and I think he pushes Ramiro back up against the

2497
02:16:25.331 --> 02:16:28.750
fence. Ramiro defends it. D you know, covers and covers,

2498
02:16:28.840 --> 02:16:30.220
throws couple of shots to push

2499
02:16:30.370 --> 02:16:33.120
<v 2>Costa back. And then I think the second round comes in cost,</v>

2500
02:16:33.260 --> 02:16:35.740
it comes crashing forward and Romera catches in with something,

2501
02:16:36.310 --> 02:16:38.650
right hook over the top, something like that.

2502
02:16:38.860 --> 02:16:40.630
The technique I'm watching out for for Costa,

2503
02:16:40.631 --> 02:16:42.730
which is going to be useful for a mirror,

2504
02:16:43.270 --> 02:16:47.770
he throws a great body kick to left Hook and Ramirez got this bad habit and you

2505
02:16:47.771 --> 02:16:49.450
can see it all the way through the Whitaker fights.

2506
02:16:49.451 --> 02:16:50.620
Every time someone throws a kick,

2507
02:16:50.621 --> 02:16:54.520
he does this like overdramatized scoop with his arm to like Perry it out of the

2508
02:16:54.521 --> 02:16:58.540
way if he's carrying out that the way that body kick is and be wide open for the

2509
02:16:58.541 --> 02:17:00.910
left hook. So that's something I'm watching out for with Costa.

2510
02:17:01.210 --> 02:17:02.920
I just feel like he's over confidence.

2511
02:17:03.100 --> 02:17:07.840
His willingness to take risks and the fact that Ramiro's patient can take his

2512
02:17:07.841 --> 02:17:11.290
time is never in a rush to get the knockout because he knows he can get it at

2513
02:17:11.291 --> 02:17:15.050
any point in the fight. I feel like his patients might play off on customer.

2514
02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:16.480
Mike might walk onto something.

2515
02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:21.380
<v 1>MMM. Imagine if he kaos Costa and we play this over that.</v>

2516
02:17:21.920 --> 02:17:23.150
You look like Goddamn here.

2517
02:17:23.300 --> 02:17:26.450
But what's most likely happen is that it's going to be completely opposite.

2518
02:17:26.650 --> 02:17:29.870
And it wasn't really like was he got a job with the UFC is now the list? Well,

2519
02:17:29.871 --> 02:17:31.970
every now and then you're so wrong.

2520
02:17:32.030 --> 02:17:35.840
Like when Derek Lewis fought Francis in Ghana, I was like, Holy Shit,

2521
02:17:35.841 --> 02:17:37.190
don't go for popcorn.

2522
02:17:37.191 --> 02:17:40.880
This has gotta be fucking chaos is going to be fucking chaos.

2523
02:17:41.060 --> 02:17:45.200
I was nervous before that five star. I was like, Holy Shit.

2524
02:17:45.201 --> 02:17:46.100
Here we go.

2525
02:17:46.220 --> 02:17:48.770
I'm like Francis and John was going to be gunning for the title again.

2526
02:17:48.890 --> 02:17:50.420
He's going to come out guns blazing.

2527
02:17:51.350 --> 02:17:54.500
Derek Lewis goes to war every single God damn time. They're both enormous.

2528
02:17:54.501 --> 02:17:56.000
I'm like, fuck, can we go?

2529
02:17:56.880 --> 02:18:00.160
<v 2>Nothing. Yeah. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.</v>

2530
02:18:00.330 --> 02:18:01.920
We working with crews on that night.

2531
02:18:01.950 --> 02:18:05.310
There was somebody else who you were working with and they said the woods that

2532
02:18:05.311 --> 02:18:08.820
you never say during a heavyweight fire, as soon as it's about to start,

2533
02:18:08.821 --> 02:18:12.840
they go, there's no way this is going the distance. Ooh, yeah.

2534
02:18:12.841 --> 02:18:15.690
That's a rough thing to say. Was it straight away? And I remember this

2535
02:18:15.930 --> 02:18:19.980
<v 1>well, I was [inaudible] there's no way this is going in the distance. I'm like,</v>

2536
02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:23.160
oh, did you put that Voodoo on me? Ricky Bobby.

2537
02:18:24.890 --> 02:18:28.920
Oh yeah, that was a, that was a rough one man. But it's,

2538
02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:31.620
it's interesting how uh, Francis has bounced back.

2539
02:18:32.160 --> 02:18:35.270
<v 2>France is just nuke and everybody now it's just not mental hump. Yeah.</v>

2540
02:18:35.271 --> 02:18:39.170
He had a con right. He had to go through that one fight. You know,

2541
02:18:39.330 --> 02:18:42.650
the thing is sometimes we get these fights coming into the UFC and you know,

2542
02:18:42.830 --> 02:18:45.950
they're so talented that they're there in the UFC fairly early in their career

2543
02:18:45.951 --> 02:18:47.450
before they've had any real lessons,

2544
02:18:47.451 --> 02:18:50.850
especially if they've just starched a bunch of guys. They come in at, you know,

2545
02:18:51.110 --> 02:18:53.360
10 flights into their career and they've knocked everyone out in the first

2546
02:18:53.361 --> 02:18:54.194
round.

2547
02:18:54.230 --> 02:18:57.170
There's no real learning process there because they've not found anyone to

2548
02:18:57.171 --> 02:18:58.004
challenge them.

2549
02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:01.280
So then they get into the UFC and then we get to see them go through that

2550
02:19:01.281 --> 02:19:05.390
process in the UFC. And I think that's what we've seen within knew, you know,

2551
02:19:05.600 --> 02:19:09.170
took him get into a world title for someone to really show him something in his

2552
02:19:09.171 --> 02:19:13.070
game that made him feel vulnerable. And then, you know,

2553
02:19:13.071 --> 02:19:14.620
we've watched him go through that process.

2554
02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:18.440
Like in the moment it's really annoying because we want to see a mad fight.

2555
02:19:18.590 --> 02:19:20.780
But in hindsight you can kind of look at it and go,

2556
02:19:20.781 --> 02:19:23.780
well I appreciate that as part of his journey now. And you know,

2557
02:19:24.110 --> 02:19:28.160
I understand where he was at. You got to give steeple credit for taking

2558
02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:32.930
<v 0>fucking bombs in that fight. I mean he took bombs in that fight,</v>

2559
02:19:33.410 --> 02:19:36.530
especially in that first round all at fuck.

2560
02:19:37.460 --> 02:19:39.830
Francis is always in it when he's standing in front of you,

2561
02:19:40.070 --> 02:19:41.900
when he's standing in front of you, he's always in it.

2562
02:19:41.960 --> 02:19:46.190
But Steve Bay managed to just slide away from most of them.

2563
02:19:46.220 --> 02:19:49.370
The ones he got hit with, he went with them, rolled with them.

2564
02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:50.690
The ones you got to hit clean with.

2565
02:19:50.691 --> 02:19:54.650
He just absorbed and kept going and ground them out.

2566
02:19:54.950 --> 02:19:56.180
So here's a question for you then.

2567
02:19:56.181 --> 02:19:59.600
Do you think you take punches better if you expect the person to punch hard?

2568
02:20:00.080 --> 02:20:03.920
Probably because I would say that he took bigger punches from Ingando in that

2569
02:20:03.921 --> 02:20:05.960
fight than that than the punch from DC.

2570
02:20:05.990 --> 02:20:08.930
And I would say he was probably more vulnerable to the punch from DC because he

2571
02:20:08.931 --> 02:20:12.860
probably wasn't expecting DC to knock him out. Could be, could be,

2572
02:20:12.861 --> 02:20:15.530
wouldn't expect to get caught like that in the clinch either.

2573
02:20:15.560 --> 02:20:20.560
There was a really perfect utilization of the clench work combined with that

2574
02:20:21.231 --> 02:20:22.790
crazy big overhand right.

2575
02:20:23.150 --> 02:20:26.540
I mean he really set him up perfectly for that and it was something that

2576
02:20:26.541 --> 02:20:30.440
obviously was a part of his repertoire. It was not something that was just, Oh,

2577
02:20:30.441 --> 02:20:31.760
it was just having to be there for the moment.

2578
02:20:31.880 --> 02:20:35.780
He set him up for that and that that was just a perfect right hand.

2579
02:20:35.781 --> 02:20:38.330
And he caught him when he was looking. I mean, he just didn't,

2580
02:20:38.450 --> 02:20:41.420
didn't know that punch was common, clipped him, dropped him, put him away.

2581
02:20:41.990 --> 02:20:44.930
The real question is what's it going to be like now that he knows that DC can

2582
02:20:44.931 --> 02:20:47.960
knock them out and mean? Is he gonna fight from the outside,

2583
02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:51.230
try to land big shots. He's gonna avoid the clench at any cost.

2584
02:20:51.230 --> 02:20:55.580
Now he's got a big height and reach advantage. Can he keep DC off of him?

2585
02:20:56.090 --> 02:21:00.410
And then also when a fighter is,

2586
02:21:00.411 --> 02:21:04.970
had a lot of wars, like Kim with junior dos Santos, the first fight,

2587
02:21:04.971 --> 02:21:06.260
it was a war, right?

2588
02:21:06.350 --> 02:21:11.350
I mean he's had some wars and his career street fight the in Ghana fight true

2589
02:21:11.361 --> 02:21:13.500
fight was a war is Scott stopped in that fight.

2590
02:21:14.210 --> 02:21:16.820
You know how many the Mark Hunt fight, right?

2591
02:21:17.270 --> 02:21:21.680
That was a war CP dominated time from top position as well.

2592
02:21:21.760 --> 02:21:25.640
And even the Alistair Overeem fight, I mean that first round was causing chaos.

2593
02:21:25.760 --> 02:21:28.010
It was chaos until he wound up stopping him.

2594
02:21:28.730 --> 02:21:30.710
How many of those can a fighter have?

2595
02:21:31.310 --> 02:21:33.740
How many of those can fighter have before we see them?

2596
02:21:33.800 --> 02:21:37.280
Start to fade in front of our eyes and I'm not suggesting that we saw that with

2597
02:21:37.281 --> 02:21:41.240
him because he was able to withstand the scariest fucking heavyweight striker in

2598
02:21:41.350 --> 02:21:42.183
this sport.

2599
02:21:43.070 --> 02:21:47.840
And I think the DC punch was just a punch he didn't see and it was perfect and

2600
02:21:47.841 --> 02:21:51.620
it just put them away. Yeah. Would be surprised if it happens again first round.

2601
02:21:51.680 --> 02:21:53.900
I'd be surprised if it happens again because I think he's,

2602
02:21:54.230 --> 02:21:57.440
he is going to be far more respectful of the fact that DC's got power now for

2603
02:21:57.441 --> 02:21:57.950
sure.

2604
02:21:57.950 --> 02:22:01.490
I think you're 100% right and let you go back to his UFC debut and like he did

2605
02:22:01.491 --> 02:22:02.240
fight long.

2606
02:22:02.240 --> 02:22:06.500
Like he used to use the real good lung jab and a low kick and like recently his

2607
02:22:06.530 --> 02:22:10.130
is kind of crowded. His work a lot is steps in re close with that right hand,

2608
02:22:10.131 --> 02:22:12.470
which often, you know, offered the clinch, the DC,

2609
02:22:12.530 --> 02:22:16.520
he's just Kale and so many people that I think that he's like fuck it. You know,

2610
02:22:16.730 --> 02:22:19.280
I'm just going to get in there and just bombs away with these people.

2611
02:22:19.310 --> 02:22:21.350
I mean makes it exciting. It's,

2612
02:22:21.380 --> 02:22:26.380
I think he is the least appreciated successful heavyweight

2613
02:22:26.490 --> 02:22:28.590
<v 1>champion ever. And I don't understand it.</v>

2614
02:22:28.620 --> 02:22:32.400
I don't understand that he's got everything. He's a, uh, you know,

2615
02:22:32.880 --> 02:22:37.110
he's a firefighter, an active duty firefighter. He's a knockout fighter.

2616
02:22:37.350 --> 02:22:41.160
You mean he knocked out for doom moving backwards with a perfectly placed right

2617
02:22:41.161 --> 02:22:44.490
hand. He's a fucking animal. I mean,

2618
02:22:44.491 --> 02:22:49.050
he fights super exciting. He's been smashing everybody. He stopped,

2619
02:22:49.530 --> 02:22:54.530
he won more heavyweight title fights than anyone in history.

2620
02:22:55.320 --> 02:22:58.890
He defended the title four fucking times. No one's been able to do that.

2621
02:22:59.040 --> 02:23:03.330
That's how crazy that division is and still does not get the respect he

2622
02:23:03.331 --> 02:23:05.730
deserves. And He seems pissed off this week as well.

2623
02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:10.140
Good luck in his interview diseases. Fighter man, guys. An animal.

2624
02:23:10.590 --> 02:23:11.423
Yeah.

2625
02:23:11.480 --> 02:23:12.920
<v 2>He just, he seems annoyed. I just,</v>

2626
02:23:12.950 --> 02:23:15.440
I wonder whether that's going to play into the flight because I got the

2627
02:23:15.441 --> 02:23:18.560
impression from him that you did not watch the, the previous fight.

2628
02:23:19.550 --> 02:23:24.140
I got the impression that you'd not watched the first DC fight. Yeah. So that,

2629
02:23:24.190 --> 02:23:26.320
see that concerns because then the idea of,

2630
02:23:26.350 --> 02:23:29.510
of what happened in his head might be very different to what actually happened.

2631
02:23:31.580 --> 02:23:35.750
<v 1>Well God, do you really think they would let him not watch that? I don't know.</v>

2632
02:23:36.630 --> 02:23:39.240
<v 2>I don't know. I mean there are some fighters that do, it just blows my mind.</v>

2633
02:23:39.241 --> 02:23:42.120
And the way he was talking in an interview was like, like it's, you know,

2634
02:23:43.140 --> 02:23:44.100
and the other, the thing,

2635
02:23:44.610 --> 02:23:47.520
the thing that concerns me more is that he was talking about how he was winning

2636
02:23:47.521 --> 02:23:50.490
that that first round, you know, he felt like he was controlling the fight.

2637
02:23:50.491 --> 02:23:53.100
He was, he did a lot of good things until DC caught him.

2638
02:23:53.490 --> 02:23:55.570
So if he starts banking on that being, you know,

2639
02:23:55.571 --> 02:23:58.870
just one of those punches that he got caught with, he might not, you know,

2640
02:23:59.010 --> 02:24:02.640
give DC the credit for, you know, opening that vulnerability up.

2641
02:24:02.740 --> 02:24:03.131
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

2642
02:24:03.131 --> 02:24:06.820
I think for sure he must have heard all the different people discuss tactics

2643
02:24:06.821 --> 02:24:10.270
though. So it doesn't make any sense to me that he insulates himself that well.

2644
02:24:10.480 --> 02:24:13.240
And for sure his coaches over at strong style. They've definitely,

2645
02:24:13.540 --> 02:24:14.373
oh they've watched it.

2646
02:24:15.100 --> 02:24:18.350
They understand what w so maybe he realized in his coaches,

2647
02:24:18.580 --> 02:24:22.270
in their guidance of him during training and he for sure he knows that DC

2648
02:24:22.271 --> 02:24:23.104
knocked him out.

2649
02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:26.620
So when he's going to do is go in there and fight like he's trying to get it

2650
02:24:26.621 --> 02:24:28.000
back. The question is,

2651
02:24:28.420 --> 02:24:33.010
is he going to be able to use that Longreach in that height and that power on

2652
02:24:33.011 --> 02:24:37.000
the outside and keep TC the fuck away from him cause he's got a considerable

2653
02:24:37.180 --> 02:24:40.060
height and reach advantage Kenny stuff, those take downs.

2654
02:24:40.420 --> 02:24:42.550
Can he keep DC from getting on top of him? Can,

2655
02:24:42.580 --> 02:24:45.730
you know if he can do all those things, he can get very interesting.

2656
02:24:46.030 --> 02:24:50.290
And if DC, you know, he's undefeated at heavyweight man.

2657
02:24:50.350 --> 02:24:52.600
I mean I think that's really where he shines.

2658
02:24:52.660 --> 02:24:55.570
You look at what he did to Josh Barnett fucking throws him to the air like a

2659
02:24:55.571 --> 02:24:58.480
ragdoll when he was in the Strikeforce Grand Prix did,

2660
02:24:58.481 --> 02:25:02.200
he was a monster at heavyweight, you know, and the wrestling's unparalleled.

2661
02:25:02.450 --> 02:25:07.300
Yeah. So do we get Jones at heavyweight then? I hope so. I do. I really do.

2662
02:25:07.510 --> 02:25:09.550
I think he wants to do it at light heavyweight though.

2663
02:25:09.580 --> 02:25:13.580
I think he wants to prove a point what d c wants to do with La heavyweight. Yes.

2664
02:25:13.660 --> 02:25:15.220
I didn't think he wants to lose that weight again.

2665
02:25:15.221 --> 02:25:19.510
Those are what I had heard was that he wanted to fight at light heavyweight if

2666
02:25:19.511 --> 02:25:21.940
he fights John for a third time. That's what I had heard.

2667
02:25:22.420 --> 02:25:25.720
And I think I heard it from him. Huh. And he,

2668
02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:30.190
but I would incur if I was in his camp, I'd say, fuck all this dieting, bro.

2669
02:25:30.280 --> 02:25:34.900
Like, look, you, you, you know, when you have a belly, you fuck people up.

2670
02:25:35.260 --> 02:25:36.610
You know? And he doesn't worry about food.

2671
02:25:36.670 --> 02:25:40.540
He doesn't worry about cutting weight. He n he's fast for heavyweight,

2672
02:25:40.570 --> 02:25:44.920
much like Andy Ruiz. You know, I think there's a benefit in that. There's,

2673
02:25:44.980 --> 02:25:48.010
I mean, obviously people,

2674
02:25:48.070 --> 02:25:52.570
there's people that knew that Andy Ruiz was a really talented boxer coming in,

2675
02:25:52.571 --> 02:25:54.760
but there's other people that looked at his body and dismissed him.

2676
02:25:55.570 --> 02:25:57.790
But when you see the efficiency of those punches,

2677
02:25:57.791 --> 02:26:02.650
like and the fact that he's able to uncork so many punches in close.

2678
02:26:03.130 --> 02:26:06.520
Whereas Anthony, Joshua, these giant arms is long length,

2679
02:26:06.521 --> 02:26:09.960
gets a little bit smothered by that closer distance, closer distance and,

2680
02:26:10.060 --> 02:26:14.800
and he's just dropping bombs on him over the top and big power to him to man and

2681
02:26:14.930 --> 02:26:18.940
yeah. Perfect. Perfect mechanics. Like so fluid,

2682
02:26:19.260 --> 02:26:22.630
everything is just smooth and fluid. Who Fuck knows man.

2683
02:26:22.631 --> 02:26:24.930
Maybe DC's the best heavyweight of all time. Yeah,

2684
02:26:25.090 --> 02:26:28.270
well I mean quite possibly and there's something to be said for that physique as

2685
02:26:28.271 --> 02:26:30.340
well. There's an efficiency that comes with that. You know,

2686
02:26:30.341 --> 02:26:31.900
like you look at Anthony, Joshua and yeah,

2687
02:26:31.901 --> 02:26:35.980
I mean it looks like a physical specimen but the drawbacks would be obvious over

2688
02:26:35.981 --> 02:26:38.770
rounds. Whereas I, you know, Andy Ruiz DC, they can just,

2689
02:26:39.310 --> 02:26:42.310
they just keep flowing and you know those punches are more about the,

2690
02:26:42.340 --> 02:26:43.270
the momentum, you know,

2691
02:26:43.271 --> 02:26:46.630
you need a certain amount of muscle mass to get the movement started and then

2692
02:26:46.631 --> 02:26:48.880
you maintain it with good technique. You know,

2693
02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:52.930
like an additional amount of muscle is not going to make up for a heavier punch

2694
02:26:52.931 --> 02:26:53.740
really.

2695
02:26:53.740 --> 02:26:58.740
And he's talked openly about being far stronger in training as a heavyweight

2696
02:26:59.321 --> 02:27:01.860
than he was as a light heavyweight. He just felt better. Yeah,

2697
02:27:02.300 --> 02:27:05.920
it's weight class. I really do. I think his, you know, look,

2698
02:27:06.700 --> 02:27:11.140
he beat the greatest of all time. I mean the greatest on paper of all time.

2699
02:27:11.260 --> 02:27:12.700
At least. At least on paper.

2700
02:27:12.910 --> 02:27:17.320
I feel like performance wise there was moments where Cain Velasquez was in his

2701
02:27:17.321 --> 02:27:20.680
prime while I said like, that's the motherfucker that to me,

2702
02:27:20.890 --> 02:27:24.280
I mean I know it doesn't play out on paper because he was injured multiple

2703
02:27:24.281 --> 02:27:29.260
times, a gang surgeries. But when he was in his prime man, he was terrifying.

2704
02:27:29.710 --> 02:27:31.780
He just didn't stop. He didn't still,

2705
02:27:31.860 --> 02:27:36.280
he had welterweight Colby Covington style endurance as a fucking heavyweight

2706
02:27:36.281 --> 02:27:37.510
man. He didn't make any sense.

2707
02:27:37.570 --> 02:27:40.860
And he's slightly bigger than DC everywhere is until I reach in that I never

2708
02:27:41.410 --> 02:27:44.860
attended and you know, and he could fuck you up on the feet too.

2709
02:27:44.890 --> 02:27:45.910
I mean he could do everything.

2710
02:27:46.210 --> 02:27:51.130
He was so efficient and smooth and just relentless. Relentless. Yeah.

2711
02:27:51.340 --> 02:27:54.670
No one more relentless. And Cain Velasquez in his prime for him,

2712
02:27:54.671 --> 02:27:59.170
it was almost like his body couldn't handle the strength of his brain.

2713
02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:02.980
Like his mental toughness was so incredible,

2714
02:28:03.030 --> 02:28:05.440
but he just couldn't keep up with the body just starts blowing.

2715
02:28:06.750 --> 02:28:09.340
Cause his mind just press forward, go, go, go.

2716
02:28:09.790 --> 02:28:14.300
You know his and his cardio was just preposterous. Didn't make sense. Yeah.

2717
02:28:14.720 --> 02:28:16.810
DC looks in good shape for the open workouts yesterday.

2718
02:28:16.960 --> 02:28:19.210
I think he's expecting a harder fight this weekend.

2719
02:28:19.570 --> 02:28:23.360
You know where we really got robbed that we never saw Fado vs Cain in their

2720
02:28:23.361 --> 02:28:25.600
prime. Oh Man. We were robbed.

2721
02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:29.390
We were really robbed because who the fuck knows modify that went,

2722
02:28:29.391 --> 02:28:32.180
who the fuck knows? Maybe fader would've caught him in an arm bar.

2723
02:28:32.300 --> 02:28:35.480
Who the fuck knows? Maybe came with a beat that shit out of him?

2724
02:28:35.660 --> 02:28:38.900
Who the fuck knows? We will never know, man. We'll never know.

2725
02:28:38.901 --> 02:28:41.780
And now they're both fighting, but it's too late. You know?

2726
02:28:41.781 --> 02:28:44.990
It's like they'll never be authentic and you won't be authentic.

2727
02:28:44.991 --> 02:28:46.550
Now I never forget that.

2728
02:28:46.551 --> 02:28:51.551
Suplex Kevin Randleman [inaudible] and like his face just didn't even change.

2729
02:28:52.280 --> 02:28:55.160
Cain Velasquez is doing pro wrestling and he looked good.

2730
02:28:55.430 --> 02:28:56.750
He did a lot of wild shit.

2731
02:28:56.751 --> 02:29:00.320
Like it wasn't just like he would go out there and fuck around. He had,

2732
02:29:00.321 --> 02:29:02.300
they had some serious choreograph shit.

2733
02:29:02.780 --> 02:29:07.380
Like he did some crazy flips and like this came from Alaska.

2734
02:29:07.381 --> 02:29:08.940
This is a fucking heavyweight restaurant.

2735
02:29:09.650 --> 02:29:13.640
Tony Hinchcliffe right now was creaming in his pants like, yes,

2736
02:29:13.641 --> 02:29:15.110
this is better than fighting.

2737
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:18.950
So does that mean that most of these injuries came from training camp then?

2738
02:29:19.820 --> 02:29:24.240
Amen. Who knows? I think a lot of them must've come from fights too.

2739
02:29:24.540 --> 02:29:29.060
It's just the mind that he had that that fucking berzerker mindset,

2740
02:29:29.480 --> 02:29:34.160
that just juggernaut mindset. Just he would look, he was dead behind the eyes,

2741
02:29:34.161 --> 02:29:37.750
man. It just was coming forward like a fucking shark. He would see him like we,

2742
02:29:37.850 --> 02:29:40.910
he's overwhelming Ben Rothwell. You'd see that look on their face.

2743
02:29:41.150 --> 02:29:43.100
Like it's very similar to the look in the face.

2744
02:29:43.101 --> 02:29:46.820
You see a lot of Khabib's victims. They're like, mother Fucker,

2745
02:29:46.850 --> 02:29:49.160
this is never gonna end. What kind of animal is this?

2746
02:29:49.890 --> 02:29:54.170
Certain people where it's never gonna end ramen deck has was another guy.

2747
02:29:54.200 --> 02:29:56.450
I remember meeting him once and he's same,

2748
02:29:56.480 --> 02:29:59.210
just like his eyes were just like,

2749
02:29:59.510 --> 02:30:03.860
Jamie loves this movie that he did show up, said, watch this, here's the move.

2750
02:30:04.370 --> 02:30:06.830
He jumps up, flips and throws them on the back.

2751
02:30:07.010 --> 02:30:11.780
So how can a guy with a bad back through it seems like Jesus called what a

2752
02:30:11.790 --> 02:30:16.430
hurricane, hurricane neurono hurts Christ. That's the name of the move.

2753
02:30:16.730 --> 02:30:20.370
You jump up and like, ah, get your knees around their head and it's pretty wild.

2754
02:30:21.220 --> 02:30:24.340
We going see tiny focus and do that. So you know who's trying to,

2755
02:30:24.380 --> 02:30:28.430
Trump didn't like that. Darren Cruickshank go to Darren Crookshanks. Uh,

2756
02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:33.380
what is Dan Cruz rising now? He's and say yes. What is his, uh,

2757
02:30:33.530 --> 02:30:37.510
Instagram page? Oh, I don't remember. He's like the second coming up dumb fry.

2758
02:30:37.840 --> 02:30:38.673
He's talking about that,

2759
02:30:38.840 --> 02:30:43.670
but he's practicing this really weird take down defense the other day and I was

2760
02:30:43.671 --> 02:30:47.540
wondering if he's actually going to try to use it where someone's diving on to

2761
02:30:47.541 --> 02:30:51.590
him and he's drilling this where someone's going in on the leg and he's diving

2762
02:30:51.591 --> 02:30:53.960
onto their back and rolling over the top of their back.

2763
02:30:53.961 --> 02:30:56.990
He's going like back to back with them and then rolling over the front.

2764
02:30:57.350 --> 02:30:59.950
And I was like, wow man, Jeff, he pulls this off like you.

2765
02:31:00.110 --> 02:31:02.240
I think nobody would expect that.

2766
02:31:02.270 --> 02:31:04.700
I mean maybe they would now that he's put it on fucking Instagram,

2767
02:31:05.570 --> 02:31:08.410
but look at the bar that DJ did. Yes. Yes.

2768
02:31:08.420 --> 02:31:11.090
I'm surprised with not seeing a few more people attempting to get anybody else

2769
02:31:11.091 --> 02:31:14.900
can do it. The sushi roll. The sushi roll. Yeah. Watch.

2770
02:31:14.901 --> 02:31:19.350
I mean he's drilling it like unsuccessfully sometimes watch this. Okay.

2771
02:31:20.050 --> 02:31:24.620
<v 0>I mean he's going over the top. He's Christian is doing it with a woman too.</v>

2772
02:31:24.621 --> 02:31:26.270
Whenever this his wife or something like that.

2773
02:31:27.180 --> 02:31:27.920
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2774
02:31:27.920 --> 02:31:31.580
<v 0>Cause he's uh, he's being rough on her doing. Boom.</v>

2775
02:31:32.300 --> 02:31:35.180
I wouldn't want this big ass hole rolled over my back.

2776
02:31:35.490 --> 02:31:38.930
I don't hurt your lower back man. Oh there. See now he's got it smooth.

2777
02:31:39.040 --> 02:31:39.873
See this is interesting.

2778
02:31:39.950 --> 02:31:43.400
So it does kind of look like he's actually practicing this.

2779
02:31:43.940 --> 02:31:46.780
If he ever pulls it off in a fight, that'd be fucking crazy. Yeah.

2780
02:31:46.880 --> 02:31:50.990
But he's a really interesting fighter in that he's got a great blend of

2781
02:31:50.991 --> 02:31:54.560
traditional martial arts wrestling and like, uh,

2782
02:31:54.680 --> 02:31:58.940
like he's got boxing style, but he also has karate style. Is it cure kitchen?

2783
02:31:59.300 --> 02:32:01.290
Is that what you started with? Is it because he's got that,

2784
02:32:01.300 --> 02:32:04.280
those hips that kind of come up with the side? Trying to remember.

2785
02:32:04.400 --> 02:32:06.470
I'm trying to remember what his original style was,

2786
02:32:06.471 --> 02:32:08.390
but I know he has a wrestling base too,

2787
02:32:08.720 --> 02:32:12.460
but I think it was some branch of karate. I don't remember.

2788
02:32:12.480 --> 02:32:16.050
It was Kyokushin though. One of them, yeah.

2789
02:32:16.460 --> 02:32:19.440
Showed con Kyokushin is a lot of good stuff in that validation once parents

2790
02:32:19.441 --> 02:32:22.860
started with taekwondo, so, oh, talk window. Yeah.

2791
02:32:22.861 --> 02:32:26.700
So that kind of martial art, traditional martial arts style,

2792
02:32:26.910 --> 02:32:29.640
but with also like good boxing and shit and he's doing really well over and

2793
02:32:29.641 --> 02:32:33.300
rising. Yeah. I liked that promotion. I oded some of the gloves.

2794
02:32:33.470 --> 02:32:36.570
Did you watch it though? You have to watch it online. Yeah. Watch you online.

2795
02:32:36.940 --> 02:32:39.980
Because the good thing with rise in is that usually it starts and when the UFC

2796
02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.510
just finished, so like I'll have been up all night,

2797
02:32:42.511 --> 02:32:47.490
so the prelims will have started at 11 o'clock main cards at 3:00 AM then by six

2798
02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:49.170
I'm waiting on the press conference usually,

2799
02:32:49.171 --> 02:32:53.740
but then rising start and switch over to horizon. Double Espresso, stay awake,

2800
02:32:53.741 --> 02:32:56.550
keep going, write it out, keep going. Did you a,

2801
02:32:56.560 --> 02:32:59.880
I mean that's where Kron Gracie started to, right? Yeah. Yeah.

2802
02:32:59.910 --> 02:33:03.030
Very interesting seeing him in the UFC and that he is fascinating.

2803
02:33:03.150 --> 02:33:05.670
He is a fascinating individual. Just, you know, just to,

2804
02:33:05.790 --> 02:33:08.910
he's just got a unique energy of Batson, which you would expect from, you know,

2805
02:33:08.911 --> 02:33:12.690
from Hickson's son of course. Yeah. Dude, he's lineage.

2806
02:33:12.720 --> 02:33:15.570
They were on a different vibration. They are, I never forget choke.

2807
02:33:15.600 --> 02:33:17.280
I used to watch that all the time.

2808
02:33:17.340 --> 02:33:21.240
Then the Nale breathing that you used to do the, yeah. Dude,

2809
02:33:21.241 --> 02:33:24.780
that's like one of the most legendary martial arts documentaries of all time.

2810
02:33:25.120 --> 02:33:28.980
Yeah. Do you remember? Do you remember the one day of Zen Mario Sperry? Yes.

2811
02:33:28.981 --> 02:33:31.620
That was lucky too. That was like, it was, it was a day,

2812
02:33:31.621 --> 02:33:34.980
it was a day in the life of Mario [inaudible] decided to put one of each of his

2813
02:33:34.981 --> 02:33:37.200
training sessions from the whole weekend to the same day.

2814
02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:41.850
There were like five different training sessions and by the last two he was just

2815
02:33:42.360 --> 02:33:43.470
fucking exhausted.

2816
02:33:43.890 --> 02:33:46.650
Like it was quite clear that the tried to fit so much into that one day.

2817
02:33:47.080 --> 02:33:47.913
That was fascinating.

2818
02:33:48.300 --> 02:33:51.330
And he was using one of those vibrating platforms you remember that?

2819
02:33:51.740 --> 02:33:54.420
Cause was he really stuck out in my mind? It was, yeah, it was the one,

2820
02:33:54.421 --> 02:33:57.360
it was like a vibrating platform and he had a medicine ball on it and he was

2821
02:33:57.361 --> 02:34:00.780
like holding the medicine ball and this vibrating platform and then like

2822
02:34:00.781 --> 02:34:04.350
changing positions like scarf hold and like one of that would really help you.

2823
02:34:06.230 --> 02:34:07.820
Yeah. I don't know. And then, uh,

2824
02:34:08.410 --> 02:34:10.820
Hixon had the elastic around the head until you remember that?

2825
02:34:11.150 --> 02:34:16.070
Remember when Mario Sperry started coaching over Blackzilians? No. Yeah.

2826
02:34:16.071 --> 02:34:18.040
Mario Sperry like became

2827
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:21.100
<v 1>like one of the head coaches at Blackzilians for a short period of time and put</v>

2828
02:34:21.101 --> 02:34:25.230
on these crazy motivational speeches where everybody got fired up. Really?

2829
02:34:25.231 --> 02:34:28.060
It's like God damn. Yeah. And it didn't work out.

2830
02:34:28.090 --> 02:34:29.320
I don't know why it didn't work out,

2831
02:34:29.321 --> 02:34:31.780
but it was a really exciting development because, uh,

2832
02:34:31.810 --> 02:34:34.660
I know Rashad Evans was really excited about having them over there and they

2833
02:34:34.661 --> 02:34:37.390
were all, I mean, I don't know what happened behind the scenes,

2834
02:34:37.600 --> 02:34:41.560
but I remember when Mario Sperry was like coaching the classes and like getting

2835
02:34:41.561 --> 02:34:46.390
everybody fired up. I'm like, Damn. I mean, he's old school,

2836
02:34:46.391 --> 02:34:49.270
man. That's crazy. Yup. Constant Gracie legend.

2837
02:34:49.570 --> 02:34:53.110
When I was a white belt,

2838
02:34:53.590 --> 02:34:58.590
I was training at Carlson Gracie's in on Hawthorne and Mario Sperry.

2839
02:34:59.710 --> 02:35:04.670
When he would teach you class, he would teach you a class and you,

2840
02:35:04.690 --> 02:35:09.640
I knew who he was. I had watched him fight on television. I knew who he was.

2841
02:35:09.700 --> 02:35:12.130
I mean, I was like, this is Mario fucking Sperry.

2842
02:35:12.131 --> 02:35:16.270
And Marillo Bustamante would be there and, um, call us by Hato.

2843
02:35:16.510 --> 02:35:19.330
Remember all these guys? Yeah. Yeah. Sergio Cohen was there.

2844
02:35:19.331 --> 02:35:24.331
All these beasts from the Carlson Gracie hit squad and I'm the guy who teach you

2845
02:35:25.360 --> 02:35:29.590
and then after we teach you we said thank you and he's like, no my friend.

2846
02:35:29.591 --> 02:35:31.810
Thank you for the pleasure of teaching you. Thank you.

2847
02:35:31.811 --> 02:35:33.640
And he really meant and like shake everybody's hand.

2848
02:35:33.850 --> 02:35:37.690
The most gracious down to Earth Guy ever. But it was hilarious.

2849
02:35:37.691 --> 02:35:40.240
He was talking about how we practice his triangle and his girlfriend.

2850
02:35:40.750 --> 02:35:44.290
He's like a, he goes just repetition, repetition, boom, boom, boom.

2851
02:35:44.440 --> 02:35:46.840
And my girlfriend like, no I don't want you to do it. It's like shut up,

2852
02:35:47.440 --> 02:35:49.270
keep going, keep going, keep going.

2853
02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:52.750
It's like talking about like practicing on friends,

2854
02:35:52.751 --> 02:35:55.990
like get friends to like let you triangle them over and over again. Yeah.

2855
02:35:55.991 --> 02:35:58.450
This is when he had white hair at the time.

2856
02:35:59.320 --> 02:36:03.370
So this is UFC two 20 he's training with Vulcan owes to mirror.

2857
02:36:03.580 --> 02:36:07.060
I wonder where he's at now cause he was really good at it man.

2858
02:36:07.061 --> 02:36:08.380
He was really good at like,

2859
02:36:08.590 --> 02:36:13.000
like hyping people up and you know obviously his Jujitsu knowledge is top of the

2860
02:36:13.001 --> 02:36:17.660
food chain. Yeah. He was in a bunch of the colon in the early USC scene,

2861
02:36:17.790 --> 02:36:21.910
like vetoes Culinar and that kind of thing. I don't remember. I don't remember.

2862
02:36:21.911 --> 02:36:24.000
But he's a true legend. You know, he's,

2863
02:36:24.010 --> 02:36:26.460
there's a few of those guys and I will sometimes, yeah,

2864
02:36:27.370 --> 02:36:31.230
well it's one of those guys from the early days of uh, martial arts that was a,

2865
02:36:31.231 --> 02:36:35.300
a real jujitsu master, you know what I mean? He was a real master. Yeah.

2866
02:36:35.910 --> 02:36:37.210
Lift in the gym as well. But then,

2867
02:36:37.211 --> 02:36:41.280
I mean it was like everything about that life revolved around the gym. Yup.

2868
02:36:41.460 --> 02:36:46.240
Like, yeah. Trying to try to find that kind of, that kind of environment. Now,

2869
02:36:46.270 --> 02:36:48.490
I mean, Donna has is, we were talking about Henzel Gracie is,

2870
02:36:48.491 --> 02:36:50.680
I might imagine not called very similar vibe, you know,

2871
02:36:50.681 --> 02:36:55.120
in a basement in New York and ones showing up every day and grind and doing the

2872
02:36:55.121 --> 02:36:58.420
same thing. But it's such a rare environment to find yourself in.

2873
02:36:58.870 --> 02:37:03.460
Do you remember when Mario Sperry got tapped out by that bad ass Russian dude?

2874
02:37:05.370 --> 02:37:06.220
It was the bad ass Russian.

2875
02:37:06.280 --> 02:37:11.260
The Russian dude was the same guy that frank shamrock code with a slam trying to

2876
02:37:11.261 --> 02:37:15.980
remember amongst Sulu F who? Mario Sperry

2877
02:37:16.170 --> 02:37:19.940
<v 0>looked like. He opened up a couple of gyms called hard knocks. Three 65. Okay.</v>

2878
02:37:19.941 --> 02:37:24.200
That's Henry who, okay. Alright. So yeah,

2879
02:37:24.230 --> 02:37:26.330
that's where he was originally to um,

2880
02:37:27.320 --> 02:37:30.890
Google frank shamrocks mixed martial arts record.

2881
02:37:31.970 --> 02:37:34.820
It's frank shamrock. Slam this dude and Kao to him.

2882
02:37:34.821 --> 02:37:39.821
And this guy was famous for having beaten Mario Sperry and um,

2883
02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:45.740
the old school, what was it called? Battle battle Cade.

2884
02:37:47.080 --> 02:37:49.610
I don't remember. I remember extreme fights. Extreme fighting.

2885
02:37:49.611 --> 02:37:51.320
That's what it was. Extreme fighting battle Cade.

2886
02:37:51.650 --> 02:37:53.600
Cause that was where Ron Peretti's organization,

2887
02:37:53.630 --> 02:37:57.620
that was where Conan fought Maurice Smith. So here it is. Go.

2888
02:37:57.800 --> 02:38:01.280
Where are we at here? Go back a little low. Hold on. Sub Sub. Sub Sub.

2889
02:38:01.281 --> 02:38:05.480
Sub Igor is a Novia. That's illegal. Remember Igor Novias?

2890
02:38:05.670 --> 02:38:07.700
He was a beast. Yes. Dangerous Guy.

2891
02:38:07.701 --> 02:38:11.420
Well Igor had cut Mario Sperry open.

2892
02:38:12.020 --> 02:38:14.030
He wanted a big ass gash as for it.

2893
02:38:14.031 --> 02:38:18.880
And Mario wound up tapping and Igor is a Novia was a, I think it was a Samo guy.

2894
02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.180
Yeah, I remember that guy. Tough motherfucker.

2895
02:38:21.680 --> 02:38:24.290
There was some scary dudes that pass through the USA a while back.

2896
02:38:24.291 --> 02:38:26.540
I remember there were two, there was from the red devils.

2897
02:38:26.541 --> 02:38:30.770
There was Undray seminar and a Massulo F whoa. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

2898
02:38:30.930 --> 02:38:31.650
Wait a when,

2899
02:38:31.650 --> 02:38:35.600
when he was Jeffrey up stores and Novia was Jeffrey Epstein Security Guard.

2900
02:38:36.050 --> 02:38:40.400
No fucking way. That's right. Oh my God.

2901
02:38:40.401 --> 02:38:44.120
Look at his face. That's him. That's crazy dude.

2902
02:38:45.110 --> 02:38:46.910
That is crazy.

2903
02:38:48.680 --> 02:38:53.600
Former MMA guy gives alarmingly kg interview about working for Jeffrey Epstein.

2904
02:38:54.050 --> 02:38:54.883
Click on that.

2905
02:38:55.400 --> 02:39:00.050
We've got former shit to look for all the fall alarmingly cagey interview.

2906
02:39:01.330 --> 02:39:04.790
Who's, who is this saying? This MMA dash guy.

2907
02:39:05.150 --> 02:39:09.890
That's the oats. Deadspin oh, so, um, scroll down a little bit.

2908
02:39:09.940 --> 02:39:11.360
Let me see what the fuck you has to sit here.

2909
02:39:11.550 --> 02:39:14.690
So that's crazy that we're talking about this guy. Just randomly.

2910
02:39:16.100 --> 02:39:20.240
Wow. He said one thing you told me for instance, okay.

2911
02:39:20.270 --> 02:39:23.030
One thing you told me is he got a heads up when the authorities were going to

2912
02:39:23.031 --> 02:39:26.750
come to his house the night before. He said, and then he says, listen,

2913
02:39:26.900 --> 02:39:29.930
what you say is between you and me. Okay, let's, let's fuck.

2914
02:39:30.410 --> 02:39:34.130
Let's leave this alone. But anyway,

2915
02:39:34.131 --> 02:39:37.460
feel free to Google Ladies and gentlemen. That's crazy.

2916
02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:40.220
They were just bringing him up and it turns out he was Jeffrey Epstein Security

2917
02:39:40.220 --> 02:39:43.730
Guard. That's crazy. He was a real veteran.

2918
02:39:44.330 --> 02:39:48.530
I mean that guy was a, on the early, early days of the John Preddy promotion.

2919
02:39:48.830 --> 02:39:52.610
He a beast, man. I'm been getting those video cassettes from, yes,

2920
02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:57.470
virgin megastore in town. UFC Two and three Oh man,

2921
02:39:57.471 --> 02:40:01.760
I remember when you first started fighting in the UFC. I remember those days.

2922
02:40:01.840 --> 02:40:05.240
Yeah, it's crazy. It seems like it was a long time ago, but not really.

2923
02:40:05.510 --> 02:40:09.440
Like it still seems like it makes sense. 89 I was in double figures.

2924
02:40:10.220 --> 02:40:11.053
Wow.

2925
02:40:12.170 --> 02:40:16.260
80 99 and that's the only time I've ever been cut. Believe it or not.

2926
02:40:16.750 --> 02:40:19.500
I've never, I've only ever had five stitches. You have someone looks at you,

2927
02:40:19.501 --> 02:40:20.430
you're a beautiful man.

2928
02:40:20.431 --> 02:40:23.370
They would never imagine you get hit in the face for living single as well.

2929
02:40:23.370 --> 02:40:25.250
Now we'll look at that. I know.

2930
02:40:25.350 --> 02:40:28.380
I'm ready to make it to 10 I might might've thought face only ever had five

2931
02:40:28.381 --> 02:40:31.460
stitches. That's incredible. Yeah. Right. And that was, that was the first my,

2932
02:40:31.530 --> 02:40:35.280
my UFC debut could hero Gona hit me with an open palm and it was the seam on the

2933
02:40:35.281 --> 02:40:39.480
inside of the [inaudible]. Yeah. Yeah. Going back to the whole idea of Whoa,

2934
02:40:39.630 --> 02:40:42.390
people fight bare knuckle. I've sent some ended my thoughts on it.

2935
02:40:42.690 --> 02:40:45.660
Just too many cuts. I walked because of really,

2936
02:40:45.661 --> 02:40:49.650
because of Chris Levens last cut from Dakota Cochran. He had a giant gap.

2937
02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:54.150
Have you seen it? I don't think I have none. It's a rough one. Yeah.

2938
02:40:54.270 --> 02:40:59.070
I never really watched the band too much. Chris Lieberman's uh, Instagram page.

2939
02:40:59.400 --> 02:41:01.620
I'm looking forward to it developing because I think it will,

2940
02:41:01.680 --> 02:41:02.700
I've no problem with it.

2941
02:41:02.730 --> 02:41:04.530
I think people should be allowed to do whatever they want,

2942
02:41:04.531 --> 02:41:08.270
fight under whatever rules they want, but at the moment it just,

2943
02:41:08.400 --> 02:41:12.150
it just looks like that boxing with no gloves on as opposed to bare knuckle

2944
02:41:12.151 --> 02:41:15.630
boxing, which I think looks very different. Is there any video at all?

2945
02:41:15.631 --> 02:41:18.870
People bare knuckle boxing from the olden days. Look at that picture,

2946
02:41:19.430 --> 02:41:23.670
the picture. Dude, that's horrific. I remember when he fought Michael Bisping.

2947
02:41:23.720 --> 02:41:25.640
Do you remember? I remember his face after that fight. He,

2948
02:41:25.810 --> 02:41:29.660
you sat next to me at the press conference. Like a busted him. Yeah. Yeah.

2949
02:41:29.960 --> 02:41:34.730
He's had some tough to tell for his own good Anderson Silva's UFC debut. Ding,

2950
02:41:36.150 --> 02:41:40.590
Ding Ding thing. Yeah. Yeah. I remember when he knocked out [inaudible].

2951
02:41:41.520 --> 02:41:45.750
Oh yeah, yeah. He lowered Vandelay into a fucking war and Terry Martin as well.

2952
02:41:46.050 --> 02:41:48.420
That was a back and forth one. He could kill you man.

2953
02:41:48.450 --> 02:41:52.260
And if you want to stand in front of Chris and you wanted to swing wild punches,

2954
02:41:52.261 --> 02:41:55.680
he shut your fucking lights out all day. And when he did that, the Vander line,

2955
02:41:55.681 --> 02:41:59.340
I was like, well yeah,

2956
02:41:59.730 --> 02:42:01.260
but it's like two different,

2957
02:42:01.261 --> 02:42:04.290
two entire different styles of fighting until like the Chris Liebing style of

2958
02:42:04.291 --> 02:42:06.690
fighting, which we all love in the Anderson Silver fights and style,

2959
02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:12.060
which is like witchcraft. I remember I was caged child bender,

2960
02:42:12.330 --> 02:42:15.930
I was caged sideway notes that Tony Frickin was that, oh yeah, you were there.

2961
02:42:15.931 --> 02:42:17.790
I was there. I went, he fought Lee Murray. I mean,

2962
02:42:17.791 --> 02:42:22.050
people don't talk about that fun, but like he just dismantled Lee Marie. Yeah,

2963
02:42:22.080 --> 02:42:25.500
he did. Murray was a talent that we lost early. I mean, you know,

2964
02:42:25.890 --> 02:42:29.370
made different decisions that led him down a different few unfortunate choices.

2965
02:42:30.420 --> 02:42:35.280
But, but yeah, he's dismantled them in that fight. Yeah. What do you got here,

2966
02:42:35.730 --> 02:42:40.110
Sam? Right. Uh, that's me. That's me. Yeah.

2967
02:42:40.111 --> 02:42:41.310
That was the card that he was on.

2968
02:42:41.370 --> 02:42:44.310
But if you can find a photo of him in the press conference afterwards,

2969
02:42:44.490 --> 02:42:49.470
he allowed the elephant man. Oh, it was bad pictures. Oh, this is a, yeah,

2970
02:42:49.471 --> 02:42:53.010
this was, yeah, UFC debut, right? Yeah. Yeah. There it is.

2971
02:42:53.070 --> 02:42:56.310
Like Bisping just 18 off on them. Yeah. Yeah.

2972
02:42:56.370 --> 02:42:59.130
That was still 15 minute fights as well. And main events.

2973
02:42:59.550 --> 02:43:03.320
So that was only a 15 minute fight. Yeah. Isn't that interesting? Like the fire?

2974
02:43:03.360 --> 02:43:06.870
How, what do you think about the five round main event? You liked that? Yeah.

2975
02:43:06.871 --> 02:43:09.930
I don't mind it. Even if it was on a championship fight. Yeah. I don't mind it.

2976
02:43:09.931 --> 02:43:12.290
I just ate g changes. Boy changes

2977
02:43:12.290 --> 02:43:14.050
<v 2>the, the way that fighters approach to the sport.</v>

2978
02:43:14.051 --> 02:43:16.350
I think it changes their output. Yeah.

2979
02:43:16.600 --> 02:43:19.420
Like there are some fighters that will go, okay, you want 25 minutes,

2980
02:43:19.520 --> 02:43:23.890
I'll just spread out my same workload over 25 instead of 15. Um,

2981
02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:26.560
the thing I like about it is that can, it can be far more tactical.

2982
02:43:26.620 --> 02:43:29.830
And the one thing that I enjoy about boxing is the fact that you can,

2983
02:43:30.040 --> 02:43:33.340
you can implement a narrative in the first round that can play out in the later

2984
02:43:33.341 --> 02:43:34.240
rounds and you can,

2985
02:43:34.390 --> 02:43:38.170
you can allow it to breathe a bit because you've got 12 segments that are being

2986
02:43:38.171 --> 02:43:41.770
scored separately. You can gamble a few and you can play that game.

2987
02:43:41.771 --> 02:43:45.410
Whereas in MMA, you, you lose one round, you've got to win too. You know, we're,

2988
02:43:45.411 --> 02:43:47.230
so the five rounds you can lose one,

2989
02:43:47.410 --> 02:43:49.420
you can even lose two if you're feeling very brave.

2990
02:43:49.420 --> 02:43:53.350
And then when the last three, so I don't mind it too much.

2991
02:43:53.410 --> 02:43:57.580
I don't mind it too much. Yeah, I think it definitely changes the way you fight,

2992
02:43:57.670 --> 02:44:01.840
right? I mean if all boxing matches were like glory fights,

2993
02:44:01.841 --> 02:44:02.750
like glory fights,

2994
02:44:02.950 --> 02:44:07.420
three rounds for the non title fights and then one on the three minute rounds,

2995
02:44:07.450 --> 02:44:08.770
those guys go to war. Yeah.

2996
02:44:08.830 --> 02:44:11.740
I mean it's one of the reasons why it's so exciting is because there's such a

2997
02:44:11.741 --> 02:44:15.400
high output, high volume because they know there's only three rounds. Yeah.

2998
02:44:15.401 --> 02:44:19.600
It's interesting because tactics do get adjusted. You just have to stop faster.

2999
02:44:19.660 --> 02:44:20.410
You have to, you know,

3000
02:44:20.410 --> 02:44:23.080
you have to do your first two rounds in the dressing room before you walk out.

3001
02:44:23.230 --> 02:44:27.030
What do you think about pedis versus dia as this weekend done done?

3002
02:44:27.700 --> 02:44:31.720
I honestly, I think I took some stick for this on the youtube,

3003
02:44:31.721 --> 02:44:36.340
but took stick stick stick is, that's a British ism is it? Is that shit?

3004
02:44:36.400 --> 02:44:39.600
I took a shit stick. Sounds like tick. That doesn't,

3005
02:44:39.610 --> 02:44:41.890
no one says that it took some Dick. Yeah, I wouldn't say that again.

3006
02:44:42.520 --> 02:44:43.110
I'll adjust.

3007
02:44:43.110 --> 02:44:44.980
You know what he was saying would come like I never heard that before.

3008
02:44:44.981 --> 02:44:49.600
I'm trying not to nitpick. I'm learning. I'm still loading. So,

3009
02:44:50.080 --> 02:44:53.710
uh, what did you think? I think Pettis has got the skills to beat is everywhere.

3010
02:44:53.770 --> 02:44:56.770
Really? Yes I do. I think he's, I think he's a,

3011
02:44:56.890 --> 02:44:58.600
he's a better striker all around.

3012
02:44:59.020 --> 02:45:03.100
I think he's got a higher fight IQ at least what he shows as you've make better

3013
02:45:03.101 --> 02:45:04.480
decisions than Diaz does.

3014
02:45:04.840 --> 02:45:08.410
I think Diaz realized far too much on his toughness and his and his ego and his

3015
02:45:08.411 --> 02:45:11.110
ability to walk through stuff and it works.

3016
02:45:11.111 --> 02:45:13.070
Sometimes it works against Michael Johnson. You know,

3017
02:45:13.180 --> 02:45:16.480
you got his front leg battered in that fight and just kept marching him down and

3018
02:45:16.481 --> 02:45:19.870
eventually forced him into a boxing match and that could happen against Petty's.

3019
02:45:19.870 --> 02:45:20.950
There's no doubt about it.

3020
02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:24.850
My feeling is that Petty's has got the skills to start setting Diaz up because

3021
02:45:24.851 --> 02:45:27.400
Diaz is very predictable. You know, you can kind of,

3022
02:45:27.640 --> 02:45:30.130
you can make him walk the directions that you want.

3023
02:45:30.131 --> 02:45:33.490
You can make him lean in the ways that you want to lean. If you've got the,

3024
02:45:33.491 --> 02:45:36.400
the ability to, you know, to land the strikes that match that matter,

3025
02:45:36.401 --> 02:45:38.710
then then you can put them out. And you know,

3026
02:45:38.711 --> 02:45:41.230
same thing with Costa having the body kick to the left hook.

3027
02:45:41.231 --> 02:45:45.430
I feel like Pettis has got, um, what he used it against Tony Ferguson,

3028
02:45:45.580 --> 02:45:48.760
he used it against Michael [inaudible] is a a right body kick to a straight

3029
02:45:48.761 --> 02:45:51.310
right. And because Diaz is Southport in the lean,

3030
02:45:51.311 --> 02:45:55.270
so heavy on that lead leg block in the body kick and in the straight right might

3031
02:45:55.271 --> 02:45:57.940
be something that Pettus is going to be looking for. But I just,

3032
02:45:57.970 --> 02:46:01.870
I feel like Diaz is there to be hit and I think he uses that to his advantage

3033
02:46:01.871 --> 02:46:05.590
because he kind of homer Simpson's people like you wear yourself out, hit him,

3034
02:46:05.591 --> 02:46:08.350
me and then I'll start to push my, my game on you.

3035
02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:10.280
But when you about him against

3036
02:46:10.280 --> 02:46:13.670
<v 1>talented strikers, like you brought up Michael Johnson chopped at his leg,</v>

3037
02:46:13.671 --> 02:46:17.180
but he wound up beating them up. But the Conor McGregor fight it.

3038
02:46:17.780 --> 02:46:22.780
Todd Connor is a very skillful striker and in both fights he wasn't really able

3039
02:46:22.821 --> 02:46:23.960
to do much with Nate.

3040
02:46:23.961 --> 02:46:27.410
He clipped him a couple times in the second fight and dropped him.

3041
02:46:28.130 --> 02:46:29.960
And you know,

3042
02:46:29.961 --> 02:46:34.700
there's speculation like did he drop because he got knocked down or did he drop

3043
02:46:34.880 --> 02:46:39.740
cause he felt like it was a good enough punch to lay down and have Connor come

3044
02:46:39.741 --> 02:46:43.460
and meet him and wrap him up and catch him in something which easily could,

3045
02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.220
you know, you don't know. I mean he,

3046
02:46:46.221 --> 02:46:50.060
part of his strategy might've been tried to lower Connor into following him to

3047
02:46:50.061 --> 02:46:53.060
the ground for sure. The doom tried to do that against Mark Hunt Company.

3048
02:46:53.200 --> 02:46:55.550
The Times, you know, it takes an over hand falls to the floor.

3049
02:46:55.580 --> 02:46:57.020
We did it to fe door. Yeah.

3050
02:46:57.140 --> 02:47:00.290
I mean I do feel like Kinda caught him at least a couple of times. Clean and,

3051
02:47:00.540 --> 02:47:02.330
and he definitely did. He definitely did.

3052
02:47:02.630 --> 02:47:06.800
But then they came back and it was a really close fight at the end.

3053
02:47:07.160 --> 02:47:09.230
Really close fight. An excellent fight.

3054
02:47:09.320 --> 02:47:14.320
But Conor McGregor is a fucking skillful Stryker and I don't know who would win

3055
02:47:14.901 --> 02:47:16.640
Conor McGregor versus Pettis.

3056
02:47:16.790 --> 02:47:21.590
But Conor McGregor has proven when the Dustin poor Yay Phi in the Josie Aldo Fi,

3057
02:47:22.140 --> 02:47:26.150
he's proven in the Eddie Alvarez fight, he fucking shuts people's lights out.

3058
02:47:26.600 --> 02:47:29.870
Was not able to do that to Nate Diaz. So, and I think,

3059
02:47:30.200 --> 02:47:35.200
I mean in my perspective you might be underestimating Nate Diaz is a lot slicker

3060
02:47:35.571 --> 02:47:38.480
than he appears and he's harder to hit.

3061
02:47:38.680 --> 02:47:42.290
He knows how to use his jab and his long left hand.

3062
02:47:42.620 --> 02:47:44.360
He's not like the best kicker in the world,

3063
02:47:44.361 --> 02:47:48.570
but he's never really had that as a part of his arsenal. But his ground games,

3064
02:47:48.590 --> 02:47:53.480
super, super high level, he's tough as shit. His endurance is ridiculous.

3065
02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:55.940
I don't like about it. Sold them the rest of mate, any of that.

3066
02:47:55.941 --> 02:47:59.540
One thing I will say though is that the difference in the way that the fights is

3067
02:47:59.541 --> 02:48:00.920
absorbed punches is different.

3068
02:48:00.921 --> 02:48:03.160
So all the people that you mentioned that knocked that,

3069
02:48:03.230 --> 02:48:06.530
that got knocked out by McGregor, they were all leaning heavy on their lead leg.

3070
02:48:06.800 --> 02:48:10.850
So to me that is like hitting a punch bag that's hanging from the ceiling hits

3071
02:48:10.851 --> 02:48:12.580
in Nate Diaz. He's like hitting a bag,

3072
02:48:12.740 --> 02:48:16.940
standing on the floor because he's wait is so spread over his base that when you

3073
02:48:16.941 --> 02:48:19.910
hit him, you know that let those inflatable standup punch backs,

3074
02:48:20.090 --> 02:48:23.400
if you blast that thing into the topic just rocks away and comes back. You know,

3075
02:48:23.550 --> 02:48:25.100
it's like, it's like a reed in the wind.

3076
02:48:25.900 --> 02:48:29.300
That's how he was able to absorb those shots from McGregor because as they were

3077
02:48:29.301 --> 02:48:29.811
coming at him,

3078
02:48:29.811 --> 02:48:33.380
he was already moving away and he was able to ride the power and then McGregor

3079
02:48:33.381 --> 02:48:34.990
was over extending. You know?

3080
02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.280
And I mean there's no doubt he's a durable individual.

3081
02:48:37.281 --> 02:48:40.640
I'm just saying that your liens on that sometimes too much. Yeah. It's also,

3082
02:48:41.360 --> 02:48:46.360
we've seen pedis now at 45 55 and now 70 it's really wild to see.

3083
02:48:50.090 --> 02:48:54.740
And you go by that wonder Boy Thompson knockout. It's like, man,

3084
02:48:55.130 --> 02:48:58.490
maybe this is weight class. Like if he can do that to Wonderboy,

3085
02:48:58.730 --> 02:49:00.980
maybe this is his weight class. Maybe. I mean,

3086
02:49:00.981 --> 02:49:05.330
maybe this guy has been just tortured himself, dehydrating himself,

3087
02:49:05.360 --> 02:49:08.790
and not fighting like he's capable of, cause his body's always weakened.

3088
02:49:09.060 --> 02:49:12.930
Like his number one complaint was when he went down to 45 he was a dead man.

3089
02:49:13.330 --> 02:49:16.500
Yeah. You could tell he looked terrible. His body just couldn't do it.

3090
02:49:16.740 --> 02:49:19.650
So he goes back up to 55 and like discouraged.

3091
02:49:19.651 --> 02:49:24.651
And then on this wild whim takes his fight at 70 against Wonderboy and fucking

3092
02:49:25.411 --> 02:49:29.880
superman punches him in the mug and cows him like seeing Wonderboy alcohol for

3093
02:49:29.881 --> 02:49:33.930
the first time of the UFC fight and seeing it happen because of Pedis. I mean,

3094
02:49:33.931 --> 02:49:37.260
he's gay. He gets tagged again while he's out. He's totally stiff. You're like,

3095
02:49:37.261 --> 02:49:40.590
wow. Yeah, it's definitely got power. There's no doubt about tech.

3096
02:49:40.830 --> 02:49:44.200
Tyron Woodley couldn't stop him. Nobody else has stopped Wonderboy, have they?

3097
02:49:44.550 --> 02:49:47.440
<v 2>Uh, no, no. I dropped a few times, but not, not stopped.</v>

3098
02:49:47.680 --> 02:49:50.910
Smiles of the Dow wasn't able to stop him. Yeah. And then, you know,

3099
02:49:50.911 --> 02:49:52.050
maybe you underestimated.

3100
02:49:52.051 --> 02:49:54.540
Maybe he wasn't expecting pat just had the power to knock him out. I,

3101
02:49:54.550 --> 02:49:56.130
I'm starting to feel that's a thing.

3102
02:49:56.131 --> 02:50:00.360
I'm starting to feel like if you're expecting of the power, you're more,

3103
02:50:00.450 --> 02:50:04.590
you're more brace to, you know what I mean? Sure. What you shock absorbers on,

3104
02:50:04.700 --> 02:50:07.110
you're ready to ready to absorb that. So good argument.

3105
02:50:07.170 --> 02:50:08.430
So then we're going to like the other thing,

3106
02:50:08.490 --> 02:50:10.170
the other thing to keep in mind is that, you know,

3107
02:50:10.670 --> 02:50:14.340
patties at one 70 is the same human that he was at one 45,

3108
02:50:14.341 --> 02:50:17.250
but without all the suffering, you know, so it's, it's,

3109
02:50:17.540 --> 02:50:20.500
it's finding that right amount of suffering and I think a little bit of stuff

3110
02:50:20.580 --> 02:50:23.100
for him, for a weight cut is, is, is good. I liked it.

3111
02:50:23.340 --> 02:50:26.490
I always thought about it. I always likened it to the march two battle.

3112
02:50:26.880 --> 02:50:31.260
You know, like if I'm, if I'm, uh, you know, the Peloponnesian wars,

3113
02:50:31.450 --> 02:50:32.760
I'm picking my sword and shield up.

3114
02:50:32.761 --> 02:50:35.490
I'm not stepping out of my house onto the battlefield.

3115
02:50:35.880 --> 02:50:40.560
I'm stepping out and walking miles and miles. So that process, that was the,

3116
02:50:40.590 --> 02:50:43.650
that was the weight cut for me. You know, the, the walk into the battlefield.

3117
02:50:43.920 --> 02:50:48.780
And I enjoyed that. And I think that we saw McGregor at one 70 didn't have that.

3118
02:50:48.810 --> 02:50:52.860
You see McGregor on the scales at one 55 or one 45 and he's feral.

3119
02:50:53.160 --> 02:50:56.880
Like he's wild. You saw him on the scales at one 70 and he's smiling,

3120
02:50:56.881 --> 02:50:59.920
he's rubbing his belly. He's not marched to the battlefield, you know?

3121
02:51:00.330 --> 02:51:03.300
And I think there's something in that psychology as well. I like it.

3122
02:51:03.450 --> 02:51:05.400
Even if it's a small weight and I've done,

3123
02:51:05.430 --> 02:51:10.430
I've done everything from three pounds to 16 pounds and I know how I felt across

3124
02:51:10.621 --> 02:51:13.320
the board. How did you feel best about eight.

3125
02:51:13.950 --> 02:51:17.700
Eight was good for me because I felt put a little bit back on you feel strong

3126
02:51:17.701 --> 02:51:20.430
and big for the way class, but you're not depleted.

3127
02:51:21.090 --> 02:51:26.090
Like I w I mean usually I would be back up to like one 84 one 86 when I was fine

3128
02:51:27.691 --> 02:51:30.360
at one 17 that was my, that was my good way. Around.

3129
02:51:30.361 --> 02:51:33.570
One 84 was comfortable because then I didn't feel too bloated and too slow.

3130
02:51:33.990 --> 02:51:37.560
I've been closer to one 90 before and it just didn't suit the way that I fought.

3131
02:51:37.770 --> 02:51:40.950
So there's a point of diminishing returns for sure. Yeah.

3132
02:51:41.040 --> 02:51:44.250
And did you use ivs during those days?

3133
02:51:44.280 --> 02:51:47.280
One time I used an only one time and never, never really.

3134
02:51:48.620 --> 02:51:50.200
It was for me, it was always a,

3135
02:51:50.280 --> 02:51:54.180
it was quite an internal process because I always cut weight on my own and I

3136
02:51:54.181 --> 02:51:56.380
always found it strange that nobody else. Yeah, I always did.

3137
02:51:56.450 --> 02:52:00.930
You don't have anybody rubbing your shoulders with a room card? Have you seen,

3138
02:52:00.931 --> 02:52:04.830
yeah, I seen that. Oh Man, I, man, it was always a personal thing for me.

3139
02:52:05.020 --> 02:52:06.160
So like, you know,

3140
02:52:06.190 --> 02:52:10.340
running through the streets of Tokyo with trash bags on or sitting in the corner

3141
02:52:10.380 --> 02:52:11.560
of the sauna in my own head,

3142
02:52:11.800 --> 02:52:15.670
who's the most ridiculous way cutter you ever saw in terms of volume?

3143
02:52:16.330 --> 02:52:19.690
Oh Man. Anthony Johnson for sure. Oh yeah, that's right.

3144
02:52:20.300 --> 02:52:25.060
[inaudible] so when I fought him in, in Seattle, he could wait that at Tuesday,

3145
02:52:25.060 --> 02:52:27.580
Wednesday, Thursday night to weigh in on the Friday. And,

3146
02:52:28.030 --> 02:52:31.060
and I'm don't know for sure this, but I, from what I understand,

3147
02:52:31.061 --> 02:52:35.050
he was two 14 on the night when he rehydrated he looked like a different human

3148
02:52:35.051 --> 02:52:36.730
being. Oh my God.

3149
02:52:36.840 --> 02:52:41.080
And I remember that from one 70 to two 14 it was ridiculous. He was massive.

3150
02:52:41.450 --> 02:52:44.500
And like my whole game plan, cause it this for me, that, and this was,

3151
02:52:44.800 --> 02:52:47.260
this was a good lesson for me cause he punked me in this one.

3152
02:52:47.590 --> 02:52:50.400
I put all my eggs in one basket. That's the phrase that everyone on the staff.

3153
02:52:51.100 --> 02:52:54.550
So I thought if I can trash talk him into, make him wait,

3154
02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.190
I'll make sure that I can get him tired in the fight.

3155
02:52:57.940 --> 02:52:59.350
And then they'll start to wear on him in the,

3156
02:52:59.351 --> 02:53:03.130
in the later rounds with my footwork and my movement and I just come off and

3157
02:53:03.131 --> 02:53:04.720
knock out Las to call us conduct.

3158
02:53:04.780 --> 02:53:08.050
And then I get caught up and I've got Anthony Johnson who's never not knocked

3159
02:53:08.051 --> 02:53:11.170
anybody out at welterweight. So immediately I'm thinking to myself,

3160
02:53:11.171 --> 02:53:13.570
well first of all, somebody at the USC hates me.

3161
02:53:15.430 --> 02:53:19.420
And second of all, I've got to deal with this monster in some way. So I thought,

3162
02:53:19.540 --> 02:53:22.360
I thought it's going to be a real fight. He's going to throw power at me.

3163
02:53:22.361 --> 02:53:24.910
So if I can at least get him to throw in fatigue himself,

3164
02:53:25.180 --> 02:53:29.200
then my window of opportunity will come later in the fight. And the,

3165
02:53:29.201 --> 02:53:31.840
the original main event was Tito against Phil, Derek,

3166
02:53:31.841 --> 02:53:35.170
Tito against in the Guara and Tito pulled out of the fight injured.

3167
02:53:35.171 --> 02:53:38.230
So they put Phil Davis in and immediately I got a message on Twitter from

3168
02:53:38.231 --> 02:53:40.750
Anthony Johnson, like DM on Twitter. And he was like,

3169
02:53:40.990 --> 02:53:42.820
I can't believe they didn't bump us up to the main event.

3170
02:53:43.330 --> 02:53:46.840
We need to steal the show. We need to, you know, like, and we, we were friends,

3171
02:53:46.841 --> 02:53:49.960
we used to do signings at to tap out with tap out and stuff all the time.

3172
02:53:50.320 --> 02:53:52.330
So we were going back and forth throughout training camp.

3173
02:53:52.390 --> 02:53:54.910
This is going to be great. We're going to have a wild fire. We're going to,

3174
02:53:55.030 --> 02:53:58.660
you know, just kind of basically Kinda psyching each other up for the fight.

3175
02:53:59.290 --> 02:54:01.480
Me coming off a knockout, I'm thinking to myself,

3176
02:54:01.481 --> 02:54:04.240
there's no way he's not going to try and knock me out. Right.

3177
02:54:04.780 --> 02:54:07.290
So I went into the fight with the full intention that I,

3178
02:54:07.300 --> 02:54:10.270
we were just gonna like I was going to have to move around and cover and you

3179
02:54:10.271 --> 02:54:11.890
know, try and counter him until he got tired.

3180
02:54:11.891 --> 02:54:13.630
Then I was going to take advantage of that.

3181
02:54:15.040 --> 02:54:18.130
He hit me with a head kick like early on in the fight and I blocked it.

3182
02:54:18.131 --> 02:54:21.130
It didn't knock me out and knocked me down. It knocked me over.

3183
02:54:21.430 --> 02:54:24.400
It was just a heavy leg, just like being hit with a tree. Trunk, Bang.

3184
02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:25.833
I hit the deck.

3185
02:54:25.930 --> 02:54:28.510
Then I think there was a scramble back to the feet and then he took me down and

3186
02:54:28.511 --> 02:54:32.380
I dislocated my thumb on that first tape down. And you can see in the fight,

3187
02:54:32.381 --> 02:54:35.620
I actually reach over it cause I was in, I had him in, my God,

3188
02:54:35.800 --> 02:54:39.670
I reached over and put my thumb back in. Oh and he's still crooked.

3189
02:54:39.810 --> 02:54:41.680
Little is still not still not quite right,

3190
02:54:42.010 --> 02:54:46.330
but then like he just drowned me with wrestling and I, I had just not,

3191
02:54:47.010 --> 02:54:49.480
I had not prepared for that. I put all my eggs in one basket.

3192
02:54:49.481 --> 02:54:52.590
It was going to be a counter striking match and I was going to defend these

3193
02:54:52.591 --> 02:54:55.540
strikes and I didn't expect him to try and take me down at all. Dude,

3194
02:54:55.541 --> 02:54:57.820
I think that wait clause, when you,

3195
02:54:57.821 --> 02:55:01.300
when he was cutting down from wearable of 200 to get to one 70,

3196
02:55:01.310 --> 02:55:04.100
I think it tired him so badly that we didn't see the real

3197
02:55:04.100 --> 02:55:07.550
<v 0>Anthony Johnson until he went up to light heavyweight, which is so crazy.</v>

3198
02:55:07.790 --> 02:55:11.390
Remember he missed weight at 85. A V tore beat him up because no one 90,

3199
02:55:11.740 --> 02:55:13.430
70 wade in something like that. Crazy like that.

3200
02:55:13.730 --> 02:55:17.780
But I think his next fight after me was a Andrea Loskott heavyweight. Look at,

3201
02:55:17.810 --> 02:55:22.460
look at what he looked like at one 70 skeletor and then looking at them at two

3202
02:55:22.461 --> 02:55:25.190
30 crazy as a light heavyweight.

3203
02:55:25.280 --> 02:55:29.690
He was the scariest because his power was fucking immense.

3204
02:55:30.170 --> 02:55:31.130
But he's another guy,

3205
02:55:31.131 --> 02:55:36.131
he fought heavyweight in the PFL and fucked up a Andrea Lawsky and now he's a

3206
02:55:37.250 --> 02:55:41.600
million pounds. Now we sold, he's so big, man. I saw him in the, uh,

3207
02:55:41.630 --> 02:55:44.360
in the lobby of the hotel in Stockholm after 84,

3208
02:55:44.361 --> 02:55:47.650
I Alexander Alexander Gustafson after he knocked Gustafson out, um,

3209
02:55:47.840 --> 02:55:51.200
when I walked into the lobby of the hotel and he was there taking a few photos

3210
02:55:51.201 --> 02:55:54.680
and stuff and I walked up to him and I said, I'm glad you didn't do that to me.

3211
02:55:54.680 --> 02:55:59.510
And he shook my hand. He went, I like you though, God for that.

3212
02:55:59.690 --> 02:56:01.640
Thank God. Holy Shit. He one,

3213
02:56:01.730 --> 02:56:06.350
he's in a perfect example of a guy that when he wasn't depleting his body,

3214
02:56:06.351 --> 02:56:10.430
we got to see what he could really do and like the Nogueira fight. Oh my Jesus.

3215
02:56:10.460 --> 02:56:13.210
Yeah. He got on his feet with an upper class.

3216
02:56:14.110 --> 02:56:17.930
Extraordinary when he knocked out, glow over with one punch. Like, God damn,

3217
02:56:17.931 --> 02:56:19.040
this guy is extraordinary.

3218
02:56:19.340 --> 02:56:21.860
But it was really interesting when I talked to him when he retired,

3219
02:56:22.340 --> 02:56:25.220
he retired in the octagon. He said, I'm an athlete. He goes,

3220
02:56:25.221 --> 02:56:27.770
I'm not a fighter because I don't like doing this. I'm just good at it.

3221
02:56:28.460 --> 02:56:29.840
I'm like, wow. Like,

3222
02:56:29.841 --> 02:56:34.841
how crazy that probably the most dangerous knockout artists in the history of

3223
02:56:35.001 --> 02:56:36.230
the light heavyweight division.

3224
02:56:36.980 --> 02:56:41.150
I would say that I would say who the fuck's more dangerous than Anthony Rumble

3225
02:56:41.150 --> 02:56:44.990
Johnson. Yeah. If he connects on you, the only person that absorbed it was DC.

3226
02:56:45.530 --> 02:56:48.380
DC absorbed that head kick. She absorbed a big right hand.

3227
02:56:48.381 --> 02:56:52.190
The first fight that sent up scrambling. Yeah.

3228
02:56:53.090 --> 02:56:57.170
Ridiculous puncher. Ridiculous. Especially [inaudible] you know,

3229
02:56:57.171 --> 02:57:00.650
he's a comfortable weight for him to the Glover fight was stunning.

3230
02:57:00.651 --> 02:57:05.280
We never saw go over getting knocked down and then also boom one punch bank out

3231
02:57:05.281 --> 02:57:07.900
cold. Yeah. You remember the uh, the,

3232
02:57:08.140 --> 02:57:12.440
the knockout that I always remember is the Shane Calling Gonzaga fight cause

3233
02:57:12.441 --> 02:57:16.490
that was like a six inch punch. Oh yeah. Gonzaga just folded on the spot.

3234
02:57:16.810 --> 02:57:20.690
Didn't k o Jimmy man don't went to oh he did. Yes he did.

3235
02:57:20.780 --> 02:57:24.800
He fucks everybody up except DC. DC just had that number.

3236
02:57:25.550 --> 02:57:26.690
Takes those shots so well.

3237
02:57:26.800 --> 02:57:30.680
It takes some shots so well and his wrestling's is so overwhelming and in that

3238
02:57:30.681 --> 02:57:34.850
fight, you know, he just wasn't like physically prepared to do that until,

3239
02:57:34.851 --> 02:57:38.530
and it's that same game plan twice. I call it,

3240
02:57:38.531 --> 02:57:40.360
I'm calling it the grind cycle. You know what I mean?

3241
02:57:40.420 --> 02:57:43.330
You're just trapped in that cycle, puts you against the fence.

3242
02:57:43.331 --> 02:57:45.570
He takes you down, he beats you up till you give you his Bible,

3243
02:57:46.390 --> 02:57:50.650
strangles you in ice. It's a beautiful thing to watch. She's very, very, yes.

3244
02:57:50.990 --> 02:57:54.140
I'm so curious as to whether or not he's going to be able to do that again this

3245
02:57:54.140 --> 02:57:56.780
weekend and what he's going to be able to do this weekend and steep bay and

3246
02:57:56.781 --> 02:57:59.270
what, what steep bay has for him, what he has,

3247
02:57:59.300 --> 02:58:01.500
what he has planned and how he approaches the fight.

3248
02:58:02.080 --> 02:58:04.220
Now he's got to know that this is,

3249
02:58:04.250 --> 02:58:07.020
it was hard to get this rematch and DC's on his way out.

3250
02:58:07.770 --> 02:58:11.250
Dcs publicly saying this might be his last fight. He doesn't know.

3251
02:58:11.340 --> 02:58:14.120
And then Dana White is saying reluctantly, I'll,

3252
02:58:14.180 --> 02:58:15.780
I'll let you guys fight at light heavyweight.

3253
02:58:15.780 --> 02:58:18.990
If you fight John Jones the remaster still they're talking about another fight

3254
02:58:19.020 --> 02:58:22.560
other than this fight, which I hate. I never liked that. Yeah.

3255
02:58:22.980 --> 02:58:24.900
And he's what a year past is past the date.

3256
02:58:24.901 --> 02:58:28.890
He said he was going to retire as well, right? DC I think he said at 40. Right?

3257
02:58:29.070 --> 02:58:33.380
Did he sell it? 40. So it's at the end of 2018. You know what?

3258
02:58:33.390 --> 02:58:35.550
Don't want to keep bringing up trending around.

3259
02:58:35.580 --> 02:58:40.000
It's hard to say no to the chatter that cheek. Hey Man,

3260
02:58:40.010 --> 02:58:41.520
I'm an old man. I'm talking about,

3261
02:58:41.580 --> 02:58:45.450
I'm talking about getting back in there one more time. You seem to want it for,

3262
02:58:45.900 --> 02:58:48.180
um, it seems to be more than just for money for you.

3263
02:58:48.181 --> 02:58:50.700
It seems to be something you want to challenge yourself one more time. And,

3264
02:58:51.030 --> 02:58:52.260
and for people who don't know,

3265
02:58:52.261 --> 02:58:57.261
your career was taken from you in a way that you feel like didn't medically make

3266
02:58:58.951 --> 02:58:59.700
sense.

3267
02:58:59.700 --> 02:59:02.940
They s they told you to stop fighting because they explained the whole heart

3268
02:59:02.941 --> 02:59:03.774
condition thing.

3269
02:59:04.680 --> 02:59:08.330
<v 2>It was, it was in the build. It's the Michael Brown wire on pot. Wolf. Yes. Yes.</v>

3270
02:59:08.390 --> 02:59:11.740
I wouldn't tell you which part. Um, yeah, I was,

3271
02:59:11.810 --> 02:59:14.480
it was in the building at the Mike Brown fight at the Mike Brown Mike Brown

3272
02:59:14.780 --> 02:59:15.860
fight. And because it's California,

3273
02:59:15.861 --> 02:59:18.710
they're required to do a bunch of different tests and uh, it just,

3274
02:59:18.740 --> 02:59:20.270
it showed up as an irregular heartbeat.

3275
02:59:20.300 --> 02:59:22.450
It's like I have a second heart heartbeat.

3276
02:59:22.530 --> 02:59:25.520
And so it's another bunch of cells in the heart that produced an electrical

3277
02:59:25.521 --> 02:59:30.080
current and it can confuse the heart cause cardiac arrest. It can cause,

3278
02:59:30.290 --> 02:59:34.520
you know, electrical issues with the heart. I'd never had any problems,

3279
02:59:34.521 --> 02:59:36.800
never had any symptoms of side effects or anything like that.

3280
02:59:36.801 --> 02:59:40.430
So basically what they told me is that if I wanted to continue fighting,

3281
02:59:40.431 --> 02:59:41.420
I had to have an ablation.

3282
02:59:41.480 --> 02:59:44.940
So they had to go into my heart and they had to burn the, the, the,

3283
02:59:44.941 --> 02:59:48.070
the cells that were producing the second, uh, electrical cork.

3284
02:59:48.860 --> 02:59:51.440
I've never had anything wrong with me. It's so healthy.

3285
02:59:51.650 --> 02:59:55.280
I've pushed myself to whatever limits I think I've got. And, um, you know,

3286
02:59:55.340 --> 02:59:57.620
I'm hoping to find some more, but I pushed myself,

3287
02:59:57.621 --> 03:00:01.070
I know what my heart's capable of and I just, I've never doubted it.

3288
03:00:01.071 --> 03:00:04.340
I've never felt like you're known for having good cardio. Yeah. I always pushed,

3289
03:00:04.370 --> 03:00:08.690
I always pushed the pace and so I, I just didn't want to have anything done.

3290
03:00:08.750 --> 03:00:10.100
They said, they literally said to me,

3291
03:00:10.101 --> 03:00:12.290
you can have it done and still fight on the same date.

3292
03:00:12.291 --> 03:00:13.880
This was five weeks before the fight.

3293
03:00:14.690 --> 03:00:19.280
So it just didn't have it having some five weeks. So how much recovery time? Oh,

3294
03:00:19.281 --> 03:00:21.440
practically none. Till they go into the,

3295
03:00:21.530 --> 03:00:24.920
into the carotid artery and the femoral artery and they go into the heart.

3296
03:00:25.340 --> 03:00:28.670
But Lorenzo sent me out to California. What are they going in there?

3297
03:00:28.730 --> 03:00:31.430
I know some, some cables are being broken.

3298
03:00:31.930 --> 03:00:36.260
The car goes wrong. Yeah, exactly. And then I ended up being an iron man.

3299
03:00:36.380 --> 03:00:39.830
I mean, you want to come out with powers, but Lorenzo sent me out to a,

3300
03:00:39.831 --> 03:00:43.670
to Beverly hills to a specialist out there to have more checks done. Um,

3301
03:00:43.760 --> 03:00:47.780
and they couldn't find anything, any, any anomalies with my heart. No.

3302
03:00:47.781 --> 03:00:50.990
Like additional growth or anything like that. So I just said,

3303
03:00:50.991 --> 03:00:52.190
I'm not having anything done.

3304
03:00:52.250 --> 03:00:55.640
I went back to the UK and then I was busy for a few years doing the commentary.

3305
03:00:55.790 --> 03:00:57.350
But I did go and see a specialist.

3306
03:00:57.750 --> 03:01:00.880
I'm a cardiac specialist for athletes and he put me through all the same tests

3307
03:01:00.881 --> 03:01:03.590
and he points out what they'd seen and he said that it could,

3308
03:01:03.850 --> 03:01:05.440
could've been accentuated because I was in,

3309
03:01:05.650 --> 03:01:08.560
I was weight cut and I was in training camp. I was tired, he said,

3310
03:01:08.561 --> 03:01:09.280
but ultimately these,

3311
03:01:09.280 --> 03:01:12.490
there's nothing in these records that show that you can't fly and you're not

3312
03:01:12.491 --> 03:01:16.060
safe to fight. So I have the paperwork now. So four months in,

3313
03:01:16.140 --> 03:01:17.900
you saw the test important. I've just got my,

3314
03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:19.630
I've just got the option to step back in there.

3315
03:01:19.990 --> 03:01:24.160
I would like one more because I never felt like I showed what I'm fully capable

3316
03:01:24.161 --> 03:01:28.390
of. [inaudible] I spoke at a spa regularly. I dropped in the gym cause I've got,

3317
03:01:28.391 --> 03:01:29.860
I've got guys that are training for fights.

3318
03:01:29.861 --> 03:01:33.000
So we've had Terry brasier fight and recently out of Mama Singer, um,

3319
03:01:33.100 --> 03:01:36.400
Dean Truman fought recently. So I've been in them moving around with those guys.

3320
03:01:36.720 --> 03:01:39.130
And you've never really gotten out of training, training,

3321
03:01:39.131 --> 03:01:41.680
you've always trained martial arts this whole time, right? Yeah.

3322
03:01:41.740 --> 03:01:43.960
And I've always stayed healthy. I never gained any,

3323
03:01:43.961 --> 03:01:46.990
I actually lost weight after I stopped fighting because you know, my,

3324
03:01:47.920 --> 03:01:51.010
my diet changed. I didn't feel the need to be constantly eating all the time.

3325
03:01:51.011 --> 03:01:51.610
So I just,

3326
03:01:51.610 --> 03:01:54.700
I allowed my body just to kind of figure out where it wants to be naturally.

3327
03:01:54.940 --> 03:01:58.090
One 82 one 84 was perfect for me. Um,

3328
03:01:58.120 --> 03:02:01.900
so my plan is just to kind of get to about 85% condition and just sit there and

3329
03:02:01.901 --> 03:02:05.500
then like, I mean this weekend is a great example. If like, you know,

3330
03:02:06.060 --> 03:02:08.140
Petty's or Diaz fell out and there's no one else around,

3331
03:02:08.141 --> 03:02:10.630
that's the kind of place I'll just throw my name in the hat and just to be

3332
03:02:10.631 --> 03:02:14.770
available and one of those flights will be perfect for me. Just a, you know,

3333
03:02:14.771 --> 03:02:16.210
one of the veterans of the game,

3334
03:02:16.220 --> 03:02:19.810
someone that's like not too concerned with the rankings or anything like that,

3335
03:02:20.630 --> 03:02:21.580
dropping their, have a great fight.

3336
03:02:21.581 --> 03:02:25.180
And then step back out again and just be able to, how you'd like to approach it.

3337
03:02:25.181 --> 03:02:28.750
You want to immediately jump back in and fight someone with a big name? Oh,

3338
03:02:28.751 --> 03:02:31.450
for sure. I wouldn't, I wouldn't want to cause I might be one more fight.

3339
03:02:31.570 --> 03:02:33.280
I want someone to one more. Well that's it.

3340
03:02:33.370 --> 03:02:36.280
I want someone that everyone knows that if you love it though, wow,

3341
03:02:36.410 --> 03:02:38.310
I would know. I would love it. But I feel very,

3342
03:02:38.500 --> 03:02:41.950
I feel very selfish thinking about fighting again anyway because it's not there.

3343
03:02:41.970 --> 03:02:44.710
What I've realized since I've been fighting is it's not just me coming out of

3344
03:02:44.711 --> 03:02:48.400
retirement. It's like my whole family. I was, I was there,

3345
03:02:48.460 --> 03:02:50.410
I was there when [inaudible] got knocked out in London.

3346
03:02:50.411 --> 03:02:53.470
I was there when going to Nelson got knocked out in, in Glasgow.

3347
03:02:53.780 --> 03:02:55.420
I see the reactions of their family.

3348
03:02:55.421 --> 03:02:58.360
I know what I put my family through and because I've had time to kind of step

3349
03:02:58.361 --> 03:03:02.410
back and like allow them some time to, you know, the,

3350
03:03:02.640 --> 03:03:06.700
the souls aren't as calcified to the idea of me fighting anymore, you know?

3351
03:03:07.410 --> 03:03:10.810
So it's a serious conversation to have. But I mean, the reality is like, and,

3352
03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:14.890
and you know, the sport's very different now.

3353
03:03:15.220 --> 03:03:17.320
Everything's changed. Like when I was fighting GSP,

3354
03:03:17.321 --> 03:03:19.840
the conversations I was having with the media was, you know,

3355
03:03:19.841 --> 03:03:23.440
what we are and aren't allowed to do, you know, what's legal, what's illegal.

3356
03:03:23.590 --> 03:03:26.500
So it wasn't really about about why I was doing it. It was about,

3357
03:03:26.501 --> 03:03:29.800
I was basically being an ambassador for the sport while I was in training camp.

3358
03:03:30.370 --> 03:03:35.110
So now it would, it would be far more of a, um, an internal journey.

3359
03:03:35.111 --> 03:03:39.040
I'd be able to, to really embrace it a lot more and focus on myself. Um,

3360
03:03:39.070 --> 03:03:41.410
you know, and now I've got, you know, my, my camera guys,

3361
03:03:41.411 --> 03:03:43.060
I'd like to document the process.

3362
03:03:43.240 --> 03:03:46.270
I'd like to be able to speak quite candidly to the camera and just bank a load

3363
03:03:46.271 --> 03:03:48.580
of stuff. So after the fight, I've got all this,

3364
03:03:48.760 --> 03:03:51.730
all this footsies that I can put into something to kind of

3365
03:03:53.470 --> 03:03:54.750
give some insight into the,

3366
03:03:54.810 --> 03:03:58.010
the mentality of the fighter and the ups and downs of training company. Because

3367
03:03:58.010 --> 03:03:58.220
<v 0>you know,</v>

3368
03:03:58.220 --> 03:04:01.070
the days you show up to media day to the press conference and you're like,

3369
03:04:01.370 --> 03:04:01.971
you know, you, you,

3370
03:04:01.971 --> 03:04:04.700
you're confident in the stage and you shit talking to your opponent and you

3371
03:04:05.150 --> 03:04:08.750
smiling and stuff like you might get back to your dressing room and you might be

3372
03:04:08.751 --> 03:04:10.880
exhausted. You might feel like shit, you might,

3373
03:04:10.910 --> 03:04:13.970
you might have been playing a game for a particular reason and there's a,

3374
03:04:13.971 --> 03:04:15.620
there's a good reason you're playing that game.

3375
03:04:16.040 --> 03:04:19.760
And I think that a lot of those narratives go on told because the sport moves so

3376
03:04:19.761 --> 03:04:20.594
quickly.

3377
03:04:20.690 --> 03:04:23.570
And I think I might be able to give like a nice little insight into that.

3378
03:04:24.080 --> 03:04:26.780
So if we are going to expect this,

3379
03:04:27.260 --> 03:04:29.750
how much time do you think you need to fully prepare?

3380
03:04:29.810 --> 03:04:34.160
Where are you at right now? Uh, I always work on percentages.

3381
03:04:34.220 --> 03:04:37.250
I would say physically in con I would say I'm about,

3382
03:04:38.840 --> 03:04:42.440
I don't know about 58% condition. 58 that's an interesting number. Yes.

3383
03:04:42.441 --> 03:04:45.440
Choose that. Well because I'm working through a couple of injuries,

3384
03:04:45.441 --> 03:04:47.270
I've not been doing a lot of hands on stuff.

3385
03:04:47.271 --> 03:04:50.190
I've been doing a lot of training on my own. I'm starting to build up my,

3386
03:04:50.260 --> 03:04:53.940
my aerobic base again. But the one thing I've noticed is, and like, um,

3387
03:04:54.050 --> 03:04:58.880
I smoked most days, like my conditioning like always is, is good.

3388
03:04:59.190 --> 03:05:04.190
Like I can just get out and run 10 miles and feel comfortable with it and that's

3389
03:05:04.821 --> 03:05:08.950
never changed. So all I, all I need to do is just kinda just Kinda test that,

3390
03:05:09.040 --> 03:05:12.140
that the toughness in that condition now and push it, you know, to the,

3391
03:05:12.141 --> 03:05:16.090
to the points where I feel uncomfortable. How old, you know, 37 done, done.

3392
03:05:16.640 --> 03:05:20.660
But I've, you know, healthy, I've not, you know, I'm not drinking 20 years.

3393
03:05:20.780 --> 03:05:25.250
I've had ibuprofen since 2009 you know, I just, I, I have nothing.

3394
03:05:25.490 --> 03:05:28.040
And you've been out of competition for how many years now?

3395
03:05:28.041 --> 03:05:29.900
It's been seven years now. I haven't, yeah,

3396
03:05:30.440 --> 03:05:34.240
I told you I work in cycles and cycles. This is my, this,

3397
03:05:34.330 --> 03:05:37.580
this seven year cycle. Yeah. Listen, man, I hope you do it.

3398
03:05:37.581 --> 03:05:41.180
I hope you fulfill your vision quest like Matthew Modine, that movie.

3399
03:05:41.340 --> 03:05:45.350
Thanks man. Fucking do it. I wouldn't be beautiful to see and, uh,

3400
03:05:45.540 --> 03:05:48.620
we gotta do this more often, man. Fun. I really enjoyed this. Thanks man.

3401
03:05:48.621 --> 03:05:50.300
It's always good. So I'll consider it. It's just, you know,

3402
03:05:50.480 --> 03:05:53.330
I live so far away now and I'm in the UK. Anytime you're here,

3403
03:05:53.331 --> 03:05:56.630
anytime we're around, I bring a mobile thing. We'll figure it out on the road.

3404
03:05:56.631 --> 03:05:59.420
Okay. But have you ever at UFC events? Okay. Thank you brother.

3405
03:05:59.510 --> 03:06:02.600
I appreciate you making silicon c Dan Hardy, ladies and gentlemen,

3406
03:06:03.410 --> 03:06:04.243
<v 5>Goodbye.</v>

3407
03:06:12.130 --> 03:06:12.963
