Speaker 1:          00:00          I'm Robert Krulwich. I'm Molly Webster. This is radio lab and today today we've got a guy asking a pretty common question. Yeah. But the way he tries to solve this question is at first thrilled to him crutch, then the curse and then it ends up in an extraordinarily deep puzzle. It comes to us from producer Andy Mills. A story is about David Weinberg, a buddy of mine, and it starts off uh right around the time he gets out of high school. Yeah. I graduated from high school in 2000 and then went directly to university and then I got kicked out somewhere at the beginning of the second semester and then left that town that I was living in and moved to the town where all my friends were going to college and he moves into a group house. It was a party house, him and a bunch of his friends.

Speaker 1:          00:46          There was a giant cross in the front yard that my friends had found wild tripping on acid and put in a shopping cart and they put in the front yard. Our fact checker actually found out that they were tripping on mushrooms, not acid, but anyway, a lot of drinking, a lot of partying. And for David, like for awhile it was good hanging out with like the people that I care about most in the world, I feel incredibly free because I don't live at home anymore. Um, and then I just started to get old for one everyday when his friends would go off to class, David would have to go to work during the day I was working as a janitor at the university where my friends went and during the evenings I would deliver pizzas and it went on like this for years, you know, day after day they would party.

Speaker 1:          01:31          But then in the morning when his friends would go to class, he would go and clean toilets and then deliver pizzas all through sophomore year they would go to class, he would clean toilets than deliver pizzas, junior year class toilets, pizzas. And like, I think looking back on it now, I think there was this rage that started to build up inside inside me because I mean I was really sick of cleaning the toilets of kids in the dorms who I resent but are also, but I also recognize are able to do something that I wasn't able to do. And you know, all my friends were at that university and they were about to graduate. And so I think I was also worried that like, well they're all going to go off and live these lives and I'm going to be stuck here cleaning toilets. And on top of that, by the time most of David's friends were seniors, he was spending his weekends in jail for driving on a suspended license. So my life at that point was like cleaning toilets in the morning, delivering pizzas in the evening. And then every weekend I was in jail and there was kind of this breaking

Speaker 2:          02:36          one thing that one thing that we did a lot of like, uh, we listen to a lot of punk music. My friends were in punk bands and we would just like get really drunk and like yell into the speakers probably like three or four nights a week, you know. And One night we were doing that, it was me and my friend Danny and my friend mark and some of them you've snapped inside me. I just got lost. It just started like grabbing chairs and hurling through windows and just

Speaker 1:          02:59          like smashed out all the windows in our house. You couldn't see the floor cause there was just like wreckage everywhere and I was all bloody and I was just like, it was intense. It was, I don't think it hit me until the next morning when I saw what it looked like, like a hurricane and like ripped through the house. Yeah. And all of his friends, everyone was just sort of stunned. There's sort of like, what's going on? And then you know, when, when you confront a reality like that, everything just sort of gets stripped away and you're just left with this question that's like, who am I like and what am I doing with my life?

Speaker 1:          03:44          And around that time, David was driving around delivering pizzas, listening to the radio and WBZ Chicago. It's this American life. Am I right glass heard this story, this Scott carrier story called the test. I was hired to interview men and women in the State of Utah who received Medicaid support for treatment of mental illnesses generally die and interest like stop me in my tracks. So the story is by a guy named Scott carrier. He's a frequent contributor at this American life and it's basically about how he gets this new job. He gets this job driving around the state of Utah interviewing schizophrenia, people giving them this test. I took the job because I had no other, I took the job because I had just quit my steady job, my professional job, and this is happening at a point where Scott's life is falling apart. What I wanted more than anything was to put my boss on the floor and stand on his throat and watching gag talks about how he hates his boss and my wife moved out, took the kids and everything, his wife and just left him. So I took the job and did the job and my life will never be the same.

Speaker 1:          04:52          And David says, as soon as he heard that story, I remember thinking like, I need to figure out how to become a radio producer. That's what I need to do. Why, why does he want it to become a radio for this?

Speaker 3:          05:04          Well, I think first off, Scott carrier is really good at what he does. Yeah. Uh, there's something about him that is magnetic, right? It gets people thinking I want to do that. But maybe more importantly in the story, Scott is stuck, not too dissimilar from, uh, where David finds himself. And a good Scott does is he turns his stuckness into a story. And in doing so kind of gives it meaning.

Speaker 1:          05:32          So He's, yeah, it's getting, it's rising above your situation. Sorry.

Speaker 3:          05:35          Yeah. Yeah. And when David hears it, he thinks like, well, maybe I can do that too. It makes sense. It was like, okay, this is my ticket.

Speaker 1:          05:47          So that summer he lined up a job at this camp, this summer camp in upstate New York. And I bought this mini disc recorder already. Got himself. Mike, the little mic that you could clip onto your shirt and testing. Recording inside the tent. He and his buddy mark who had just graduated, they left Colorado and headed to upstate New York. My idea was like, okay, I'll just go around and get all these recordings and then I'll write these stories about what it all means and day one sort of like on the road but with recording.

Speaker 4:          06:21          Great. On the line, on the law, you recorded the kids at the camp [inaudible] step out. Yeah. We don't meet this bar fight one night when he was out with the other counselors. What's going on with it? Is there keyboarders Huh? Yeah. We brought the keyboards flirting with girls. What do you got these added for buddy? Listen, this is the coolest thing in the world. Put these on. I mean, isn't that cool? It's a live recording of what's happening right now. Right now. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:46          I distinctly remember just being in complete awe of hearing recordings that I had made

Speaker 4:          06:53          where nothing was happening. The idea,

Speaker 1:          07:00          the idea that I could make a recording and listen to it. It was like, like early man sees a mirror, you know, and just can't stop staring at it.

Speaker 4:          07:08          Yeah, yeah. Actually wasn't it

Speaker 1:          07:13          interviewing people or anything like that? He'd sort of decided that he wanted to record moments as they happened, like to him and he figured the best way to do that was to record. Secretly I had cut a small hole in all of the pants and shorts that I had in the pocket. So like I'd get up in the morning, put the mini disc recorder in my pocket, and then I'd run the cord down my shirt and anytime something interesting was happening, I would slip my finger in my pocket and just press the record.

Speaker 4:          07:44          Well, launching fire at first, just some, you know, moments here and there. This is really scary. These possible little scenes for a story. Maybe Abraham. Then we got to Queens, we got to get to the seven trays. Him, he and his buddy mark built in New York City. Everything sounds interesting. So he's recording more and more on the upper middle, falling there. Then every day after New York, he and mark hitchhiked across Europe together. I'm sure, uh, my name is mark or I'm David.

Speaker 1:          08:30          And at this point David is recording people that pick them up in Europe, e n mark and there other buddy dom on the side of the road.

Speaker 5:          08:37          Well, the rhythm of the cars on the highway is even, it sounds almost like waves and the ocean.

Speaker 4:          08:45          No, every street performer I would run up to stand next to and record and just everything. And you're still thinking to yourself like, man, I am

Speaker 1:          08:56          just getting gold. Yeah. I was like, you know, this is the, this is the raw material for my first grade story, you know, and uh, I think I tried, like I separated myself from, it's like, it's kind of cliche like, oh yeah, you graduate from college and you backpack around Europe. And it's like, no, no, no. I'm not one of those people. Like I'm actually making a grants documentary. Like I'm a, I'm a, I'm a somebody, you know, I'm not just like everybody else. Yeah. Meanwhile, David is accumulating hundreds and hundreds of hours of tape and one thing that you'll hear if you managed to listen through all of it or most of it as I did is just him hanging out with his buddy mark. He was one of the people like we became instant friends the moment we met mark was your older than David. He was really into music. Sound engineering? Yes.

Speaker 4:          09:42          Magic pocket. We had this like perfect dynamic where mark had like enough talent, like he could actually play music and like rift these funny songs on the spot and I sort of like brought the wrong, boozy ASM to it

Speaker 1:          10:03          and the two of them together that we would just end up in these crazy places.

Speaker 6:          10:15          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          10:15          oh yeah. Do you remember this recording? Yeah, I remember that.

Speaker 6:          10:21          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          10:22          we were in Croatia and then we ended up at this huge amazing party. It was like in this old abandoned cabin, his building, which is hundreds of beautiful Croatian people. That was such a great day,

Speaker 6:          10:49          but then she didn't want a trailer slate. Do you want French fries, veggies or apple sauce?

Speaker 1:          10:54          David and mark came back to the states. Mark went out to Seattle to record an album with his band. And David, I got a job waiting tables at an apple

Speaker 6:          11:03          [inaudible] or salads or soup before the meal

Speaker 1:          11:05          back in his hometown living in his parent's basement. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          11:08          And if you guys aren't taking two seconds to try to up sell and you're taking money out of your pocket, you're taking money out of your pocket, you're taking money out of mind.

Speaker 1:          11:17          This kid did, he hung out with the most that I worked with was this meth addict. I would go to his place after work and like drink beer and play video games and he would get high and it was just like really depressing, um, a hard time, this shitty. And David has all of this tape like tons and tons and tons of tape from times with mark and, uh, in New York, in Europe. But he has no idea what to do with it. So he just keeps hitting record.

Speaker 6:          11:44          Yes. Set up for the night shift the morning.

Speaker 1:          11:51          Yeah. I mean I just, I just that more, I think

Speaker 4:          11:54          I needed the recording and the wire more than any time in my life. Didn't want that. Like that was the period when I needed the wireless most cause it was like raspberry lemonade. Sure, sure. This sucks. But like I'm gonna, I'm gonna get through this. I'm gonna and this will be a chapter in the story,

Speaker 6:          12:14          but just [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          12:31          [inaudible] I spent a lot of my time with my finger gently resting on the mini disc player. I could feel the disc spinning when it was recording. It was just very satisfying and comforting. You know, like a pulse in a way. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's still going. Yeah. Excuse me. Excuse me. No, we should get one of those bells. Put it right here. So tightening the meeting or like if I just made this friend or make it big, you know, like they made it, they just kept getting louder and louder until you made the [inaudible]. No, not at all. Some bartender [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          13:44          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          13:46          does he have a story? I'm not so sure he's caught to tell. Oh, well hang on. Okay. And after the break, I think you'll, I think you'll hear an answer. Okay.

Speaker 6:          14:07          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          14:52          one or wherever you get your podcasts.

Speaker 9:          15:03          I am Robert Krulwich. I'm Molly Webster and we're back. And today we're w we're in the middle of a story about David Weinberg who is recording almost every day of his life. And last we left him. He was in Applebee's, uh, working as a waiter and living in his parents' basement. Right. But he did eventually, yeah,

Speaker 2:          15:21          save up enough money to travel again. I went to Alaska, things like that. And he says that, well, when times were bad, like at Applebee's, he needed these recordings to make his life feel like it had a meaning when times were good, he couldn't stop recording because he was worried that he was gonna miss something. Yeah. Occasionally, like something would go wrong. Like I lost three or four recorders. They broke down over the course of the years that I was recording and whenever our recorder broke, there would be a period where I'd have to wait for the new recorder to come. [inaudible] and I just felt like on edge all the time, you know, like I need to be, I'm missing, I'm missing out, you know. And like in this weird twisted way, like I felt like I was missing out on life because I wasn't recording it. So when you would get the recorder, it would be like a relief. Oh yeah. It was like, oh, thank God I can, you know, like this pressure would be released and I could go back to recording and, and I would just feel like myself again, you know? But then, hey, hey, why is Brian ahead of you or behind David ended up down in Seattle where he met back up with mark and mark and I got in some big arguments in Seattle before I left.

Speaker 6:          16:27          It's something that you said that with private, like what is why it is that you feel uncomfortable.

Speaker 2:          16:34          He just told me when I had the buyers like I hate the fact that you record me all the time and you know, I was recording that conversation too.

Speaker 6:          16:43          I don't want to get to the heart of why

Speaker 2:          16:48          and he just laid it all out for me. You know, like he was someone who spent his day all day in a recording studio meticulously laying down perfect tracks, you know, that was his life. And so to him that idea that you would just sort of like record everything. It was wrong for a lot of reasons. One of which was just, he just didn't think that experiences warranted that. And then he had like philosophical objections to it

Speaker 6:          17:10          for both [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          17:20          that like what makes life great and worth living is that it is this fleeting thing and it's temporary.

Speaker 6:          17:27          Well I liked my life being temporal. I don't want him to, posterity is only good in like certain doses

Speaker 2:          17:35          and when you are trying to constantly record it and capture it, you're just taking away from that aspect of life.

Speaker 9:          17:42          It's like don't keep trying to capture like the essence of this thing. Just be in the essence of the thing. Right. So here you've got

Speaker 3:          17:49          David saying that you know he's recording all the time as to not miss anything and mark is saying that no, by recording all the time you are missing everything. You're missing the important thing.

Speaker 2:          18:03          And it got to the point where he said he didn't want to be recorded anymore and it was like really getting the way of our friendship cause it was like it like puts a ceiling on where your relationship can go when someone feels like they can't open up to you in that way. That just puts this wedge between you in a way that's just like awful. Did you stop recording at this point? Well, I couldn't stop like I, that I had just like, I don't know whether it's OCD or whatever. It was like, I was just like, I couldn't stop recording. And so I was always recording and the recording was like almost like a uniform for this person that I wanted to be. It was like, it's like you're in a play and you think you're living this life. And then when the desktops suddenly, like the lights go up and you realize it's all fake, just like face it dude. Like

Speaker 6:          18:53          you're just drifting.

Speaker 3:          18:59          At this point, David has around 2000 hours of tape, um, because he keeps on recording. He's not really hanging out with mark anymore. And he ends up just drifting down to New Orleans. And this is not very long after Hurricane Katrina. And it's like, you know, like, you know, everyone has heard about the flood and I was like, no. So I was like, listen to these people's like heroin journeys and then like all these injustices that they had faced. So he decided to do something that he, he never really done before and started interviewing people.

Speaker 10:         19:30          Yeah, I've been assessed the stall, but I've been living in New Orleans east telling their stories. How has it changed since? Huh? I will change that much since Katrina with their permissions, you know, not recording them secretly it up, you know. So where did you do your grocery shopping? I was doing a daughter jets really?

Speaker 3:          19:47          And then he started getting those stories onto New Orleans public radio station, listening to Wwlz street talk stories of New Orleans cultural rebuilding. [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         19:56          I'm telling you man, I appreciate that discipline cause I was growing up, man, I was growing up, just terrible man.

Speaker 3:          20:02          And then at night, uh, he'd go home and, and he would listen to audio from the wire tape of like me and some

Speaker 2:          20:09          bar and I think I am ready. Everyone in a bar.

Speaker 6:          20:13          I hear Ya. Yeah. You didn't make very many friends there, like

Speaker 2:          20:17          super drunk. And it's like, what? Like, why did I think this mattered? You know, like why, you know, and then also this like dynamic started to change in my mind where like it's one thing to record your own life and yes, I mean to be fair, I was also recording other people but it was always framed around me and everyone else was just sort of like supporting characters. But then when I started doing stories in the wounds, it was like this is not about me, this is about other people. And like suddenly it did start to feel dirty to record people. It was like all of that sort of came to a head and I just felt worse and worse about recording and then I just stopped. I was like, I don't want to, I don't want to do this anymore.

Speaker 3:          21:03          What about that feeling you were talking about just moments ago where without the recorder recording, what's happening. You felt as if you were missing out that an experience was kind of wasted because you hadn't gotten a chance to record it.

Speaker 2:          21:17          I mean that didn't go away. That definitely didn't go away. I mean, I feel like that still to this day, I sometimes feel like, man, I wish I was recording this, you know? Um, but it just forced me to really think hard about what moments in life were worth capturing and what [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          21:34          weren't, you know. So like if you do try to capture a moment, then you're kind of out of that moment, but if you don't then it's gone. So that has the potential to be lost. Right. I think that yeah, we all can relate to this idea. But for David, the crux of that tension to do it or not to do it like that became really difficult for him in part because of what happened next few months after he had quit recording. I used talking to mark who uh, you know, still back home in Seattle is very happy to hear the David wasn't recording anymore and so mark decided to go down to New Orleans and visit David and their buddy Danny who was down there too.

Speaker 2:          22:16          And um, man, this is hard cause I haven't really told the whole real story about what happened with mark. And I'm trying to think, I'll tell you the real story and um, shoot. Um, with, uh, Dan and today Danny and mark and I were really close to three of us. Um, and one thing we would do a couple of times a year, we, we would all go out to the mountains together and just have this great trip together like as friends. And so we were going to do that in New Orleans. And so, um, we got on our bikes and we rode down to the river and um, sat along the river for awhile and then we took the ferry over to the wet West Bank, the other side of the river, you know, like New Orleans is like glittering across the water got stoned and it was just magical, like in the, we were just sitting there for a long time, just talking, like having those sort of deep philosophical conversations

Speaker 3:          23:12          for the first time in a long time. [inaudible] was not recording, wasn't worried about capturing the moment. So

Speaker 2:          23:17          my mind was free to not think about the recording, you know, and then I was actually more present in some way. You know, and it just felt like it always did when we were close back in the mountains in Colorado, you know, it was just like a great moment and I wanted to keep hanging out there and mark was like getting kind of antsy. He wanted to go explore the city, you know, he wanted to go exploring and I was just like, they didn't really feel like I was just sort of like, they didn't want to be around other people. I was happy to be there with them and then mark just jumped up and took off, like just sprinted away. And we were like, well that was weird. You know, like it was very strange. David says that

Speaker 3:          23:57          mark said something in a moment but he can't like remember exactly what

Speaker 2:          24:02          and so we like got on our bikes and we were only a maybe, I dunno, maybe a hundred yards, 200 yards from the ferry that was parked there. And by the time we got to the bridge that connects the land to the ferry, I saw that Mark's bike was laying on its side on the ramp. I was just like, well that's weird. You know, in my mind am I, when I think back about it, I feel like things happened very slowly. Why is Mark's bike laying down? Why are all those people shouting? They're looking into the river. Why are they looking at over? And then I look in the river and there's mark and he's swimming in the Mississippi and he's shouting something and I can't figure out what he's saying. And I was just like, Holy Shit. Like this is really bad. And then I got really, really scared and I looked, Danny and Danny looked totally terrified and he started to, you know, he was going down river. Obviously it's the river. And so there was a point I could see off in the distance that there was a boat, like a rescue boat or something had gotten into the water. And mark started to drift around the bend and he disappeared out of you.

Speaker 3:          25:10          David and Danny, they kind of walk up and down the river, um, looking for mark and they couldn't find him. Then it gets dark. Um, and Danny, Martha, just head home and wait for news there the next morning. Still no news. A few days later, the authorities, they gave up their official search for mark and, and assume that he was dead and week or so later they found his body he had drown. And I should just add that there is no reason to suspect that this was a suicide. Yeah. I'm sorry the mark passed, man. That's [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          25:47          it's a tough story to hear. Yeah. Yeah. Let me ask you this,

Speaker 6:          25:50          okay.

Speaker 3:          25:52          Thinking about this as a lens of like, you being as someone who has a, a compulsion and obsession that is now under control but still live, lives in you, is there, uh, still is there a part of you that

Speaker 6:          26:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          26:09          wishes that you had been recording that day? Um,

Speaker 6:          26:15          uh, I don't know.

Speaker 3:          26:19          The thing is, David says, uh, you know, not long after your market died, he started going through a lot of his old recordings and sometimes he would hear on them these great moments between the two of them. But a lot of times he says it almost like, uh, he could hear that ceiling, but those recordings had put on his friendship with mark.

Speaker 2:          26:39          Man, I want to fucking take a boat down the coast, man. So I was acting different than I would would've if I hadn't been recording. You know, like I was conscious that I was on tape all the time.

Speaker 6:          26:52          I don't know, even if the boat, even if, you know,

Speaker 4:          26:55          Damien was saying that he was willing to like, and I also hear myself in these recordings often, like stepping over him. Like he'll say something and then I'll jump in and, and, and just like, clearly I'm just like, I'm on my own like train of thought and I'm not really listening to him. And that bothers me a lot. I'm glad I don't have, I think I'm glad that, I don't know. It's just a hard, cause I'm on one hand, I'm very glad that I don't have to

Speaker 2:          27:18          live with that tape and that it doesn't exist. But at the same time David says, I feel like maybe I miss something and maybe there's some part of what happened that night that I can't, that I missed. All I know is that he just said, let's get out of here and like jumped up and like, I don't even remember exactly how he put it. I just remember all of a sudden he was gone. If I had that recording, maybe I could make sense of it and maybe something would be more clear about it. Um, I think about that a lot, but then I also think of what would have marked what would mark have wanted. And you know what? That probably trumps whatever clarity. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. But I still think about it a lot. I still think about what I would get from those recordings if I had them. And, um, yeah, I don't

Speaker 6:          28:33          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] a big

Speaker 9:          29:18          thank you to David Weinberg for opening up his audio archive and sharing it all with us and sharing the story and thank you. And you also produced the whole thing and listened to all of those hours of day. Uh, I should add here a little update on, on David. He's actually a producer at KCRW and he's got this, uh, series that you should all check out called below the 10. And if you want to know more about that or maybe you listen to a lot of the 10, what it's a series about people, um, like very one of a kind interesting people who live in La, a couple of the 10, if you want to hear it, uh, find links to it or hear little snippets from the archive. You can find all that on our website. That's the thing you could do. I don't know if that's the thing we should say, which is radiolab.org events. That's it. Still it.
