STEVE GROVE: Good morning
and good afternoon.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.420
My name Steve Grove.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.827
I look after a team here at
Google called the News Lab.

00:00:06.827 --> 00:00:07.910
We're actually a new team.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:08.930
About a year old.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.374
We're focused on innovation
in the media landscape.

00:00:12.374 --> 00:00:13.790
But before that,
I actually worked

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.165
at YouTube, which is where I
first came across David Evan

00:00:16.165 --> 00:00:17.900
Harris and the
Global Lives project,

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.450
which you're all here today to
learn a little bit more about.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.390
It's really, really a unique
project in the media landscape

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.890
today.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.810
We're very pleased to have
David and Naomi joining us here

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.340
in Mountain View for this talk.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.920
How many of you have
seen the exhibit

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.747
in the lobby of building 43
before coming to this talk?

00:00:33.747 --> 00:00:34.330
Show of hands.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.200
Anybody?

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.080
Just a few.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.580
OK.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.810
Great.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.226
So this will be
the perfect tee up

00:00:38.226 --> 00:00:40.900
for you to go actually
observe the exhibit yourself.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.125
It's right inside the
front lobby of Google.

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:45.390
And it's really a
phenomenal exhibit.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.530
It has over 500 hours of
footage from the daily life

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.496
of 20 people in seven
different countries.

00:00:51.496 --> 00:00:52.370
And it's really neat.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.485
It's sort of an eight
screen immersive experience

00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:56.610
where you get to hear both
the audio and the visual

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.280
from lives of these people that
David and Naomi and others have

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.664
documented around the world.

00:01:00.664 --> 00:01:03.080
And they'll be up here to tell
you about it in just a bit.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.350
Google is just one place this
exhibit has found itself.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.950
It has also been at the
Smithsonian, the United Nations

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:09.680
University.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.040
I think it originally debuted
at the Yerba Buena Art Center

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.730
up in San Francisco.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.220
So as I mentioned, I
first met David back

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.100
when I was at YouTube
in about 2007.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.200
This was a long time ago
in internet video years.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.280
This was back when Lonely
Girl 13 was a huge phenomenon.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.210
When one of the original viral
videos on the web was a video

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.050
called Lazy Sunday from
Saturday Night Live.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.732
If anyone remembers that.

00:01:36.732 --> 00:01:38.440
In terms of my own
experience at YouTube,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.648
it was around the same time
that YouTube just started

00:01:40.648 --> 00:01:41.770
to be used for politics.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.400
So if you remember George
Allen being caught on a camera

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.330
calling his campaign opponent's
videographer a macaca,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.840
that moment being captured,
uploaded to YouTube.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.300
It went viral.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.205
He then lost a very
close race in many ways

00:01:55.205 --> 00:01:56.080
because of that clip.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.990
And sort of YouTube
politics had been born.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.450
So YouTube has been used in a
lot of ways since that point.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.580
But David was one of these
really early guys who

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.390
I think really recognized
the potential of online video

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.039
to really transform how we
understand the world around us.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.110
And I think most importantly,
how we understand the lives

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.460
of others who don't
live right next door,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.200
or in the same state, or
even in the same country.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.790
I think when he set aside to
do the Global Lives Project--

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.570
and he'll you a little bit
more about it when it comes up.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.545
He didn't want to just go out
there and say, hey, check out

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:26.920
these documentary
films of people

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.420
who live around the world and
have different experiences

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.920
to you.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.330
He wanted to do it in
a really unique way.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.040
What you see in these film is
a really raw, unvarnished look

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.390
at what it's like to
live somewhere else.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.540
He takes the idea
of day in the life,

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.980
and he takes it very literally.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.855
It is an actual day in the
life of these individuals

00:02:45.855 --> 00:02:49.300
that he goes out and
films 24 hours straight.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.830
Camera runs for
the whole 24 hours.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.370
They get a full
picture of what it's

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.710
like to be in that
person's shoes.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.560
And it helps you
answer questions--

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.290
to use some of
David's examples--

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.340
like what does a
Brazilian rapper do

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.920
first thing in the morning?

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.740
Or how long does it take
a Palestinian refugee

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.640
to walk to dance class?

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.780
Or what's it like to get
around the Tokyo subway

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.830
when you have to
use a wheelchair?

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.650
These are some really
ordinary moments

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.364
from which David extracts really
extraordinary stories that

00:03:16.364 --> 00:03:18.780
give us a real sense of what
life is like around the world

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.140
today.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.480
The program really got
kicking about five years ago,

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.524
thanks to several
grants from the National

00:03:24.524 --> 00:03:25.482
Endowment for the Arts.

00:03:25.482 --> 00:03:27.344
Three years ago,
David took the program

00:03:27.344 --> 00:03:29.385
and made it not just about
the videos themselves,

00:03:29.385 --> 00:03:30.794
but a curriculum.

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:32.960
For those of you who saw
these booklets on the table

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.260
when you came in, this is a
fully immersive curriculum

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.080
for schools to use.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.480
Over 1,000 teachers have
this in their classrooms,

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.810
and can use it showing
videos from these films,

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.200
but also a lot of great
questions and answers.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.880
And a deep curriculum
that David developed

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.900
with a group at
Stanford to bring

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.580
this work to the classroom.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.220
And when I think
about this project,

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.920
it's one of these
things where it's

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.795
sort of like private
sector/public diplomacy.

00:03:57.795 --> 00:04:00.090
If you talk to somebody
at the State Department,

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.960
or any foreign
government about what

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.420
it means to understand
cultures around the world, one

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.170
of the first things
they always talk about

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.449
is like well, if you could
do an educational exchange,

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:10.490
or if you could meet
someone from someplace else,

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.840
they no longer seem
like the other.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.891
But they seem like, you know--
you see a notion of sameness,

00:04:15.891 --> 00:04:16.390
right?

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.029
And that gives you
a new perspective,

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:20.446
I think, empathetic perspective
about the world around you

00:04:20.446 --> 00:04:21.278
that's so important.

00:04:21.278 --> 00:04:23.560
It's why we're so excited
to have David and Naomi here

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.510
with us today.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.360
He is joined as
well by Naomi Ture.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.869
She filmed the Vietnam
portion of this exhibit.

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:32.660
She'll tell you all
about that in a moment.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.580
She's an accomplished filmmaker.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.445
She recently just finished the
project of "Batkid Begins."

00:04:37.445 --> 00:04:40.070
How many of you sort of followed
the whole phenomenon of Batkid

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.950
in San Francisco?

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.320
So Naomi just finished
a film with Time Warner

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.142
on that extraordinary story.

00:04:46.142 --> 00:04:48.100
She's also been a board
member for Global Lives

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.961
for several years.

00:04:48.961 --> 00:04:51.460
I'm going to bring up David now
to give us a quick overview.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.710
David's a sociologist.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:53.410
He's an artist.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.380
He's a curator.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.880
He founded this program, like
I said, way ahead of its time,

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.504
before online video
was really a thing.

00:04:58.504 --> 00:05:00.419
Back in 2004.

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.710
In addition to running this
extraordinary organization,

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.120
he's also a Fellow at the
Institute for the Future,

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.850
which means he
knows what's coming.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.230
So maybe we can get
to that in the Q&amp;A.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.410
He also was on the staff
at UC Berkeley's Haas

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.850
School of Business.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.420
He started out
earlier in his career

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.795
at the White House
on the Council

00:05:15.795 --> 00:05:18.070
on Environmental Quality,
and spent a lot of time

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.346
in Sao Paulo, where he
got his sociology degree.

00:05:21.346 --> 00:05:23.970
So without further ado, I'd like
to bring up David Evan Harris.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.892
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:26.892 --> 00:05:28.100
DAVID EVAN HARRIS: Thank you.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.320
Thanks so much, Steve.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.720
It's really an honor to be here.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.560
So I should just
mention, Global Lives

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.620
was founded just a few months
before YouTube, actually.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.300
And at the time when we did
our first 24-hour shoot,

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.870
we couldn't even
afford a hard drive

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.080
that we could put 24
hours of video onto.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.790
It was actually
quite costly. $1,000.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.482
But I followed Moore's law.

00:05:47.482 --> 00:05:49.940
And figured that by the time
I finished all of these videos

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.250
around the world, I
would be able to afford

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.070
the adequate hard
drives to do this.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.050
So let's see.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.050
So one of the big questions
that Global Lives is asking--

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.680
and Global Lives really
is not about giving you

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.580
specific answers.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.660
It's about asking you questions.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.500
One of these questions is
what are the boundaries

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.460
of your moral universe?

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.320
And this is a
pretty big question.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.370
And one way I like to think
about what this might mean

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:20.900
is to ask people a question.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.580
So I'm curious in the audience
here if anyone knows or would

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.370
like to volunteer a number
about how many people

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:34.530
died in Iraq as a result
of the Iraq war since 2002.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.010
If anyone has an idea
about the numbers there,

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.250
the magnitude of
deaths that took place.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.990
AUDIENCE: 300,000.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.255
DAVID EVAN HARRIS: 300,000.

00:06:43.255 --> 00:06:45.070
600,000.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.790
Anyone else?

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.070
No Googling allowed.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.440
1 million?

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.101
Couple million.

00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:52.600
Yeah.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.270
So this is really interesting.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.840
And so this room is
actually representative

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.570
of the broader lack of
agreement on this issue.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.680
There are estimates
that range from 150,000

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.660
to a million people.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.015
Just one of the studies
reached a conclusion

00:07:08.015 --> 00:07:09.960
that around half
a million people

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.740
died as a result of this war.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.420
Now to me, this is
really difficult,

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.580
because we do have
exact numbers.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.220
And we do get exact
numbers whenever

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.690
members of the American
military or US citizens

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.460
are killed in these conflicts.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.570
But we have a margin of error
in the hundreds of thousands

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:34.300
of human lives in our
reporting on this issue.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.840
And to me, what that
says is that there's

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.530
a really deep problem
in our society today,

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.910
which is that we don't
value human lives equally.

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:46.510
And if someone is of
a different religion,

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:51.520
of a different nationality,
and maybe of a different class,

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.630
and living in a different
part of the world,

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:58.210
we don't have the mechanisms to
really think about their life

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.440
in the same way,
in the way that we

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.140
think about the
lives of other people

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.554
that are much closer to us.

00:08:03.554 --> 00:08:05.220
So to me, that's a
really important part

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.515
of the context of why I started
thinking about Global Lives.

00:08:09.515 --> 00:08:11.140
So I'm going to show
a short video that

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.130
gives you an introduction
to Global Lives.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.827
And then I'll tell you more.

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:17.510
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:21.410
-The world is an
incredibly diverse place.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:25.300
But it takes experiencing that
diversity on a personal level

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.330
to really appreciate
and understand it.

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:34.500
-The Global Lives project
is a video library

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.820
of life experience
where we record

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.950
24 hours in the daily life of
people from all walks of life,

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:42.180
from all over the world.

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.554
-What I think is
very interesting

00:08:43.554 --> 00:08:45.770
is the way in which
we present it.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:49.900
Unraveling in real time,
waking up, eating breakfast,

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.550
conversing with your neighbors.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.932
-It's those details that really
make you connect with someone.

00:08:54.932 --> 00:08:56.390
All over the world,
no matter where

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:59.390
we are, how we live, we
all laugh, we all cry,

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.890
we all care about our families.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.450
-Global Lives
cultivates empathy.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:08.010
And empathy is at the foundation
of any thriving culture.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:11.170
-It all began with recording the
life of James Bullock, a cable

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:14.280
car driver here in San
Francisco back in 2004.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.750
Since then, we've done video
shoots in other countries

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:20.660
around the world, including
Brazil, Malawi, Japan, China,

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:25.990
India, Indonesia, Serbia,
Lebanon, and Kazakhstan.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:27.420
-When selecting
our participants,

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.180
we work with
demographics experts

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.710
to represent the world's
diversity by age, religion,

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:36.030
income, gender, and occupation.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.520
-It's really transformative to
travel and see other cultures.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.020
But not everyone
has the privilege

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.380
to just backpack
around the world

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.760
and get to know people
from different places.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.170
Global Lives tries to
bring that to people where

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:51.560
they are, through the internet,
through video installations,

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.470
and allow people to have
that experience of seeing

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.820
what everyday life is like in
different places in the world.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.350
-In a classroom
environment, it's

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:03.600
very important for the
future leaders of this world

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.580
to be able to appreciate
cultures, and be

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.260
able to understand that
at the root of it all,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.756
we are all human beings with
the same aspirations and dreams.

00:10:13.756 --> 00:10:16.890
-The Global Lives collective is
made up volunteer filmmakers,

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.570
photographers, designers,
architects, and everyday people

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.420
from all over the world who
are dedicated to sharing

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.169
culture and crossing
cultural boundaries.

00:10:26.169 --> 00:10:28.460
-There's so many ways and
opportunities to get involved

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.730
with the Global Lives Project.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:33.120
Even just coming to our
website and helping tag videos,

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.470
there's plenty of opportunities
to use our resources

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:38.634
and engage in that,
and contribute to that.

00:10:38.634 --> 00:10:46.930
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:57.690
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.440
DAVID EVAN HARRIS: So
another big question

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.230
that we're asking
through Global Lives

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.460
is what could global
empathy look like?

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.540
What would it really mean
to be able to empathize

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.330
with a person who lives on
the other side of the world?

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.550
And a model that we
use, and something

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.260
that we've been saying
for about 10 years now,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.940
is step out of your world.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.450
This is really the
request that Global Lives

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.130
makes of you as a
viewer and a visitor

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:26.420
to our exhibits to really use
these videos as an opportunity

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.360
to step out of your
everyday experience

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.310
and imagine yourself into
the life of another person

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.680
that you otherwise
couldn't have known.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.900
So this is a timeline of
what we've been up to.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.260
Steve actually covered some
of this in the introduction.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:43.940
But we have produced 20
videos of the daily life

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:48.550
of individuals in 17 different
countries around the world.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:50.940
And we've been exhibiting
that in all sorts of venues

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.990
ranging from museums
to galleries to schools

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:55.980
all over the world.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.720
So the first shoot that we did
was in 2004, as I mentioned.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.110
And it's been climbing since.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:05.580
And when you open up the
brochure that I gave everyone,

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.320
you'll see that the
shoots are divided

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.690
into two sets of series.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:11.740
And one is the first
10 videos, which we

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.340
produced between 2004 and 2009.

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.330
And those have a
little 10 next to them.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.890
And the others that have a
cable car icon next to them

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:21.120
are from our Lives
in Transit series.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.240
And the Lives in Transit series
is about transportation workers

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.440
all over the world.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.190
And again, all of these videos
are featured in the exhibit.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:30.450
And I'll be really happy
to take you over there

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.190
after this for a tour.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:35.060
So since this is potentially
a technical crowd,

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:38.640
I wanted to get to some of
the math and the numbers

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.750
behind Global Lives.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.740
So this is actually
a spreadsheet

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.980
that we used to
figure out who we

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.140
wanted to videotape in
different parts of the world.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.410
But we actually did some
work with at the time

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.140
a Google employee
who volunteered

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.590
to do an animation
for us to explain

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.150
how we pick different
people in different places.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.670
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:59.190
-The Global Lives
Project set out

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:02.010
to document 24 hours
in the daily life

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.260
of 10 people who
roughly represent

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.002
the diversity of humanity.

00:13:08.002 --> 00:13:10.736
-From the most intimate to
the most mundane moments,

00:13:10.736 --> 00:13:13.445
our crews patiently
watched, turning themselves

00:13:13.445 --> 00:13:17.810
over to the pace and rhythms
of lives not their own.

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:18.990
-Geography.

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:22.590
61% percent of the world's
population lives in Asia.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:25.680
So we selected six Asians,
and one person each

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.520
from the other four major world
regions-- North America, South

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.140
America, Africa, and Europe.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.000
-We also learned that more than
half the world lives in cities.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.300
So we chose five urban
and five rural people.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.830
-Income.

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.230
We conducted detailed
economic research

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:46.360
to select 10 people whose
earnings roughly represent

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.800
global income distribution.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.533
-Gender.

00:13:49.533 --> 00:13:50.240
Half men.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.500
Half women.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.400
-Religion.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.960
The actual religious
distribution of the planet.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.142
-Age.

00:14:00.142 --> 00:14:02.730
The actual age
distribution of the planet.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:06.976
Six of the 10 people
are under 30 years old.

00:14:06.976 --> 00:14:08.400
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.260
DAVID EVAN HARRIS:
So those animations

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.760
came out of this
spreadsheet, again.

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.170
So what we tried to do is
we developed this concept

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.710
of a representativity score.

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:20.420
And this is actually
something that

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.700
came from an idea in a
conversation I had with Loren

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.310
Carpenter, who's one of
the founders of Pixar,

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.500
and invented the software
called RenderMan.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.824
And I told him, Loren, we're
about to finish our 10th shoot.

00:14:30.824 --> 00:14:32.740
But we want to keep doing
more of these shoots

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:33.531
all over the world.

00:14:33.531 --> 00:14:35.120
And we want to
stick to this idea.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.080
And he said, oh, David.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.330
It's a simple problem.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.975
All you need to do is create a
seven dimensional million cell

00:14:39.975 --> 00:14:41.470
by million cell matrix.

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:43.630
And then in that
matrix, you'll be

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.625
able to maximize the
distance between all

00:14:46.625 --> 00:14:49.000
the different points in each
of the different dimensions.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.931
And just write an algorithm.

00:14:50.931 --> 00:14:52.180
And then it will all work out.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.760
And it will guide how you
keep adding to the collection.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.630
And so we're in the process
of implementing Loren's idea

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.190
through first a set
of spreadsheets,

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.080
and eventually we hope
an online tool that

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.490
will allow people to come
to our website and say,

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:05.830
I'd like to produce a
new Global Lives shoot.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:10.500
How can I propose a person who
adds the most representativity

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.670
to the Global Lives collection?

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.480
So that's not the
only way that I've

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.340
been involved with really
technical communities

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.970
in the Global Lives work.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.950
As I was developing this
group-- and now so we

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:25.750
call the group of people who've
contributed to Global Lives

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:27.350
the Global Lives Collective.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:31.360
And as I was experiencing
the growth of this collective

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.600
beyond the size of most arts
collective that you hear about

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.990
in the world, I started to look
to other domains for examples.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:40.160
And one of those was
open source software.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.970
Have any of you
contributed to Debian,

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:46.850
or been involved with the Debian
Linux distribution community?

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:48.580
Anyone know what Debian is?

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:49.080
OK.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.400
We have some nods.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.500
So Debian is a really
interesting open source

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.370
community that doesn't have a
strong hierarchical leadership

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:59.450
structure, and at the same time,
continues to produce a really

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:01.200
important Linux distribution.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.080
And so I looked at Debian.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.490
I looked at Creative
Commons, which

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:08.605
is an organization that
produces licenses for art

00:16:08.605 --> 00:16:10.420
and creative content
that are very much

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:14.280
inspired by and analogous to
open source software licenses.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.010
And in many ways,
Global Lives is

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:20.660
taking that ethos of open source
that is behind open source

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.920
software, behind
Wikipedia, and taking that

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.540
to the world of film through
licenses like Creative Commons.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.760
So we do our
exhibits in all sorts

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.570
of different shapes and sizes.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:31.950
These are just a few examples.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.220
We've done circular exhibits.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.230
We've done square exhibits.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.760
And we've done exhibits
with projectors, with TVs.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.120
This is the exhibit
that's here at Google.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.780
And again, I'd be really
happy to invite all of you

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.960
on a tour of that exhibit
as soon as the talk is over.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.440
And it's not far from here.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.650
Now that same exhibit has spent
time at schools like this one.

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:55.450
This is Envision
Academy, a public school

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:56.670
in downtown Oakland.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:59.730
And we've taken the exhibit
to dozens of schools.

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:01.692
Sometimes schools
use our equipment.

00:17:01.692 --> 00:17:03.900
And sometimes schools put
together their own exhibits

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.050
using their own equipment.

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:07.470
There was a school in
India two years ago

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:10.010
that actually had 10
projectors, and brought them

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:12.859
all into their gymnasium,
projected on the walls,

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:16.329
and had a 24-hour marathon
video watching session

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:17.829
where it was a
boarding school where

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:19.245
the students brought
sleeping bags

00:17:19.245 --> 00:17:21.640
and watched for
the full 24 hours.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.660
So we really encourage people
to build their own exhibits.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.970
So a lot of the filmmakers
that have been involved

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:32.520
with Global Lives have been able
to benefit from a production

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.790
guide that we produced at
the beginning of our Lives

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:35.660
in Transit series.

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:40.430
We really wanted to standardize
this methodology for producing

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.930
films.

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:43.750
So the guide goes
through every aspect

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.570
of how to produce a 24-hour
shoot with one person.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.800
From pre-production,
identifying the person,

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.680
getting to know the community,
building a strong relationship,

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.700
to the day of production, to
microphones, to batteries,

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:55.510
et cetera.

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:57.880
And then the whole
post-production process,

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.860
guidelines for file
naming, metadata.

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.860
This stuff is really
important to us.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.280
This is an example of
the equipment checklist

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.070
that you would use to
put together everything

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:08.590
you need to do a shoot.

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:10.820
And it's pretty extensive,
because we really

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.300
want the shoots to succeed.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.330
Some of the filmmakers
have told me afterwards

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.670
that one of the aspects of doing
a Global Lives shoot that they

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:22.500
like is the technical
challenge of actually producing

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.230
24 continuous hours
of usable video.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:27.530
I have one filmmaker who's
also a marathon runner.

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:30.840
And he said it's a very
similar experience, actually.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.440
And there's a lot of
teamwork in there too.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.046
So our website, we actually--
going back to the theme

00:18:37.046 --> 00:18:40.800
we mentioned earlier-- Global
Lives predated web video

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:41.860
as we know it, basically.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.290
When we were starting
this project,

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:47.280
people were still emailing
WMV files to each other.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.900
And it was a different time.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:52.610
I originally intended this
work as a video installation.

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:56.050
But as the web evolved, first
from being our primary medium

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:57.790
for communication
between filmmakers

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:01.740
around the world into a place
to share about the work we were

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.990
doing, it eventually
evolved into being

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:06.075
one of the primary
ways-- actually I

00:19:06.075 --> 00:19:09.160
should say the biggest way that
people experience Global Lives

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.820
videos is through our website.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.500
So on the website you can
explore the collection

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.250
through a grid, or
also through a map that

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:17.220
shows you the relationships
and the connections

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.460
between different people.

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.550
And we're always looking for
ways to improve the website.

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:24.570
So if any of you are
excited about using

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:27.454
your technical skills for
this, please, please let me

00:19:27.454 --> 00:19:28.120
know afterwards.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.350
I would love to really
have your input.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:35.190
So I wanted to get into a
couple of the actual people.

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.050
So this is Seunghwan.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:39.130
And he's part of our
Lives in Transit series.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:41.700
He actually lives in the
neighborhood of Gangnam,

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.190
that probably all of
you have heard of, known

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:47.890
for Gangnam style, the song,
in Seoul, in South Korea.

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:50.980
And he works for a
company called Any Man.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.200
He rides a motorcycle around
Seoul and delivers things.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.630
He assembles a chandelier.

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:57.620
He does all kinds of
different odd jobs

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.200
over the course of his day.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.070
This is Ivan.

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:04.240
He is a horse cart driver
in Cali, in Colombia.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.545
And you can see the crew
riding the horse cart.

00:20:06.545 --> 00:20:10.800
It's hard to get a stable image
from the back of a horse cart.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.520
But you can see they're
using a Steadicam rig there

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.180
that's shoulder mounted.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.560
And then this is Laura.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.570
She's a traveling circus
performer in Spain.

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:22.210
And the form of transit
that she's involved in

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:24.560
is the transit of
an entire circus.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.830
This is definitely
a popular one.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:28.620
And this is Ruixian.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:32.150
And she is a long distance
train worker in China.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:35.510
And so she actually spends
most of the 24 hours

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:38.880
actually on a moving
train during the shoot.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.300
And then this is Mingmar.

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:44.690
And he is a caterpillar
fungus harvester in Nepal.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:46.630
And the form of transit
that he's involved in

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:47.550
is actually his feet.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:50.780
He hikes for about a week
and a half in each direction

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.780
to this remote area
of the Himalayas

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.620
where he collects this extremely
valuable fungus that grows

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.610
on the backs of caterpillar.

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:00.950
So again, I gave you
all the brochure.

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:03.450
And you can read more about
each of them, and even more

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:04.590
on our website.

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.190
I have exciting news.

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:10.460
Global Lives has been accepted
into the New York Film Festival

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.690
for 2016.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:13.400
So Lives in Transit.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.620
We're wrapping up
post-production on that.

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.930
What you're seeing is
a work-in-progress view

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:20.190
of the Lives in Transit series.

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:22.670
So Lives in Transit
will premiere globally

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:25.730
at Lincoln Center in
September of next year.

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:28.620
And there are a lot of people
in the Google New York office

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.870
who are actually excited
about being involved in that,

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:34.330
perhaps having this exhibit
go to Google in New York

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:36.240
before that.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:41.270
So I want to actually show a
clip from our shoot in Vietnam

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:44.410
before I bring up Naomi,
one of our filmmakers.

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:46.300
But before I do
that, I owe a couple

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.100
of really big thank yous to
the GO Arts program, and Janice

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.600
[INAUDIBLE], who was the curator
who brought the Global Lives

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.650
exhibit to Building 43.

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:59.615
Esther Wojcicki, who's on our
advisory council for Global

00:21:59.615 --> 00:22:02.491
Lives, and was a big part
of bringing the exhibit here

00:22:02.491 --> 00:22:02.990
as well.

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:05.395
Of course, Steve and his
Steve' wife, Mary Grove,

00:22:05.395 --> 00:22:08.070
have been talking about
doing this exhibit with me

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:09.100
for about four years.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.170
It's been a long road.

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:13.960
We benefit a lot as well from
the Google Reach Local program,

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.385
which is soon to be
Google Local Leadership.

00:22:16.385 --> 00:22:18.992
We met a team of three
Googler volunteers

00:22:18.992 --> 00:22:21.450
a couple weeks ago that actually
helped build that exhibit,

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:23.510
and did lot of work
on audio editing

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:25.880
and getting footage
onto our website.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.740
And then also a
really big thanks

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.700
to Rosa Wu, who is
standing in the back there.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.580
So Rosa is a Googler, and a
member of the Global Lives

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:33.760
board of directors.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:39.180
And she is also equipped with
a donation-accepting computer

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.700
if you want to make a
contribution this holiday

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:42.780
season to Global Lives.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:46.350
And it will be doubled
by your employer, Google.

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:50.781
So with that, let me show you
some footage from Vietnam.

00:22:50.781 --> 00:22:52.739
And then we'll talk a
little bit more about it.

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:06.980
[SPEAKING VIETNAMESE]

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.240
STEVE GROVE: Great.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.250
Thank you, David.

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:54.290
Naomi, why don't you
come up and join us.

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:55.581
Round of applause for the film.

00:25:55.581 --> 00:26:00.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:03.310
So David, let's start with you.

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:06.030
Going back to 2004, what
gave you the inspiration

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:08.055
to start this whole thing?

00:26:08.055 --> 00:26:09.930
DAVID EVAN HARRIS: So
actually it was in 2002

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:10.850
that I had the idea.

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:12.780
I was in college.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.180
And I was traveling
as part of a study

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.670
abroad program where I
had this amazing luck

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:20.694
to be able to live in
five different countries

00:26:20.694 --> 00:26:21.860
over the course of the year.

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:25.910
And I went to Tanzania, India,
the Philippines, Mexico,

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:27.000
and the UK.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.370
I lived in a bamboo
house in the Philippines.

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:32.560
I lived in a former squatter
settlement in Mexico City.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.600
I lived in a mansion with
five servants in New Delhi.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.740
And that experience is
something I really want

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:40.000
to share with other people.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.300
And I then went on to get a
graduate degree in sociology.

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:47.970
But I was feeling like in my
writing, my academic writing,

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:50.950
it wasn't really getting
across just what you

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:53.640
can gain from really
spending time one-on-one

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.370
or in someone's home
with another person.

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:57.500
So I wanted to share that.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.110
That's really where
the idea came from.

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:01.710
It was a very long process.

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:03.400
But that's how we
arrived at that.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:07.509
But still every week we get
inquiries through our website

00:27:07.509 --> 00:27:09.050
from filmmakers that
want to continue

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:10.870
adding to the collection.

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:15.150
And we're looking for ways to
find the resources to continue

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:16.882
producing more and more video.

00:27:16.882 --> 00:27:19.340
STEVE GROVE: Naomi, we just
saw a clip from your experience

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:19.680
in Vietnam.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.740
How long ago was that?

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.200
NAOMI TURE: That was like, 2003.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.100
STEVE GROVE: 2003.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:23.820
OK.

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:24.890
So you're a filmmaker.

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:27.070
Your traditional process
of filmmaking, I'm sure,

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:28.380
is documentary style.

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:28.880
You shoot.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.387
You stop.

00:27:29.387 --> 00:27:30.470
You take a drink of water.

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:31.420
You keep going.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:32.380
This is very different.

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.860
You filmed for 24
hours straight.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:34.982
Tell us what that's like.

00:27:34.982 --> 00:27:35.690
NAOMI TURE: Yeah.

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:37.189
So I think we
mentioned this before.

00:27:37.189 --> 00:27:40.960
But it's really kind of the
ultimate filmmaking challenge.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.790
It's like endurance filmmaking.

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:51.750
So obviously preparation is
months and months in advance,

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:53.430
as in any documentary.

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:57.224
But this is a
logistical challenge.

00:27:57.224 --> 00:27:58.640
STEVE GROVE: And
is it you holding

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.380
the camera the entire time?

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.493
Like you personally are holding
one camera for 24 hours?

00:28:03.493 --> 00:28:04.243
NAOMI TURE: So no.

00:28:04.243 --> 00:28:05.450
So we definitely had a team.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:08.040
So I had a team of seven people.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.770
Four of us were actually
holding the camera.

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:13.080
The cinematographers.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.310
And the rest are just support.

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:18.690
And so logistically,
the way we do it

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:22.250
is actually Alfred
Hitchcock style.

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:25.540
So we want the
experience for the viewer

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:30.430
to feel as though it's a
constant-- we're filming

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:34.820
from when they go to sleep,
their entire sleep, turning

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:35.810
around in sleep.

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:36.500
They wake up.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.590
They brush their teeth.

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:38.900
They wash their face.

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.090
They're exhausted.

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:42.860
And then they finally get
their caffeine or whatever they

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:45.780
need for the morning and go.

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:50.430
So because we're filming
every single possible minute,

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:52.610
and no camera in the world
can film for 24 hours.

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:54.700
There's no card.

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:58.490
Well, actually there
are ways to do that.

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:01.175
But what we needed was, you
need at least two cameras

00:29:01.175 --> 00:29:02.700
and at least two
camera operators.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.720
So you're constantly signaling
to the other camera operator

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.130
and switching cameras.

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:13.600
And in order to kind of
transition to the next thing,

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:16.470
you'll move the camera
to maybe a black space

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:18.370
while the next person
begins filming.

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:18.890
STEVE GROVE: What
do you do about

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:20.022
like showers and bathrooms?

00:29:20.022 --> 00:29:21.980
I mean, these people are
living an actual life.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:24.420
So doing things they probably
don't want on camera,

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:24.930
obviously.

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:25.638
NAOMI TURE: Yeah.

00:29:25.638 --> 00:29:28.120
We give very little privacy.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.110
But when they do
go to the bathroom,

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:37.600
then we do allow them to
go behind the closed doors.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.650
STEVE GROVE: We have
this too, if you wanna.

00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:41.400
NAOMI TURE: On the
boat in Vietnam though,

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.860
the bathroom is open to the sky.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:46.400
So all of us, crew, onscreen
participant, all of us

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:52.270
had to just go in a box
that then would flush right

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:55.920
into the river, which you then
later on pulled up the river

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.451
water to wash the dishes.

00:29:58.451 --> 00:30:00.111
STEVE GROVE: Fascinating.

00:30:00.111 --> 00:30:01.360
So you're given an assignment.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.200
Tell me how it works.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.658
You're given an assignment from
David and team, or whoever,

00:30:04.658 --> 00:30:05.610
to go to Vietnam.

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:08.010
How early in advance--
are you like contacting

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:11.940
a potential subject of your
film months in advance?

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:14.565
Or how does this work in terms
of approaching the people

00:30:14.565 --> 00:30:15.440
you're gonna profile?

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.148
NAOMI TURE: Yeah.

00:30:16.148 --> 00:30:19.179
So I was actually behind
the scenes for six years

00:30:19.179 --> 00:30:20.720
before I actually
became a filmmaker.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.900
So I was on the board, on
the production committee,

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.740
and looking at
all the proposals.

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:27.410
So yeah, it's month in advance.

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:29.940
Every proposals
and actual specific

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:35.020
person that you've researched,
that the team in that area.

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:39.500
So my team in Ho Chi Minh City
drove down to rural Vietnam,

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:43.580
right below [INAUDIBLE]
in My Khanh village,

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.140
found someone who's
willing to participate.

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:50.440
And then we assemble.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.910
STEVE GROVE: I'm interested
in the willing to participate

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:53.910
moment.

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:56.890
This woman, Huyen, from
the film that you profiled.

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:59.180
What's the pitch look like?

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:01.810
And what kind of
reactions did you get?

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:05.330
NAOMI TURE: So actually I
was able to see her reaction,

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:08.370
because we lost our
participant a day

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:09.990
before we were about to film.

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:14.030
So we had motorbiked across the
whole city of Ho Chi Minh City,

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:17.010
gathered all of our equipment,
had the production van.

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:20.200
We were ready to go
down, called [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.930
who was our original
participant.

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:25.380
And he said, oh, I'm
really, really sick.

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.760
And I can't participate.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.140
And I've been sent home.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:32.170
So I'm no longer on
the boat anymore.

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:34.600
And so we drove
down to [INAUDIBLE],

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:38.890
which is the largest city
in the Mekong River delta

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:41.480
region in Vietnam to
find another participant.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:45.480
And so we split up into
teams of people, each one

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:47.700
with a Vietnamese local.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:51.530
And we went from boat
to boat asking, hey,

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:54.650
would you be willing to be
filmed for 24 hours tomorrow

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:57.270
morning starting at 5:00 AM?

00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:00.250
And so of course, that's
an interesting question.

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:04.180
And I think the response
was always positive

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:07.590
because people are
interested in revealing

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:08.810
something of themselves.

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:09.310
You know.

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:16.830
And I think we all want
to share in this idea

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:19.260
of like kind of
global connectedness

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.520
and global empathy.

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:24.670
And so we had a lot
of positive responses.

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:27.580
The issue was that we
had to find someone

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:31.100
of a certain age demographic, of
a certain religion, et cetera.

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:32.600
STEVE GROVE: David,
do you find this

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.820
to be true in most of the
situations in which you're

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:38.630
filming these 24-hour shoot,
that people are surprisingly

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:40.540
willing to do it?

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:42.340
DAVID EVAN HARRIS:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.530
That's a question that comes up.

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:48.820
And another piece of it
is that the filmmakers are

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:50.200
surprisingly willing to do it.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:54.070
The filmmakers-- Naomi
volunteered her time.

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:57.690
And she, like many of
our other filmmakers,

00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:59.730
went to some significant
personal expense

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:02.330
to be able to produce
a Global Lives shoot.

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:06.480
And in many ways this is just
a scaled-up version of someone

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.730
who's a really passionate
Wikipedia contributor

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:10.450
and spends months
writing articles.

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:10.950
Right?

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:13.990
It's someone who
believes in the totality

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:15.430
of this global project.

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:17.140
And so they're
willing to really put

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:21.020
a lot of blood, sweat, and
tears, and sometimes money

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:21.660
into that.

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:25.567
And I think that the
onscreen participants, which

00:33:25.567 --> 00:33:27.900
is the name we use for the
people whose lives we record,

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:29.710
we say that because
they are really

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:35.960
participating by giving us their
life and access to their life.

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.720
I think all of
them that I've met,

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.890
and the ones that I've
heard about and talked to,

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:44.340
and heard interviews
with, I think

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:47.520
have an understanding of
what Global Lives is about.

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:51.000
I think it helps that we're
a nonprofit organization,

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.520
that we're independent, that
we use the Creative Commons

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.530
licenses, that all of
the video that we produce

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:57.470
can be watched for
free on the internet.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.670
And I think they
understand that they're

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:01.819
contributing to something.

00:34:01.819 --> 00:34:03.610
STEVE GROVE: Please
join me with questions.

00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:04.535
Justin.

00:34:04.535 --> 00:34:06.410
AUDIENCE: I imagine it's
pretty wild for them

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.841
to have somebody sort of
arrive at their community,

00:34:08.841 --> 00:34:10.507
especially with
equipment in their face.

00:34:10.507 --> 00:34:11.882
What is that sort
of relationship

00:34:11.882 --> 00:34:14.644
like as you arrived
to them [INAUDIBLE],

00:34:14.644 --> 00:34:16.500
having to spend a
lot of time together?

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:17.320
NAOMI TURE: Yeah.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:17.460
No.

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:19.001
That's a really
interesting question,

00:34:19.001 --> 00:34:20.929
because within the
course of 24 hours,

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:23.210
there is an intimacy
that develops.

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:26.900
So it's filmmaker
and participants

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.050
don't know each other at first.

00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:29.550
Right?

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:31.750
And we come in.

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:33.679
There's maybe a little
bit of awkwardness

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:37.560
in having a camera pointed
at you for hours and hours

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:38.290
upon time.

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:40.159
But after a certain
amount of time,

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:42.489
and it might be
three or four hours,

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:44.239
you kind of get lost in the day.

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:47.590
So you stop thinking about the
fact that you are filmmaker,

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:50.134
and you are observing someone.

00:34:50.134 --> 00:34:52.800
And they stop thinking about the
fact that they're being filmed.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.684
And it becomes this kind of
natural day that progresses.

00:34:56.684 --> 00:34:57.490
It has to.

00:34:57.490 --> 00:35:01.660
You cannot act in front
of a film for 24 hours.

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:04.940
And then during
that course of time,

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.850
there is subtle
communications that

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:09.840
happen, because
we never use words

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.677
between the filmmaker
and the participant,

00:35:11.677 --> 00:35:13.010
because we're just filming them.

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:14.720
We are kind of a
fly on the wall.

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:18.560
But at the same time, there's
subtle things that happen.

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.390
So for example, Huyen
was cooking lunch.

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:22.550
You know, I was filming.

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:24.330
I had an assistant
right next to me.

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:26.580
And as she began
eating, she actually

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:29.940
filled another bowl with rice
and tuna, with fish sauce,

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:32.105
and she kind of
handed it towards us.

00:35:32.105 --> 00:35:34.230
It was one of those moments
where you kind of break

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:36.730
the barrier of filmmaker
and participant.

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:38.540
And it was really beautiful.

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:42.510
By the end of it, we hadn't
spoken much to each other.

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:43.590
But we were hugging.

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:45.470
We felt like we were
part of her family.

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:46.010
Everything.

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:47.290
Almost crying.

00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:50.660
And it's just 24 hours that
you spend with this person.

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:53.930
But you become very close in
this very interesting way.

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:55.100
STEVE GROVE: How well do you
think you got to know her?

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.850
I mean, how well do
you think you can say,

00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:59.720
I feel like I know who this
person is after 24 hours?

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:05.070
NAOMI TURE: I mean, do
we know anyone that well?

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:07.530
I think what it is is
you get to know someone

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:12.140
well enough that the kind
of ideological boundaries

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:15.730
or the cultural differences
kind of start bleeding away.

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:17.190
And it's like, OK.

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:19.730
It's enough to make that
personal connection,

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:23.060
that personal leap of stepping
out of your own reality

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:24.579
into someone else's reality.

00:36:24.579 --> 00:36:26.870
DAVID EVAN HARRIS: And that's
actually part of the goal

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:29.450
is when you come to a
Global Lives exhibit

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:31.680
or you come to our
website, that you

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.880
have an experience of seeing a
lot, and hopefully seeing a lot

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.340
that that's not familiar to you.

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:39.110
But also you leave
the exhibit, or you

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:41.910
leave the website knowing that
you haven't seen everything,

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:44.510
and that you couldn't
possibly see all of it.

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:49.610
And in many ways that's the
type of attitude about the world

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:53.260
that we hope to bring,
which is a curiosity,

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.640
a desire to learn more.

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.370
But a certain
humility and knowledge

00:36:57.370 --> 00:37:00.460
that there's a whole lot
more that you really don't

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:01.580
know and can't know.

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:02.846
But it's still worth trying.

00:37:02.846 --> 00:37:04.470
STEVE GROVE: How many
folks in the room

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:06.960
would agree to have your
life filmed for 24 hours?

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:10.299
Roughly half.

00:37:10.299 --> 00:37:12.340
DAVID EVAN HARRIS: We're
going to take your names

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:14.460
on the sign up sheet.

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:15.830
STEVE GROVE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:18.272
AUDIENCE: First of all,
this is a incredible way

00:37:18.272 --> 00:37:19.644
to extend empathy.

00:37:19.644 --> 00:37:21.060
Really impressed
with the project.

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.470
This is the first time
I'm hearing about it.

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:26.100
VR is increasingly being
spoken of as a tool

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:28.740
from a storytelling
perspective to extend empathy.

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:31.800
And I think a really great
example, a recent great example

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:34.950
of that is "The New York
Times" documentary "Displaced."

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:38.580
Is that something that you guys
have thought about going into?

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:41.910
And if so, what would
that look like in terms

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:43.720
of the video installation?

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:46.860
DAVID EVAN HARRIS: So we set a
standard about seven years ago

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:52.380
that we only do shoots in
high definition, 1080p film.

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:55.820
And we might have set that a
little bit early in the sense

00:37:55.820 --> 00:38:00.300
that it was kind of a challenge
in places like rural Indonesia

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:03.430
to find at that point
seven years ago,

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:06.790
eight years ago, a camera that
could shoot at that level.

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:11.240
And so today, setting a standard
and using our current structure

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.140
of being a really
volunteer-driven network

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:18.060
of filmmakers around the world,
doing a series shot all in VR

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:21.790
would be, I think, not
possible with this community.

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:24.240
However, if there
were a very generous,

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:26.250
well-resourced
company that wanted

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:29.860
to give us a lot of
cameras and probably

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:32.810
a lot of technical support
and stitching software,

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:35.800
and then probably Cloud-based
stitching to put together

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:40.440
all of this, and if there were
a platform capable of stitching

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:47.950
together a 16 GoPro
array-based 24-hour long shoot,

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:49.950
I think it would crash systems.

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:51.860
I don't think it's
doable right now.

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.310
But I'm ready to try.

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:58.651
And I have talked to a few
people at companies like that.

00:38:58.651 --> 00:39:02.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] You
talk about the empathy piece.

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:04.420
And that's really
fascinating to me.

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:07.402
And I think from our
culture, we often

00:39:07.402 --> 00:39:09.110
tend to have this sort
of savior complex,

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:11.360
like, how can I help you.

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:15.330
And I'm curious to know
what out of this project

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:18.031
do we have to learn from
them and other cultures?

00:39:18.031 --> 00:39:19.780
And can you talk to
that piece around sort

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:21.320
of the insights that
come out, and sort

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.111
of like you're discovering
sort of the most

00:39:23.111 --> 00:39:24.840
beautiful pieces of culture.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:30.750
And how can we share that and
take that around the world?

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:31.800
NAOMI TURE: Yeah.

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:35.370
I think just even
from the filming

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:39.600
that I did in
Vietnam-- so one thing

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.480
that we really try
to do-- and I'm

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.230
unique in that I went
to Vietnam to film.

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:46.060
But I filmed with a local crew.

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:48.240
So what Global
Lives attempts to do

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.860
is get a crew situated
already in that country

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:54.700
to film a participant
within the country.

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.590
So I think that's
important in that you

00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:59.970
have to kind of understand your
own kind of cultural context.

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:03.290
But then the other
thing is that you

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:07.330
begin questioning your own
assumptions, your own ideology,

00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:08.440
your own culture.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:10.780
So we had been stressed
out on cell phones

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:12.560
like every second of the day.

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.830
We arrive on the boat.

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:19.310
And Huyen and her
brother and the worker,

00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:21.650
they didn't say
anything for an hour.

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:23.760
They're just sitting
helming the boat.

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.130
And that's it.

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:27.480
And so just that
perspective of oh,

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.290
they're not online all the time.

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:31.910
You know, here's a different
perspective of life.

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:35.100
Or her definition
of success isn't

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.100
to reach the top of the ladder.

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:40.310
Her definition of success
is to help her family,

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:42.750
is to be happy, you know?

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:46.840
So I think the
definition of life

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.552
itself is going to be different.

00:40:48.552 --> 00:40:50.010
And that's what
you begin to learn.

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:53.860
And you begin to learn
that you know what?

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:56.740
My world view may
not be important

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.420
when it's put into the
context of someone else's,

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:01.770
or the multiple narratives.

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:03.270
DAVID EVAN HARRIS:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:05.685
So one of the communities
that I didn't mention that

00:41:05.685 --> 00:41:07.560
much so far that's
involved with Global Lives

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.030
is the translators.

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:11.830
We've had about 1,500
volunteer translators

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:14.290
from all over the world that
have contributed their time

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:18.720
to subtitling all of this
500 hours or so of footage

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:19.960
that we produced.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.170
And one of the
translators from Malawi

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:24.760
was actually living in the UK.

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.450
And she sent us a story.

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:30.030
She said that she was raising
a daughter who I think

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:31.460
was around seven years old.

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:34.870
And she would show her daughter
video from the Global Lives

00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:36.960
shoots that she was subtitling.

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.980
The shoot was from
Malawi where she grew up.

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:42.210
And her daughter, I don't
think, had been to Malawi.

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:45.490
And using the videos as a tool
to show her daughter what life

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:48.360
would have been like back home
if she had grown up there,

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.050
which I found was
really touching.

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:53.910
And she also said that for
her, the Global Lives videos

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:56.860
are a way that the
community that she's part of

00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:00.800
can speak to and share
their voice with the world.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.780
And to me that was
really touching.

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:06.310
Now on the education side,
our whole curriculum, again,

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:09.200
designed at the Stanford
Graduate School of Education.

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.480
Steve has a copy right
there behind him.

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.130
And there are some here to grab.

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:14.410
It's called Unheard Stories.

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:15.990
And it's all about
building empathy

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:17.470
through the Global
Lives project.

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:20.520
And this was designed by
a group of grad students,

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.810
that they came up with that
idea to focus on empathy.

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:26.640
They built it around the Common
Core curriculum standards.

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:29.940
And then they came up with
some metrics, which we then

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:32.330
use surveys to
study, to think about

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:35.340
does Global Lives make
students more interested

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:37.060
in learning another language?

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:38.670
Does it make students
more interested

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:41.190
in helping someone who
they see who's in trouble?

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:43.250
Does it make students
feel more like they can

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:45.394
make a difference in the world?

00:42:45.394 --> 00:42:47.310
And so all of those, in
a number of questions,

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:49.040
we're seeing
significant increases

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.870
in before and after
watching the videos.

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:53.650
Now from my perspective,
Global Lives

00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:58.320
is a little more about art
and about asking questions

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:00.550
than increasing
numbers of people

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:01.790
that have certain emotions.

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:04.880
But at the same time, in the
education field which we've now

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.930
dipped our toes, and
increasingly a whole leg

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:11.540
into-- as I fall off the
chair-- those kinds of numbers

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:13.810
and that kind of research
is really important.

00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:16.740
STEVE GROVE: Other questions.

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:17.538
Yeah.

00:43:17.538 --> 00:43:18.972
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:43:18.972 --> 00:43:23.280
Just a question
about the time issue.

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.684
What ideas, or what kind
of vehicles have you used

00:43:26.684 --> 00:43:30.628
to compress that time
[INAUDIBLE] in the life of this

00:43:30.628 --> 00:43:34.840
person and not have to
sit through 24 hours to--

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:37.890
DAVID EVAN HARRIS: So the
shoot that you saw from Vietnam

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:41.920
that Naomi produced, that was
a three-minute summary video

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.070
of the 24 hours in Vietnam.

00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:46.380
So all of the crews
produce a short

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:49.700
that's based on the 24 hours
that we use in situations where

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:53.100
we can't invite someone
into an exhibit.

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:55.040
NAOMI TURE: But I
think even talking

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.790
about that 24-hour
format, I mean,

00:43:56.790 --> 00:44:00.190
that's what's really special
and unique about Global Lives.

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:03.925
And so it's kind of the
purest form of documentary.

00:44:03.925 --> 00:44:05.510
It's unedited.

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:09.040
And so in an installation
format, when you're

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:13.270
stepping inside and seeing the
unraveling of a daily life,

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:16.320
you might come upon a very
mundane moment, you know.

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.970
Someone is just
hiking up a mountain.

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:20.500
Someone else is
brushing their teeth.

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:27.100
And so that forces you to
rethink what narrative is,

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:31.710
and to rethink the fact that
we put a lot of narratives

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:33.940
on everything we
see in the media.

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:34.440
Right?

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:35.939
There's always some
sort of opinion.

00:44:35.939 --> 00:44:40.670
And so this is as pure as
possible in terms of cinema

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:42.440
verite, just unraveling.

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:48.890
And that allows us to ask those
questions and begin dialogue.

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:50.890
STEVE GROVE: So David,
I'm guessing no one other

00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:53.560
than you has seen more of
these films in their entirety

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.880
and had time to think
through what they mean.

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:57.840
I'm curious what you
learned about people

00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:58.870
throughout this project.

00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:59.870
DAVID EVAN HARRIS: Yeah.

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:01.703
So one of the reasons
is-- I've been working

00:45:01.703 --> 00:45:02.930
on Global Lives for 11 years.

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:08.790
And that is a really long time,
especially in our generation.

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:15.500
And the real reason that I keep
with it is watching the footage

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:17.680
is still challenging to me.

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:20.660
When I come to the
exhibit, I still

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.355
almost always see something
new that I haven't seen before,

00:45:23.355 --> 00:45:26.160
or I notice something new
in the piece of the video

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:27.780
that I haven't seen before.

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:31.160
And it's always challenging.

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:35.860
It's always challenging to think
how-- I didn't mention this.

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:38.929
But so Naomi and I met
here in Mountain View.

00:45:38.929 --> 00:45:40.470
We were both living
here at the time.

00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:42.180
I went to Mountain
View High School.

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:46.550
And growing up in
Silicon Valley,

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:48.900
I had a pretty comfortable
existence here.

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:50.760
And I live in San Francisco now.

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:54.170
And I still have a pretty
decent, comfortable life.

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:56.400
And when I watch the
Global Lives footage

00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.610
from around the world,
there's no convincing story

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:04.040
I've come up with to tell
myself about why I deserve all

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.990
of the privilege and the
resources and the comforts

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:08.050
that I have.

00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:12.620
And the reason I keep
doing Global Lives

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:15.950
and trying to bring this footage
to more and more audiences

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:19.190
is because that is
still a challenge to me.

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:23.730
And I think increasingly it's
a conversation with the Occupy

00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:26.290
movement, with the
Ford Foundation just

00:46:26.290 --> 00:46:29.180
announcing that their entire
focus of all their grant-making

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:32.290
is around inequality, with
Barack Obama talking more

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:33.930
and more about
inequality, I think

00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:35.580
that's a conversation
increasingly

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:38.040
we're ready to have as a globe.

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:42.030
But I think it's still a
really important challenge.

00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:43.870
And I hope that
Global Lives provokes

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:47.000
more of those kinds
of conversations.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:47.870
STEVE GROVE: Great.

00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:49.161
Well, we're almost out of time.

00:46:49.161 --> 00:46:51.140
I know that for those
who do have the time

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:52.395
to come over and see
the exhibit live,

00:46:52.395 --> 00:46:54.350
we're gonna do a quick
walkover and a walk through it.

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:55.440
It's fantastic to see.

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.050
Please join us if you can.

00:46:57.050 --> 00:47:00.110
Any final questions
before we wrap?

00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:01.540
Yes.

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:05.380
AUDIENCE: So the thing
about [INAUDIBLE] like pose

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:08.020
a challenge is
measuring the success

00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:10.210
and sharing all of
your documentary,

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:14.790
and just like how you go about--
what metrics you might use.

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:15.790
DAVID EVAN HARRIS: Yeah.

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:18.740
So as I mentioned in
our education program,

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:20.830
we've developed a couple
of different surveys.

00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:24.620
There's actually a movement
within the psychology community

00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:28.720
called positive psychology
that is all about finding ways

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:32.400
to increase the prosocial
behaviors is a term that they

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:37.450
use, between people, and looking
at ways to influence and then

00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:41.440
measure if people are becoming
more empathic and more

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.030
kind to each other.

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:45.200
And so we actually had a
psychology graduate student

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:49.950
at Berkeley develop a survey
to figure out in real terms

00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:53.160
whether the experiences of
watching this footage actually

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.630
draws you out of yourself
and makes you someone who's

00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:57.180
thinking more about others.

00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:00.840
And again, the initial
results are very good.

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:05.840
However, it's really expensive
to do randomized control trials

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.840
in a really systematic way.

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:13.040
And it's also a challenge
because a lot of grant-makers

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:14.629
want to see that
information when

00:48:14.629 --> 00:48:16.420
they're grant-makers
in certain categories.

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:19.730
And we have initially
good results.

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:21.549
But I'm always looking
for ideas and ways

00:48:21.549 --> 00:48:22.590
we can develop that more.

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:24.798
I'm sure there's a way we
could do that with visitors

00:48:24.798 --> 00:48:25.810
to our website too.

00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:27.430
And I haven't gotten around
to implementing that.

00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:29.010
I'd love to hear
more of your ideas

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:31.819
after, if you have them,
about how to do that.

00:48:31.819 --> 00:48:32.610
STEVE GROVE: Great.

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:36.050
Well, David, Naomi, thank you
so much for being with us today.

00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:36.560
Thank you.

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:37.610
Round of applause.

00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:38.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:40.598
STEVE GROVE: Thank you.

00:48:40.598 --> 00:48:41.890
Thank you also for the project.

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:44.056
I think in addition to being
an amazing contribution

00:48:44.056 --> 00:48:46.140
to the film-making, and
the arts, and the culture,

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:47.430
and the education communities.

00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:49.390
It's also just a great
contribution to humanity.

00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:51.098
So thank you for doing
what you're doing.

00:48:51.098 --> 00:48:52.510
And please come back again.

00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:54.010
And for those who
have time, I think

00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:55.095
we're gonna walk over
and actually check out

00:48:55.095 --> 00:48:56.130
the exhibit live.

00:48:56.130 --> 00:48:58.870
DAVID EVAN HARRIS: Well,
thank you so much to Steve

00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:59.817
for hosting us here.

00:48:59.817 --> 00:49:01.150
We really, really appreciate it.

00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:02.480
And to Naomi for joining.

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.980
So big applause for both of you.

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:04.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.071
STEVE GROVE: Great.

00:49:05.071 --> 00:49:06.430
Thanks, guys.
