00:00:01.543 --> 00:00:02.836
Um, This is pretty amazing.

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:04.713
CUSTOMER: So this is
a rare find, then?

00:00:04.713 --> 00:00:06.881
Well, that's if it's real.

00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:08.299
CUSTOMER: 400?

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:09.676
I'm looking online, this
thing is worth $1,000!

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.010
Were you able to sell
into your computer?

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:18.351
RICK (VOICEOVER): A guy brought
in an extremely rare 1861 Half

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:20.019
Eagle.

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.147
That is if it's one of the
few minted in North Carolina.

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:24.774
So I called in my coin guy,
Mike, to take a closer look.

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:26.776
Just to make sure it's
not a counterfeit.

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:28.027
MIKE: What's up, Rick?

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:30.071
RICK: 1861 Charlotte.

00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:31.948
MIKE: That's a rare one.

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:35.869
1861 Philadelphia, there
was over 700,000 of those.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:39.205
We're talking five,
six hundred bucks.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:43.168
With a "C," we're
talking a whole lot more.

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:44.878
20 times as much.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.463
CUSTOMER: That's good news.
That's great news.

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:48.173
MIKE: Yes, yes, absolutely.

00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:50.049
CUSTOMER: So this is
a rare find, then?

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:52.469
Well, that's if it's real.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.345
I'd like to take a look
at the mint mark and--

00:00:54.345 --> 00:00:55.305
Oh, a-- absolutely.

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:55.847
OK.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.934
RICK: How's it look?

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:06.900
After looking at it, yes,
I believe that it is a, uh,

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.277
authentic Charlotte minted coin.

00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:11.488
That's awesome, awesome news.

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:13.531
COREY: So, what's it worth?

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:14.866
You could get about 15,000--

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:15.658
Wow.

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:16.618
--for this coin.

00:01:16.618 --> 00:01:17.911
All right, beat it Mike.

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.078
MIKE: (LAUGHS) Hey,
nice to meet you.

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:20.038
CUSTOMER: No, hey thank you.

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:20.914
Yeah, thank you so much.

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:22.081
Good luck, guys.

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:23.625
What do-- What
do you want to do?

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:27.295
$7,500.

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:28.671
Mm, no.

00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:29.756
12.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.966
I think you'll do just fine.

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:34.135
RICK: I still have
to send this off.

00:01:34.135 --> 00:01:36.304
Things can pop up
when I send it off.

00:01:36.304 --> 00:01:38.097
I end up assuming all the risk.

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:40.600
Let's somewhat
split the difference.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.935
How about 95?

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.645
I'll go eight grand,
not a penny more.

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:44.646
I'm good.

00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:46.105
Eight grand.
- All right.

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:47.398
Good doing business.

00:01:47.398 --> 00:01:48.608
COREY: Come on man,
I'll write you up

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:49.943
You got it.
All right, thank you.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:50.735
CUSTOMER: How are you?

00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:52.070
RICK: Pretty good.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.947
I have a coin from
the Byzantine Empire

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.573
I'd like to sell.

00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:57.867
RICK: Um, this is
pretty amazing.

00:01:57.867 --> 00:01:59.369
Where in the world
did you get this?

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.830
CUSTOMER: I actually
bought a group of books

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.999
from an antique store a while
back, and in one of them,

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:06.918
that was actually
inside the spine.

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:08.294
How much do you want for it?

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.839
CUSTOMER: I was
thinking about $1,900.

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:13.716
I'll give you like
800 bucks for it.

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:15.134
Nah, that-- that's
a little bit too low.

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:18.054
I mean, th-- that's
a thousand years old.

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:20.974
Can you do like, 16?

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.725
RICK: I'll go $1,100.

00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:24.811
11?

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:26.104
Yeah, I guess we can do 11.

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:27.480
OK, $1,100.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.107
All right, I'll meet
you right over there.

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:30.775
RICK (VOICEOVER): My go-to
guy for ancient coins, Dave,

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:32.735
is here to give me
a grade and a price.

00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:33.444
Hey man.

00:02:33.444 --> 00:02:34.362
How you been?

00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:35.864
RICK: Good.

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:37.156
Here's the coin.

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:38.741
Ah, it's fantastic.

00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:42.161
This is a coin of the Byzantine
Emperor Constantine IX.

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:45.248
He's on the reverse,
and Jesus Christ

00:02:45.248 --> 00:02:46.708
is on the obverse, the front.

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:49.586
So is it the real deal, or?

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:50.837
DAVE: Looks good.

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.338
RICK: Big question.
What's it worth?

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:55.675
DAVE: These are not
always worth what

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:57.468
people might think they are.

00:02:57.468 --> 00:02:58.970
OK.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.264
I see these going
typically, in the marketplace

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:05.727
today, for between 700 and
$1,000 in this condition.

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:06.895
RICK: That's it?

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:08.646
DAVE: It should be
worth thousands.

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:11.107
And I think you just ran into
a market that, at present, is

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:12.901
terribly undervalued.

00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:14.193
RICK: All right.

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:16.070
Not the news I was
exactly looking for.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.697
Lesson learned, I'll call
you next time. (LAUGHS)

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:18.698
Yeah, call me first.

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:19.949
All right, thanks man.

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:21.409
Thank you.
COREY: What you got?

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.370
It's an 1874 chop
marked trade dollar.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.705
COREY: So, where'd
you get this at, man?

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:28.333
Actually, I got it
at a coin trade show

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:31.044
in California a few years
back, up in San Francisco.

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:32.378
OK.

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:34.088
The whole reason these
things came about

00:03:34.088 --> 00:03:35.882
is because China, and a bunch
of other countries in Asia,

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:38.051
they didn't like our
currency when we would go

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.302
over there and trade with them.

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:40.595
But believe it or
not they actually

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:41.971
liked the Mexican
peso more because it

00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:43.640
had more silver in it.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.099
We started making these, we
put a little bit more silver

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.643
in them so they
would actually prefer

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:48.227
these over the Mexican peso.

00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:50.021
They would take them and
they would take a little tool

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.814
and they'd put a
chop mark in it.

00:03:51.814 --> 00:03:54.233
And that's how they kind of
tested the silver in them.

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:56.653
They were never meant to
get into the hands of normal

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:58.154
consumers in the United States.

00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:00.365
But what ended up
happening is, you know,

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:02.116
silver prices started
to really fall

00:04:02.116 --> 00:04:05.787
so China threw all their old
trade dollars on some ships

00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:07.246
and brought them into
the United States

00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:08.164
and traded them for gold.

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:09.499
CUSTOMER: OK.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:10.375
So what do you want
to do with it, man?

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.126
It's time to sell it.

00:04:12.126 --> 00:04:15.588
All right, uh, I'd be willing
to give you around $400 for it.

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:17.006
400?

00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:18.424
I'm looking online, this
thing's worth $1,000!

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:20.677
Were you able to sell
it to your computer?

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:22.804
CUSTOMER: I mean, can
you come up a little bit?

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:25.264
Like, at least 800.

00:04:25.264 --> 00:04:28.643
COREY: I'll go like 450, man.

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:30.103
750.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:32.397
The problem is, is
that it's chop marked.

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:35.692
There's a big debate on whether
or not a chop mark is just

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:37.694
part of the coin's
history, or if it's

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:40.905
just damage that was done to the
coin by the Chinese government.

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:45.702
Uh, that being said, the most
I'm gonna go is $500, dude.

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:48.663
Well, $500?

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:50.248
500.

00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:52.041
Come with me,
we'll write you up.
