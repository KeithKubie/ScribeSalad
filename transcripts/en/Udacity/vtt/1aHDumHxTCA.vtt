Hi I'm Shanea,
a program manager at Google.

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:04.310
Prior to Google,

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.080
I started a digital marketing agency to
help women entrepreneurs, authors, and

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.200
experts develop and
launch their businesses online.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.837
Welcome to the Tech Entrepreneur
nanodegree program.

I am really excited to join you on your
journey to becoming an entrepreneur.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.090
A few things that you can expect are,
interviews with authors, investors, and

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.532
industry experts to give you deep
insights on your new role as a founder.

00:00:26.532 --> 00:00:29.200
Project submissions and one on one
coaching to get feedback on your

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.950
business ideas and course material
meds help support you along the way.

you'll be doing throughout the program.
