KORY JEFFREY:
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.440
We are on site at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.220
Joining me in the studio
right now is Sang Lee.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.372
He's the CEO of Dark Matter.

00:00:09.372 --> 00:00:10.710
Welcome to the studio, Sang.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.510
SANG LEE: Thanks for having me.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:11.810
KORY JEFFREY: Awesome.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.440
So let's talk a little
bit about Dark Matter.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.940
What is it?

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.479
What do you do?

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:17.520
SANG LEE: So Dark Matter
is a SaaS-based platform

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.590
that allows asset managers,
like fund managers, venture

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.240
capitalists, hedge funds to
basically manage, optimize,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.571
and access new investors
in the investor world.

00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:28.654
KORY JEFFREY: Interesting.

00:00:28.654 --> 00:00:29.445
That's pretty cool.

00:00:29.445 --> 00:00:31.090
So how does that work?

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.330
SANG LEE: So when an actual
asset manager raises capital,

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.690
it's not dissimilar to
startups raising capital.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.530
So a lot of people
think that fund managers

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.712
are born with money.

00:00:40.712 --> 00:00:42.670
They actually go through
the exact same process

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:43.680
a startup would.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.560
So they have to
identify investors,

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.430
see which investors
are right for them.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.740
And then, unlike startups,
they have a very complicated

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.060
onboarding process of
identifying them, qualifying

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.850
them, making them
sign documents,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.830
and making sure they're part
of the system, if you will.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.950
That process is done
exclusively offline today

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.237
right now by people
and spreadsheets.

00:01:03.237 --> 00:01:05.570
And we're bringing that to
the cloud for the first time.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.700
So asset managers like
BlackRock and a lot

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.920
of these other firms you
may have heard of still

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.950
use staff and paperwork to
identify these investors.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.800
We're going to bring that
to a data driven model.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.300
KORY JEFFREY: So
that's interesting.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.940
So it sounds like a very
old style marketplace

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.200
or, I guess, segment that's
coming into the new tech world.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.790
Are there any other sort
of trends in that space

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.405
of changes in tech?

00:01:29.405 --> 00:01:30.530
SANG LEE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.238
So I think a lot of
the technology that's

00:01:32.238 --> 00:01:34.480
been developed on
Wall Street primarily

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.230
were siloed for each firm.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.500
So they developed a
lot of legacy software

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.840
that was ideal for one firm
but nobody else can use.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.480
So you had these massive
software development companies

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.920
that had $5 million
contracts and would

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.990
develop one piece of
software for one firm,

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.080
but that wouldn't
work anywhere else.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.280
What we see is that a lot of
large financial institutions

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.180
are migrating to the cloud.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.030
And this is going to
require a lot of change

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.492
and a lot of capital invested.

00:01:59.492 --> 00:02:00.950
But at the same
time, what we think

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.821
is the positive
in that regard is

00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:05.320
that it's going to promote a
lot more transparency into Wall

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.010
Street.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.430
When you don't have
siloed off information,

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.530
what you kind of
force upon people

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.035
is being transparent
and forthcoming

00:02:14.035 --> 00:02:16.336
with the information
that they have.

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:17.810
KORY JEFFREY:
That's pretty cool.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.570
So you guys are here today.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.845
There's thousands of
people walking around.

00:02:21.845 --> 00:02:24.640
You guys are set up with a
booth talking about Dark Matter.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.610
What is it that you're hoping
to get out of the two days?

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.370
What attracted you
to Founder World?

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.960
SANG LEE: You know, what's
interesting is we obviously

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.682
attend events like this.

00:02:34.682 --> 00:02:36.640
Some of the key things
that I like to take away

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.160
are when people
hate our products

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.070
because it gives me
a perspective on what

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.610
we need to improve and
what we need to change.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.250
Being based in New
York, obviously, we

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.520
don't get out here as
often as we'd like.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.600
But we obviously love
that pure technology angle

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.560
that San Francisco
can kind of bring us

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.260
in terms of our business
model as well as our products.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.090
So we hope to connect with
a lot of like-minded people,

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.760
as well as
potentially investors.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.120
KORY JEFFREY: That's right.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.411
And there's of them here today.

00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:03.630
SANG LEE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.100
KORY JEFFREY: So other than your
core business and the cloud,

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.570
we talked there's a lot
of technology here today.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.760
What excites you in
the technology world?

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.300
SANG LEE: I think the
advent of technology

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.420
itself in financial
services is something

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.540
that really gets me up in the
morning because technology

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.170
itself, while it can be
fallible, most times, people

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.440
can't screw with it.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.460
And when you think about that
and you think about Wall Street

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.560
and how vilified it's become
over the last 10 years,

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.380
it's quite something
that's really, really sad.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.940
Because financial
services in and of itself

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.780
is supposed to be about value
transferring from me to you,

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.920
and doing well by
doing well for you.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.040
That's really the genesis
of the whole thing.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.030
And Wall Street created
this environment

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.880
where things are
done in back rooms

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.350
without technology
over phone calls,

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.740
without people being
accountable for their actions.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.240
And for the first
time, I think what

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.970
we're seeing is not firms
building technology,

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.510
but rather technology
firms that are

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.100
entering financial
services, which

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.745
I think is very, very exciting.

00:04:06.745 --> 00:04:08.200
KORY JEFFREY:
That's pretty cool.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.314
Do you have a favorite
Google technology?

00:04:11.314 --> 00:04:13.730
SANG LEE: You know, we started
our business off of Google,

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.170
as many startups do.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.880
So there's so many things that I
like about the Google platform.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.344
But particularly, we use a
lot of the Google Analytics.

00:04:22.344 --> 00:04:24.760
So Google Analytics has been
kind of the bread and butter,

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.420
I think, of many, many startups.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.430
But it really helps
us understand our core

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.171
constituents, how
they behave, and how

00:04:30.171 --> 00:04:31.337
we can improve our business.

00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:32.545
KORY JEFFREY: That's awesome.

00:04:32.545 --> 00:04:34.424
Well, thank you very
much for joining me.

00:04:34.424 --> 00:04:35.840
And thank you guys
for joining me.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.506
My name is Kory.

00:04:36.506 --> 00:04:40.070
We're on site at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.820
