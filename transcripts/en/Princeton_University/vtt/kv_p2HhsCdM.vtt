[CHATTER]

00:00:06.188 --> 00:00:07.438
ROBOT: You've made your point.

00:00:11.334 --> 00:00:12.308
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.308 --> 00:00:13.770
KEVIN WANG: Hello, handsome.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:14.740
ROBOT: [BARK]

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.195
KEVIN WANG: Up.

00:00:16.195 --> 00:00:22.106

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.250
ANDREW HOUCK: We've
had students make cars

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.840
that balance on
robots, cars that

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.510
play soccer, cars that can
balance on two wheels, cars

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.380
that pretend they're animals.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.280
We've also had students get
rid of vehicles altogether.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.300
Basically, anything that
students can think of

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.700
is fair game.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.500
I'm Andrew Houck.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.590
I am a professor in
electrical engineering

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.350
and one of the two
professors for our Car Lab.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.269
In junior year, we
really want to give them

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.560
a project that sort of brings
all of the things they've

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.965
learned so far.

00:01:02.965 --> 00:01:04.340
HALEY CHOW: It
all comes together

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.540
in a project where
we can build a robot.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.090
And it is a pretty cool
way to acquire knowledge.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.660
ANDREW HOUCK: At Princeton,
we want students to really

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.260
be creative thinkers.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.020
Their final project,
they have six weeks

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.290
to order the parts they need,
get them here, build them

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.680
into a system, debug it,
work out all the kinks.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.380
HALEY CHOW: So right now, we
have soccer-playing robot.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.570
DANA FESJIAN: Tomorrow
during the demo,

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.172
the car will back up to
try to locate the ball.

00:01:32.172 --> 00:01:34.130
And then it will go
towards it, and then circle

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.920
and score the goal.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.420
JAMES ALMEIDA: I don't think
anyone has ever gotten anything

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.730
on the first try in Car Lab.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.040
If they did, that
would be a miracle.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.250
KATY HO: Our goal is to
make a robot dog car that

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.070
responds to different commands.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.774
Originally the dog's name was
Duncan, which is my dog's name.

00:01:49.774 --> 00:01:51.690
KEVIN WANG: But we also
found that it actually

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.066
doesn't respond very
well to the word Duncan.

00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:58.342
So instead we've been using
the phrase, "Hello, handsome."

00:01:58.342 --> 00:01:59.800
ZACH KENDRICK: Our
goal is to shoot

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.460
a ball that's flying through
the air with a Nerf bullet

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.110
like this.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.485
CHLOE SONG: Hopefully
by tomorrow,

00:02:05.485 --> 00:02:07.140
which is the final
demo day, we'll

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.050
be able to show the turret
actually shooting something.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.520
JAMES ALMEIDA: We
designed a robot

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.100
that can balance on a ball.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.976
Basically it has four
wheels and four motors.

00:02:17.976 --> 00:02:19.808
TONY JIN: The ultimate
goal is to have it be

00:02:19.808 --> 00:02:21.130
like the BB-8 from Star Wars.

00:02:23.734 --> 00:02:27.560
ANDREW HOUCK: So this
is actually my car.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.620
I was among the first
classes to actually take

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.900
Car Lab when I was an
undergraduate here in 1999.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.260
Now students, they
can do so much more.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.790
What used to be the
final is now really

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.290
just the sort of
stepping-off point.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.230
The purpose of Car Lab is
really to get people to use

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.370
a whole array of sensors.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.230
In the last 10 or
20 years, we've

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.000
really developed
ways that machines

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.690
can see the world around
them, digital cameras that

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.260
can do vision, sonar that can
sense the distance, temperature

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.720
sensors, magnetic field sensors.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.360
This sort of marriage of the
physical world with data,

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.440
and information,
and computation is

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.682
really critical for
everything going forward.

00:03:07.682 --> 00:03:09.640
TONY JIN: I would like
to do more with robotics

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.140
and hopefully get
to the point where

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.429
you see these robots in
movies that are intelligent,

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:15.220
that can help humans
with different things.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.844
DANA FESJIAN: In the future, we
can theoretically do anything.

00:03:17.844 --> 00:03:20.260
ANDREW HOUCK: This is why
people want to become engineers.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.430
You take an idea, and
you turn it into reality.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.580
