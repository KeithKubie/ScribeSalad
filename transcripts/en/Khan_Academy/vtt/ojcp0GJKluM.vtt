00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.340
Let's do another problem where
we graph a function based

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.140
on the properties of
its derivatives and

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.010
second derivative.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.700
And what's especially
interesting about this problem

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.870
I think is the fact they
don't give the function.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.635
They just give a bunch of
clues about the function.

00:00:12.635 --> 00:00:14.070
So what do they tell us?

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:24.220
Well they tell us that
f of 0 is equal to 3.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.725
They also tell us that at
f of 3 is equal to 0.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.200
They tell us that f
of 6 is equal to 4.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.590
What I like about this problem
is that you can't use a

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.950
calculator to solve it because
you don't know the function.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.010
So even if I give you a graphic
calculator you'd be helpless.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.750
Let's write out all the
information then we

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.020
can plot it out.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.010
Let me write all the
derivative information here.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.100
They tell us that f prime--
so the derivative of x--

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:14.870
is less than 0 on the
open interval 0 comma 3.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.150
So that means not
including 0 and 3.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:28.520
And they also tell us that the
derivative of is greater than 0

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.410
on the open interval
from 3 comma 6.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.120
So we can already guess that
if we're less than 0 as we

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.900
approach 3 and we're greater
than 0 as we go away from 3,

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.060
that the derivative
must be 0 at 3.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.620
That's the intuition.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.390
Although they don't tell us
that for sure, but I'm assuming

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.290
that this function is
continuous and differentiable

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.620
over all the intervals, because
the don't tell us otherwise.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.880
OK.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.180
So that's the information
to tell us about the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.740
first derivative.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.630
And what do they tell us
about the second derivative?

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:03.750
They tell us that the second
derivative is greater than

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.720
0 on the interval 0 to 5.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.030
I did the open
interval from 0 to 5.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.740
So that means it's
concave upwards there.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.680
And they also tell us that the
second derivative is less than

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.010
0, so it's concave downwards on
the open interval

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.430
from five to 6.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.620
You know they don't give
us information what

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.990
happens after 6.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.450
Maybe it goes to an
inflection point.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.050
We don't know.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.470
So maybe you know, we'll just
assume that is doesn't change.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.030
So what does all this
information tell us?

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.890
Well first let's just graph it.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.095
So f of 0 is 3, so we
have to graph the

00:02:49.095 --> 00:02:52.700
point 0,3 3,0 and 6,4.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.410
It seems like all of the action
is in the first quadrant, so

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.210
I'll graph it accordingly.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.190
So let me graph it.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.600
I want to focus on the first
quadrant, so that's my x-axis.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.460
That's my y-axis.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.020
I have to go to 6,4.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:26.790
I want to draw this point
6,4, so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.320
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.520
So that's the point 6,4.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.300
And let's see.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.560
3 comma 0.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.180
So that's 1, 2, 3, so that's
this point right here.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.050
That point right
there is 3 comma 0.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.630
I got that from
this information.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.900
And then we have the
point 0 comma 3.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.180
0, 1, 2, 3.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.600
So this is 0,3.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.580
Well, those are definitely
points on the function.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.760
That's what this tells us.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.840
And what do they tell us?

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.030
They tell us that the
derivative is less than 0 on

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.250
the interval from 0 to 3.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.670
From here to here the
derivative is less than 0.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:29.090
And that makes sense, because
we have to obviously decrease

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.810
to go from this value
to this value.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.020
But what it does tell us is
that the function does not

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.465
do something like this.

00:04:34.465 --> 00:04:37.260
The function does not do this.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.880
The function does not do that.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.040
And how do we know that?

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.690
Well because if the function
moved up and then down, then

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.560
you have a positive slope
here, which this says

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.020
is not possible.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.030
The derivative is less than 0
from this interval to this

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.290
interval, so the slope has to
be negative the entire time.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.550
And then it tells us that the
slope is positive from this

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.150
interval-- from x is equal
to 3 to x is equal to 6,

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.310
that's what this tells us.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.580
And so you know the line has to
look something like that, or

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.680
like that, but can't curve down
then go up, because if it

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.350
curved down you'd have a
negative slope at some point.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:16.900
So OK, fair enough.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.740
Essentially the graph is
monotonic from this point

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.720
to this point and this
point to this point.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.140
And if you want to get
technical, the monotonicity

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.970
theorem tells us that, well
then this must be a point

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.060
either that is a point where
the derivative is 0, or it must

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.150
be a point where there is no
derivative, but I'm assuming

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.670
that this graph is
differentiable over everything.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.370
And you know you didn't need
a theorem to tell you that.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.800
We know that the slope is
less than 0 as we approach

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.470
here in this interval.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.690
We know the slope is greater
than 0 in this interval.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.110
And if we assume that the
derivative is continuous, which

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.270
I will make that assumption
although they haven't told us,

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.200
but in the absence of that
information, why not.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.650
If the derivative is always
kind of incrementing or

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.800
decrementing at a continues
rate, the derivative must be 0

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.700
at this point, because it's
less than 0 here and

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.260
greater than 0 here.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.025
I'll draw a little horizontal
line to indicate that the

00:06:09.025 --> 00:06:10.070
derivative is 0 there.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.540
So a it's going to be a bit
of a minimum point I think.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.260
And then let's move on to the
information on the second

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.440
derivatives and see what
they're telling us.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.740
Well they're saying that the
second derivative is greater

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.810
than 0 from 0 to 5.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.200
So from 0 to 5.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.710
So this is 5 right here.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.770
What does this tells?

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.970
This means that we are
concave upwards from 0 to 5.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.180
That gives us a lot
of information.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.700
So that tells us that not only
are we monotonically decreasing

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.890
as we approach 3, but
we're concave upwards.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.260
And and why is this
concave upwards?

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.120
Well as you see the
slope here is negative.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.830
It's a little less
negative here.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.580
It's even less negative here
and then as it slowly

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.410
approaches 0 it gets less and
less negative, and then

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:03.580
it keeps increasing
until you get to 5.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.070
And then from 5 to
6 what happens?

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.130
The second derivative becomes
negative, so we enter a point

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.450
that is concave downwards.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.180
So from 5 to 6-- I don't know
what the value of the function

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:21.070
is it 5-- but from 5 to 6 the
function becomes concave

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.490
downwards from x equals
5 to x equals 6.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.583
We don't know what f of 5 is,
but f of 5-- they didn't tell

00:07:31.583 --> 00:07:33.640
us-- is an inflection point.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.490
That's where we went from
going concave upwards

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.600
to concave downwards.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.330
And I think that's all we
can do with this graph.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:41.770
We don't know what happens.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.820
I mean actually we made a
couple of assumptions anyway,

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.730
that the graph is continuous
and differentiable

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:46.535
over the whole thing.

00:07:46.535 --> 00:07:49.640
But I think this will give you
an intuition on what all of

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.650
this first and second
derivative and all this

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:52.810
stuff does for us.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:55.370
And just so you know, this
is an inflection point.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:08:00.580
they could have told us that f
prime prime of 5 is equal to 0.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.960
We don't know that for sure,
but I'm just assuming.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:08.220
Anyway hope you found
that vaguely useful.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.120
Actually since I have time,
let me do one more bonus

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.300
problem that I was sent.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.270
And it was written right after
that problem so why not do it.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.710
And it says prove that
a quadratic function

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:21.220
has no inflections.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.980
So what does a quadratic
function look like?

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:30.180
f of x is equal to ax
squared plus bx plus c.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.930
And it says prove that this
has no inflection point.

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:33.990
Well, what's an
inflection point?

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:38.400
It's a point where the second
derivative is equal to 0.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.760
So let's figure out what
the second derivative is.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.300
The first derivative of this
quadratic-- but any quadratic

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:51.270
can be written like
this-- is 2ax plus b.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.405
And what's the
second derivative?

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.240
Well that's just equal to 2a.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.860
Now an inflection point
is when the second

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:03.040
derivative is equal to 0.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:10.010
Now my question to you is, can
this function ever equal 0?

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.780
Well, the only way that this
function would equal 0 is for

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.610
some reason a was 0, but if a
was 0 then it wouldn't be a

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.650
quadratic, because then this
term wouldn't exist, it

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.960
would be bx plus c and
it would be just a line.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.080
So if we're talking about a
quadratic where this a

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.430
coefficient is non 0, which it
has to be because that's the

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.420
coefficient of the term x,
there's no way that

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:32.190
this function, this
expression, is non 0.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.280
So there's no way that the
second derivative can ever be

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.980
0, and thus we have proved
that a quadratic has no

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.530
point of inflection.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:42.360
see you in the next video.
