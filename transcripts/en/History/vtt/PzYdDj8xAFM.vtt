00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.080
- I woke up this morning,
and there’s no way

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.920
I could get back in this boat
and handle big gators.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.540
I’m hurting too bad.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.250
I’ll put him
on top of the ice chest.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.830
[bleep]
He jacked on my knee.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.920
My knee, man.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.290
- You gonna be all right, T?

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.380
- My knee is hurting pretty bad.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.880
It’s not gonna get any better

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.880
by going to do the same thing
I was doing yesterday,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.210
loading big gators and stuff,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.210
so we’re gonna try
something else.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.040
My knee’s
pretty painful right now,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.040
So they say he’s good,
so we’re gonna see.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.960
A traiteur is a treater,
but they use prayers to treat.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.250
Doctors use medicines,
they use prayers.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.880
I believe in prayer, so, I mean,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.500
I went to traiteurs
when I was younger.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.040
It’s been a long time
since I went to one,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.120
but I really believe in ’em.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.250
My mom was one.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.880
My mom would treat for warts.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.210
So I believe in ’em.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.710
I have no warts.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.750
This is an ancient method

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.000
that I don’t know
how long it’s been going on.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.380
And I’m gonna give this a shot.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.330
- All right, T.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.880
- My knee’s really
hurting me pretty bad.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.540
I gotta try
to get something done.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.290
I need to get back out there.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.210
Daniel’s actually out there
today running lines by himself.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.790
- Okay. Well, let’s go ahead
and get you treated

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.080
so we can get your healing
taking place.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.710
I’m just gonna lay my hands
on your knee here

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.830
and say some prayers over it.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.420
They’re really just
simple prayers to God

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.040
that was said
in our native French tongue.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.460
[speaking French]

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.710
For me to be able
to offer a certain thing

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.750
that is dying out
in our culture,

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.500
it’s something that I feel
not only honored to do,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.250
but it’s required of me.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.500
[speaking French]

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.210
Amen. Thank God
for your healing.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.580
You just gotta have faith
in the healing.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.710
- I believe in prayers strongly.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.080
- Mm-hmm.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.580
- So I have faith
that it’s gonna work.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.210
- All right. Come on out.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.580
- Seeing Colby really put me
back on track, I think.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.170
Ready to get back out there
and get the job done.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.380
Give it a little time,
we’re gonna be back in action.
