00:00:00.336 --> 00:00:01.536
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Guys, I know.

00:00:01.646 --> 00:00:03.096
I know. Just take a
deep breath, you guys.

00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:04.336
Give us a few minutes, okay?

00:00:04.396 --> 00:00:05.406
Justin, could you stop please?

00:00:05.406 --> 00:00:06.906
Okay. Ladies and gentlemen..

00:00:07.016 --> 00:00:09.136
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Having trouble
managing your classroom?

00:00:10.386 --> 00:00:12.786
Here are some of our
favorite tricks of the trade.

00:00:16.046 --> 00:00:18.866
&gt;&gt;Claudia: One, two-- Alice?

00:00:20.226 --> 00:00:21.776
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Claudia Hernandez abides

00:00:21.776 --> 00:00:24.306
by a single rule to
quiet her classroom.

00:00:24.806 --> 00:00:28.226
&gt;&gt;Claudia: The first thing you
want to do is not raise your voice.

00:00:28.696 --> 00:00:34.276
Once a teacher starts raising her
voice, everything turns into chaos.

00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.406
So we could use signs.

00:00:36.676 --> 00:00:42.086
You know, you could count one through
ten, or you could use clapping,

00:00:42.086 --> 00:00:46.126
or any other strategy as long as
you don't increase your voice.

00:00:46.686 --> 00:00:49.776
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Share one of your tricks
with fellow teachers on Edutopia.
