00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:21.050
[ Silence ]

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.040
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb: Good
afternoon and welcome

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.310 position:56%
to the African Middle East Division.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.790
I'm Mary Jane Deeb, I am chief of
the division and I am delighted

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.820
to see you all here to attend
this very exciting program.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.380 position:56%
I will start with something that
many of you have heard me say before

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.050
but I always say a little
thing about our division,

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.100
and our division is made up of
three sections; the African section

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.780
that covers the whole continent
of Africa, Sub Saharan Africa

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.230
and then the Near East section
that spreads out into Central Asia

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.550
to Afghanistan of course
includes the Middle East

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.060
and then the Hebraic section

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.180
that includes actually
collections from the entire world.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:20.450
And we collect, we serve these
materials here in our reading room

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.810
and we also organize conferences
around specific topics,

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.720
we have exhibits and we had a big
exhibit on the Hebrew book three,

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:42.170
four years ago which was an
enormous hit, we highlighted some

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:50.670
of our treasures here at the
library, and we digitize materials

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.610
to make them more accessible.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:02.500
Our own staff in each section
are made up of scholars who write

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.450
and publish and digitize and scan

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.260
and do all kinds of
wonderful things.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.610
And throughout the year we invite
scholars to come and to talk

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.690
about their books and the
research they've carried out

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.420 position:56%
and the discoveries they've made and
in this way they inform our patrons,

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:33.840 position:56%
they inform our researchers about
the state of research in their field

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.100
but also about the countries.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.580
We are responsible for 78 countries

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.980
in this division and
so they let us know.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.820
They're the scholars who bring to
us the knowledge from these books

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.650
that we collect and they we serve,
so we're always very very grateful

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.100
to have scholars come
and talk to us.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.040
And today is a case in point.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.790
We have Mark Glickman here with us
and he's just published a new book

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.500
which is absolutely
wonderful and it sounded

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.320 position:56%
as we were talking a bit earlier
not only like a great scholarly book

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.940
but also there is a bit of a
thriller in it as you will see

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.950
when we presents it himself.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:25.990
Stolen Words: The Nazi Plunder of
Jewish Books is his newest book

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.280
and we really are very excited
to have him come and share

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.580
with us his research
and his insights.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.850
And before I go any further,

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.130
I would like to introduce
our own Sharon Horowitz,

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.840
a pillar of this division
and someone

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.930
who always brings the
most exciting people

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.530
to the division to have them speak.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.890
So a reference librarian,

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.310
senior reference librarian,
Sharon Horowitz.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.510
Thank you.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.070
[ Applause ]

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.660
&gt;&gt; Sharon Horowitz:
Thank you Mary Jane.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.960
My name is Sharon Horowitz.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.890
I'm reference librarian in the
Hebraic section and I too want

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.980
to welcome you to the African
and Middle Eastern reading room.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.600
Thank you all for coming.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.690
Our speaker today is Mark Glickman.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.860
Currently Rabbi Glickman
is the interim rabbi

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.670
at congregation Beth Shalom in
Baton Rouge, he's a graduate

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.050
of Washington University
in St. Louis

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.390
and he received his
rabbinical ordination

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.090
from Hebrew Union College
in Cincinnati.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.070
He has lectured frequently,
has taught in institutions

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.940
of higher learning,
and has published

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.740 position:56%
in the print media on Jewish topics.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:40.260 position:56%
His first book published in 2011 was
Sacred Treasure The Cairo Genizah.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.070
Today we will hear about his
newest book, Stolen Words:

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.940
The Nazi Plunder of Jewish Books.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.720
This book relates the odyssey
of Jewish books in the wake

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.340
of the Holocaust, why the
Nazis gathered these books

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.880
as one reviewer stated,
Glickman tells

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.060
of this often overlooked
aspect of the Holocaust,

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.310
how the written word can be abused
for the sake of cultural genocide

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.910
and finally about the struggle

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.970
to establish restitution
protocols after the war.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.760 position:56%
The Hebraic section has a connection
to these books originally stolen

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.450
by the Nazis from their victims.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.060
Between 1949 and 1952 the
library of congress received more

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.070 position:56%
than five thousand books, pamphlets,
periodicals and newspaper issues

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.550
from the Jewish Cultural
Reconstruction a New York based

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.250
umbrella organization that
has served as a trusteeship

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.150
for the Jewish people
in the aftermath

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.650
of the Holocaust by agreement.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.200
The JCR received these heirless
and unidentifiable books

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.680
from the United States
military government in Germany

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.850
which had taken exhaustive steps to
identify and restitute items seized

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.670 position:56%
by the Nazi regime from their
original owners to return them sorry

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.790
to return them to their
original owners

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.590
or to their countries of origin.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:04.670
The JCR subsequently distributed
most of these orphaned books sorry

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.720
to scholarly institutions in
the United States, Israel,

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.480
Europe, and Latin America.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.580
Items that the Library
of Congress received

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.700
from JCR bear a unique bookplate
marking their special provenance.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.860
In addition, the Library
of Congress also received

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:32.780
about 150 Hebraic volumes
bearing the stamp of anti Nazi,

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.200 position:56%
anti Semitic Nazi organizations that
are also likely to have been seized

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.000
by the Nazis from Jewish victims.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.410
In recognition of the special
provenance of these books,

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.500
the Library of Congress has created
a virtual library aggregating both

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.710
collections in its online catalog

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.650
under the Holocaust Era
Judaic Heritage Library.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.160
The full bibliographic record

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.000
for each work includes a provenance
note indicating the specific

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.830
acquisition source and
accession date for each title.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:06.480
And now please join me in welcoming
today's speaker, Mark Glickman.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:12.140
[ Applause ]

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.240
&gt;&gt; Rabbi Mark Glickman: Thank you,
Sharon and thank you to Mary Jane.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.960 position:56%
Thank you to the Library of Congress

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.240
for this wonderful opportunity
to be here this morning.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.290
I hope everybody can hear me.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.980
I ordinarily like to move around
and get closer but I'm told

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.700 position:56%
that I'm anchored here to the podium

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.550
because of the requirements
of the filming.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.090
I appreciate especially
your coming out today

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.550
because it really gives
me an opportunity

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.640
to speak about the story.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:43.580
The story of the looted literary
treasures and the looted books

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.460
of the Holocaust that comprises
such an important and as we said,

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:51.960
as Sharon said, largely unknown
chapter of Holocaust history.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.610
There are many ways we
could tell the story

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.560
of the looted books
of the Holocaust.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.990
We could start the story
in many different places.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:06.590
I like to start it in a snowy day
in February in late February 1946,

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:10.790
almost exactly 70 years
ago in Hamburg in Germany.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:15.670
It was evidently a snowy
and blizzardy day that day

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:20.290
and at the airport arrived
a young man by the name

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:27.950
of let me see how I can make this
work here Captain Seymour Pomrenze.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.990
Seymour Pomrenze was
a fascinating man.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.990
An Orthodox Jewish archivist who
had been doing some work in Germany

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.510
on some of the material
that had been discovered,

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.880
and he had been summoned to
Frankfurt, and he was picked

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.370
up at the airport by a man named
Lieutenant Lesley Post [phonetic]

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:49.050
who began to drive him across
the Main River towards a suburb

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.180
of Frankfurt called Offenbach.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:55.970
And on the way he explained there
was some material that the allies,

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.140
that the allied forces had
discovered as the war was ending

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.680
that he had been assigned
to sort through

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.850
and Lieutenant Post evidently
was out of his league

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.150
in sorting through this stuff.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.990
He was, he went on to be
an accomplished scholar

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:11.890
but at this point he was very young

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.600
and he was having trouble
just dealing

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.940
with what he had to deal with.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:22.920
They drove across the Main River
and they went to they soon arrived

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.280
at a warehouse that had
belonged before the war

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.990
to the IG Farben chemical company.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:32.310
This was a company that among
other things manufactured some

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.570
of the component elements to
Zyklon B gas, the gas that was used

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:40.200
in the gas chambers in Nazi
Europe, and now it's being used

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.980
to house some recovered
Jewish material.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:49.950
Pomrenze walks into this building,
the what would soon be known

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:54.440
as the Offenbach Archival Depot
and he couldn't believe what he saw

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.660
because there in front
of him was an ocean

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.290
of books, an ocean of material.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:06.650
It reminds me do you remember that
final scene at the end of Raiders

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:10.210
of the Lost Ark that scene where
he's in the warehouse and just row

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.240
after row after row of
boxed up, well here you had

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.460
that except it's not so
neatly stored as it was there.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.050
You had this chaos of material.

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:22.350
He took one look at it and
realized that he was looking

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:26.400
at the literary ruins of a lost
civilization, of a civilization

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.070
that had just been destroyed.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.990
He was astounded and he said
he almost felt like crying.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.530
He didn't know how he was
going to possibly deal

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:36.960
with all of this material.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:42.000
Well, he soon got to work and he
created what was officially known

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.760
as I said a moment ago as
the Offenbach Archival Depot.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.060 position:56%
He hired a staff of a couple hundred
German citizens as well as a few

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:52.870 position:56%
of his military advisors and they
began sorting through this material.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:54.900
They divided it into
three categories;

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.840 position:56%
first was the identifiable material,

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:01.810
that material whose ownership
before the war was readily evident

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:07.870 position:56%
and where they could they restituted
the books to their original owners.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.660
He was kind of limited because
there was this principle,

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.450
there's a legal principle
known as escheat which says

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:19.040 position:56%
that he can only restitute war booty

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.730
to governments and
not to individuals.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:27.490
So they would send huge shipments
out to Holland to other countries

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:30.980
where they knew that their national
libraries had been the original

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.430
owners of this material.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.420
There was also the semi
identifiable material,

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:40.810
material that might have a mark
on it that seemed to indicate

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:44.410
where it was from but there
was no definitive proof

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:46.360
or perhaps there was
a person's name on it

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.410
but they didn't know what
happened to that person.

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.580
And then there was a
great deal of the material

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.730
that was completely unidentifiable.

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:58.680
So they began going through
this material and as they did,

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:05.680
Captain Pomrenze took note of what
he was dealing with and started

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.240
to ask himself how
all this happened.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:13.850
He knew along with the rest
of the world that Nazis early

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:16.450
in the war had another
way of dealing

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:20.070
with their looted literary
material which was what?

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.370
&gt;&gt; Burning.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:22.670
&gt;&gt; Rabbi Mark Glickman:
Burning them.

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:28.640
And he had heard the reports
from May 1933 of this huge rash

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.650
of Jewish book burnings
but what he didn't realize,

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.970
what I certainly didn't realize at
the beginning of this research was

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:38.580
that while the Nazis did
burn books at the beginning

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.100
of the war they only
did so for a short time.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.840
The book burnings only lasted

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.860
for the most part during a
three week period in May 1933.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:51.050
They were a way for Hitler to
sort of establish his toehold

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.840
in the German cultural imagination

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.820
because these book burnings
were great spectacles

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.140
and there were fire chants,
and there were incantations,

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:04.480
and there were fiery speeches and
then they had these big bonfires.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:09.030
What many people didn't realize and
certainly has been forgotten now is

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:12.480
that those book burnings
they didn't work really well.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.640
First of all, it's
hard to burn a book.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:21.710
Books, physically it's
hard to burn a book.

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:25.450
Books burn far more like logs
than they do like kindling,

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:29.030
so if you throw a book into if you
try to touch a match or something

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:32.080
to a book, it's not going
to catch fire very easily.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.810
We have accounts of people
whose books were thrown

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:39.610
into these bonfires one night,
going out there the next morning,

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:43.460
picking the books up and brushing
the ashes off and taking them home.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:47.430
And it's also figuratively
speaking, it's hard to burn a book

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.900
because in the age of printing of
course if you burn one copy or even

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.160
if you burn a hundred copies
of a book there are going

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:58.050
to be other copies
around in other places.

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:01.440
Helen Keller was one of the
authors whose books were burned

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.790
and she said you are fools if
you think you can destroy ideas.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:09.940
So sometimes you can destroy
a few copies of a bound book

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.960
but you can't destroy
the book itself

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.600
because the book itself
is going to survive.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.300
Aside from that, the book burnings
brought the Nazis really bad press.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:25.950
They were seen in the international
media as thugs and oafs

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:29.860
for having done this if you
can believe such a thing.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.620
They, the books many
of them were chosen

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:35.990
because there had been a black
list of prohibited authors

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:38.470
that had been published
before the book burnings

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:43.370
so they could have some guidelines
as to what material to confiscate

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:45.920
and there were authors
around the world

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.670
who were complaining
of being white listed.

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:54.620
They were complaining that
they weren't on the list

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:58.640
and the worldwide press
really just excoriated Germany

00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.940
for doing this thing.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.480
And of course they
were looking forward

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.620
in 33 they were already
looking forward to a big event

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:08.820
that was going to happen in
Germany in 1936 which was what?

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.120
&gt;&gt; The Olympics.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.420
&gt;&gt; Rabbi Mark Glickman:
The Olympics,

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:12.930
and they knew that if they
were still doing such things

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:14.670
when the Olympics came to town

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:17.120
that it would not look
good on the world stage.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.180
So quickly the book
burnings stopped.

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:24.430 position:56%
They flared up again if you will a
couple years later a few years later

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:26.900 position:56%
in Kristallnacht at the end of 1938,

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:32.580
but for the most part this was
just a brief spade of book burnings

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.870
that the happened in 1933.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:40.940
In the late 1930s Hitler
was approached by one

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:45.080
of his main ideologues one
of the main intellectuals

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:50.680
in the Nazi regime, a Nazi
soldier, a Nazi official

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:55.180
with the unlikely name
of Alfred Rosenberg.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:59.580
Rosenberg was an intellectual
if you could call him that.

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:02.840
It was probably more like
a pseudo intellectual.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.740
He wrote a book of the Myth
of the Twentieth Century

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.940
which was the second best
selling book in all Germany.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:15.110
Second of course only to Mein
Kampf and it was this 800 page,

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:19.930
7 or 800 page tome with thousands
of footnotes and apparently

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.480
if you were the kind of
person who would fail

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:28.350
to see the emperor's new
clothes, you would have admitted

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:31.050
that this was an impossible
piece of work to read.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:34.830
It was kind of like remember
the book A Brief History

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:37.060
of Time by Steven Hawking?

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.480
Everybody had this book on
their shelves when it came out,

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.870
nobody I think ever understood a
word of what he was saying in there

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:45.430
but it looked great on the shelf.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:49.220
And so too did the far
more voluminous Myth

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.970
of the Twentieth Century.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:55.620
Rosenberg was a rising
star in the Nazi regime.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.100
He was not in Hitler's inner circle
but he was trying to get there.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.490
He was eventually put in
charge of the territories,

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:03.690
the conquered territories
in the east,

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:07.320
but he was also an intellectual and
we went up to Hitler and he knew

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:11.670
that Hitler had long dreamed of
opening Hauptschule an institute

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:14.360
for higher learning that
would really be a testament

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:18.050
to the great intellectual
achievement of German civilization.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:22.530
And he went to Hitler and he said
my Fuhrer, why don't you allow me

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:25.040
to start to build these
institutions?

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.620
And how about a part of it is an
institute for Jewish research?

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:32.150
Let's open in fact a series of
institutes for Jewish research

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:36.260
after the war to study
this extinct Jewish people?

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.100
The Jewish people of course will
soon be extinct and it's going

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.160
to be important for the world
to know just like we know

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.580
about other extinct civilizations,
it will be important for the world

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:50.230
to know what this civilization
was about and who to teach them

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:54.210
who can teach the world about
this extinct civilization

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:59.310
if not the great Nazi, Nazi regime.

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:03.050 position:56%
And so Hitler gave him permission to
build these institutes and Rosenberg

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:06.900
and of course if we're going to
have these institutes we're going

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.100 position:56%
to need some libraries, and if we're
going to have libraries we're going

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.750 position:56%
to need to put books in the library.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:19.160
So Hitler gave Rosenberg
permission to gather books

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:24.880
from the conquered
territories of the Nazi regime.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:29.140 position:56%
When the Nazis would take over a new
territory, he would be able to go

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:33.050
and take and confiscate
some Jewish books.

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:36.400
But of course in the late 1930s
there weren't many conquered

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:41.880
territories, but in 1940 in May
of 1940 Germany invaded and took

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:45.130
over France and it was like
a treasure chest opened

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:47.160
up before Alfred Rosenberg's eyes

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.250
because of course throughout
France particularly in Paris

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.430
but elsewhere there were all
kinds of Jewish libraries,

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:56.990
private libraries, institutional
libraries that had been abandoned

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:00.510
by Jews who were fleeing
Nazi oppression.

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:05.580
And it was very easy for
Rosenberg to go in and to take

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.090
over the material that
was in that library.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:13.040
He created what was called the
Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg,

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:18.110
the Rosenberg task force
otherwise known as the ERR.

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:19.560
When you study this especially

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.710
if you don't know German
it's a challenge

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.930
to return these multisyllabic
German words.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:28.830
He created the ERR which went
out and went to these libraries

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:31.390
and confiscated the material
and originally it was all sent

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:33.730
to Frankfurt, it was
stored elsewhere

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:36.280
as well as the war went on.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.920
And he established a routine
where the Nazis would go in

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.290
and they would take over a
town and this was especially

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:46.740
so as the Nazis went into Poland
and Russia and other places

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:52.240
in Eastern Europe and the routine
was a simple if not tragic one.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.100 position:56%
The Nazis would go into a town, they
would empty that town of its Jews,

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:59.790
the Jews would be taken out to
the outskirts of town sometimes

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:05.150
and shot right there or loaded
up into cattle cars and taken off

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.700
for execution in one
of the death camps.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.460
And shortly after that the ERR guys
would go in and they would load

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.760
up the Jewish books from the
homes, from the libraries,

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.330 position:56%
from the synagogues, from the
schools and they would take them off

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:22.110
to a collecting point
somewhere nearby.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.640
We'll get to those
collecting points in a while.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:29.540
And soon the library, the
Nazi Jewish library grew.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.680
Rosenberg was not the
only one collecting books

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:37.540
under the leadership of another man
named Reinhard Heydrich even more

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:38.840
books were collected.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.530
These were collected from
within Germany itself.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:44.130
Rosenberg was collecting
them outside Germany,

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:49.490
Heydrich was collecting them
from within the territories

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:51.850
from within the lands of
the Third Reich itself.

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:56.530
He was able to unify all of the
various German police forces,

00:20:56.530 --> 00:21:00.250
security forces into
one single organization.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:03.850
In my book by the way I compare
the Nazi organizational chart

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:08.070
to a Jackson Pollock painting
with a German language overlay

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:12.810
to understand the way
the Nazi regime was setup

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:15.490
and to understand these various
agencies and what they did

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:19.820
and who they reported
to is a gargantuan task,

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:22.510
but what Heydrich was able
to do was to take many

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:26.710
of these security institutions
with overlapping responsibilities

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:32.610
and unify them now to talk
about multisyllabic German words

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:35.310
into the Reichssicherheitshauptamt.

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:38.780 position:56%
And if you knew how long it took me
to learn how to pronounce that word.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:43.700
The Reich Security Main Office,
the RSHA and he too started

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:47.590
to collect books in a similar
way to the way Rosenberg did.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:52.490
There were other Nazi organizations
that were doing the same thing,

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:56.130
and so again they would go into
towns and once that were emptied

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.560
of their Jews, they
would collect the books.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.630
They sent them to collecting points

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:05.310
and often these collecting points
were in monasteries and in castles

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:08.950
and in warehouses throughout
the territories

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:10.720
that the Nazis had taken over.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.740
So there were books stored
in the Von Pless Castle,

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:18.300
there were books stored
here in the Tworkow Castle,

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.160
dozens of places these
books were stored.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.860
They were even stored in the
famous Neuschwanstein Castle.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.240 position:56%
Most of the material that was stored

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.830
in Neuschwanstein was
the looted artwork

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:33.780
but there were books
stored there as well.

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:39.820
As the war went on it became more
and more difficult to keep them

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:41.120
in some of these storage places

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.000
because the storage places
themselves were taken

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.640
over as the size of the Reich's
land holdings began to shrink.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.320
And so slowly there began to
consolidate the collections

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.720
and in Eastern Europe most
of the material was sent

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:01.020
to a town called Rotibor or
there's a way to pronounce

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:04.750
that in modern Polish that I'm not
going to even try to pronounce.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:08.580
Here use see is a stockpile
in Rotibor and then

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:13.390
in Germany they were sent to a town
called Hungen and they were stored

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:15.300
in the castle and in
other places there.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:21.070
These two towns were, you
know, typically when you think

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:23.530
of a storage facility
you think of a warehouse

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:24.980
or a building of some sort.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:29.510
These were entire towns as the
volume of the material grew,

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:32.830
these became entire towns
whose every public building

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:36.630
for the most part was devoted
to storing this material.

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:40.130
So the bank building would
have material, the church,

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:43.820
the community center
would all be filled

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.260
with these materials
in these two towns.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:52.430
There were storage places elsewhere
too but the two largest ones were

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:56.570
in Hungen and in Rotibor as well.

00:23:56.570 --> 00:24:00.840
We're going to come back to
Schloss Hungen in a little while.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:06.320
So to look at the contrast between
1933 and 1943 is astounding.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:10.560
In 1933 as you've seen we had this.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:19.130
These orgies of book burning but
by 1943 it had moved to this.

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:22.910
To Nazi soldiers and officials
going through this material,

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:25.420
sorting it out, trying
to organize it

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.100
and again the amount was just huge.

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.130
They were only able to
organize a small amount of it

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:35.340
but they did what they
did what they could.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:38.140
Now not all the books
went by the way we have

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.810
until one o'clock including
Q and A, is that correct?

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:43.240
Including Q and okay.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:53.650
So not the books went readily
to their into Nazi hands,

00:24:53.650 --> 00:25:01.780
and one story that is important
to tell are the books of Vilna.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.180
Vilna which was now
Vilnius the capital

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:07.850
of Lithuania was a teeming
Jewish community before the war.

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:09.710
Tens of thousands of
Jews lived there

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:12.660
and there were Jewish
theaters, and Jewish newspapers,

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:18.140
and schools of all kinds,
and even in its area

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:22.870
around Vilna there was an
active and vibrant Jewish life.

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:26.950
When the Nazis took Vilna over,
they went into Vilna itself

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:28.270
and all the towns around Vilna

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:30.870
and again they collected
the Jewish books.

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:36.160
And originally they sent them to
the university to be sorted through

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:42.420 position:56%
and processed but eventually they
realized that that didn't make sense

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:46.070
because outside of the Vilna
Ghetto there is a library,

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:48.550
there was a building
that had belonged

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:52.420
to YIVO the Jewish scientific
institute, an organization

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.010
that before the war had
been documenting the history

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:56.430
of Eastern European Jewry.

00:25:56.430 --> 00:26:00.060
They had a huge library there
already and so it made sense

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:04.710
to send all the books to this one
library to get sorted through.

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:08.840
The man in charge of the effort
was a man named Johannes Pohl

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.940
and here we should step back
and take note of the fact

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:17.390
that there was a cadre, there
was a phenomenon during the war

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:20.940
of Nazi Judaic scholars.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:26.320
This is also an untold story
largely of World War II was

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:31.960
that the Nazi regime was
able to boast of many people

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:36.910
who were trained experts in Judaica
who knew Hebrew, who knew Talmud,

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:42.160
who knew Jewish history and they
used that knowledge in a variety

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:47.280 position:56%
of ways in order to further the anti
Semitic aims of the Nazi regime.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.660
So here you have this
man Johannes Pohl

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:54.180 position:56%
who before the war had studied
Jewish studies for a couple of years

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:58.440 position:56%
at the Hebrew University in
Jerusalem and now he's put in charge

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:03.120
of processing this
material in Vilna.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:08.170
So what he did was he conscripted
a few dozen Jewish literati

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:10.180
from the Vilna Ghetto.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:14.830
These were poets, these were
historians, these were writers

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:18.220
of different kinds and
every day this group

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:24.240 position:56%
of people would be marched out of
the Vilna Ghetto to the YIVO Library

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.810
where they would be
assigned the task

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:27.310
of sorting through this material.

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:30.500
Since there was so much of it they
were told that they should sort

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:34.960
through it and only keep the
most valuable 20 to 30 percent

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:38.910
of what they saw and the rest of it
was going to go to the pulp mill.

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:42.570
And it's a very interesting
story, therefore,

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:46.810
I have these books being
gathered, being collected

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:51.000
in a central gathering place,
being marched past an official

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.260
for a cursory examination,
some books go one way,

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.780
some books go the other way and
depending on which way they go,

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:01.670
that will determine whether they
have a chance of surviving the war.

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:04.190
And in that sense of course
the story of the books

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:08.520
of the Holocaust is eerily
parallel to that of the people

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.940
of the Holocaust although
of course far less tragic.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:17.360
So these scholars, these people
who love books who used to study

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:20.740
in the YIVO Library before the war
and now were being brought there

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:24.310
and with every book that was put
in their hands they had an option.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:28.990
Either destroy it or
give it to the Nazis.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:33.070
And often they were able with great
difficulty and with having gone

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:36.730
and with great pain they were
able to make that decision

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:40.200
but sometimes they couldn't
stomach either of those decisions.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:43.120
So what they started to do
was when they came across some

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:46.570
of the really valuable
material, they would put it aside

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:50.260
and at the end of the day they
would hide it in their clothing

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:55.070
and bring it back with them into
the ghetto for safe keeping.

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:59.980
It is to me ironic that inside
the ghetto itself was seen

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.970
as the safest place
for these books to be.

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:06.480
That's where they could keep their
eyes on them, and so you would see

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:10.050
at the end of the day if you look
closely all of these scholars

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:14.080
and poets and writers walking out
of the YIVO Library with puffed

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.060
up clothes because there were
these books inside trying

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.350
to sneak them back into the ghetto.

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:22.620
At one point somebody
said, are you crazy?

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:24.590
Are you nuts?

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:28.300
They're books, you're
risking your lives for books.

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:31.180
And one of the members
of this group said, well,

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:35.550
books you know they
don't just grow on trees.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:40.720
The group called itself the Paper
Brigade and soon they realized

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:44.310
that this process was going far
too slowly, that they needed

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:47.130
to speed things up if they were
going to save anything close

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:49.770
to the number of books
that they hoped to save.

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:51.930
And they realized that the guard

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:57.750
at the YIVO facility the Polish
guard was an untrained almost deaf

00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:03.090 position:56%
guy who felt badly about the fact
that he was an uneducated guy and so

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:05.380
out of the kindness of their
hearts a couple members

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:10.270
of the Paper Brigade volunteered to
tutor him at lunchtime every day,

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:13.740
and while they did
so, the other members

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:17.230
of the Paper Brigade busied
themselves taking as many books

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:21.090
as they could and hiding them above
the ceiling and behind the walls

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:23.080
of the YIVO building hoping

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:26.650
that they would last
there until after the war.

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:30.400
One of the main members of this,
one of the most well known members

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:41.660
of the Paper Brigade was a poet
by the name of Avraham Sutzkever.

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:45.280
He and Shmerke Kaczerginski they
were both the only two people

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.280
who survived until after the war.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:50.570
Sometimes at lunchtime or on breaks

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:53.800
in their work Avraham
Sutzkever would sit down

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:59.650
and write poetry reflecting on his
life and reflecting on his world

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:03.750
when he was working in the
YIVO facility and in one

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:08.900
of the poems he wrote he used an
image that Ann Brener is Ann here?

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:14.750
Ann there's Ann was able to
help me unpack a little bit.

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:17.470
Apparently in medieval poetry,
and Ann you'll correct me

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:21.520
if I'm wrong I hope, they
use the image was often used

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:24.120
of the word as black pearls.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:29.440
The words were seen as black
pearls on the page and in a poem

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:34.990
that he wrote, Sutzkever
used that image.

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:39.030
He riffed only that image and
he talked about the written word

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:41.860
as a burnt pearl on the body

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:45.690
of on the charred remains
of a woman's body.

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:50.760
We don't have the owner of the
pearls left and all that remains

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:55.710 position:56%
of her are the burnt pearls that she
once wore, and he used that image

00:31:55.710 --> 00:32:00.680
as a way of looking at
the words around him

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:04.390
that the owner's bodies themselves
were being charred and all

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:07.700
that is remaining now are
the burnt pearls, the books,

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.810
the written words themselves.

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:15.940
One other story, a couple
of these stories of how some

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.500
of the books survived
are fascinating.

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:22.200
There is a book a very famous book
called the Sarajevo Haggadah a

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:26.200
beautiful Passover Haggadah that
was made originally in Spain

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:31.000
and spirited out we think when the
Jews were expelled in Spain in 1492

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.790
and eventually made its
way to Sarajevo in Bosnia

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:38.440
and it's a beautiful
illuminated book.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:42.210
Here you see a picture of a
facsimile edition of the book

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:44.220
that I have in my own library.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:49.250
When the Nazis took over
Sarajevo early on they went one

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:53.480
of the Nazi officials went to the
Bosnian national museum in order

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:57.650
to get the Sarajevo Haggadah
and he walked in and he asked

00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:00.650
to see the library director and
he was introduced to the director.

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:03.640
The director didn't speak
any German so they called

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:07.110
on a man named Dervis Korkut
to serve as an interpreter.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:13.140
Dervis Korkut was a young Muslim
scholar who had done research

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:16.280
in a variety of different
fields and he was able to help

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:19.690
because he knew German and he
knew the local language as well

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:24.260
and was able to help translate, and
the Nazi official said I've come

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.840
to get the Sarajevo
Haggadah, and the director

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.230
of the museum said, I'm sorry sir.

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:33.660
One of your colleagues came
this morning, I give it to him.

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.420
He said who was my colleague
who came this morning?

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.990
He said I didn't think it was
appropriate for me to ask his name.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:41.500
He said so you don't have
the Sarajevo Haggadah here?

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.820
No, it left this morning.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:47.210
And so this German soldier
as I picture him he kind

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:50.940
of clicked his heels and with an
upset look on his face he kind

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:55.420
of turned and walked crisply
out of the room not realizing

00:33:55.420 --> 00:34:00.070
that during the entire conversation
the famous Sarajevo Haggadah had

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:02.960
been hidden in Dervis
Korkut's pants.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:07.820
He had put it in the waistband of
his pants to hide it from the Nazi

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:14.790
and he and the head of the museum
had colluded right before this talk

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:17.460
in order to make sure that
they saved his Haggadah.

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:20.920
And they were able to save it
for the duration of the war

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.770 position:56%
and it still exists now in Sarajevo.

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:26.270 position:56%
What is important to note as well is

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:29.610
that the Sarajevo Haggadah
was not the only book

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:32.550
that Dervis Korkut was
not the only thing rather

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:36.750
that Dervis Korkut saved from
Nazi hands during the war.

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:42.210
He was also able to help rescue
a young Jewish woman who showed

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:45.940
up bedraggled and in great need
of safe haven at his doorstep

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:49.220
and at great risk to his
life and to that of his wife,

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:51.240
the couple was able to shelter her

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:53.790
until she could get somewhere
safer during the war.

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:56.430
So this was really a heroic man.

00:34:56.430 --> 00:35:00.420
We can also tell the story of
a young couple Hans Augusto

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:03.190
and Margaret Reyersbach, a
young couple that had met

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:06.010
in Brazil, German Jewish couple.

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:14.680
He was in advertising and she
was an artist and they started

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:20.030
to on the side make children's
books originally in Brazil.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:24.570
They took their honeymoon in the
late 30s to Paris and they fell

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:27.820 position:56%
in love with and were enchanted by
the city and like many people who go

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.630
to Paris they found
themselves stuck.

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:31.960
They couldn't leave
they loved it so much.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:35.330
And while they were there they
made some children's books.

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:38.210
They started to create
this character named Fifi.

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:43.200 position:56%
Fifi was this mischievous monkey who
would get into all kinds of trouble.

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.050
Right before the Nazis
invaded Paris,

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:48.840
they realized that they
needed to get out of town,

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.830
so they cobbled together
a couple of bicycles,

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:53.960
they took the Fifi drawings and
a few other personal belongings,

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.040
put them on the back of their
bicycles because they knew

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:59.140
that the Nazis this was
artwork, this was a book that was

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:01.020
in the making, they knew
that the Nazis were going

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:03.060
to take this if they
weren't careful.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.890
And on their cobbled together
bicycles they road out of Paris

00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:09.020
and they eventually got on trains
and they went through Spain

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:11.810
and Portugal and then they
eventually went back to Brazil

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:14.190
and after that they came
to the United States

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:21.650
where they changed their names
from Hans Augusto Reyersbach

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:26.160
and Margaret Reyersbach
to H.A. and Margaret Rey

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:29.100
and Fifi they changed
Fifi's name as well.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.140
Does anybody know what
Fifi's name became?

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.440
&gt;&gt; Curious George.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:39.160
&gt;&gt; Fifi became Curious George, so
Curious George was among the books

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:44.040
that slipped through Nazi
hands during the war.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:49.460
When the war ended, the
allied forces went in

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:51.640
and found this material and so

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:55.880
when we see Schloss Hungen
again there was a young soldier

00:36:55.880 --> 00:37:02.600
by the name of Robert Schaumburg
[assumed spelling] who had grown

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:07.280 position:56%
up in Vienna and was an attorney
there but had to flee and on his way

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.310
out he said that he wasn't ever
going to come back to Europe again.

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:13.160
And when he came to the United
States and his draft board found

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.960
out that he was fluent
in six languages,

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:21.490
before he could say Anschluss he
was back on boat back to Europe.

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:28.540
And he was assigned a detail of
soldiers one day in 1945 or 1946

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:35.590 position:56%
and he was sent to check out some
reclaimed material at Schloss Hungen

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:40.300 position:56%
at the Hungen Castle which was
remember Hungen was one of the towns

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:42.430
where all this material was sent.

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:45.320
And he went up to the castle
and I think it was dark

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.240
and as I picture it it was a
dark and dreary day that day

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:53.060
with bats flying around the
castle, and he knocked on the door

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:55.950
and it turns out that the owner

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:59.350
of the castle Princess
Schloss Braunfels,

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:04.510
Princess Solms Braunfels rather,
was no longer living in the castle.

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:07.400
She had to flee earlier in the
war because it was discovered

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.590
that she had been trying
to help some Jews.

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:11.100
However, her husband,

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:15.400
her octogenarian husband was still
allowed to live in the castle.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.590 position:56%
His name was James Pitcairn Knowles.

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:22.140
He was a Scottish portrait painter

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:24.030
and he lived there all
alone in the castle.

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:26.900
It was just him and
Alfred the butler.

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:30.240
And Alfred the butler, and
I'm not making this up,

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:34.360
Alfred the butler was also an
octogenarian doddering old man.

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:37.600
He had been involved in the
service industry for a long time

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:43.400
and several decades earlier,
he had been a ship steward

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:48.420
who was assigned the task of
knocking on the door of the Astors

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:51.970
and the Guggenheims telling them
it was time to get to the deck

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:55.610
of the Titanic immediately because
the ship was about to go down.

00:38:55.610 --> 00:39:01.590
He was that guy, and now he's
the butler in Schloss Hungen.

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:03.630
So Schoenfeld [phonetic] goes
up and knocks on the door,

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:08.180
Alfred the butler opens the
door and kind of says well,

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:11.240
we've been expecting
you, come on in.

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:14.000
And they walk in and were
astounded at what they saw

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.750
because throughout this entire
castle and we're only seeing part

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:21.270
of the castle here in this picture,
floor to ceiling were bookshelves.

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:23.490
Here the books were
perfectly organized

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:27.770
and the whole castle was filled
with them, millions of books

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:29.780
that had made their way there.

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:34.930
And Alfred said, you may want
to see what's in the basement.

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:39.750
And he took out a skeleton key,
opened the door to the basement

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:45.010
and they walked down and there they
found huge boxes with the library

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:49.890
of Le Corps Rabbinique the
rabbinical academy in Paris

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:56.510
with priceless old books and
other manuscripts of all kinds.

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:59.620
And then Alfred said, you might
want to see what's over here

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:02.280
and he beckoned them over
to a cabinet and he takes

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:05.950
out another skeleton
key, opens it up.

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:09.930
It was the Rothchild's library in
there some of the great treasures

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:11.520
from the Rothchild collection.

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:15.440
Incunables, some of the earliest
printed Jewish books that existed

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.820
and there were manuscripts
and all kinds

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:20.190
of other priceless Jewish material.

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:23.010
This happened place
after place after place

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:24.610
as this material was collected.

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:28.240
As we said it was originally
sent to Offenbach

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.070
where the American army
had to figure out what

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:32.640
to do with this material.

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:38.290 position:56%
They restituted what material they
could but even as the war was coming

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:41.750
to an end, they had hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds of thousands

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:44.550
of remaining volumes not
sure what to do with it.

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:48.580
And the issue quickly became a
political one even amongst Jews it

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:51.600
became political, if
you can imagine that.

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:57.940
So the Jews in the soon to be
born state of Israel were saying,

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.560
you know, we are the capital
of the Jewish people here.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.760
This material should come to the
Hebrew University in Jerusalem,

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.680
we'll take care of it like
nobody else can or will.

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:10.330
And Jews in the United States were
saying our community is now the

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:12.680
largest Jewish community
in the world.

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:13.980
The books should come here.

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:16.740
They should come to places like
the Library of Congress and some

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.810
of the fine universities
we have here.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:21.150
We can take care of them
like nobody else can.

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:24.730
And the survivors who were
staying in Europe were saying,

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:26.870
no the books should stay here.

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:31.200
The books should stay at home, and
can you imagine what you would do

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:36.280
if you were in the American army
and you found that some books came

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:40.270
from a town library, you knew
exactly where they came from

00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:43.370
but that town that Jewish
community was no longer there.

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:46.370
Or if only or if there
were a huge library

00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:48.860
and only ten people
from that town survived.

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:52.920 position:56%
Or what do you do with the books if
a large number had survived but half

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:56.360 position:56%
of the people had gone to Israel and
half had come to the United States?

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.660
What do you do with it then?

00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:59.770 position:56%
So there were all kinds of decisions

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:03.090
and it was becoming this
very heated political issue

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:06.630 position:56%
and the poor American army is
caught in the cross fire between all

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:08.880
of these groups of bickering Jews.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:14.560
To their great fortune, eventually
1949 the occupation of Germany came

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:20.010
to an effective conclusion
and as Sharon said earlier,

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:25.020
the books were then turned over
to a team of Jewish historians

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:28.940
and other intellectuals
called Jewish Cultural

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:30.840
Reconstruction Incorporated.

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:35.050 position:56%
This was an American based
organization that became the trustee

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:38.060
of the Jewish people to
deal with this material.

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:41.880
The director was a prominent
historian named Salo Baron

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:45.980
at Columbia University and for a
time the on the ground director

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:51.500
in Europe was none other than the
famous Jewish political philosopher

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:52.800
Hannah Arendt.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:57.750
She spent a few years in Germany
dealing with this material and even

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:01.760
in the most prominent
biographies that have been written,

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.350
Hannah Arendt barely merits a blip

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:07.140
in the biographies
that are told of her.

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:11.080
But this was a major part of
her life and what she did.

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:14.310
They too had to figure out
what to do with this material

00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:17.260
and eventually they
came up with a formula.

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:19.890
It was their 40, 40, 20 formula.

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:23.500 position:56%
Forty percent of the books that they
couldn't identify whose owners they

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:27.730
couldn't identify whose provenance
was unclear, they sent to libraries

00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:31.960
in Israel, 40 percent they sent
to libraries in the United States,

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:37.220
and 20 percent they sent elsewhere,
and the elsewhere was places

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:41.410
like South Africa and Australia
and Argentina and libraries there.

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:46.980
They sent many of the books to DP
camps early on so that the people

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:49.350
in those camps could use them
but eventually then they had

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:52.920
to decide what to do with them
after the DP camps closed.

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:57.640 position:56%
Jewish Cultural Reconstruction
existed at least on paper until 1977

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:02.310
and there was through the into
the early 1950s there was a lot

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:04.960
of material that they had to deal
with and there was just a trickle

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.480
that they had to deal
with afterwards

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:11.660
but it finally closed its
doors in the late 1970s.

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:15.370
Now, keeping my eye on the
time, it's easy to get lost

00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:19.350
in the big numbers here and I found
that it's helpful to tell the story

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:24.720
of one book that was part of the
story to see how it really panned

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.350
out in terms of that one book.

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:30.810
And I thought we would take
a book called Hilchot Alfasi,

00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:35.420
it was written by a man named Rabbi
Isaac Alfasi whose name literally

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:37.680
means Isaac the guy from Fes.

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:45.060 position:56%
He was from Fes, Morocco home of the
tasseled kind of dorky looking hat,

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:50.510
and he in the 11th
century he and some

00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:55.140 position:56%
of his colleagues were becoming
concerned because Islam was starting

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.090
to shimmer pretty brightly.

00:44:57.090 --> 00:45:01.250
Islam was becoming a
temptation for Jews

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:10.930
because it was this brilliant very
rich thriving intellectual corpus

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:16.690
of material and it was hard
for rabbis to prevent people

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:19.910
from converting to Islam
because at the time in order

00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:25.490
to study Judaism there were only
really for the most part two books

00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:29.760
that you could offer people who
wanted to learn about Judaism.

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:33.070
Those two books were what?

00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:36.610
The Torah and the Talmud, and aside

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:39.700
from that I mean there were some
other rabbinic works but the Torah

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:42.050
and the Talmud were
about it in terms

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:45.450
of practically available material

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:47.790
that students of Judaism
could study.

00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:51.850
And the Talmud is a very
difficult book to study.

00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:56.600
It's in Aramaic for one thing,
it's in very terse language,

00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:01.950
it's governed by a lot of arcane
principles, and so it was very hard

00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:05.480
for rabbis like Alfasi and his
colleagues to say you should stay

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:09.370
with Judaism and here's this great
rich literary heritage we have

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:10.670
to offer you.

00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:13.880
So what he did, what Alfasi did
was he went to through the Talmud

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:17.800
and he took out and kept
just the stuff that was

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:20.700
of practical use for
Jews those days.

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:24.460 position:56%
There's a lot of stuff in the Talmud
about sacrifices in the temple,

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:25.760
doesn't even exist anymore.

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.060
He took all that stuff out.

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:29.330
He took out all the material
about the back and forth

00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:32.240
between the arguing and
bickering rabbis of the Talmud,

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:35.650
all that was left out, and he
kept just the stuff that was

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:39.590
of practical use, and he took
the 20 volume Talmud and he sort

00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:44.230
of condensed it into a three
volume Reader's Digest version

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:45.750
of the Talmud if you will.

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:51.470
And Hilchot Alfasi the laws
of Rabbi Alfasi was one

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:54.360
of the very first printed
books ever.

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.380
It was printed in Spain
in the late 1400s

00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:00.740
and there was a version printed
in Constantinople not long

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:04.110
after that there were several
versions printed in Italy.

00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:07.890
The tenth time a printing house
got around to printing it it was

00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:12.780
in the town of Sulzbach in
Germany and that was in the 1760s.

00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:14.280
There was one volume that came

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:19.210
out in 1763 another in
64 and another in 65.

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:21.320
So we can picture say
the second volume

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:25.470
of this book rolling
off the presses in 1764.

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:28.240
Most of the people who studied
these books back then lived

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:32.740 position:56%
in Eastern Europe but they were hard
to print because a page of Talmud

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:35.430
and a page of all these
books has different fonts

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:37.300
and there's different text blocks

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:40.130
and it's very difficult
to layout the printing.

00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:43.880
And in Eastern Europe for the most
part they didn't have the resources

00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:48.170
to do this kind of printing and so
these books were typically printed

00:47:48.170 --> 00:47:51.260
in Western Europe but
read in Eastern Europe.

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:53.510
So we can picture this
book second volume

00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:56.780
of Alfasi coming off the press
and being loaded by a bunch

00:47:56.780 --> 00:48:01.350
of big brawny guys out to the
back of a truck or a wagon rather.

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:05.190
That wagon heading eastward and
we can picture it then arriving

00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:09.250
in some small town in Poland, being
taken off the truck and purchased

00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:13.400
by a book distributor who the
next day starts to make his rounds

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:18.110
and he goes to a little town and
he shows up at the Beth Midrash,

00:48:18.110 --> 00:48:21.160
the adult study house in that
town where he's warmly greeted

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:25.670
by the rabbi, he walks in
carrying a big pile of books,

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:29.890
he comes out with a far shorter
pile because he just sold our copy

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:31.980
of the second volume
of Hilchot Alfasi,

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:35.400
the Laws of Rabbi Alfasi
to this Beth Midrash.

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:39.150
The following day a group of
students, young students come in

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:42.420
and they break up into pairs which
is the way they would study back

00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:47.570
in the yeshiva in the Beth Midrash
and one pair of students came

00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:49.470
across a question and
they decided they wanted

00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:52.880 position:56%
to consult the Laws of Rabbi Alfasi.

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:56.500 position:56%
So they go to the shelf and they
pull this book off, they open it up,

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.590
they study it, they put it back.

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:01.430
The next day the same thing
happens except a different group

00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:03.810
of students takes the book
off the shelf, opens it up,

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:05.720
studies it and puts it back.

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:09.390
This happens day after day, month
after month, year after year

00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:13.950
for almost two centuries it sits
on the shelf of that Beth Midrash

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:19.900
until one day the students
don't come in because

00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:24.190
of course the students early
that morning had been rounded up

00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:28.850
and taken outside to the outskirts
of town and they were all shot.

00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:33.030
And the day after that the
doors do open and instead

00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:37.590
of eager young students the
darkness comes in and a group

00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:41.780 position:56%
of Nazi soldiers enters the building
and takes our copy of Alfasi

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:45.470 position:56%
and all the other books they find
and throws it in the back of a truck

00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:46.830
where it's taken to a castle

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:49.460
where it's stored somewhere
until after the war.

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:53.150
Discovered after the war, sent
to Offenbach, they open it up

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:54.450
and they find that the stamp

00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:57.260
of that Beth Midrash while it
was still there it had faded away

00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:59.930
so much they couldn't tell
where it was originally from.

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:03.260
So they kept it and
eventually the army turned it

00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:05.990
over to Jewish Cultural
Reconstruction who at the end

00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:10.670 position:56%
of the war put it into their 40,
40, 20 formula and sent it to Israel

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:12.640
where it was purchased by the
library of the chief [inaudible]

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:16.470
of Israel and it sat on the
self there for several decades

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:20.480
until they needed to clear some
space in their library and they,

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:23.800
what librarians call
deacquisitioned the book.

00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:28.770
They sold it off to an antiquarian
book dealer who purchased it

00:50:28.770 --> 00:50:31.880
and put it up online where it
was purchased by a customer

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:39.910
in Washington State and here it is.

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:42.830
So this is a book that I purchased.

00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:48.280
I purchased it the way most rabbis
purchase books these days on eBay,

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:52.730
and when I got the book I
opened it up and I found

00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:56.780
on the inside was a
bookplate Jewish Cultural

00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:58.600
Reconstruction Incorporated.

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:01.630
At the time I had no idea what
Jewish Cultural Reconstruction

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:05.340
Incorporated was so I did
what most rabbis do when faced

00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:10.590
with such conundra [phonetic],
Googled it, and that sent me

00:51:10.590 --> 00:51:17.960
on to this whole story that
where wrote the book about.

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:23.670
If only of course we had the
people who owned this but we don't.

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:26.030
And among the only
physical relics we have

00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:29.380
of them are the books
that they left behind.

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:38.570
It reminds me of the words of
Abraham Sutzkever who died in 2010

00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:40.950
and he wrote, it is not
just because my words quiver

00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:45.390
like broken hands grasping for aid
or that they sharpen themselves

00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:47.920
like teeth on the prowl
in the darkness,

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:51.980
that you my written words
substitute for my world flare

00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:54.060
up the coals of my anger.

00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:57.830
It is because your sounds glint
like burnt pearls discovered

00:51:57.830 --> 00:52:03.310
in an extinguished pyre and
no one not even I shredded

00:52:03.310 --> 00:52:07.470
by time can recognize the
woman drenched in flame for all

00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:13.010
that remains of her now are those
gray pearls smoldering in the ash.

00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:15.720
All that remains of them
now are these gray pearls.

00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:21.380
But it is what we have and God
willing we can open the books again

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:26.120
and let the pearls shine forth
for us all to see in the future.

00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:28.510
Thank you very much.

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:33.160
[ Applause ]

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:35.800
We have just a few
minutes left for questions.

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:37.540
Does anybody have any?

00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:38.840
Oh, we can go a little
bit over, okay,

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:40.450
we have more than a few
minutes left of course.

00:52:40.450 --> 00:52:41.750
Way in the back.

00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:46.010
&gt;&gt; I have a question about
talking about the Nazi [inaudible].

00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:47.310
&gt;&gt; Rabbi Mark Glickman: Yes.

00:52:47.310 --> 00:52:53.110
&gt;&gt; Would somebody like
that eventually be indicted

00:52:53.110 --> 00:52:54.410
for war crimes?

00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:55.710
&gt;&gt; Rabbi Mark Glickman: Yeah.

00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:57.010
I'll repeat the question.

00:52:57.010 --> 00:52:58.310
The question is were these
Nazi Judaic scholars indicted

00:52:58.310 --> 00:52:59.610
for war crimes?

00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:03.910
And the answer is some of them were
kind of a little bit, but not much.

00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:09.170
Johannes Pohl lived out his
life I think he got captured

00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:12.170
for a little while but
released shortly afterwards

00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:13.470
and he lived out his life.

00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:15.790
I think, something is
telling me he moved to Canada

00:53:15.790 --> 00:53:17.840
after the war but I'm not sure.

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:21.370
Alfred Rosenberg who was the
head of all these scholars,

00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:26.130
he was tried at Nuremberg
in the first you know wave

00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:28.640
of Nuremberg trials
and he was executed.

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:33.250
Most of the others were
punished hardly at all.

00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:38.060
Hardly at and that's one of the
great tragedies if you will is

00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:42.150
that these guys you know they had
a lot of these guys after the war,

00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:47.190
they knew where a lot of these
guys were but there was no effort

00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:50.600
to really make them accountable
for what they had done.

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:52.400
Yes, ma'am.

00:53:52.400 --> 00:54:14.520
[ Inaudible ]

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:16.010
You know what?

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:20.320
I think the broader question
is why did they bother holding

00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:21.620
onto this stuff?

00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:25.450
Yes. So why did they bother and
that's of course the question

00:54:25.450 --> 00:54:29.130
and I've got a great book I
can suggest to read about that

00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:30.780
which is available in
the back of the room

00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:33.890
by the way, and available on audio.

00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:36.820
But there are a few
answers to that question.

00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:40.900
First, the Nazis were
trying to show themselves

00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:44.560
to be cultured and
enlightened people.

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:49.960
They were very proud and
Germany had long been a culture

00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:56.360 position:56%
that prided itself on its books,
and so you know this was great poets

00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:00.060
and novelists and writers
had all come from Germany

00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:05.090
and so they were working very
hard to show themselves to be,

00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:10.910
to be an enlightened people, a
scholarly intellectual people.

00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:16.050
This was the intellectual veneer
that was put over the ugliness

00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:18.960
of Nazi Germany, that's
one reason they did it.

00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:22.090 position:56%
The other reason or among the other
reasons, there are a lot of reasons,

00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:24.570
part of it was just triumphalism.

00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:28.010
Look at how we have become victors

00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:30.830
over this vanquished
Jewish civilization.

00:55:30.830 --> 00:55:33.030
I think that's what they
were trying to do as well.

00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:34.330
One of the other phenomena

00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:38.400
in play was what one scholar
called working towards the fuhrer.

00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:41.490
Hitler it turns out
was a very good orator.

00:55:41.490 --> 00:55:43.780
He was not a very good administer.

00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:49.140 position:56%
He would come in late in the day, he
would when his underlings would get

00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:52.100
in fights and conflicts with
one another, he didn't want

00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:53.580
to be bothered with that at all.

00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:56.880
He kind of enjoyed letting
them, watching them fight it

00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:59.180
out amongst themselves and it made

00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:03.670
for a very chaotic administrative
structure within the Nazi regime.

00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:07.770
I touched on that in my talk
and they were all competing,

00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:10.320
they were all trying to
get Hitler's attention,

00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:14.780
and so if your agency could
get more books more material

00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:19.310
than the other Nazi agency,
if Rosenberg's ERR could

00:56:19.310 --> 00:56:25.060
out do the RSHA in their looting
efforts, then that would be a badge

00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:27.030
of pride that they
could wear as they went

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:28.910
and appeared before the fuhrer.

00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:31.150
So they were trying to
impress Hitler as well.

00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:35.390
So there were a lot of reasons that
they did this and it all culminated

00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:42.400
in this largest campaign in
history of literary pillage.

00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:45.380
So that's a partial
answer to your question.

00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:49.630
I'm not sure I have a full answer
but I hope that's a partial answer.

00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:50.930
Other questions.

00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:52.230
Yes, ma'am.

00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:53.650
&gt;&gt; You mentioned the
history of YIVO.

00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:54.950
&gt;&gt; Rabbi Mark Glickman: Yes.

00:56:54.950 --> 00:57:03.260
&gt;&gt; And I feel like I should
know the answer already

00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:14.030 position:56%
but I don't have it quite in mind,
I know that YIVO is now in New York.

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:15.330
&gt;&gt; Rabbi Mark Glickman: Right.

00:57:15.330 --> 00:57:21.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And I believe that some of the
people got out and were able to come

00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:24.010
to New York [inaudible],
but in terms of the books.

00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:25.310
&gt;&gt; Rabbi Mark Glickman:
In terms of the books.

00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:26.610
&gt;&gt; Did they survive?

00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:27.910
&gt;&gt; Rabbi Mark Glickman: Yes
I should have said that.

00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:29.210
Thank you.

00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:30.510
Some of the books were, they were
able to get out early in the war

00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:32.870
and those went to New York and now
as you said YIVO is at the Center

00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:35.790
For Jewish History in
New York city so many

00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:38.330
of the books got out
early in the war.

00:57:38.330 --> 00:57:41.370
The ones that the Paper
Brigade tried to save,

00:57:41.370 --> 00:57:45.490
the majority of them were hit in
bombing raids especially the ones

00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:46.790
that were hid in the YIVO facility.

00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:49.630
That was hit by allied
bombs and not all of them

00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:52.280
but the majority of
them were destroyed.

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:55.420
Some of them survived and they
were able to get out a good number

00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:56.720
of them and bring them
to New York after the war

00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:58.520
but the majority sadly
did not survive the war.

00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:13.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:14.340
Yeah. The short answer

00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:17.960
to your question is the question
is did they organize these books

00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:21.070
at all and if so how?

00:58:21.070 --> 00:58:25.400
The answer is no, they didn't
because there were just so many

00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:26.730
of them they weren't able to.

00:58:26.730 --> 00:58:32.450 position:56%
There were a few small efforts to do
so like the books in Schloss Hungen.

00:58:32.450 --> 00:58:36.670
They started to categorize them
but they were just such a huge mass

00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:39.260
of material and they
were all different kinds

00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:41.900
of books that were looted.

00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:46.040 position:56%
There were you know priceless
manuscripts as well as trashy novels

00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:49.160
and children's activity books
and everything in between

00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:51.320
so there was just so much material

00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:56.410
that they simply didn't
have time to organize it.

00:58:56.410 --> 00:58:58.610
That was I think that was the
idea that they would get to it

00:58:58.610 --> 00:59:02.890
after the war once
that collected it.

00:59:02.890 --> 00:59:04.690
Yes, sir.

00:59:04.690 --> 00:59:27.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:31.340
We, and it perversely we have the
Nazis to thank for preserving some

00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:35.330
of the Jewish books
from before the war.

00:59:35.330 --> 00:59:40.310
Because they collected them and
because they brought them into what

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:44.750
at least for a time were secure
places, they saved what may have

00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:48.620
in many cases been books that
would have been destroyed,

00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:52.940
certainly whole titles and many
times priceless manuscripts,

00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:55.580
they saved them in many cases.

00:59:55.580 --> 01:00:00.970
So we do have Nazis to thank for
that in a perverse kind of a way.

01:00:00.970 --> 01:00:03.830
Yes. Was that your question?

01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:07.290
Yes. Other questions.

01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:12.510
This looks like it's going to be
our final question so make it good.

01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:29.060
[ Inaudible ]

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:32.090
No, I think that the question
is what happened to the books

01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:33.660
that went into the DP camps?

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:38.640
And I think they eventually they
were eventually don't quote me

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:42.440
on this but I think they were
eventually sent back into JCR,

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:46.650
the Jewish Cultural Reconstruction
and then went back into the system.

01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:50.080
Yeah. Well thank you very
much for this opportunity.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:53.190
It was a delight to speak to you.

01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:56.830

of the Library of Congress.
