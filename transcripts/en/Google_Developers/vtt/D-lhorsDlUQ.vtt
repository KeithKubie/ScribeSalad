00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.410
LUKE DAVIS: Welcome
to "Assistant On Air,"

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.990
where we talk to the experts
behind the Google Assistant.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.550
I'll be your host
today, Luke Davis,

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.100
an engineer who works on
the Actions on Google team.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.080
I build tools for developers.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.362
And I'll be interviewing my dear
friend, Jessica Dene Early-Cha.

00:00:19.362 --> 00:00:21.570
Jessica, why don't you tell
everybody about yourself?

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.487
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: So
I'm a Developer Advocate

00:00:23.487 --> 00:00:24.500
for Google Assistant.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.430
So I sit right across from you.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.740
So I get to work with you
all day, which is exciting.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.560
But a lot of what I do is
I get to be able to build

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.390
actions for Google Assistant.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.930
And so I build out
functionalities and different

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.727
experiences that users can have.

00:00:37.727 --> 00:00:39.810
And by doing that, I learn
more about the product.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.840
And if I see anything
that's not going well,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.970
be able to tell the product
team, the engineers who

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:44.930
are building it.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.080
And then I get to build out
contents like blogs and videos

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.480
like this and share that
out to the community,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.700
and be able to go and meet
with other developers,

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.090
hear their feedback of,
like, what's not going right.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.002
And then I could
grab that and then

00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:00.210
take that feedback in and
give it to the product team

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.820
so we can make our
product better.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.810
LUKE DAVIS: So you're
like an ambassador

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.470
between the developer community.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.020
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Yeah,
I like to think of that.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.230
Yeah, totally.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.860
LUKE DAVIS: --and the rest
of the engineering team.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.430
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Between both.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.763
Yeah, so it's a nice little--
it's an interesting space,

00:01:09.763 --> 00:01:12.530
because of course, you're
so close to the product

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.665
that you know the ins and outs.

00:01:14.665 --> 00:01:16.040
But because you're
so close, it's

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.910
hard to see those blind spots.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.910
And so it's nice to like,
OK, let me go and meet

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.860
with actual people who
are working on this

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.260
and be able to feel like,
oh, that doesn't make sense,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.510
or this makes sense, or maybe
this is a better option,

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.500
and be able to get that
and make it better.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.795
So it's amazing space.

00:01:29.795 --> 00:01:31.920
LUKE DAVIS: That sounds
like the most fun job ever.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.545
You're just like,
you make cool things,

00:01:33.545 --> 00:01:34.680
talk to a couple of people.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.076
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Totally.

00:01:36.076 --> 00:01:37.670
LUKE DAVIS: Do you have a
thing that you can show us?

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.670
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Oh,
my gosh, so I've recently

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.410
been building an action that's
all about supporting developers

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.110
on kind of learning how to
practice for whiteboarding--

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.630
technical whiteboarding
interviews.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.030
LUKE DAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.840
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: And
so I could definitely

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.870
show you how to do this.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.720
And so I'm going to activate it.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.822
Hey, Google, talk to
whiteboarding practice.

00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:54.780
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Sure.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.792
Let's get
whiteboarding practice.

00:01:56.792 --> 00:01:57.292
[CHIME]

00:01:57.292 --> 00:01:59.210
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.954
GOOGLE ASSISTANT:
Welcome back, Jessica.

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:04.550
Let's get ready to do some
whiteboarding challenges.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.940
I can give you
random challenges.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:06.440
Are you--

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.150
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: So pretty
much is it activated my action,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.233
and then it talks to you.

00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:11.900
And so I can have a
conversation with it

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.090
and ask it for whiteboarding
problems that are hard or easy.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.870
And then I could, in real time,
be able to get a whiteboard

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.210
and try to solve those problems.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.570
LUKE DAVIS: That is so sweet.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.490
Did you actually have to
record the audio for that?

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.820
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: No.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.862
So what's really great is
it makes it super easy,

00:02:24.862 --> 00:02:26.110
where it's just text--

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.540
LUKE DAVIS: Oh, wow.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.440
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: --that
I send to Google Assistant,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.773
and Google Assistant will
translate that text to speech.

00:02:29.773 --> 00:02:32.180
So I'm not actually
having to handle

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.478
all of the voices and the
audio, which is really nice.

00:02:34.478 --> 00:02:35.270
LUKE DAVIS: Really?

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.890
Well, I thought I
heard, like, a ukulele

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:37.900
or something in the background.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:38.060
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Yeah.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.935
Yeah, there's a little
bit of music on there.

00:02:39.935 --> 00:02:43.350
So I'm using what's called SSML,
which is Synthetic Speak Markup

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.850
Language.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:44.150
LUKE DAVIS: OK.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.410
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
And you can add audio,

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.097
and you could add,
like, silly voices.

00:02:47.097 --> 00:02:49.430
You can even have it where
it's layered to really create

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.080
a rich experience for users.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.390
LUKE DAVIS: Oh, how neat.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.980
So help me understand what's
actually happening here.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.060
We've got this phone.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.550
I assume you can do the same
thing on, like, a Google Home.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.150
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Oh, totally.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.858
Yeah, I'm going to be
on the Google Home,

00:03:00.858 --> 00:03:02.682
meaning there's headphones.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:03.890
Gosh, there's smart displays.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:04.880
There are so many
different devices

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.130
that support Google Assistant.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.090
LUKE DAVIS: Cool.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.780
So the user talks to the
phone or the Google Home,

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.470
and they say, I want to talk
to Jessica's awesome app.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.740
And then somehow, some
code that you wrote

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.710
gets executed and then
return to the user.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.600
So can you kind of
walk me through what's

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.260
actually happening there?

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.635
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
Totally, yeah.

00:03:25.635 --> 00:03:28.250
So when the user
says the activation,

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.850
to talk to the action's name,
Google Assistant will hear that

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.368
and will figure out
what do they mean,

00:03:34.368 --> 00:03:36.660
if that is something that's
being explicitly triggered,

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.790
which means its actual name.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.373
Or they might be
able to say something

00:03:39.373 --> 00:03:41.180
like, I want to
practice whiteboarding

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.640
for technical interviews--
could potentially trigger this

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.192
as well.

00:03:44.192 --> 00:03:46.400
And so Google Assistant will
figure that out and then

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.398
surface it to the user.

00:03:47.398 --> 00:03:48.440
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Mm-hmm.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.857
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
And that's when

00:03:49.857 --> 00:03:52.370
it pings my code in my back
end, and like, hey, somebody

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.200
is asking for your
device, for your action.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.650
And that's where I would
surface the welcome greeting,

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.260
like, hey, welcome to my action.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.720
LUKE DAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.040
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: And so
there's that back and forth

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.160
dialog that happens.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.800
And that's something
that it could

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.610
be built in multiple ways.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.332
The way I built this one was
using a tool called Dialogflow.

00:04:08.332 --> 00:04:10.040
LUKE DAVIS: OK, tell
me about Dialogflow.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.030
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
Yeah, so Dialogflow--

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.147
because you can imagine.

00:04:12.147 --> 00:04:13.730
People are-- we're
all a little funky.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.105
We all see things
a little weird.

00:04:15.105 --> 00:04:19.600
I know I'm not the best when it
comes to speaking well English.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.430
And so there's people like me
out there that can make it--

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.340
it can be a little
harder to write

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.280
a regular expression, trying to
bring out what I actually mean.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.650
LUKE DAVIS: Oh, yeah.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.270
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
Imagine having

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.430
to handle different ways
someone might ask for something.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.270
LUKE DAVIS: That
would be a nightmare.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.312
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Right.

00:04:36.312 --> 00:04:39.065
And so Dialogflow, what that
does, it uses machine learning,

00:04:39.065 --> 00:04:40.940
and it becomes my natural
language processor.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.870
And so what we could do with
Dialogflow is I feed in--

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.600
if somebody says something
like this, this, and this,

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.470
for it to hit my back end
and this part of my code.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.150
And so for this
example, I have it

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.120
where if somebody says something
like, give me a challenge,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.150
give me a random challenge, or
a hard challenge, or a question,

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.730
it hits my back end for
code that says, ask problem.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.370
And then from there, I
go to look up my database

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.320
on the problem I
want to give them,

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.180
send that back to
Dialogflow, which

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.680
sends it to Google Assistant.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.580
And this is all text.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.770
And Google Assistant
translates that text to speech,

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:16.670
sends it to the device.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:17.540
And then the user gets it.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.350
LUKE DAVIS: How cool.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.850
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: And that
happens all real quick.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.310
LUKE DAVIS: So you don't
have to be a machine learning

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.200
expert or anything like that.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.440
The Dialogflow platform
is what gives you this--

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.150
I don't know what to
think about this--

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.217
like a machine learning-powered
regular expression almost?

00:05:32.217 --> 00:05:33.800
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
Yeah, it's amazing.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.758
It's such a great tool.

00:05:34.758 --> 00:05:36.350
Because again, you
don't have to learn

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.920
and have to know everything.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.700
You just have to be thoughtful
on the types of training

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.710
phrases you give it.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:42.260
LUKE DAVIS: Training phrases.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.380
OK, yeah.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.860
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
And making sure

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.870
that those training
phrases fit within what

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.102
your expectations are.

00:05:46.102 --> 00:05:47.810
And I like to think
of creating-- they're

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.520
called intents in Dialogflow.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.590
And I like to think of it
like the functionality,

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.590
like what type of options do
I want to provide to my users.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.330
Like, what's the
functionality part.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.075
And to trigger
that functionality,

00:05:58.075 --> 00:06:00.200
that's the training phrases
that the user will say.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.710
LUKE DAVIS: I see.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.390
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: And
so when they say that,

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.400
triggers that functionality,
which triggers my code,

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.025
and my code will
respond appropriately.

00:06:06.025 --> 00:06:08.450
LUKE DAVIS: OK, and
so in a lot of ways,

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.522
it's almost like a GET
request to an Express server

00:06:11.522 --> 00:06:12.480
or something like that.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.855
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
Totally, yeah.

00:06:13.855 --> 00:06:16.382
I like to think of it
definitely like when

00:06:16.382 --> 00:06:18.590
it comes to, like, web
requests, you could definitely

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.540
think of it as a resource
that you're just asking for.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.350
And so imagine having instead
of tons of different resources

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.647
available, you could use machine
learning to just have one,

00:06:27.647 --> 00:06:29.480
and that if anyone says
a variation of that,

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.380
it triggers that one.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.910
LUKE DAVIS: How neat.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.570
Can the Dialogflow
platform pull details out

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.560
of the user's speech?

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.120
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
That's a great question.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.320
Yeah.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.930
So it can.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.110
They're called entities.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.830
And what happens there
is for this example,

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.540
again, if someone
asks for a question,

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.915
I'll give them a
random question.

00:06:45.915 --> 00:06:47.690
But if they say, I
want an easy question,

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.640
I should give them an
easy question, right?

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.150
LUKE DAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.608
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: And so you
could pull those out and then

00:06:52.608 --> 00:06:54.290
be able to use that in my code.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.753
So with Dialogflow, you can
have that be required or not.

00:06:57.753 --> 00:06:59.420
And so if someone
doesn't give it to me,

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.670
and I say it's required,
Dialogflow will respond back,

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.700
hey, what type of
level do you want?

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.160
And you could code
that yourself.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.750
Or you give the
option like I have,

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.050
where if they gave
it to me, great.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.290
If they don't, I'll do random.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.720
LUKE DAVIS: How neat.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.260
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
And so it depends

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.880
on how you want to
handle it as a developer.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.530
LUKE DAVIS: That's
super, super cool.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.170
It sounds like there are
tons of different services.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.530
Like, you mentioned your phone
and the actual Google Home

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:20.030
itself.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:20.480
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Yeah.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.860
LUKE DAVIS: Like, how do
you build your application

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.660
to accommodate both
of those things?

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:25.200
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Totally.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.075
And this is where it
gets really interesting.

00:07:27.075 --> 00:07:29.040
Because when you're
building, we generally

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.960
recommend build a voice first.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.990
Build it as though there's
no screen, so that way,

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.190
you're actually building
for the conversation.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.180
And that is, in my opinion,
one of the hardest parts.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.650
And so if you
could focus on that

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.210
and have a really
good experience

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:45.060
when it's just voice only, that
means when you have things--

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.750
I have screens, like your
phone, or smart displays,

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:52.830
or other elements, then you
could add and enrich those

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.510
using visuals to it.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.310
So that way, on the
different devices

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.010
that are available for Google.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.010
So soon you could
have those options.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.638
And as a developer, you can
know whether they have a screen

00:08:02.638 --> 00:08:03.930
or if they don't have a screen.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.930
So then you can be able to give
the different experiences based

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:08.600
off of the device
that the users have.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.392
LUKE DAVIS: Own it.

00:08:09.392 --> 00:08:11.580
So how far can I push this?

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.340
Like, can I do other stuff, like
maybe an image or something?

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:14.740
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Totally.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:14.950
Yeah.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:16.700
So when it comes to
the visual components,

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.800
we have, of course,
images and buttons.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.460
And those little
button things are

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.500
called suggestion chips, which
is a great design element.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:28.200
So let's say if you're my user
and I ask you a question--

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.257
and there's kind of
common responses--

00:08:30.257 --> 00:08:32.549
instead of you having to
figure out and think about it,

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:34.559
I could just have
a suggestion chip.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:36.476
That way, it's easier
for you to just be like,

00:08:36.476 --> 00:08:37.240
yeah, that option.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.520
That's what I like.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.580
Or if I have something
that has account linking

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.080
and I know something about you,
that your favorite color is

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.830
blue, I could always make sure
I offer you blue things instead

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:48.100
of other things too.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:52.980
And so you have that level
of customize experience

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:53.803
for your users too.

00:08:53.803 --> 00:08:56.220
LUKE DAVIS: What if I wanted
to make, like, a little robot

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.200
and put the Google
Assistant in it?

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.630
Or want to make some kind of,
like, cool art installation

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.550
and make it, like,
voice interactive?

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:03.550
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Yeah.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:04.765
Oh, gosh.

00:09:04.765 --> 00:09:06.640
First thing I'm thinking
about is Smart Home.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:06.780
LUKE DAVIS: OK.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:07.410
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: So
if you want something

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.530
where you're kind of
integrating into the IoT space,

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.800
you totally can, which
is really exciting.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.800
One of my coworkers
recently found

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.620
a ball that moves on its own.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.402
LUKE DAVIS: OK.

00:09:21.402 --> 00:09:23.230
Like a little spherical
robot or something?

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.000
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
Like a little sphere.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.500
Yeah.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.620
And it just rolls around.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.870
And he connected that to
an action he built out.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.570
And so he has two little girls.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.610
And his little
girls tell the ball

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:36.568
to move forward really fast
or for a long distance.

00:09:36.568 --> 00:09:38.860
And so they can control the
ball with just their voice,

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:39.415
which is adorable.

00:09:39.415 --> 00:09:40.582
LUKE DAVIS: That's adorable.

00:09:40.582 --> 00:09:41.257
Oh, my gosh.

00:09:41.257 --> 00:09:42.840
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
So you can do a lot

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.130
of really cool integration.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:45.755
And then something
that I do at my home

00:09:45.755 --> 00:09:48.760
is I don't touch light
switches anymore.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.120
I just tell Google Assistant
to turn off my lights

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.670
in the master bedroom
or all the lights.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.322
I even have it to
where I have routines,

00:09:56.322 --> 00:09:58.530
which is a Google Assistant
feature, where I can just

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.870
tell Google, I'm going
to bed or good night.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:02.905
And it will turn off
all the lights for me,

00:10:02.905 --> 00:10:03.780
which is really nice.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:04.260
LUKE DAVIS: That's awesome.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:04.900
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Yeah.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.450
LUKE DAVIS: So I
assume that you were

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.117
doing other kinds of engineering
before you got into this crazy,

00:10:09.117 --> 00:10:11.970
like, voice conversation world.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.400
Like, what are the
lessons that you

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.465
have had to pick up
in this new space

00:10:16.465 --> 00:10:18.090
that you didn't have
necessarily coming

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.800
from web or mobile
development background?

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.130
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Definitely.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.320
Something that
whenever I do a talk,

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.930
I usually tell people--
because I want people

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:26.460
to learn from my mistakes.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.918
I'm definitely one
of those people,

00:10:27.918 --> 00:10:30.000
like, I've done this
mistake, please don't do it.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.770
It's not worth the time
to suffer through this.

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:36.360
So something I did that was
horrible was I went to the docs

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.280
and I was reading.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.580
And the first thing was
like, make a design just

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.455
on your conversation.

00:10:40.455 --> 00:10:42.450
And I was like,
skip, skip, skip.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:43.950
Because I wanted
to get to the code.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:45.432
Because I'm a developer.

00:10:45.432 --> 00:10:46.890
I want to actually
build something.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:51.060
And as I was doing that,
I realized, oh, crap.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.617
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:10:52.617 --> 00:10:53.950
And it's not the technical part.

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:57.542
It's not the actually be
able to query my database

00:10:57.542 --> 00:10:58.500
to generate a response.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.120
Like, that stuff
is basic coding.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.450
That's not the hard part.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:03.000
It's the designing
the conversation.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.168
And at any point, the user could
say something totally random.

00:11:06.168 --> 00:11:06.960
LUKE DAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.400
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: And
that's how people are.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.040
And how do you code it so
it can handle that and guide

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.390
the user through it?

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:16.910
And so when it comes to mobile
development or web development,

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.660
as a developer, you
have a lot of control.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:19.520
This is my image.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.380
This is a screen.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.422
This is the page you see.

00:11:21.422 --> 00:11:22.880
And these are the
buttons you have.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:23.580
And that's it.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.720
When it comes to
conversation, you

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.420
have to release a
lot of that control

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:30.540
and allow your user to figure
out where the boundaries are

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.193
and guide them to what options
you have that's possible.

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:35.610
LUKE DAVIS: That seems like
such a different frame of mind

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:37.140
than what I do when
I'm building a web app.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:37.580
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Totally.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.010
Totally.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:38.400
Totally.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.817
LUKE DAVIS: So how
do you do that?

00:11:39.817 --> 00:11:42.710
Like, if you were actually
to not hit the skip,

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.783
skip, skip and so the
conversation design thing,

00:11:45.783 --> 00:11:47.200
what does that
actually look like?

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:47.640
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Totally.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.810
So I had to do that.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:50.310
And now, whenever
I meld any action,

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.110
that's the first thing I do.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:54.245
A nice easy way-- there's
tons of documentation

00:11:54.245 --> 00:11:54.870
that helps you.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.670
But something I
really like to go into

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.930
is, I love to get people and
go, OK, you are the action

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:00.930
and this is what you do.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.318
And I like to get someone
else, you're the user.

00:12:03.318 --> 00:12:04.860
And then have the
conversation and be

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:05.970
able to write it out down.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:08.550
That way I can see how people
might say something different.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:09.970
And then what I like
to do after that,

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:11.730
get a little bit of a
sample, it's turn around,

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.710
get two other new random
people, you're this,

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:16.243
this is what you are, and
then just document that down.

00:12:16.243 --> 00:12:18.160
And that usually gives
me a nice base of like,

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.480
oh, this is kind of how
people talk about this concept

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.250
and they might navigate
through things.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:23.525
LUKE DAVIS: Yeah.

00:12:23.525 --> 00:12:23.800
Yeah.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.175
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
And so that's

00:12:25.175 --> 00:12:27.490
one way that's really easy
to be able to build out,

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:29.448
but by all means, there's
so much documentation

00:12:29.448 --> 00:12:31.530
that you could get,
that's out there,

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:32.950
that really helps support this.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:36.300
But it is kind of hard to get
something that's not visual

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.100
and make it, write it
down, have a visual,

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.830
because again, the conversation
could go anywhere at any point.

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.970
So that's just a starting ground
to at least get you going.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.790
And then after that you start
realizing, oh, people actually

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:50.170
want you to repeat yourself
every once in a while.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:53.140
So that's something that
you would want to have,

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.170
I think, in every action,
to be able to have

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:56.010
that functionality.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:59.930
So you start noticing some
common practices from there.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:00.870
LUKE DAVIS: OK.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:03.030
So what sorts of
things are-- like

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.890
you just said that
repeating things

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.797
is kind of the
common functionality

00:13:06.797 --> 00:13:09.130
that lots and lots of people
might want in their action.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:10.200
Am I getting the
terminology right?

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.200
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yes.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.060
LUKE DAVIS: OK.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:16.080
What sorts of things are built
into kind of help developers

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.730
along the path of making these
things a little bit easier?

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:25.080
Am I going to have to
write my own account

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.772
linking software or
asking for location

00:13:28.772 --> 00:13:29.980
software, that sort of thing?

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.022
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:13:31.022 --> 00:13:33.390
So we provide a lot
of great helpers.

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:36.900
And so things that are something
that you would want to expect,

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.030
like an E in
someone's name, there

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:40.530
is a helper method
that could you.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:42.562
And what's really nice
is it's very explicit,

00:13:42.562 --> 00:13:44.020
where Google will
take over and go,

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.812
hey, do you want to
share this information?

00:13:45.812 --> 00:13:48.240
And so it's all about
user privacy first.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.680
And so we do have
some permissions

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.990
that you could use to
gather that information.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.420
When it comes to the user's
name and their family name

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.240
and their photo
and their location,

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.540
not necessarily
precise location,

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.440
but it could be like
a zip code location.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.940
And then, of course
account linking,

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.398
where you can build
that out and be

00:14:04.398 --> 00:14:06.570
able to connect their
account to a database

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:07.750
that you might have as well.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:09.900
So there's a lot of tons
of resources that could

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.130
support that functionality.

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:12.490
LUKE DAVIS: That's
super, super cool.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:13.270
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.420
LUKE DAVIS: So I am super
inspired by this thing

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.212
that you've built. How
long did it actually

00:14:17.212 --> 00:14:18.712
take you to put
this thing together?

00:14:18.712 --> 00:14:20.879
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: It's
taken me a couple of weeks,

00:14:20.879 --> 00:14:23.490
but that's also because I do
other things during the day.

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.782
And this was actually my
first action I had ever built,

00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:28.703
so it took way longer because
I was struggling on some parts.

00:14:28.703 --> 00:14:30.120
I'm like, this
doesn't make sense.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.537
And that's when I
realized, I need

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:34.810
a design to follow and be
able to figure this out.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:38.217
So I built this out, I would
say, in a couple of weeks

00:14:38.217 --> 00:14:40.050
because it was still
all new and I was still

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:43.348
learning all the other
things, being new to Google

00:14:43.348 --> 00:14:43.890
at that time.

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:45.990
LUKE DAVIS: So you didn't do
any kind of conversational voice

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.010
stuff before Google at all?

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:47.580
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Oh, no.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:48.270
No.

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:51.518
Well having conversations with
people, I do that all the time.

00:14:51.518 --> 00:14:53.560
LUKE DAVIS: Which you're
really the best at, too.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:53.970
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
And that's what

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:57.060
I think is really nice,
is that this space is not

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:02.970
where it's an expertise so
specialized that it's only

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:03.790
for a few people.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:07.720
This is really something that
everybody, since we're born,

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.760
we learned how to
communicate with one another

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.620
and it's all about capturing
that and being able to code

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.110
it and see, does this work?

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.620
And it's still so new that
there is not a definite,

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.540
this is how all
actions should be.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.940
Kind of like with
mobile or with web,

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.600
there is a sense
of best practices,

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.150
this is how things
should happen.

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.782
And users have an expectation
that, if I click on something,

00:15:26.782 --> 00:15:28.740
it should go in the cart
and the cart's usually

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.233
on the right top corner.

00:15:30.233 --> 00:15:32.400
There's certain things that
users are familiar with,

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.830
and with Voice, we're
still in this new space

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:36.485
that there's not that norm.

00:15:36.485 --> 00:15:37.860
So this is a really
exciting time

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.650
to be able to get your hands
in and get dirty and try

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.022
to help mold what that would
look like in the future.

00:15:43.022 --> 00:15:44.480
LUKE DAVIS: That
is super exciting.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.110
I'm so glad that you
get to work on this.

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:48.296
You're such a joy to work with
and so inspiring in the stuff

00:15:48.296 --> 00:15:48.660
that you work on.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:48.750
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
Oh, thank you.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.063
Gee, I appreciate it.

00:15:50.063 --> 00:15:51.480
LUKE DAVIS: Is
there anything else

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.180
that you'd like to talk about,
maybe around the best practices

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:54.680
stuff?

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.990
I know we talked about
having these conversations

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:59.880
between a few people
before you get started

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.920
to get an example of
the kinds of things

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.850
that you might include
in your action.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:08.810
Are there any other common
best practices for getting

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:10.060
started in the this new space?

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:10.920
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
I usually suggest

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.670
people, who are really
excited about this,

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.460
is go on our Codelabs
and that way you

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:18.240
can learn about how to
build your first action,

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.240
and that back and forth.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.205
And you build your first
round of conversation

00:16:21.205 --> 00:16:22.080
on the first Codelab.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.788
And then the second
one takes it further,

00:16:23.788 --> 00:16:26.150
where you're having
multi-turn conversation.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.830
And then the third one actually
talks more about best practices

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.220
and how you should
greet your user.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.762
Because you don't want to have
it where every time you see me

00:16:32.762 --> 00:16:33.665
I go, "Hi, Luke."

00:16:33.665 --> 00:16:35.790
And like the next time you
see me I go, "Hi, Luke."

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:36.790
It doesn't feel natural.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:38.940
So having that variety
within the conversation

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.170
is always nice too.

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:40.950
LUKE DAVIS: Yeah.

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:42.300
Yeah.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.950
It feels like such a
different kind of thing to me

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:49.230
than the kind of mobile
or web development

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.090
that I've done in the past.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:53.670
In a way, it kind of feels--

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:55.612
it feels inherently social.

00:16:55.612 --> 00:16:56.820
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Oh, yeah.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.370
You couldn't just
necessarily, as a developer,

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:01.900
get this project
and be like, oh,

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.330
yeah I'm going to see you
guys in a couple days,

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.220
hide in a little nook
and code it by yourself.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:05.495
LUKE DAVIS: Right.

00:17:05.495 --> 00:17:05.770
Right.

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:07.210
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
It's generally not

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:07.930
what you want to do.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:09.190
Because you want to
share with other people

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:11.650
and with your designer and
get feedback and see like,

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:12.569
does this make sense?

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:18.438
And even when it comes to the
way you write the actual words,

00:17:18.438 --> 00:17:20.230
you don't want something
that's too formal.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.772
Because the way we write is very
formal, but the way we speak

00:17:22.772 --> 00:17:23.380
is informal.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:28.359
And so using the words,
"I will go to the store, "

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:29.500
is a little too formal.

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.030
Generally we say, "I'm
going to the store."

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:34.397
And so it's little things
that you don't notice it

00:17:34.397 --> 00:17:36.730
until you hear it, and you
have other people hearing it,

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:40.458
and it's like, oh,
yeah, that sounds weird.

00:17:40.458 --> 00:17:42.310
LUKE DAVIS: That's
really interesting.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.120
OK.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.640
So being able to have
varied responses, right?

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.640
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yes.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:52.000
LUKE DAVIS: Doing this demo back
and forth, with actual humans,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:52.668
beforehand.

00:17:52.668 --> 00:17:53.710
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:55.210
LUKE DAVIS: Keeping
humans in the loop

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:56.650
throughout the
development process,

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.150
to make sure that
it sounds natural,

00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:59.470
using more informal language.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:02.220
It sounds like you're
an expert on all this.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.720
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Well, I
have been spending a lot of time

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.450
with it, so.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:07.690
And all this is, again,
in the Docs that we have.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.990
And we have technical Docs
and we also have design Docs.

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:13.330
And so when you want to
just talk about design,

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:14.770
that I found to be really rich.

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:16.720
I'm like, oh, I never
thought about that.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.720
How do you tell a user,
if you don't hear them,

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:23.050
it's not their fault that
we didn't hear them and?

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:25.750
And owning it as the
developer, like, I'm

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:28.570
sorry I didn't hear you,
versus say that again.

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:30.960
Like those little things,
I'm like, oh, yeah,

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.960
I never thought of that.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.380
It's all there,
which is exciting.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.090
LUKE DAVIS: Wow.

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:37.040
How long have you been
working on the platform?

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.340
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: It's
been a year, recently.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:40.940
LUKE DAVIS: Congratulations
on your Googleversary!

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:41.160
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Thanks.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:41.680
Thank you.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.150
Thanks.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:45.880
Yeah, so it's still,
again, a new space.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.130
So this is really exciting
because any developer could

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:51.160
kind of just jump on
right now and you'll

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.990
be part of the
first kind of wave

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:54.832
of people being able
to build for Voice.

00:18:54.832 --> 00:18:55.540
LUKE DAVIS: Yeah.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.778
That's super exciting.

00:18:56.778 --> 00:18:57.196
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:18:57.196 --> 00:18:58.450
LUKE DAVIS: Oh, my gosh.

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:00.635
So do you have any
resources or references,

00:19:00.635 --> 00:19:02.260
things that you would
like to encourage

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.280
other people to look at?

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:03.940
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
Oh, my first thing

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.330
I always recommend, Codelabs.

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.330
Go to the Codelabs, it's
Codelabs.Google.com.

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:11.048
That is the spot where you could
really onboard you onto it.

00:19:11.048 --> 00:19:12.340
We have tons of videos as well.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.220
LUKE DAVIS: OK.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:15.380
Is there code somewhere
on the web, somewhere?

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.547
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Totally.

00:19:16.547 --> 00:19:17.630
Yeah, so on GitHub.

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:19.750
We have a GitHub rebuild
that has tons of samples,

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:21.122
and they're really great.

00:19:21.122 --> 00:19:23.080
Whenever I start on a
project, that's usually--

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.310
if I have an idea
of what I want,

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:29.110
I like to go there and be like,
what's my boilerplate code.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:33.730
And we also have Sample Actions,
which is this other idea that--

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.800
I know for me, if I'm
learning something,

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.092
the overhead of setup
could be daunting.

00:19:38.092 --> 00:19:38.800
LUKE DAVIS: Yeah.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.550
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA:
And so there is a tool

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:42.400
that we built out
that will give you

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:47.260
a sample agent and
Dialogflow that showcases

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.280
different functionality.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.900
And so there's one
that's that gives jokes.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.450
And so it highlights SSML
with the audio, and like that,

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:59.333
how do you grab information
and back and forthness.

00:19:59.333 --> 00:20:01.000
So instead of having
to build everything

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.830
from scratch, click
on this one button,

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:04.090
it generates it for you.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:06.610
And you can play with it and
there's code already in there

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:09.220
that you could just copy,
paste, and put in your space

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.825
and be able to build off of
that, which is really exciting.

00:20:11.825 --> 00:20:12.700
LUKE DAVIS: How cool.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:13.030
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Yeah.

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:14.170
LUKE DAVIS: Thank you
so much for coming on

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:15.330
to chat with me today, Jessica.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:16.480
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Of
course, my pleasure.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.490
LUKE DAVIS: If people want to
learn more about this software,

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:21.040
like follow along as the field
develops, what should they do?

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:21.520
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Oh, my gosh.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.687
So I usually recommend to
people, go on our Twitter,

00:20:23.687 --> 00:20:25.475
we have actions on
Google Twitter account.

00:20:25.475 --> 00:20:27.850
And if you want to communicate
with other developers that

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:29.225
are building
fractions on Google,

00:20:29.225 --> 00:20:31.210
use the hashtag AoGDevs.

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.972
Let us know what your thoughts
are, what bill building,

00:20:33.972 --> 00:20:36.430
and then you'll be able to
share within the community, too.

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:37.150
LUKE DAVIS: That's so great.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:37.985
Thank you so much.

00:20:37.985 --> 00:20:39.110
JESSICA EARLEY-CHA: Thanks.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:40.280
LUKE DAVIS: We hope
you liked today's show.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.040
