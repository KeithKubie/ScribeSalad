00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.530
- [Instructor] The exchange
students were able to view,

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:03.930
but not handle,

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.020
the fragile artifacts at
the archeological site.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.540
So they've underline fragile.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.730
Maybe you think, do we
not want to change it?

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.590
Is fragile the right word to use,

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.380
or do we want to replace it
with weak, decrepit, or sickly?

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.470
So let's think about it.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.560
Fragile means something that
you can break very easily,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.950
so that actually seems to make sense.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.670
You know, they're not, the
students aren't able to handle

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.070
the artifacts because
they're very easy to break.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.040
So I could imagine that.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.430
The exchange students were
able to view, but not handle,

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.600
the fragile artifacts at
the archeological site.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.520
So I actually like fragile there,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.450
but let's see how the other words fit in.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.560
Weak.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.000
So weak, if you're talking
about a thing being weak,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.486
it means that, okay,
if you were to kind of,

00:00:48.486 --> 00:00:51.570
it wouldn't be able to
support a lot of weight maybe,

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.260
or it does mean that it might kind of fail

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.770
under pressure somehow.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.350
So it is close to fragile.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.990
So, the exchange students were
able to view, but not handle,

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.988
the weak artifacts at
the archeological site.

00:01:03.988 --> 00:01:08.988
Yeah, weak just doesn't as
strongly give this notion of

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.200
being easy to break.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.620
Fragile really talks about
that, and it's very clear,

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.900
okay, you wouldn't want to touch.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.180
You would kind of restrict
people touching something

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.050
that is fragile.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.883
So I don't know.

00:01:18.883 --> 00:01:21.740
This one is, I don't
feel so great about it.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.870
Decrepit.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.100
So decrepit is somethings
that's kind of old or worn out,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.530
and artifacts are old and worn out,

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.036
but you're usually referring to,

00:01:32.036 --> 00:01:34.580
like it could be people or a thing,

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.090
but I kind of think of
something very old and decrepit.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.361
And decrepit by itself isn't
saying why you're not allowed

00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:45.020
to touch it, I guess is the main takeaway.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.553
The exchange students were
able to view, but not handle,

00:01:47.553 --> 00:01:50.860
the decrepit artifacts at
the archeological site.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.250
It's, you know, just because
something is old and worn out

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.550
doesn't mean that that's
the reason not to touch it.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.470
The reason not to touch it

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.070
is because you could break it easily.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.240
So I'll rule this one out.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.480
Then you have sickly.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.320
The exchange students were
able to view, but not handle,

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.127
the sickly artifacts at
the archeological site.

00:02:06.127 --> 00:02:09.510
Well, sickly means, if you're
talking about a person,

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:10.510
which we're not in there,

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.540
it would mean someone who is sick often

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.470
or very easy to get sick,

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.640
or it could mean just
kind of a pungent smell,

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.880
or something that makes you ill,

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.350
and I don't think that's the reason why

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.440
they're not handling it.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.990
If they said the students
were able to view,

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.960
but not smell, maybe you'd
go with the sickly artifacts,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.670
and even that would
sound a little strange.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.800
So the fact, I really like fragile here,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.610
and all of these other ones
don't really feel as good.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.630
So I'm gonna go with NO CHANGE...
