till adulthood so because played it's
 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.750
till adulthood so because played it's
almost impossible to overstate the

and then the fantasy play that enables

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079
and then the fantasy play that enables
 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.869

then the negotiated games that you
 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.229
then the negotiated games that you
talked about that enable people to

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239
talked about that enable people to
 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.080
