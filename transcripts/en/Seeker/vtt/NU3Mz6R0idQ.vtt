00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.043
Imagine a world where
you have your own medical avatar,

00:00:05.043 --> 00:00:09.360
a sci-fi-like profile that’s made
out of your real-time health data.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.440
After all, you can lift up your car hood and
diagnose your engine, or open up a program

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.940
on your computer to see why
it’s not working properly.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.360
So, what if we could do that 
with our own bodies?

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.060
LARRY: When I talked to the doctor, I said,
'Look, here's a problem.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.560
You don't really understand the three-dimensional
structure of the thing you're gonna be operating on,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.240
and I do. But I'm gonna be under anesthesia,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.320
and I can't help you.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.180
And you're gonna have knives inside of me.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.660
And that's messed up.'

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.060
Dr. Larry Smarr has been studying his anatomy
in such minute, extreme detail

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.600
that he recently directed his own surgery, by providing doctors with what is essentially Google Maps

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.360
for his body.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.040
This revolutionary, interdisciplinary thinking
is quickly earning Larry recognition

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.840
as the father of personalized medicine.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.940
LARRY: 'How 'bout you come over to my virtual
reality cave, and, as patient and doctor,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.300
we will look at my full colon and decide where
point A and point B is

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.520
you're gonna make the cut?'

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.720
And she says, 'Wow, that's like my 16-year-olds
do with video games.'

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.120
I said, 'Yeah.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.340
We want to take video games
into the surgery suite.'

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.040
When I was a kid, I got the visible human.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.619
And that was a plastic doll, except it was
transparent, and all the organs were in there.

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.570
And you could take it apart like that.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.030
It was only in the last ten or fifteen years
that I realized that using computer graphics

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.990
and the amazing advances in imaging modalities
like MRI and CAT scan, that we could put those

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:49.340
two together, and actually generate a transparent
version of basically anybody.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.920
Larry has been collecting 3D visualizations
and time-series data on his body for almost

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.380
a decade, and amassing it all into a model
of himself that can be experienced in VR.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.450
He fondly calls this fascinating medical avatar
“Transparent Larry.”

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.769
LARRY: I was tracking my colon 
by using MRI imaging.

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.040
Whenever I had a colonoscopy, I'd tell 'em,
'okay, well, give me the video.'

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.659
I'd spend hours watching the video
inside me.

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.060
It turns out mine comes up, and then it goes,
loops way down.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.879
Quite contorted compared to what the
textbook looked like.

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.550
That's different than the next person.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.260
And that’s different from the next person.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.200
How different?

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.100
Well, we can, through the magic of computer
graphics, know that.

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:35.400
By sifting through his own health data, Larry
was able to work with his doctor to diagnose

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.140
himself with colonic Crohn’s, a form of
inflammatory bowel disease.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.860
LARRY: The time had come to have a resection
of about six to eight inches of the colon.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.699
When it came time for Larry’s operation,
he wanted to make sure his surgeon had access

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:57.209
to all the comprehensive information that
he did, enhancing both their confidence

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.640
in the operating room.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.000
LARRY: One thing that motivates me to do this
work: I just know how terrified people are

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.939
of things like the unknown of surgery.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.000
They don't know because they don't see inside
themselves.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.700
This was a highly trained team; A+.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.520
So if you could remove all of the unknowns
they were gonna run into

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.820
because it's you instead of somebody else, 
then I felt quite calm.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:28.099
And I think that actually meant my body was
able to heal itself much more quickly.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.659
Larry believes the future of medicine will
be to transform our 'sick-care' system

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.480
into a true, preventative 'health-care'
system&nbsp;— by allowing you full access

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.400
to your body's data to make better-informed decisions.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.200
But just how far away is this world of holistic
digital healthcare, where we take charge of

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.440
our well-being using transparent Tamagotchi
versions of ourselves?

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.400
LARRY: The combination of the technology and
the kind of responsibility for themselves

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.700
that you're seeing the millennials take, that's
a good sign.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.870
If we can harness those things together, we
may just get that revolution in personalized

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.310
medicine sooner than we think.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.849
