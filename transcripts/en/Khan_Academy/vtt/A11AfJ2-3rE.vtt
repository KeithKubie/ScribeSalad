00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.220
In this and the
next few videos, I

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.880
hope to explore different types
of regions in three dimensions.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.580
And these will be
useful for thinking

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.860
about how to evaluate different
double and triple integrals

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.660
and also some interesting proofs
in multivariable calculus.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.340
So the first type of region,
and it's appropriately named,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.955
we will call a type 1 region.

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:25.165
At first, I'll give
a formal definition.

00:00:25.165 --> 00:00:26.665
And hopefully, the
formal definition

00:00:26.665 --> 00:00:27.910
makes some intuitive sense.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.329
But then I'll draw a
couple of type 1 regions,

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:31.870
and then I'll show
you what would not

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.840
be a type 1 region
because sometimes that's

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.600
the more important question.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.520
So type 1 region, maybe a type
one region R, is the set--

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.420
and these little curly
brackets means set--

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.500
is the set of all
x, y's, and z's.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.870
It's the set of all
points in three dimensions

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:54.120
such that the x and y's
are part of some domain,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.270
are a member-- that's what
this little symbol represents--

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.960
are a member of some domain.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.400
And z can-- essentially
varies between two functions

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.890
of x and y.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.150
So let me write it over here.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.910
So f1 of x, y is kind
of the lower bound on z.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.320
So this is going to be less
than or equal to z, which

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.950
is less than or equal to
another function of x and y,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.790
which is going to be less than
or equal to f2 of x and y.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.540
And let me close
the curly brackets

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.200
to show that this was all a set.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.980
This is a set of
x, y's, and z's.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.430
And right here, we
are defining that set.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.940
So what would be a
reasonable type 1 region?

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.980
Well, a very simple type
one region is a sphere.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.400
So let me draw a
sphere right over here.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.230
So in a sphere, where it
intersects the x, y plane--

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.090
that's essentially this
domain D right over here.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.510
So I'll do it in blue.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.620
So let me draw my best
attempt at drawing that domain

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.086
so that this is the domain D
right over here for a sphere.

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:01.710
This is a sphere
centered at 0, but you

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.010
could make the same argument
for a sphere anywhere else.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.650
So that is my domain.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.650
And then f1 of x, y, which
is a lower bound of z,

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.430
will be the bottom
half of the sphere.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.160
So you really can't see
it well right over here,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.034
but it would be-- these
contours right over here

00:02:19.034 --> 00:02:20.200
would be on the bottom half.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.020
And I can even color in
this part right over here.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.770
The bottom surface of our
sphere would be f1 of x, y,

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.470
and f2 of x, y as
you could imagine,

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.470
will be the top half of the
sphere, the top hemisphere.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:40.637
So it'll look
something like that.

00:02:40.637 --> 00:02:42.220
This thing that I'm
drawing right over

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.620
here is definitely
a type 1 region.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.470
As we'll see, this could
be a type 1 type 2,

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.530
or a type 3 region.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.480
But it's definitely
a type one region.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.730
Another example of a type 1
region-- and actually this

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.640
might even be more obvious.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.500
So let me draw some
axes again, and let

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.440
me draw some type of a cylinder.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.620
Just to make it clear that
our domain, where the x, y

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.420
plane does not have to
be inside of our region--

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.190
let's imagine a cylinder
that is below-- well,

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.450
actually I'll draw it above--
that is above the x, y plane.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.226
So this is the bottom
of the cylinder.

00:03:20.226 --> 00:03:21.100
It's right over here.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.641
And once again, it
doesn't have to be

00:03:22.641 --> 00:03:24.080
centered around the z-axis.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.400
But I'll do it that way
just for this video.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.780
Actually, I could draw it a
little bit better than that.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.940
So this is the bottom
surface of our cylinder,

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.040
and then the top
surface of our cylinder

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.560
might be right over here.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.220
And these things actually
don't even have to be flat.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.530
They could actually
be curvy in some way.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.650
And in this situation,
so in this cylinder--

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.940
let me draw it a
little bit neater.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.270
In this cylinder
right over here,

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.344
our domain are all of the values
that the x and y's can take on.

00:03:58.344 --> 00:04:00.010
So our domain is going
to be this region

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.080
right over here
in the x, y plane.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.100
And then for each of that,
those x, y pairs, f1 of x, y

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.540
defines the bottom
boundary of our region.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.960
So f1 of x, y is going to
be this right over here.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.890
So you give me any of these
x, y's in this domain D,

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.060
and then you evaluate the
function at those points,

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.620
and it will correspond to
this surface right over here.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.820
And then f2 of x, y,
once again, give me

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.290
any one of those x, y
points in our domain,

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.900
and you evaluate
f2 at those points,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.030
and it will give you
this surface up here.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.080
And we're saying
that z will take

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.160
on all the values in between,
and so it is really this whole

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.210
solid-- it's really
this entire solid area.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.880
Likewise, over
here, z could take

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.150
on any value
between this magenta

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.200
surface and this green surface.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.490
So it would essentially
fill up our entire volume

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.860
so it would become
a solid region.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.030
Now, you might be wondering what
would not be a type 1 region?

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.191
So let's think about that.

00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:04.690
So it would essentially
be something

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.520
that we could not
define in this way,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.630
and I'll try my best to draw it.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.940
But you could
imagine a shape that

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.670
does something funky like this.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.650
So there's like
one big-- I guess

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.470
you could imagine a
sideways dumbbell.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.440
So a sideways
dumbbell-- and I'll

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.570
maybe curve it out a little bit.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.780
So this is the kind of the top
of the dumbbell-- or an hour

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.780
glass, I guess you could
say, or a dumbbell.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.650
It would look
something like that.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.650
So I'm trying my
best to draw it.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.190
It would look
something like that.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.670
And the reason why this is
not definable in this way-- it

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.540
becomes obvious if you kind of
look at a cross section of it.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.280
There's no way to define
only two functions that's

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.490
a lower bound and an
upper bound in terms of z.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.310
So even if you say, hey, maybe
my domain will be all of the x,

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.470
y values that can
be taken on-- let

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.610
me see how well I can draw this.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.750
So you say my x,
y values-- so let

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.130
me try to draw this whole
thing a little bit better,

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.240
a better attempt.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.130
So you might say, OK, for
something like a dumbbell--

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.220
let me clear out
that part as well.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.866
For something like a dumbbell--
so let me erase that.

00:06:20.866 --> 00:06:22.490
So for something like
a dumbbell, maybe

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.100
my domain is right over here.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.140
So these are all the x, y
values that you can take on.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.553
But in order to have a
dumbbell shape, for any one x,

00:06:34.553 --> 00:06:36.980
y, z is going to
take on-- there's not

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.040
just an upper and a lower
bound, and z doesn't

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.430
take on all values in between.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.110
Well, let me just draw
it a more clearly.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.010
So our dumbbell-- maybe
it's centered on the z-axis.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.610
This is the middle
of our dumbbell,

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.800
and then it comes out like that.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.350
And then up here, the z-axis--
so it looks like that.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.320
And then it goes
below the x, y plane,

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.360
and it does kind
of a similar thing.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.220
It goes below the x, y plane
and looks something like that.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.690
So notice, for any
given x, y, what

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.810
would be-- if you attempted
to make it a type 1 region,

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:14.410
you would say, well, maybe
this is the top surface.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:20.030
And maybe you would say down
here is the bottom surface.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.590
But notice, z can't take
on every value in between.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.025
You kind of have
to break this up

00:07:25.025 --> 00:07:27.150
if you wanted to be able
to do something like that.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.524
You would have to break this
up into two separate regions

00:07:29.524 --> 00:07:32.540
where this would be
the bottom region,

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:37.410
and then this right over here
would be another top region.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:41.100
So this dumbbell shape itself
is not a type 1 region,

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.520
but you could
actually break it up

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.160
into two, separate
type 1 regions.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.410
So, hopefully, that helps out.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.118
And actually, another
way to think about,

00:07:48.118 --> 00:07:49.910
this might be an
easier way-- if we

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:51.819
were to look at it
from this direction,

00:07:51.819 --> 00:07:53.527
and if we were to just
think about the z,

00:07:53.527 --> 00:07:55.990
y, if we were just
thinking about what's

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.970
happening on the z, y
plane-- so that's a z,

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:03.680
and this is y right over
here-- our dumbbell shape would

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:09.950
look something like
this, my best attempt

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.920
to draw our dumbbell shape.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.220
And so if you get a given
x or y, maybe x is even 0,

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:19.960
and you're sitting right here
on the y-axis, notice z is not,

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.370
even up here, cannot be
a function of just y.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.696
On this top part, there's
two possible z-values

00:08:26.696 --> 00:08:28.445
that we need to take
on for that given y--

00:08:28.445 --> 00:08:31.990
two possible z-values
for that given y.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.130
So you can't define
it simply in terms

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:38.469
of just one lower bound function
and one upper bound function.
