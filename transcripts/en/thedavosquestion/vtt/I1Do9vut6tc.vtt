00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:06.040
&gt;&gt;I want to open the floor. We have so many
smart and interesting people here and Michael

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.940
Elliott was out there somewhere. Michael,
yeah you had a question I wanted to make sure

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.421
I got it. And just identify, please identify
yourself - back there.

00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:20.900
MICHAEL: Hi, Mike Elliott from Time Magazine.
One of the unexpected, at least, to me, themes

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.560
of the first day of Davos, yesterday, was
the crisis of expensive food that was mentioned

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.430
by delegates from India, from Africa, and
from China. And rightly or wrongly, in many

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.000
parts of the developing world that's associated
with the increasing amount of available corn

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.940
that's devoted to the production of Ethanol.
Similarly, Bono just earlier this morning

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:53.730
pointed out that in landlocked parts of Africa
and other parts of the world, air transport

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.480
is an essential tool of economic development.
I'd just like to ask all of you, how in practical

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.939
terms do you convince people in the developing
world that these two great goals [ INAUDIBLE

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.920
 ] reduction and climate change are not in
conflict. I mean how do you convince people

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:19.610
that climate change will not be a policy adopted
on the back of people who just recently have

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.611
moved from one meal a day to two?

00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:27.420
Larry: Can I say I feel like, one of the biggest
problems we have in the world is people don't

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.710
realize that technology is the way we solve
these problems so I was giving a talk recently

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.730
and we have this great economist who helps
us out, Hal Varian, and I was saying, he's

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.161
saying basically all the growth in GDP per
capita has been due to technology and you

00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:48.979
can graph it as like an exponential - you
know starts with basically farm improvements

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:55.060
machinization and and mass manufacturing and
so on. And the way we're going to get out

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.340
of problems like that is by having better
technology. And if you look at, you know the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.560
U.S. has something like, you have 10,000 people,
the equivalent of 10,000 people helping you

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.890
every day with the energy use. They're pushing
your car, they're carrying your water up to

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.510
you. If you work out the number of calories
you have to use as a person to do all the

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.620
things that you do is something like 10,000
people. In Africa, that number is like one

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:27.260
or two or zero. Right. And really, it's really
not fun to have to carry your water. It'd

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.390
be really nice to have somebody carry your
water for you. And the way we're going to

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.750
solve those problems is by having more energy
not less, and by having it not hurt our environment,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.380
the world that we live in. And by having it
be a lot cheaper, right. Having more, having

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.881
it be cheaper, those things are related. The
way we're going to do that is with technology,

00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:50.284
we're not, there's no other magic that's going
to do it. And that's the way it's always been

00:02:50.284 --> 00:02:54.440
done and, if you look at the trends, there's
been huge, huge advances in all those things.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.280
So I think the way you're going to solve the
poverty is by having helpers and energy is

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.720
a great way to have helpers. The food cost
is probably largely based on transportation.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.381
The cost of transportation is largely based
on the cost of energy. And so you know you

00:03:09.381 --> 00:03:14.250
solve, you'll solve both those problems at
once. You'll solve food and you'll solve energy

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.930
and that'll help with poverty and starvation
and all those things. And the way we're going

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.590
to do that is we're going to make it cheap
and prevalent and you know you can dig a whole

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.500
anywhere in the world and get tons of energy.
That would be a great thing, right? Let's,

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.380
let's go build that.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.819
[ CROSS TALK ]

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.810
&gt;&gt;What you just heard from Larry was what
I think forced me to change my mind about

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:46.450
how you deal with climate change because the
logical extension of this faith, I think,

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.700
in technology and engineering, not just faith
in the historical record of it. When we started

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.580
doing out energy work, we were very interested
in renewables, we were interested in government

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:03.590
policies. And Larry really challenged us.
He said you can't do it out of a feeling of

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.610
scarcity. You can't react just out of conservation,
because then you won't have economic development

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.840
and you will hurt so many people by any kind
of an abrupt slow down or any kind of trade

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.939
off. You're absolutely right about the ethanol
issue. They're called chapote wars now or

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:24.479
tortilla wars, because people are really rising
up against ethanol for that reason. But Larry

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.970
says don't make it into a competition. He
says find a way to make electricity, not that

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.620
you have to cut back on it, but that you have
more than you ever dreamed of and that you

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.290
do it at prices less than you ever thought
of and gird your loins. Get the engineers

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.710
LARRY: Wait. The corn issue is largely a policy
issue.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.710
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.710
LARRY: I mean the reason corn as expensive
as it is because we're making ethanol out

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.680
of it, which we should'nt be doing.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.680
&gt;&gt;Right.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.099
LARRY: And something I already mentioned we
have 50%, we have a 50 cent tariff in the

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:59.159
U.S. on imported ethanol and a 50%, 50 cent
subsidy on corn ethanol. So it's a dollar

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:03.110
a gallon, and that's why corn is expensive.
It's not, because people would otherwise be

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.099
making ethanol out of corn.

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:06.099
&gt;&gt;Right, right.

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:11.750
&gt;&gt;It is a travesty that it there's a 54 cent
per gallon tariff if you want to import sugar

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.210
ethanol from Brazil. But if you want to actually
import a gallon of refined gasoline from Saudi

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:23.379
Arabia, it's only a penny and a half. So from
a country in our hemisphere that's a democracy,

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:28.369
we have a 54 cent tariff and from the people
who brought us 911, we have a one cent and

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:30.059
a half tariff. Al, please.

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:35.490
&gt;&gt;Yeah, I wanted to briefly comment on Michael
Elliott's question. First of all I wanted

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:44.840
to compliment the three of you for the equation
RE&lt;C. I think it's a brilliant and simple

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:52.169
clarification of the key moving part in all
of this debate. But, there is actually a rich

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:58.899
and growing literature on the connection between
food and security in the developing world

00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:07.819
and climate. And the price of tortillas and
the price of other staples has actually gone

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:12.559
up more because of the thousand year drought
and what many are calling the thousand year

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:19.710
drought in Australia and the effect on yields
on the supply side then on the very marginal

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:25.249
extra pressure that comes from renewable [ INAUDIBLE
 ]. I happen to agree that corn-based ethanol

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:33.729
is just a transition dead end towards cellulosic
ethanol and the use of enzymes, enzymatic

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:41.319
hydrolysis is what I think above my pay grade
but it's I think one of the winners on this.

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:48.330
But if you look at the map of where the food
is to be grown in the developing world, the

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:54.189
impact of the climate on this is by far the
most important issue. The United Nations Development

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:59.949
Program has put out two reports now, Kevin
Watkins, the principle author says that climate

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:08.189
is the principle development challenge. And
the program for fighting against food insecurity

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:17.729
has to take account of climate in order to
succeed. And by the way, the trends in agriculture

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:23.199
in developing the poorest of the poor countries,
has been mono-culture. The reason why as Larry

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:28.039
Brilliant said the highest percentage of jobs
is with the large multi-nationals is because

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:33.419
they're replacing the kind of subsistence
agriculture with locally grown appropriate

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:42.240
crops, with these huge plantations of mono-culture
that depend upon lots of petroleum, lots of

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:49.289
transportation. Wangari Maathai's Green Belt
program got it's notice for tree planting,

00:07:49.289 --> 00:08:00.580
but she uses that to educate women primarily
to go back to the traditional crops that are,

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:05.550
and you know Alice Waters in the United States
has been among those who's generated this

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:12.009
movement. Food and security is one of the
principle cutting edges of the climate crisis

00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:19.240
in the developing world and solving it is
yet another reason why we have to intertwine

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:28.580
this with solutions of the climate crisis.
One final point. Back to the Re&lt;C. Innovators

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:36.390
bringing renewable energy down in cost represents
the left-hand side of that equation. The right-hand

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:41.660
side of the equation is equally important.
The extraordnalities that are not presently

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:47.460
reflected in the price of coal and fossil
fuels, have to be priced into this equation

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:55.000
but in order to reflect reality. And rather
than seeing that as a tax, it should be seen

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.550
as a revenue swap. That all ought to come
back on the left-hand side of the equation

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:07.180
and in the form of adaptation, not only in
the poorest of the poor countries, but among

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.190
the poorest of the poor in the rich countries.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:11.500
&gt;&gt;Thank you.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.500
[ CROSS TALK ]

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:18.640
&gt;&gt;Can I just make a very quick comment? Judy
Rodin is here who runs the Rockerfeller Foundation

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.960
and she's sort of been our inspiration and
mentor. They have $150,000,000 program, the

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:30.000
AGRA Program, which is to try to deal with
new seeds, Gates puts them, most, two thirds

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.620
of the money in. That is because Africa never
really had a green revolution, not in the

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:41.470
way we think of India having had one, and
because of climate change you will see intercurrent

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:47.800
drought and floods and salinity as salt is
brought from the rising seas over the shores

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:53.610
and the agricultural land. The situation is
so dire that for the first time in known history,

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:58.300
farmers in Andhra Pradesh and in parts of
India are committing suicide, because their

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:04.340
lands will no longer produce enough calories
per actor to feed their family. So Al, in

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:10.660
my experience is actually right. These are
twins of the same problem climate change makes

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:16.100
poverty worse. Poverty, if it does economic
development the wrong way makes climate change

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.970
worse. We can't choose sides. We have to be
both and.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:20.970
&gt;&gt;Yes there.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:25.970
&gt;&gt;Yeah, thanks I want to add one other thing
to this both and. I don't know whether to

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:31.240
challenge Larry Brilliant or to ask a leading
question of Sergey and Larry, but none of

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:39.320
this, if you think the U.S. government is
short-sighted, the other governments are so

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:45.019
much worse that there is a huge amount of
corruption in many of these countries and

00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:49.950
it forestalls things. You can have business
plans up the wazoo, but now your guy gets

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:56.270
his $50,000 and the next thing you know the
tax inspector comes calling. Or he tries to

00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:02.540
open an office, but it gets closed down because
some rich land owner who's related to the

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:07.920
nephew of the governor wants to start a shopping
mall or something like that. And so, in order

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:13.720
for the top down stuff to happen, you just
need to go talk to the governments, but for

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:20.300
most of the bottom up stuff to happen, the
stuff that's going to create the diversity

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:24.060
and the props and the entrepreneurs and all
this economic growth. One way or another you

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.850
do have to take on these governments. Please
comment.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:35.181
Larry: Well I actually, Larry and I have been
talking about this issue a lot. I spent some

00:11:35.181 --> 00:11:41.260
time actually in Ethiopia in the elections
actually with the Carter Center just monitoring

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:47.470
the elections, which was really interesting
I recommend that to people, and they have

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:51.110
really good systems, I mean you can debate
the election there but they have really good

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.790
systems now for they have series of like 10
rules before they'll go in

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:57.250
&gt;&gt;It was all Larry's fault, he miscounted.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.250
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:03.500
Larry: [ INAUDIBLE ] like they have for example
10 things they have to have before they go

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:11.970
into a country to monitor elections. And,
for example the U.S. meets none of them, by

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.070
the way, whereas many, most of the countries
 [ INAUDIBLE ] countries during elections

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:19.220
do meet those. And, you know, it's just about
accountability, you know they, everybody watches

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:26.280
the ballot box getting filled, the ballot
box expands, once they have the ballots they

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.720
write the numbers down on the building so
anyone can see them and you know if you want

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.280
to make sure that all the tabulations are
right you can just visit all the buildings

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.280
and

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.280
&gt;&gt;help them,

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.940
Larry: yeah, to count the ballots.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.340
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.740
[ INAUDIBLE ]

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:55.360
Larry: Oh sorry, I was going to transition
to that, sorry. I think that I think elections

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.970
are an area we can learn from because there's
been so much work done by a lot of great people

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:03.280
that there are actually procedures in place
now that we know if we have the following

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.420
10 things, than we have an election that's
probably mostly fair or we know whether we

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:13.050
did or not. And I think we need those set
of 10 things for other parts of the government.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:17.070
So you know there's great organizations that
are trying to do things like just measure

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.800
you know if you're putting money into a school
does it actually get built? You know, can

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:27.110
you see the school, does it walls, does it
have books and those kind of things. How do

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:30.821
you measure that, that scale? And so what
are the 10 things that you need to do to make

00:13:30.821 --> 00:13:33.410
sure that when you gave the money for the
school that they really appear and they have

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:38.700
teachers and students and all those things.
And I think if we got some of those procedures

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.600
and the rules right for these governments
and we got the accountability and the understanding

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.860
of what's going on I think we'll make a lot
of progress in, around the corruption side

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:52.300
and so on. My brother really likes, he has
a phrase ISO 9000 for governments. You know

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:58.610
if you go around in these developing countries
you see a factory. They alway have an ISO

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:03.590
9000 banner, which is basically you know this
burocratic stuff about how you make sure the

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:08.090
stuff you make is really what you claim it
is and it's safe the and the bolts don't break

00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:11.730
if you build a building out of the nails they
don't, you know your building doesn't fall

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:15.720
down. And we don't have the equivalent for
governments, if we did, maybe that would help

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.650
a lot. And I think we're talking about that
and Larry alluded to it.

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:25.050
&gt;&gt;This organization that Larry's talking about
Parthown, we've given them some money and

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:31.330
they're actually doing surveys of not the
input or the output but the throughput of

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.650
education to see whether kids are actually
literate, not whether the government says

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:39.790
they are or whether the school teachers say
they are, because parents who are not literate

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:45.540
can't gauge the literacy and the education
that the kids are getting. So there's really

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:49.890
three parts to this. First, I want to say
a nice thing about the government of India,

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:55.540
you know they've got three one hundred billion
dollar programs to address issues of intractable

00:14:55.540 --> 00:15:01.240
extreme poverty. And one of them a program
called the Right to Information Act. You know

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:05.730
we have one of those in the United States?
But this one has teeth in it. If you don't

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:12.520
get your grain allotment that you are entitled
to, you go to any magistrate and you say,

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.590
I didn't get my grain allotment. They have
30 days to tell you who touched that grain

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:21.250
allotment at every single weigh-in in the
chain and if any one of those guys doesn't

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:25.830
tell you what they did with it, they go to
jail. And they actually make people go to

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:31.990
jail. It's an amazing piece of legislation.
Likewise, they have a Right to Work Act, where

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:38.890
the government is allocated 100 billion dollars
for people in India who, you know, on average

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:44.940
can 300 million people earn less than a dollar
a day? So they have offered anyone a dollar

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:50.860
a day of work for two hundred days. Two hundred
dollars a year. But the problem is corruption.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.940
The problem is it's the leakiest pipe in the
world when you start off with 100 billion

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:59.550
dollars in Dali and you've got to get it to
any other place in India. So they've built

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:04.940
the best program evaluation system I've ever
seen. It's called the social audit. Forget

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.670
about where the money started or how it gets
there at the end of the day they bring all

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:14.191
of the landless peasants together who are
entitled to get this work and get paid and

00:16:14.191 --> 00:16:18.960
they pull out the roster. And they check the
thumb prints on the roster in front of 2,000

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:23.490
village. I attended some of these myself where
corrupt individuals were just put in jail

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:28.130
immediately in front of everybody and thousands
of people cheered because they've never felt

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:34.190
so empowered. I think these are some of the
things that we need to be looking at. There

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:39.030
are lots of solutions out there. The other
part of it is that I don't think that people

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:42.760
in Ganna know what the people in India are
doing. I don't think there's much of what

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:48.970
the UA used to call TCDC, Technical Cooperation
Amongst Developing Countries. We with our

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:54.410
technology and others should be able to spot
those things which work in one place and share

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:59.310
it with everybody. You can be very optimistic
if you go to a social audit in India, I'll

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.310
tell you.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:01.970
&gt;&gt;Sergey, did you want to jump in on any of
this.

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:08.000
Sergey: Yeah I do have, I think that the U.S.
even today remains a leader in many ways and

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.879
I do think that if the U.S. transitions to
clean, I think a lot of these other countries

00:17:12.879 --> 00:17:18.429
will follow, corruption aside. Now today I
do think, unfortunately, the other countries

00:17:18.429 --> 00:17:22.360
are leaving the U.S. and that if you look
at, you know there may be small examples but

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:27.100
Buton that I mentioned, or Costa Rica or any
number of others. I mean these countries are

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:32.450
using renewables they are preserving their
environment, they're actually the leaders

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:41.120
today it's a minority. But I think we need
to get the United States in the loop and I

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.899
think then the majority countries'll follow.

00:17:42.899 --> 00:17:46.450
&gt;&gt; Could I, I'm Paul Berkile from Boies, Schiller

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:47.450
&gt;&gt;Stand up

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:55.549
&gt;&gt;Boies, Schiller and Flexner law firm in
New York. Regulatory policy, Al Gore mentioned

00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:59.999
the externalities issue and really, this is
what we need to focus on in the U.S. You were

00:17:59.999 --> 00:18:04.769
talking why, how does it happen? How can we
be optimistic? Well lawyers, as you know,

00:18:04.769 --> 00:18:10.519
are designed to make things slow down or potentially
speed them up on the right side. Let me give

00:18:10.519 --> 00:18:17.669
you some positives. Tom Friedman was pessimistic
about where we are here in the U.S. about

00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:25.690
shifting over, internalizing the costs of
coal and oil and gas. But some good examples,

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:32.059
tobacco - it did happen, it took 30 years
from the time we learned the problem until

00:18:32.059 --> 00:18:38.250
we solved it. This was the Gore administration,
may I say with your friend Clinton. The FDA

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:45.020
did it by regulation, by regulation ultimately
did it. Also, seat belts, it took 30 years

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:51.160
to get seat belts to internalize those costs.
But it happened. And it can happen here in

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:56.749
less than 30 years. Especially if you have
regulatory policy that shifts a big harbinger

00:18:56.749 --> 00:19:03.550
here is the Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts
vs. EPA, telling the EPA indeed you have the

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:10.500
power and you may, you must regulate for gases
in the environment.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.500
&gt;&gt;You have a question?

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:18.350
Paul: And my question is why don't we get
Exxon, Mobil and all these guys to spend more

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:24.690
time with them, win them over to the alternative
fuels argument and get a better lobby than

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:25.919
we have now?

00:19:25.919 --> 00:19:29.619
&gt;&gt;Larry you want to take it?

00:19:29.619 --> 00:19:36.620
&gt;&gt;Well I think some of those oil and gas companies
you can have that conversation with and some

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:42.899
of them you cannot. And I have actually been
very impressed with BP Oil. Whatever it's

00:19:42.899 --> 00:19:49.350
other problems have been there is inside of
that organization a genuine search for alternatives.

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:53.669
You know, I laughed because it's so easy to
be cynical when they say BP beyond petroleum,

00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:58.549
but I actually have been very impressed with
them and that and I you know we have other

00:19:58.549 --> 00:20:06.210
oil and gas companies that produce deep hydro,
deep hydro, deep thermo energy in the U.S.

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:10.899
I don't think that's an impossible quest.
There are some people here today [ INAUDIBLE

00:20:10.899 --> 00:20:17.480
 ] and other who have been trying to get that
conversation going and keep it going. But

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:22.639
I do believe that you're better going around
these companies, going to their customers.

00:20:22.639 --> 00:20:27.369
Letting their customers know that if you go
down this road you're endangering your children's

00:20:27.369 --> 00:20:33.850
lives in the future. I think that's a better
role for people who are trying to advocate

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:40.840
change than, you need help and customers are
a really good group to help you.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:48.610
&gt;&gt;Van Jones, Van you had a question?

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:55.980
Van Jones, Green [ INAUDIBLE ], Oakland, California.
I wanted to just make and observation. You

00:20:55.980 --> 00:21:02.929
know we are thinking about how do we expand
this coalition? How do we get more people

00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:07.289
to care about buying the good clean stuff
and actually more people who want to put the

00:21:07.289 --> 00:21:12.380
right price on the dirty stuff. And, often
these conversations become what's wrong with

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:17.299
everybody? Why doesn't everybody get this?
Well I spent the past year, the past three

00:21:17.299 --> 00:21:23.870
months I talked to 30,000 people about climate
change. In places like Oakland, Watts, Newark.

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:27.139
We talked about poor people in other countries,
you never talked about poor people in the

00:21:27.139 --> 00:21:32.429
developing countries. This is what gets people's
attention. If you tell peopel who already

00:21:32.429 --> 00:21:39.389
live in crisis about another crisis, they
get depressed. Okay? You're poor, you don't

00:21:39.389 --> 00:21:42.840
have a house, you don't have a job, you're
scared and you say here's global warming,

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:43.840
it's going to kill everybody.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.840
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:49.990
Van: They don't want to join your group. They
just don't. And they say it's the end times,

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:51.969
that Jesus is going to come back and they
give up.

00:21:51.969 --> 00:21:52.969
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:21:52.969 --> 00:21:59.091
Van: Okay? But if you tell people who live
in crisis about the opportunity, they get

00:21:59.091 --> 00:22:04.009
very excited. So we started telling people
about the idea of green collar jobs for their

00:22:04.009 --> 00:22:10.230
kids. That we could put low-income, urban
youth to work, cutting up those solar panels.

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:13.820
The President signs a law, the President's
not going to put up one solar panel. The President's

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:19.480
not going to weatherize one building. Your
kid could do that. And we got instant cooperation

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.999
and support across the board. So I think what
we've got to do is stick to the positive.

00:22:23.999 --> 00:22:27.179
I do think we're going to have to get the
govenment to help the markets and help the

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:31.119
technologies work because the government has
to be involved. We need a political movement

00:22:31.119 --> 00:22:35.950
that includes everybody. But if we go to people
who have crisis and tell them about the opportunity,

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:41.700
we can expand this coalition to include the
people who need this green wave to lift all

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:42.700
boats.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:43.700
&gt;&gt;Now let me ask you a question.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.700
&gt;&gt;Van. Yeah.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:49.129
&gt;&gt;If you could ask one thing of the Google
founders and Google.org that would help the

00:22:49.129 --> 00:22:52.440
green collar movement, what, you know, what
could they do?

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.350
Van. Well I think that the most important
thing is that these, we tend to have these

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:59.889
conversations like at a lot of these meetings
and it's all about the technology. It's all

00:22:59.889 --> 00:23:06.679
about the entrepreneurs and that's great.
But what about the workers? If you go to your,

00:23:06.679 --> 00:23:11.980
if you have this standard that says we want
three cents, that's the outcome, and we also

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:16.901
want X number of jobs. Tell us how we're going
to be able to get X number of jobs out of

00:23:16.901 --> 00:23:22.450
your innovation and we'll make that a part
of what we celebrate. Because people aren't

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:25.649
just saying oh, it's good for the Polar Bears,
they're saying maybe it's good for me and

00:23:25.649 --> 00:23:26.649
my child.

00:23:26.649 --> 00:23:28.889
&gt;&gt;Thank you. Thank you.

00:23:28.889 --> 00:23:29.889
[ CLAPPING ]

00:23:29.889 --> 00:23:33.360
&gt;&gt;Yeah, I'll get to everybody. Over here.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:44.859
&gt;&gt;Hi, I'm Jeff Jarvis and I just blog at buzzmachine.com.
I'm hearing a cultural shift here which goes

00:23:44.859 --> 00:23:48.490
right after what Van just said and what you
said a little earlier Larry. That so much

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:51.910
of the movement tells us what we should not
be doing. You're talking about what we can

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:58.029
and should do and will do. And I think that's
essentially different in the message. It goes

00:23:58.029 --> 00:24:01.169
back to what you said in the beginning Larry
about how good a job we're doing at getting

00:24:01.169 --> 00:24:04.809
the message out. So if you take that essential
message of saying okay there's things we shouldn't

00:24:04.809 --> 00:24:08.350
do, fine. But, there's all these things we
can do and should do that technology will

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:14.269
bring us. That I think requires lobbying for
investment, it requires PR to get the people

00:24:14.269 --> 00:24:18.769
to understand the need for investment, it
requires education. How much does that fit

00:24:18.769 --> 00:24:22.600
into, is that your job or are you going to
 [ INAUDIBLE ] for technology, where does

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.419
the lobby and the information and the education
come in?

00:24:24.419 --> 00:24:29.139
&gt;&gt;Can I just add one thing to that Jeff, which
is a really important point, because Al Gore

00:24:29.139 --> 00:24:33.809
and I were talking about this on the way over.
I don't think people fully appreciate what

00:24:33.809 --> 00:24:39.730
a number Exxon Mobil did on this debate. Because
basically what they did is that they made

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:45.409
the debate between, no climate change and
Al Gore. So Al was out here, one extreme and

00:24:45.409 --> 00:24:50.590
no climate change was here. But in fact Al
was actually at the center and the real debate

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:55.850
is between kinda Al and Al, which is Al in
the center or actually much worse climate

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:59.940
change, which is what we're now seeing. And
that's why I keep coming back to this issue.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:05.809
No name something is to own it. They own that
debate still. And what are we going to do

00:25:05.809 --> 00:25:07.720
to rename it?

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:14.289
&gt;&gt;Well you, it's not just Exxon Mobile. It's
not just that issue. The coal industry in

00:25:14.289 --> 00:25:21.509
the U.S. has just launched a 50 million dollar
television campaign, The Coalition for Fair

00:25:21.509 --> 00:25:22.509
Energy.

00:25:22.509 --> 00:25:23.509
&gt;&gt;Yeah I've seen them all.

00:25:23.509 --> 00:25:24.509
&gt;&gt;CLEANCO.

00:25:24.509 --> 00:25:25.509
&gt;&gt;They're running now.

00:25:25.509 --> 00:25:29.179
&gt;&gt;Well they don't have a name CLEANCO, the
have a name which sounds like Peace, Motherhood,

00:25:29.179 --> 00:25:33.345
God and Apple Pie. That's what the name of
it. The debut, but that's not what they're

00:25:33.345 --> 00:25:38.460
doing. They're trying to persuade people that,
just keep using dirty coal for a little while

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:42.960
we'll clean it up. That's really what they're
trying to say. And we don't want to, I think

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:51.639
that the issues become far more manageable
when we deal with issues of getting the information

00:25:51.639 --> 00:25:58.649
out there. Everybody's got to play a different
role. Ann can play one role, John Doerr, on

00:25:58.649 --> 00:26:03.230
of our leaders plays one role, All plays one
role. I mean our role is best played by getting

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:09.169
all of the information out there in any way
that we possibly can, because when one has

00:26:09.169 --> 00:26:15.009
that same amount of information, not everybody,
most people are going to make the right decision.

00:26:15.009 --> 00:26:16.269
And that's what I believe in.

00:26:16.269 --> 00:26:20.570
&gt;&gt;But what happens when you're up against
people who's motto is do harm?

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:21.570
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

[ TAPE JUMPS 26:22 ]

&gt;&gt;you have the gigawatts for example, goals
say we could buy a data center at roughly

00:26:28.139 --> 00:26:33.830
the same cost as we can get it from coal we
would go do it and you know we can invest

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:37.330

alternatives and if you did everybody would

&gt;&gt;Al go ahead.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:52.179
Al: I wanted to gently take issue with something
you said Larry. Getting all the information

00:26:52.179 --> 00:26:59.359
out there and letting people see all the facts
and make up their minds, that generally works.

00:26:59.359 --> 00:27:06.419
I think that's the way the world used to work.
I don't think it works that way any more.

00:27:06.419 --> 00:27:16.220
And the reason why the tobacco industry was
able to continue killing people for 40 years

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:25.799
after the Surgeon General's report of 1964
is that they understood that as against the

00:27:25.799 --> 00:27:29.509
enlightenment model of, putting the facts
on the table, seeking the best evidence, have

00:27:29.509 --> 00:27:34.270
a reasonable debate, appealing to the rule
of reason and letting people make their minds

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:44.109
up, they understood the power of strategic
persuasion. And, they went about it in a very

00:27:44.109 --> 00:27:51.629
careful, organized and well-funded way. And
the memoranda that have come out on these

00:27:51.629 --> 00:27:57.990
law suits that go back 40 or 50 years now
make it very very clear that they knew exactly

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:05.389
what they were doing. Now the information
ecology of of modern society, especially in

00:28:05.389 --> 00:28:12.790
the United States, makes us vulnerable to
strategic persuasion campaigns if the other

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:19.840
side assumes that all we need to do is put
the facts out there, let people make up their

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:26.029
own minds, let's have an open debate. That's
not, it just doesn't work that way. Just yesterday

00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:36.669
there was a report on the run up to the invasion
of Iraq. We've identified 975 false statements

00:28:36.669 --> 00:28:44.269
in a concentrated period of time with the
same means used intentionally by the administration,

00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:45.269
again I'll give the same disclaimer I did
in the earlier session. I've lost my objectivity

00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:54.590
so take it with a grain of salt. But this
was a strategic campaign. Now, on global warming,

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:58.609
on the climate crisis, Exxon Mobil was only
one of those involved. The southern company,

00:28:58.609 --> 00:29:05.039
there are a bunch of them. They spend a lot
of money. This current 50-million-dollar-advertising-campaign,

00:29:05.039 --> 00:29:12.720
they're sponsoring the debates among the candidates.
Okay? And Exxon Mobil has funded 40 different

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:19.529
front groups that have all been a part of
a strategic persuasion campaign to, in their

00:29:19.529 --> 00:29:28.309
own words, reposition global warming as theory
rather than fact. Now we can bemoan this and

00:29:28.309 --> 00:29:33.059
we can continue to assume that all we have
to do is to get the facts out there and people

00:29:33.059 --> 00:29:39.570
are capable of making up their own minds or
we can counter it with a strategic persuasion

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:45.479
campaign that is based on the truth and get
that out there. I have long since come to

00:29:45.479 --> 00:29:50.059
the conclusion that that's what's needed.
And that's why I formed this alliance for

00:29:50.059 --> 00:29:57.059

any candidates or any political party, but

[ CLAPPING ]

00:30:02.789 --> 00:30:15.700
&gt;&gt;I am [ INAUDIBLE ] from Zimbabwi. I always
try to make sure when we debate poverty we

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:21.769
include poor people in the debates. I want
to push a couple of paragram shifts that are

00:30:21.769 --> 00:30:27.629
required for there to be no attention between
the public debate and the climate debate.

00:30:27.629 --> 00:30:32.519
The first one is to say there must be and
there is a business case to address the climate

00:30:32.519 --> 00:30:37.460
change debate. Second paragram shift, Africans,
poor people must take the responsibility for

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:41.909
own inconsistencies. In Africa we're moving
away from the blame game. We are responsible

00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:46.049
for the cares in Africa, we must take charge
of our lives. Paragram shift number three,

00:30:46.049 --> 00:30:51.919
move away from aid [ INAUDIBLE ] to investment.
We want investment in Africa. Teach us how

00:30:51.919 --> 00:30:58.600
to fish, don't give us fish. Paragram shift
number four, move away from commodity based

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:04.899
in [ INAUDIBLE ] to processing to value addition,
that's what we want so that there's no tension

00:31:04.899 --> 00:31:09.940
between the eradication of poverty and the
climate change. Paragram shift number 5 [ INAUDIBLE

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:16.789
 ] the bottom of the pyramid. [ INAUDIBLE

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:28.009
service [ INAUDIBLE ], how you service Zimbabwi.
How you service poor communities requires

00:31:28.009 --> 00:31:33.629
innovation around volume, innovation around
technology. Clean technologys, clean fuels

00:31:33.629 --> 00:31:43.039
so that we can [ INAUDIBLE ] to this dire
economy. We need to also make a shift. I think

00:31:43.039 --> 00:31:48.389
that we are so much obsessed about national
sovereignty and I want to tell you and I've

00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:53.220
already said my views to Al, Vice President
Gore, you can't address what you're trying

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:59.119
to do if you're obsessed with national sovereignty.
We need a strategic shift from national sovereignty

00:31:59.119 --> 00:32:06.509
to global sovereignty to collective humanity.

global sovereignty and collective sovereignty.

&gt;&gt;You guys want to say anything on that?

00:32:13.899 --> 00:32:19.169
&gt;&gt;I would just say one thing about what Al
Gore said. First, it's under any circumstances

00:32:19.169 --> 00:32:24.190
it's wonderful having a conversation with
you whether we agree or not. But we do agree

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:28.479
and you know that. We attended a meeting together
in Aspen, in fact John was there as well.

00:32:28.479 --> 00:32:33.530
And, it was a very depressing meeting. We'd
just seen the latest results of the IPCC.

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:38.100
We'd just seen some of the devastating increasing
acceleration of the climate change. That meeting,

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:47.590
probably if it concluded on two things was
one, we needed a tax on carbon, the other,

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:52.330
we needed total change in human consciousness.
Now one of those things is easier to accomplish

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:55.689
than the other, but I'm not sure which one
of them.

[ LAUGHTER ]

00:32:56.689 --> 00:33:02.379
&gt;&gt;And in this debate, and I think your analysis
was exactly on and I so much appreciate your

00:33:02.379 --> 00:33:07.099
passion, that the question though is that
each one of has has got to find a role that

00:33:07.099 --> 00:33:12.729
we can uniquely play. You have to look where
you stand. I mean what Peggy's got is 100

00:33:12.729 --> 00:33:20.970
years of moral credability to bring to the
battle with the Rockerfeller family. Somebody

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:29.929
else may have analytical capability. Others
might really have political power. Some might

00:33:29.929 --> 00:33:40.259
have scientific excellence or technological
competence. I ask each one of us to look at

00:33:40.259 --> 00:33:56.701
our own assets. Don't to a net worth statement,
do a self-worth statement and see how you

00:33:56.701 --> 00:34:18.210
can contribute what fits you and what you
do may not fit somebody else.

&gt;&gt;Oh I'm sorry John.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:40.790
&gt;&gt;This'll turn the conversation around a little
bit, but if the equation is RE&lt;C and we say

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:54.080
that raising C can help accelerate that, and
that raising C is, this is the thesis of the

00:34:54.080 --> 00:35:02.840
question, is policy and politics, I'd like
your permission to pose a question to Tom

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:12.720
Friedman, who's writing a book about this
an is a world expert on politics, policy globally.

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:21.100
What's your prescription? How the hell are
we going to get the policy to be heart-attack

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:30.620
serious and to be done quickly and effectively
before as Al has warned us and led us run.

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:39.080
I think I know about the RE&lt;, the innovation
on the technology. It's the policy that,

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:43.810
Tom: Well you know I think this, I don't want
 [ INAUDIBLE ]

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:47.820
&gt;&gt;You talked about politics and policy

00:35:47.820 --> 00:36:03.790
Tom: I just would say that I think, and Al
and I were talking about this in the car over,

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:11.180
this is a,
[ INAUDIBLE ] this is a really unique problem.

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:20.760
Which is that historically an environmental
movement has really been about stopping things.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:33.050
You know stopping pollution, stopping acid
rain and and actually social [ INAUDIBLE ] movements

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:44.170
historically have been about stopping discrimination
against women, stopping discrimination against

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:55.410
blacks. This is a very different challenge.
We actually, we have to have a mass social

00:36:55.410 --> 00:37:07.000
movement that gets the government to put on
a tax. To set a price on carbon. It's an unprecedented

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:17.090
thing. A social movement. But I like the way
Al's really been talking about it, I think

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:26.790
again, language is so important, that this
has to be a social movement for an investment

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:36.520
in our future. If it's a social movement for
a tax, that going to be a really hard sell.

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:42.910
But if it's a social movement for an investment,
that really what Larry and Sergey and Larry

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:52.650
have been saying. That if we can reframe this
it's how to invest in our future, because

00:37:52.650 --> 00:38:01.220
we can talk about everything here without
a price signal you will not have a scale.

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:10.260
Without a scale, you have a green hobby. I
like to build model airplanes for a hobby.

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:12.680
Not try to get a gigawatt of clean energy.

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.730
Larry: Can I add one thing to that, I mean
I think it's well worth doing the getting

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:19.550
the C part up, but I do think that it's pretty
obvious about getting the RE down a lot and

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:22.200
in order to solve some of the development
issues we really need cheaper energy. And

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:28.510
so if you just increase C, you know if you
could wave your hands today in increase C

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:36.560
a lot, you know you should do that, but that's
actually not the only thing we need to do,

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:42.350
even if you accomplished it or not, you've
really missed something important which is

00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:48.600
that we really want everybody to have a lot
of energy.

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:49.600
[ INAUDIBLE ]

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:58.690
&gt;&gt;Larry: Okay well yeah I agree but I think
if there was one thought I want to leave people

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:09.600
with is that I think the number of people
in the world that are trying to make RE really

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:17.030
small is very very small. Like we could probably
fit them all into this room. And that's a

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:25.660
really serious problem. You know if we make
that, if we make it go from 100 to 10,000

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:31.150
people, we're going to make a lot more progress.

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:36.090
&gt;&gt;Sergey: Just to quickly add, I do think
we need a policy work just to make RE smaller

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:42.530
or to not increase it. I mean the tariffs
on the sugar [ INAUDIBLE ] the real issue.

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:50.180
The inability to put up windmills because
you know five miles off Nantucket they don't

00:39:50.180 --> 00:40:11.120
look so pretty, you know, all those things
are real obstacles and we need to get rid

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.820
of those too.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:23.580
&gt;&gt;Larry: I'm just, our buildings too, you
know we have to attach the panels to the right

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:32.100
building or we can't meter it into the grid
and they won't let us connect to the, this

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:37.480
stuff is garbage. So some of the, I think
what Sergey is saying is to get real fast

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:46.540
action on some of these things and you've
got to be able to connect them up to the grid

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:52.500
without it taking two years and stuff. That's
a policy issue.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:59.100
&gt;&gt;And one small thing, just to remind us but
we already know, if you're looking at RE&lt;C

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:06.470
it's all over the world. So you might be able
to affect the price of coal by internalizing

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:13.290
it in the United States. If you don't the
fact, that formula in China or India you're

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:19.280
really winning a [ INAUDIBLE ] victory. We
have to have RE&lt;C in those countries as well.

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.280
&gt;&gt;Peter.

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:24.270
Peter: Just one data point, Al that suggests
maybe you've been more successful than you

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:28.740
know. In San Fran, in California a recent
public survey on concern about climate change.

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:30.340
Four out of 5 Californians are willing to
support strong action on climate change. Not

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:33.790
broken down by party buy by level of knowledge.
That is they, the four who are supporting

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:36.330
it know more than the one who doesn't. And
so it really is in part a matter of knowledge.

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:41.490
Now, that is in part because of you, because
of our Governator in California, who's done

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:42.780
a pretty decent job of education the people
of California, so it does suggest that at

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.300
least some effort of informing the public
may actually have some genuine political consequences

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:46.740
so that we have a real consensus in California
on action. And so I think what you're doing

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:49.910
to bring the message to the people already
is having that kind of impact.

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:59.340
Al: But here's a crucial distinction. What
you say is absolutely right, It's the result

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:02.420
of a lot of hard work on the part of many
many people. But even though the poles show

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:07.040
that increase in change depending - here's
the bad part of that. When you give the American

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:11.850
people a list of 25 issues and you ask them
to order them in rand priority order, climate

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:16.160
is still not above 23 on the list of 25. So,
there's a difference between changing opinions

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:24.180
and changing the sense of urgency. And that's,
we need a strategic mass persuasion campaign

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:29.980
focused on getting that to the top of the
list. That happened in Australia and that's

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.420
why Kevin Rudd was elected. It needs to happen
in the U.S. and elsewhere. And to make it

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:33.440
global, that's what Copenhagen is all about.
In December of 2009 Copenhagen marks the culmination

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.440
of the global process where and that's the
policy framework within which RE&lt;C can be

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:35.440
locked in globally.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.440
&gt;&gt;Please. The lady behind you. Please identify
yourself.

&gt;&gt;My name is Toshiko Maury I'm an architect.
I'm a chair with the Department of Architecture

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:39.690
at Harvard. And I have this issue about how
to represent this information to make the

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:40.690
knowledge more accessible to the public, not
only for this country. Because earth may be

00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:48.940
flat but I think it's dynamic. It's very different
world now thanks to all the issues brought

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.880
up by climate change, property issues. We
have to come up with a different model to

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:55.220
inform the public. As an architect we see
buildings as organic [ INAUDIBLE ] connecting

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:59.270
many different dots. Issues that are incredibly
attomized. Issues of food to property to disaster

00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:02.830
to climate. How the light bulb to polar bears
 - it's so diverse. And I think problem is

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:04.020
the people cannot see the whole picture and
connecting millions of dots. And what I propose

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:08.940
what Google can do with the search engine
capability us can you come up with a dynamic

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:11.480
model, simulation model, which may be more
visual, so that everybody can see when they

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:14.970
actually understand. What about this one seed
in Africa. How does it affect everything else.

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:17.230
And people can see immediately how everything
is interrelated. It's a different, different

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:23.500
world and I think that's why we are suffering
from this and that's why people don't understand.

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:26.420
If you show this model to persons they will
get it immediately because it's all about

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:27.890
the quality of life, and that is common issue
globally. And I think this job of how to [ INAUDIBLE

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:30.140
 ] information is missing and I hope that
Google can come up with a very powerful engine

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:32.850
and a very creative way to deliver dynamic
world message.

00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:48.940
Larry: I think it'd be great to have some
of that capability in Google Earth, where

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:54.940
you can actually see simulations of what's
likely to happen and how it affects different

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:56.010
people and all those things.

00:43:56.010 --> 00:44:04.020
Sergey: Well we should mention there are already
layers in Google Earth that do some of those

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:10.320
things. For example you can look at the effects
of sea-level changes and you can simulate

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:16.240
you know one meter, three meter rise in sea
levels and it's very dramatic obviously. You

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.240
can see renewable projects around the world
so we do have some of those pieces already.

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:18.240
[ INAUDIBLE ]

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.240
Sergey: No, that's true we don't have a global
simulation that connects it all.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.240
&gt;&gt;[ INAUDIBLE ] Oh I'm sorry, and then [ INAUDIBLE
 ] because you were next.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.240
&gt;&gt;Very quickly, Michael Anderson from [ INAUDIBLE
 ] in the U.K. There's one opportunity that

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.240
I'd also like to add to the table and that
is that each year marketers spend about three

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.240
quarters of a trillion dollars on advertising
and marketing. That is a huge multiple of

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.240
50 million for coal and the chance to mobalize
customer bases is huge. The crisis we have

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:25.240
from a consumer's perspective is lack of choice.
Very hard to buy products that are exciting

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:26.240
that are cleaner. So I really think that particularly
with your relationship with advertisers, which

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:27.240
is so important, and your relationship empowering
consumers to make choice at that level you

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:28.240
have a wave that's in the trillion dollar
scale. As a young global leader we've just

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.240
written a book that has 15 case studies of
companies that have cut carbon, increased

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:30.860
profit and now are creating a multiplication
factor through their customer base. And I

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:31.950
think this is a great new lever that I hope
we also embrace if business has a role to

00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:32.950
play. Not just on big scale things, not just
on telling people to change their light bulbs,

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:33.950
but in really accelerating customer choice
in the system.

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:34.950
Larry: Yeah we can have little ads that are
green.

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:35.950
&gt;&gt;Lucen Marmicci from [ INAUDIBLE ] where
I bring you [ INAUDIBLE ]. I just wanted to

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:36.950
add two points to this important debate about
poverty and climate change and this is because

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:37.950
we know that to reduce poverty we need energy.
And two other very important elements. One,

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:38.950
there is still 50% of the population in the
world and probably more in poor population

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:39.950
in villages and the whole movement from their
village to town to [ INAUDIBLE ] everybody

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:43.160
in the village for the same level of living
needs much less energy than when he moves

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:49.590
to a slum in a town. So I think this is a
point which is very important to address.

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:51.330
How do you do it by improving the standard
of living in the village. You will need much

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:53.670
less energy. Two examples: one example is
cooking is different [ INAUDIBLE ] introducing

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:55.020
a solid cooker which has been tried for at
least 40 years. There is a social problem.

00:44:55.020 --> 00:45:03.730
People in Africa cook at night in the villages,
because this is for the women [ INAUDIBLE

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:07.300
 ] so you need anthropologists you need social
workers to convince people to cook during

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:10.320
the day. It's not a questions of [ INAUDIBLE
 ] it's really not expensive. And the other

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:13.020
was mentioned of course, seeds. Because they
have to cut more trees because they have [ INAUDIBLE

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:14.020
 ]. Thank you.

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:23.700
&gt;&gt;We have to close it down, so I don't know
if you want to answer that or if you want

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:26.370
guys what to say anything in closing.

00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:31.340
&gt;&gt;Well I, first of all this was a wonderful
conversation and the best part of is is not

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:36.190
the people up here it's the people down there.
It's really wonderful from this perspective

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:47.250
to hear what you guys say and to feel the
passion and commitment in the room. I don't

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:50.490
think that would have been the case 5 years
ago. So thank you guys.

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:52.140
Sergey: And just one item I'd like to add,
you know we're trying to do our [ INAUDIBLE

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:57.510
 ] in the investments so this is obviously
a global challenge and there are so many people

00:45:57.510 --> 00:46:06.590
here and other places doing really great and
important work. You know, I don't think that,

00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:13.400
I think we're really a drop in the bucket
and I really appreciate what everyone's doing.

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:14.400
Larry: Thank you.

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:15.400
&gt;&gt;Thank you very much.
