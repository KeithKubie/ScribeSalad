&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.420
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: That is moved
from Memphis, went to the LA Times,

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.510
went to Investors Business Daily.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.090
You know it's-- in this era two
Pulitzers doesn't necessarily

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.080
guarantee one newspaper anymore

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.730
but where he goes he
takes tremendous talent.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.140
So we have both from the left

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.390
and from the right
two great cartoonists.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.510
Please welcome up here Darrin
Bell and Michael Ramirez.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.040
[ Applause ]

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.340
All right.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.020
Please.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.740
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: You know,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.010
I'm thrilled to meet
Johnny Depp in person.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.310
[ Laughter ]

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.610
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Tell me,

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.490
if he'd send us paychecks my
way, it'll be a good thing.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.570
Well thank you guys so much.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.370
And first, you know, often
political cartoonists,

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.670
people have an impression.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.100
They sense that it must be
this curmudgeon of somewhere

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.030
and you know, must sort of feel
whether the left or the right sort

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.060
of bitter or angry all the time.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.880
And actually political
cartoonists are often some

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.260
of the happiest people I
know because their vitriol is

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.600
in their pen and they get it
out and they're often some

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.900
of the healthiest people I know.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.930
But they often have the
least opportunity to get

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.050
to the public to know them.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.550
So with each of you, you know,
I was like doing origin stories.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.860
So Darrin I know you
were born in LA.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.160
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Right.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.220
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And you know, can
you tell us a little bit about like

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.020
when did you get-- do you remember
when you first got political.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.120
Or were your parents
political people?

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.650
When did you feel that?

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.090
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: My parents
weren't really political

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.820
but our newspaper was.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.990
I remember they added Bloom County.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.520
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Were
you reading The Times or?

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.010
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: This was
back a long time ago.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.730
Every city had more than one paper.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.030
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Sure.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.330
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: So,
we got The Times,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.390 position:56%
we got the-- what was the other one?

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.690
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: The Herex?

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.990
Herald exam?

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.290
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: Oh,
the Herald Examiner.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.590
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Herald Examiner.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.890
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.190
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Yes.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.490
So I don't know which one
it was in, the both of them.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.790
But all I knew was there
was a penguin and I had

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.730
to see what it was doing everyday.

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.220
And one day, it mentioned
Caspar Weinberger

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.640
and that was a funny sounding word.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.190
I had to figure-- I just had to
know what he was talking about.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.490
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.790
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: I was
like five or six.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.090
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.390
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: So that was
my -- that's how I got in.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.410
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Most kids of five
or six of this Casper the ghost

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.310
and you're getting from Berkeley
Breathed Caspar Weinberger

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.610
and you're on.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.040
And so Michael, I know
believe you're born in Tokyo.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.340
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: Yes.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.350
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And how long of
growing up did you spend there?

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.620
And did you move around
and what were you reading?

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.100
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez:
My mom is Japanese.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.400
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah?

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.700
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: So I am -- the
first language I spoke was Japanese

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.940
which is why you may not
understand my cartoons.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.450
I lived there until
I was around six.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.750
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.050
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And
then we went back state side

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.350
and then back to Japan.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.900 position:56%
My dad was in the army for 23 years.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.200
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.500
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: I kind
of followed him around.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.600
And I lived in Germany for two
years and Belgium for a year.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.900
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah?

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.200
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: We lived
in Paris for eight months.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.230
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Were you
picking up languages as you go or?

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.550
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: No, but I was
getting a pretty deep wrap sheet

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.850
in different languages.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.130
An InterPol got my picture.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.720
And you know, it's fine-- my mom
is Japanese, my dad is half-Mexican

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.720
and half-Spanish so I'm
completely confused.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.160
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Well, it doesn't
come through in your cartoon.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.700
It comes through crystal clear.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.430
So you know, what I think,
when I started thinking

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.170
about editorial cartooning
years ago, they were thick

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.720
through across the land, right?

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.710
We had you know, we used to have
200 at least, political cartoonist,

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.690
staff political cartoonist.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:42.990
And then it would dwindle.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.910
It was like 70 and maybe now,

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.370
30 officially full time cartoonists
maybe and then you have--

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.240
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez:
Three, three and a half.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.540
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: What?

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.840
Which is shrinking.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.780
But you know, and comic strips
indication has changed so much.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.900
Sales aren't the same.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.830
But you guys, I mean,
you're so talented.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.370
Do you ever think about selling
in charts or decide you know,

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.260
these are my skills and this
is what I'm passionate about.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.520
And regardless of the
market, you know,

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.850
what motivates you, is
it having that voice?

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.910
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Well, it's partly
what you said at the beginning.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.030
We were the most-- Some of the
most common people, you know.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.980
You can imagine because
this is like art therapy--

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.280
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.580
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: For adults.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.600
I mean, I get to talk
about Trump and Clinton.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.060
All the time through my pen
and then afterwards I'm happy.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.360
I got it out.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.860
And I feel like what
we do is important.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.240 position:56%
What we -- I think back to when I
was a kid, this is the kind of thing

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.700
that made me reading
Conrad, reading Bloom County,

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.910
that's what made me interested in
politics and then the wider world.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.210
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.960
That would be Paul Conrad who
was an icon at the LA Times.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.260
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Right.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.200
And so I feel like you know,
whenever I draw a cartoon,

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.980
I know that some little kid
somewhere is going to see it

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.190
and think, I have to know what this
guy is talking about and he's going

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.280
to want to go read and find
out for himself and start

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.310 position:56%
to think critically about the world.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.870
So it's-- I see this as a service.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.170
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.170
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: I could have
gone to Trump University and--

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.410
and be real state or something.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:30.710
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Sale stakes.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.010
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Yeah.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.750
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: You
know, I never aspired

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.170
to be a political cartoonist.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.140
I want to be in cardiovascular
service.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.530
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: That's
right, medicine.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.830
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: All my brothers

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.130
and sisters are doctors
except for me.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.930
I'm the black sheep of the family.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.230
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah?

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:46.530
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And my
relative calm just comes

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.780
from the electroshock
therapy that I have.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.680
But I'm a big believer
in what we do.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.980
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.280
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And
as corny as it sounds,

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.470
I think I view editorial
cartooning as pure journalism.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.490 position:56%
In fact, it's quite some of the most
effective journalism because people

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.000
to read the editorial page
always turn to the cartoons.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.030
So it can have a profound impact.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.640
But you know, I never
set out to draw a cartoon

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.680
for I never thought about it.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.800
The first cartoon I
ever did was in college.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.080
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Well,
in UC Irvine?

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.580
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez:
Yeah at UC Irvine.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.020
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Did
you get a reaction to it?

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.400
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: Like you know,

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.920
there is an ulterior
motive for everything.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.900
In high school, we
have closed campus.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.950
You couldn't leave campus except--
the exception of having a hall pass

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.530
from the office or a press pass.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.910
The guy who control the press pass
was the editor of the newspaper,

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.460
so naturally, I became the
editor of the newspaper.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.590
And you know, whatever the waves
got over three foot, you know,

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.320
I had to go over there and
report how the surfing was.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.830
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Sure absolutely.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.110
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And so I
wrote, and then when I went

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.550
into college, I continued to write.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.980
And you know, I wrote editorials.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.610
I wrote reviews.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:07.040
I found out that you could
get albums and tickets

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.110
to the world premiers and
both Darrin and I lived in LA.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.010
That's a bonus.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.310
You get free stuff.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.610
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:15.910
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And all you
have to do is just write about it.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.040
Now I was a triple major in
college, biological sciences,

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.340
fine arts studio, painting
and art history.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.490
And the only reason why
I did the latter two was

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.490
because my older brother and
sister who preceded me said,

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.180
the medical schools are looking
for well-rounded students.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.950
They don't want straight bioscience
students, so why don't you

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.050
since you can draw, why
don't you do that art thing?

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.350
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.740
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And UCI had
a very conceptual art department.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.830
And I could make up really
good excuses for bad art.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:49.480
And so I was just doing that and
one day I was filing the story

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.040 position:56%
and my editor looked at the cartoon.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.260
And I mean, at the painting,
I was looking on, she said,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.110
now we have a student
election going on right now.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.420 position:56%
What don't you do a cartoon on that?

00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.720
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.020
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And so,

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.510
I tried to interview all the
candidates, only met with two.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.350
Looked into the other
ones and found out,

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.290
there was no real platform
for running.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:08.590
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:09.960
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And so
I made fun of all of them.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.080
And the day that cartoon came
out, we had three days worth

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.130
of protest with this cartoon.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.460
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: You
generated by you?

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.760
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: But
my generated by my--

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.060
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Or your cartoon?

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.360
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And I got
called from the student government

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.640
to apologize to the school
because I needed to be educated.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:28.230
And so, I appeared in front
of the student council

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.090
and I said you guys
were absolutely right.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.720
I do need to be educated.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.550
That's why I'm pursuing
three degrees.

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.380
But thank you for your concern.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:39.660 position:56%
And then I left, but I realized
that I've been running all the stuff

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.170 position:56%
that I thought was having an impact.

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:42.470
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.770
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: That
you draw one cartoon

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.070
and half the campus hates you.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.370
What a great forum.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:47.670 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah there you go.

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.550
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And so
that really count my interest,

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.330
although I hadn't changed
my career path.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:54.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:55.930
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: It
wasn't until my plus--

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.280
it was until my junior
year in college.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.900
We had the sense-- a local
paper who hired me got a month

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.200
and a half after I started it.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.350
In the new university,
called the Newport Incident.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:07.650
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:09.250
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez:
And it was a great deal

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.560
because I usually took
this break to go surfing

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.170
between Organic Chemistry
and Bio 1O1.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:16.470
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.070
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And this
place was just along the away.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:19.370
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:20.670
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez:
And so I could get

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:21.970
into a little mischief you
know, without a cartoon.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.270
I got $50 of cartoon.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.570
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:25.870
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez:
With a good pay back.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.170
And then, there's this incident

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.130
where the Newport Beach
Police pulled over this guy,

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.650
arrested him for drunk driving,
then allowing the phone call.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:35.890
And as it turned out, he was
a Newport City councilman

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.190
who didn't drink.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:40.000 position:56%
That's why I did this cartoon where
I had this guy hard tied on the hood

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.690
of a police car with a
shoe wedge in his mouth

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.660
and the arresting officer was
explaining to his sergeant,

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.190
I was merely reinforcing
his constitutional right

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:49.490
to remain silent.

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:50.790
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.980
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And I went
into the office there one day

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.040
and the police chief
happened to be there.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.190
And he was yelling at the publisher
and he was yelling at the editor.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.490
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.130
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And then he
tried to find out where I lived.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.430
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And I realized,
what a profound impact this dryness.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.810
So I think that was the
moment I fell in love

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:10.110
with the political cartooning.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.410
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Absolutely.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.200
Well this year hasn't
given us much to do.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.590
But I literally was in the gift
shop, I needed something to eat

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:22.010
and there was-- it was literally
a basket of deplorable skittles.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.800
And there were too many
political metaphors in one basket.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.150
And I couldn't literally eat it.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.750
But let us go through.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.070
Michael, this is your-- from
the cover from your book,

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:35.030
"Give Me Liberty or
Give Me Obamacare",

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.300
you've had a wealth, you know.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.100
It's always that makes blessing.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.710
You may not agree politically
with who's an office,

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:44.660
but what material they give you
and you've had seven and a half

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.420
and counting years of Obama.

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.720 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: Absolutely its--

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.200
this is the administration that's
the gift that keeps on giving.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.020
And you know, in this
presidential election cycle's been

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.990
like Christmas all year round.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.890
In fact, I don't even think I'm
an editorial cartoonist anymore.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:00.400
I'm a glorified stenographer.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.810
One of the best gag writers in
the business, working for me,

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.480
they're called politician.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.990
I'm just taking notes.

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:11.340
But you know, this book picks
up where the first book ended.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.850
At the beginning of the Obama
Administration, so we kind of--

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:16.620
I am an equal opportunity offender.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.710
Although I'm a right
wing conservative,

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:21.590
in the end of knuckle dragging.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:24.390
But believe me, there's enough
from politics to go around.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:25.970
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:31.010
So we'll look at some of these and
you can go to michaelpramirez.com

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:33.320
to follow him, so that
was information.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.100
So let's look-- This is
the building of a cartoon

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.270
because there's a magic to it.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:43.150 position:56%
So, could you talk about sort of the
process of how a cartoon is born?

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:45.000
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: You know,
Michael, the strange thing is

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.900
when I think of the ideas I see
in images, and so, this is--

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.850
first, I'm not sure
is a cocktail napkin.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:53.150
I have--

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:54.930
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Literally,
drawing on a cocktail--

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.230
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez:
On a cocktail napkin.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.420
And the way this began was
that I had a weekly process

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:02.230
where I would meet with a friend
of mine, who is so well-read.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.910
He knows every subject
you could think of.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:06.210
We read newspapers.

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:08.030
We talk politics for two
hours while we you know,

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.240
eat tacos, 99 Cent Tacos.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.540
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yes.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.790
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And so, I would
think of ideas while we're talking

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:15.820
and I would just sketch it
out on these little napkins.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.640
And I ended up stealing napkins
every week, so I get a big pile.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.720
But every time I think of an
idea, because of so much going on,

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.460
I automatically just
sketch out on a napkin.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.300
So this is the beginning
of the process for here.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.600
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: OK.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.160
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And then what
I do is I transfer to you know,

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:36.680
I just copy a paper, so that I have
a larger, more recognizable version

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.060
of it that I can send
out to a group of guys.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.320
Now, I started doing this when I
was co-managing the editorial page

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.870
that invests with business daily,
about eight people that I sort

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.270
of rely on for their opinion.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.570
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: You
trust their sense?

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:49.870
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: Right.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.350
And I'll email it to them
and try to find, you know,

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:53.870
which ones are the best ones.

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.980
And they tell me which ones they
like the most and they ignore them

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.540
and then just do whatever I want.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:59.840
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.140
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: But then
it comes out too in the black

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.830
and white statue because
we've run cartoons both

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:05.160
in color and black and white.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.480
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And
then you do your color?

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.000
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And then
the color is done on Photoshop.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.980
And this is pretty
much the final copy.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.720
So if you could see from the
napkin sketch to the final,

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.450
it pretty much looks the same.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:16.750
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.380
You know, some cartoonists like
to keep everything very simple,

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.500
and you talked about joy.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.800
There's joy.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.780
You seemed to beautifully
design the framing and you're

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.110
like filling up the frame.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:27.500
Is it something?

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.800
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: Well you know,

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.370
it's the ulterior motive,
date and the trap.

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:32.670
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.590
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: Now, people
are drawn to the visual medium.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:39.310
And people know, philosophically
and politically where I stand.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.960
But if you can make the
illustration, you know,

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.220
interesting enough,
then regardless of that,

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.770
they're going to have
to want to take a peek.

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.070
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:48.370
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: Once you take
a peek, then you've got them.

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:49.670
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: You've
got them in.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:50.970
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: You know, I'm
a big believer in this art form.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.650
What we're just trying to have
is a big of impact is possible,

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.020
to reach as many people as possible
and be the catalyst for thought.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.320
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.620
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And so
you know, everybody loves art.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.090
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, well let's
take a peek at some of your work.

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:04.460
So tell us about "We
the Government".

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: So now this is--

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.060
these were cartoons
that are in the book.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.300
"We the Government" is pretty
simple and straightforward cartoon.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.940
The way I think about it is
political cartoons are sort

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.440
of like the Super Bowl ads.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.070
You had a few seconds
to seize our attention.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.350
Three seconds to make the sale and
the only difference is, with the,

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:23.110
you know, political cartoons,
you're selling an idea.

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:25.290
With the Super Bowl ad,
they're selling a product.

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:26.590
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:27.890
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez:
This is just a simple,

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:30.090
straightforward representation
of how we've shifted

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:36.690 position:56%
from being a Democratic Republic
that is ruled by the people shifting

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:37.990
to the power of the government.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:42.090
And here's the "United
States Dollar Made in China".

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.390
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And I have
huge, in tiles signature down there.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:46.890
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Love it.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.190
OK.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:49.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: "Give me Liberty

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:50.790
or Give Me a Government
Bay Allowance."

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:52.090
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yes.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:53.390
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: Where
I got the title of my book.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.870
It was originally going to be
"Conservatives are from Mars

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:59.930
and Progressives are from
Uranus" but they rejected that.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:01.230
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Couldn't do it.

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:02.530
Could it-- And you send that up

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:06.380
to the eighth gang
[inaudible] that one right.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.640
Then you got Obama
with the selfie here.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: The selfie is
in your realm, his realm is burning.

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.290
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, absolutely.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:16.720
Now you really, I mean, cartoonists
like your drama the Big Ears,

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:21.080
but you really, I mean it's
like lips and then full on ear.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.960
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: But you
know what, the way I stylized

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.900
and of course his eyes
are always half closed,

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.620
who's looking down his nose and--

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:27.920
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: OK.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.260
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And then the
ears are getting bigger every time

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.150
there's an end truth
or half truth or a lie.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.790
And so, I think by the end of
December, he might just be,

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.160
two little beady eyes
and two [inaudible].

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.720
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow, OK.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.340
Let's see, and then
the Mountain Day.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.900
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: Right,
someday all this will be yours.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.370
And you know, when
you think about it,

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:49.020
you've got $20 trillion
of national debt.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.320
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.620
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez:
We've got, you know,

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.290
the federal budget
is like $3 trillion.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:54.730
You put then perspectives.

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.790
We have $128 trillion dollars

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.930
and unfunded liabilities
from entitlements.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:00.230
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.040
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And what
we're giving our kids, I mean,

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.130
$20 trillion, I don't
know what it was.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.990
At $17 trillion, it was like
$54,000 worth of depth per person.

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:09.290
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:11.360
It's not going away and so.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:16.900
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And this is my
12, 13, we need a president which,

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:21.000
I can't read it exactly, but
basically the gag at the cartoon is

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.720
that everything they described,

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:28.140
prescribed to Trump is exactly
what our president Obama has done

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.780 position:56%
for the last seven and a half years.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.190
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:32.550
And then weekend--

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:33.850
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez:
Weekend at Bernie's.

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.150
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yes.

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:36.500
[ Laughter ]

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.350
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: You know, I
wish I can make stop pics as well

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.030
as I could, carton predictions.

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:43.330
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
that's beautiful.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez:
That's pretty solid.

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:45.930
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And then you
have great found with Trump's hair,

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:48.250
his lips-- I mean, you
go to tell him on this.

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:49.550
Could you talk about--

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.950
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: You know, Trump
has just been a wonderful gift.

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:53.250
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.410
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And here,
it's building the wall, you know,

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:57.210
he saying some of the right things.

00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:59.830
But he says only the
wrong things all the time.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.410
We just want him to stop--

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:05.270
I had another cartoon where I had
a Trump sticker cross his mouth.

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:07.550
That was he can promote
himself but not say anything.

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:08.850
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:10.150
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez:
Let's for his campaign.

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:11.450
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
that's beautiful, yeah.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.140
And you get into the eyebrows
too as beautifully as the hair.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.190
Some people miss the
art of that eyebrow.

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:17.490
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: Well you know,

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:19.170 position:56%
character interests are an important
element of political cartoon.

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:22.360
Because they actually define the
personality as well, when you think

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.840
of Richard Nixon during
Watergate, you look at--

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.130
you know, the cartoon said,
just seated that period.

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.430
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:30.880
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: Where he
wasn't so dark and he didn't have

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.160
that you know, [inaudible]
at 9'o clock in the morning.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.590
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
he got jollier.

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:36.890
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: Right.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.190
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And the
whole thing changed, the nose--

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.490
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: It's
darker, more foreboding.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:40.790
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:42.430
This one always shocks me,
the old that the you know--

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:45.670
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: Hillary in 2016
which is-- once again, it's just,

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:49.020 position:56%
in these cartoons, I think resonate
the best and pretty straightforward.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.320
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.700
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And basically
I'm saying Hillary Clinton is a

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.190
third turn for Barack Obama.

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:57.090
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah and then
always strange a bit of fellows.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:58.460
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: Right and
this is the cartoon I drew

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:01.570
after the Republican Convention
which is the morning after.

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:03.850
Then suddenly after
they're drunk in the party,

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:05.960
they realize who they've
woken up with.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.260
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.700
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: I was
saying I was amazing, I know.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.520
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: You've sent
this to me a couple of weeks ago

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.100 position:56%
and I did not sleep well that night.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.770
I had to get those out of my head.

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:16.940
And now, I won't sleep
at all tonight either,

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.650
so that's a little [inaudible].

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:19.950
So this--

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:21.250
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: This is
the cartoon I did the day

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:22.800
after the Democratic Convention.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.960
You see it's confetti, and
now it's Hillary's e-mails.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.260
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: That's beautiful.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.560
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: That's right.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.390
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: That's beautiful
and the detail is just gorgeous.

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:32.430
OK. And playing off a
movie title, obviously.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.610
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And
so we use iconic images

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:35.910
that people can relate to.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:37.210
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, it's
like a current culture survey.

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:38.510
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: Right.

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:39.810
It's you know, it's
sort of a you know,

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:42.190
hitching your cartoon to the star.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:46.250 position:56%
Whenever people are focused on,
whatever I can utilize to get people

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:48.800
to look at the cartoons
where I can have the impact.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.810
This is based on the Angry
Bird's movie obviously.

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:55.540
And I just have one angry bird, the
American eagle and you're saying,

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.760
really out of 320 million
people, with the two best with--

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.060
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: These
are our choices?

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.360
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: Yeah.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:02.660
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: OK.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.490
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And then
here, it depends on fire.

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:06.720
We determine what started
the massive fires.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.410
Hillary Clinton's pants, and
saying what-- and to be accurate,

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:13.300
it should say pant suits on fire.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:14.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yes.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:17.620
I recognized those are
from [inaudible] and so--

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:18.920
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez:
And then you know,

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.880
everybody has a "I Tramp
Stamp" this is the Trump stamp.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:26.100
And I always have that tattoo
that you sort of regret it.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.400
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yes, exactly.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.480
Wake up in the next
morning and there-- yeah.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.730
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And a little
version of the Clinton Foundation.

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:36.210
This is what the foundation
of the Clinton Foundation,

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:40.480
which is our huge bags of money.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.130
I feel humbled to be
here since you guys are--

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:45.160
you're paying me $200,000, right?

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.460
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.290
Of course, of course, yeah.

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:51.250
We'll just talk to the foundation.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:54.630
They control that fund.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:58.100
And so here, you got a double,
sort of twin shot of both of them.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.400
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: Right.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.040
Right, I was thinking
about these candidates.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.540
And a friend of mine was
making campaign buns.

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:07.820
And it inspired me for
this idea, what you say.

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:11.370
At least he's not Hillary,
at least he's not Trump.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:13.580
She seems to be the
focus of this election.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:17.570
In the fading light of liberty, in
this policy of leading from beyond.

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:18.870
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:21.280
That just makes me sad for them.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.450
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: You know, I was
influenced by Paul Conrad as well.

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:25.750
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And I read that
newspaper every morning with my dad.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:28.390
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:29.690
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez:
Swap papers and--

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:32.280
So largely, Jeff McNelly [assumed
spelling] and Paul Conrad.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.670
And I was friends with
both of them --

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:35.970
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Sure.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.270
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And
I love their cartoons.

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:40.010
Paul and I could probably
not agree on a single thing.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.310
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:42.610
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: But
you cannot-- You cannot--

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:46.210
But admire the dramatic
nature of his work.

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:47.510
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: The impact.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:48.810
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And
these beautiful you know,

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:52.200
heartening dramatic images
and the powerful message

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.700
which I believe that's the
essence of editorial cartooning.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.000
&gt;&gt;Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.650 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: I know a lot of
cartoonists today because we've kind

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:01.000
of shifted from journalism
into infotainment.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.300
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.600
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez:
And I kind of think

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.900
that editorial cartoonists ought

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.320
to be a hero [inaudible]
doing about current events.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.150
So like the tonight show model up.

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:09.450
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:10.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: But I'm a
big believer in editorial cartoon

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.750
as an aspect of journalism.

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:14.050
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Absolutely.

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:15.410
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And that the
sensitive messages are the most

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:16.710
important element.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.010
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:19.310
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And so, I
mean, you don't have to be able

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:21.610
to draw an effect ironically
and if I don't like to draw.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:25.210
Because my inability to capture
what I see in my mind's eye,

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:27.400
and that was frustrating.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.700
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.080
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: Therefore,
the electroshock treatments puts--

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:35.320
or I just watch, you know, I
turn on CSPAN and watch congress.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.810
And that doles on my
senses right there.

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:40.830
But you know, I'm--
as corny as it sounds,

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.540
I'm a big believer in the art form.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.970
I want to have an impact.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:47.270
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:49.990
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: In my stint
at the Memphis Commercial Appeal,

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:54.390
there's instance where during
that, it was the early 90s.

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:58.600
And so, we're just still going
through this poor economic times.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:02.300
And the Tennessee legislature
cannot pass their pay raise

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.880
because constitutionally, they
have-- have a vote of the people.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.180
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.480
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And
so I was there at the end

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.960
of the legislative session when
they're passing these flurry bills.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.260
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:12.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And there
was one where they attached

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.890 position:56%
to this unrelated bill a writer
that increased their pension by 40%.

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:20.330 position:56%
I was there on the well at 1
o'clock in the morning in the house.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:23.980
I noticed this thing, showed
it to our national bureau guy.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:27.610 position:56%
And I did this carton which had this
big pig and looked like amazingly

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.470
like governor [inaudible],
I'm not saying that it is.

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:31.770
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.210
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And
his advisors were saying,

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:36.800
how can you justify a 40%
pension increase in light

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.590
of this budget short problem?

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.890
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:41.190
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And
what are you going to do

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:42.490
when there's a public outcry?

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:43.790
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:45.090
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And
the pig had a big smile

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:46.390
on his face and he said retire.

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:47.690
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow, wow.

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:48.990
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: When
their cartoon had the stance

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:52.760
with the accompanying article, they
were sent the bill on five days.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.060
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:57.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: So, I mean--
I'm a big believer on this art form.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.780
Passionately believe.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:02.220
You know, this-- the essence of
where we live, this foundation

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.420
of liberty that we
have and you know,

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.560
we both visited art [inaudible].

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.970
We know what the price of
liberty and freedom is.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:13.060
I want to remind people that
this is their government.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.040
That these people are
their public servants.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.340
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Absolutely.

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:17.640
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And
they're here to serve us

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.940
and they're here to do [inaudible].

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.240
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, absolutely.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.410
Well, a man that's continuing
to do journalism and I you know,

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:25.960
some people in a click
bait time want

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:29.220
to offer just the best punch
line, the best, people used to say

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.710
like it was a Jay Leno laugh line,
but to be able to deliver something

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:36.110
with the power and force
and relevance, is to me,

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:38.230
it was like what journalism
was about.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:41.320
So, and to go to that, let's get

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:45.370
with Darrin Bell's work
more from the left.

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:49.100 position:56%
So, I think this one was from last
year Darrin, when you had the gavel,

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:52.310
the Supreme Court gavel
raising gay from marriage

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:55.610
because you talked
about coming up with--

00:23:55.610 --> 00:24:00.910
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: I've been drawing
cartoons about gay marriage

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:04.190
and equal rights for
gay people since 2000.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.490
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:06.790
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Before a lot
of other people were doing it.

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:13.250
When I was a cartoonist for my
college paper at UC Berkeley.

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:14.550
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:17.600
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Back then, it
wasn't even popular at UC Berkeley.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.900
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Be
a political cartoon.

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.200 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: No, it was [laughs].

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:24.200 position:56%
That, I mean, I have my own protest.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.670
But the issue gave--
it was not popular.

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:29.970
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:35.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And the more went
on, the more detail my cartoons got.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.070
The more I tried to
drive my point home.

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:39.370
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:43.070
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And sooner, after
a while, the tides started to turn.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:47.090
And when the Supreme Court,
if I only put an end to it,

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:51.320
I thought for a second, I thought
now, I've got to do something

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.380
like really, like the most
beautiful cartoon I've ever done.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.680
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.980
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: It
has to be detailed.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:58.280
It has to fill up the whole space.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.520
I have to top everything
because this is it.

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.820
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.120
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: It's
the finish line.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.420
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.600
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: But, all I felt
was there is no gay marriage now.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.900
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.200
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: It's just marriage.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.500
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.800
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And
that was the cartoon.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.880
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, and you and
I talked a couple years ago about,

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.350
that you need to feel it.

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:20.020
Your passion, emotion.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.900
Some people say, like don't
get worked up and you feel

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.800
like that's something, that's
a resource that you'd have

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.660
that goes into your work.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:32.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I usually start with,

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.570
I don't start with like
writing down an idea.

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:38.890
I usually start just drawing.

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:42.710
And whatever I feel,
let that come out.

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:46.690
And then I massage
that into a cartoon.

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:51.250
I make sure it says the
point logically as well.

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:53.870
But if it's not something
that I'm feeling,

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:55.870
I don't feel like it's
something worth saying.

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:57.170
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah.

00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:58.470
Very well said.

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:02.610
Well, speaking of, The Party
of Small Government [laughs].

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:07.510
Yikes. What were you thinking
when you were drawing this one?

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:13.660
[ Laughter ]

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.230
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Well, it's just--

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:19.140
sometimes, when there's
something going

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.760
on that I feel is just
plain disgusting

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.360
like getting into those issue.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.660
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.960
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Trying to
legislate those issues.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.260
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:29.560
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: I try to come

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:30.940
up with an image that's
sort of equally disgusting.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:32.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:35.690
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And gets right to
the heart of why it's disgusting.

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:38.260
And that's the ultimate
hypocrisy I think that --

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:39.560
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.290
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: The Party of Small
Government should not be involved

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:43.590
in anything like that.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:44.890
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:46.950
Well you're editors with the
Washington Post writers group

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:52.940 position:56%
when you get disgusted-- disgusting,
do you-- is your editor, you know,

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:54.720
what's your batting average

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:58.390
of getting disgusting
cartoons into print or not?

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:00.700
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Ninety
nine point nine percent.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.010
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: All
right, all right.

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:04.100
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: They're
behind me almost all the way.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:05.610
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: All
right, that's fantastic.

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:09.010
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: I'd only-- I only
had one or two cartoon spiked.

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:10.310
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: OK.

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:11.610
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And those
all end up on my Facebook.

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:12.910
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: OK.

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:14.460
So flag those or flag this.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:19.540
So you want to tell
us about this one?

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:26.210
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Well, coming into
the election, Fox News and the rest

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:31.670
of the right wing intelligence
here were trying to talk--

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:33.200 position:56%
trying to reach out to black people.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.500
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.800
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: They're trying

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.290
to advance the theory--
the plantation theory.

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:38.590
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:40.670
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Telling us that,
why are you supporting Democrats?

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:42.220
They haven't done anything for you.

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.520
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:47.660
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And there's
nothing as belittling and demeaning

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:52.210
as telling somebody that they've
been supporting the wrong people

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:54.750
for the last 50 years because
they don't know any better.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:56.050
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:58.160
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: So that's
where I came up with.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.840
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Insulting
the intelligence of.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:07.290
Yeah. And not completely dissimilar
here about racism and being gone

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:10.260
and the tattoos, you can
see the confederate tattoo.

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:11.560
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Yeah.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.380
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow,
that is disgusting.

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.250
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: That
was during the--

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:19.250
now you all remember the
confederate flag was being removed

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:22.330
from state houses that
massacred the [inaudible].

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:23.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:27.210
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And I-- they
could remove the symbol.

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:28.510
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:29.810
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: I want
them to remove the symbol.

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:31.110
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:32.410
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: That's
great, I think it's--

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:34.830
I always thought it was
a symbol of treason.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:39.550
I never understood why people--
why people are proud of it.

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:43.140
Because it-- the word
was about slavery.

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.460
But, you can remove the symbol,

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.990
but it doesn't really
change anybody's hearts.

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:52.170
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah,
well said very well said.

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:56.180
And this is his powerful OK-- so
meaning, it's such a decision.

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.580
You're going to show
something is graphic.

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.710
I talked to Paul Conrad
about this one,

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:03.470
so about showing dead
bodies and what do you do?

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:06.620
I mean he would draw a
child and board a child

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:09.270 position:56%
on a crucifix, you know, on a cross.

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:13.740
So, but tell us about this
you know, and it's so I see,

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:17.030
it can derive still humor from that
conflict between having something

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:20.350
as light as balloons and the
bodies, can you talk about this?

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:22.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Well, that's another
one of those disgusting things.

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:27.270
You have this-- You have
this massacre at a college

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:31.890
and then you had a candidate
running for president

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:35.370
who basically turns himself into
a crown by interjecting himself

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:37.570
into it and saying
well, if it had been me,

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:40.060
I would have rushed the gunmen.

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:41.940
I'm not blaming you guys.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.740
Dead people for not doing it,
but I would have done that.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.040
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, exactly.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.700
He's suddenly like a superhero,

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:51.720
like he would have just
handled it perfectly.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.860
And then you did this.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.950
Darrin Bell: The next
day job-- stuff happen.

00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:58.250
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:00.970
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: I think
you lost right there.

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:02.540
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, absolutely.

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:05.110
So, and you got the
NRA solution here.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:06.410
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Yeah.

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:11.950 position:56%
Well, the day after the-- the
massacre at the-- at the night club.

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:13.250
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:14.550
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Florida.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:15.850
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:17.610
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: People were already
talking about how if-- if the--

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:19.580
if it hadn't been a gun free zone.

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:20.880
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.180
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: If
people have had guns.

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:23.480
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.780
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And my first
thought was this is a--

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.490
like almost pitch black room full
of drunk people and strobe lights.

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:29.790
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:31.210
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And even the cops--

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:32.510
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:33.810
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Yeah, and even--

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:35.110
even the cops didn't want to go

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:36.630
because that's not a good
environment for shooting people.

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:38.210
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah.

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:39.690
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And so that--

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:42.430
that's not exactly how
it would have turned out.

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:43.730
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:45.030
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: If all
these people had been armed.

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:46.750
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
and then you--

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:49.970 position:56%
you invoked the Little Rascals here?

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:51.270
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Yeah.

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:52.570
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So can you
talk about the Hillary hater,

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:53.990
the He Man Hillary Haters Club?

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:56.800
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Yeah, it says
that the meeting is now in order.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.530
First order of business, what
you felt it say if you were

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:04.420
to change the name of our club to
the select committee on Benghazi.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:07.810
Well, they-- they've tried
her seven or eight times--

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:09.110
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:10.410
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: --
and never turned--

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:11.710
never turned up what
they were looking for.

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:13.010
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:15.240
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And it was pretty
obvious I think to everybody

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.170 position:56%
who didn't already despise Clinton--

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:19.470
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:20.770
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: -- that this
was-- this was political.

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:22.070
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:23.370
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: They--
they were trying,

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:24.910
because until Benghazi happened,
they were all praising her.

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:30.450
They were saying she is-- she is
an excellent bipartisan person

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.250
who we could work with.

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:33.550
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:34.990
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Why can't the
President be more like her?

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:36.290
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:37.590
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And then it became
obvious she was going to run

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:39.800
for President so they
have to find some issue

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.750
that they knew they could
hang around her neck.

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:43.050
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:45.870 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: -- in a couple of
years when the election came around.

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:47.170
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
yeah, [inaudible].

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:48.470
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Yeah.

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:52.120
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So you got-- so
you got the-- again, to have fun,

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:55.060
I mean a glorious year
with the Trump caricature

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:58.170
and to have great fun and
that sort of that scow.

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:00.780
But can you talk about this one?

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.080
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Well, that--

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.740
that guy really, he
buys his own publicity.

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:06.280
He really pumps himself out.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.580
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.350
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: I don't know if he
took himself seriously at first.

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:11.650
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:12.950
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: But
the more he talked

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:14.250
and the more the crowds he saw--

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:15.550
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:16.850
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: --
the more he bought

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:18.150
into his own-- his own height.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:19.450
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:20.750
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And he's--

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:23.880
he's gotten into dangerous
xenophobic demigod territory.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:26.350
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yes, so
more and more self-inflated.

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:27.650
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Yeah.

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:28.950
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: As if were--

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:30.250
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Yeah.

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:31.880
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So you get
Bernie voters, Hillary voters--

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.180
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Yeah, well--

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:34.480
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Tipping
the scale here?

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.780
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Yeah.

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:40.650
I-- as-- as Michael does, I go
after-- I go after my own side too.

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:41.950
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:47.650
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Because
with what-- what I do with--

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:50.480 position:56%
the reason I want to be an editorial
cartoonist is I want to talk

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:54.090
about what-- what bothers me, what
I think-- what I think is wrong.

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:55.390
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:56.690
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And
what I think-- we're--

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:59.760
we're a better country than-- than
what-- than what we see out there.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.060
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:02.360
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And one

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.760
of the things I think is wrong
is the system being rigged.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.060
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.640
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And
whether it's rigged on--

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:10.550
on the right or rigged on the left,
we should pay attention to that

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:11.970
and we shouldn't be OK with that.

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:13.270
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:15.510 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: So you've become
a Donald Trump supporter then?

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:19.850
[ Laughter ]

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:21.930
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Well, the
thing-- and if you'll notice,

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:24.530
there are more voters
on her side anyway.

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:26.420
That's because she
was wining anyhow.

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:27.720
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.020
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: He didn't have--

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:30.320
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.690
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: -- the DNC did
not have to step in on her behalf

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:36.250
and schedule-- schedule the debates
at-- at 1 in the morning and--

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:37.550
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:38.850
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: When nobody--
when like two people are watching.

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.150
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah.

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:41.630
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: They didn't
have to do any of that.

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:42.930
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:44.560
Well, you gave [inaudible]
quite a manicure there.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:45.860
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Yeah.

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:47.160
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So
it was-- it was good.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:51.160
So, can you talk about the--
your take on the Hand of God?

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.500
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Well, that's--

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:57.310
that's one of those things where I
just started drawing what I felt.

00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:58.610
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:00.930
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: He was talking
about the wall and he was saying

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:04.640
for the millionth time, and
I was thinking this is just--

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.240
that's not our-- our country.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.540
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:08.840
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: It's not
the country I grew up in.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.140
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:11.440
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Who is this guy.

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.740
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:14.040
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Who-- where is
he getting his inspiration from,

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.500
who-- who created him?

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:16.800
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.100
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And
then I had [inaudible].

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:19.400
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And then it came.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.700
Thanks for making him
clothed by the way,

00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:22.000
in terms of avoiding disgusting--

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.380
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: I--
I didn't at first.

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:25.470
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: Thanks-- thanks
for putting that image of mine.

00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:27.670
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I'm
sorry, I'm just--

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:30.050
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: I-- I added
the suit at the last minute.

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:31.350
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Thank you.

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:32.650
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: You're welcome.

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:33.950
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: OK.

00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:35.250
Donald Trump's America here.

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:36.550
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Yeah.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:39.800
Well, I-- I don't think all
cartoons have to be funny.

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:44.530
In fact, I was talking to Michael
earlier about some-- we have--

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:47.920
one of our favorite comics that we
have in common is Calvin and Hobbes

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.460
and I was thinking back
to when I was a kid.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:53.470
There was one day when I realize
I don't think I've ever laughed

00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:55.040
at a Calvin and Hobbes.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.340
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:57.640
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Even though
it's my favorite strip.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.940
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:00.240
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Every-- what--

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.540
what I think when I see
this, that's-- that's true.

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:02.840
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.340
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: That's why I loved
it because it made me feel some--

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:06.850
identified with it,
I saw truth in it.

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:08.150
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:10.680
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: So I-- I don't
think humor is necessary--

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.740
is necessary for every cartoon.

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:14.040
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.280
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Especially when
it comes to something like that.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.000
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:26.380 position:56%
And so you got the gunner blood
acts here for President and another,

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:29.070
you know, just that hardcore.

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:31.240 position:56%
When you just use a pop or red, boy,

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:33.400
it has such an impact,
so much more impact.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.830
Can you talk about this one?

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:36.820
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Well, the-- the
guy in the audience says, still,

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.500
I like that he says what he thinks.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.040
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.310
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And
we all know, that's--

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:43.890
that's what people
say about, you know.

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:45.750
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah,
and they use that trick.

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:47.050
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: But--
but I think it--

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:50.460 position:56%
what I'm trying to get across is
it's what people think that matters.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:51.760
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.600
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: It's not--
if somebody isn't a hero,

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.670
somebody isn't worthy of a vote--

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:56.970
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:58.270
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: -- just
because they're honest.

00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:59.570
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:00.870
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: If they're
honest about horrible ideas

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:05.010
and horrible thoughts about-- and
stereotypical thoughts about--

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:06.550
about their fellow Americans--

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:07.850
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:09.150
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: That's important.

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:10.450
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:11.750
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: You know.

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:13.050
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:14.350
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: The
content is important.

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:15.650
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:16.950
You know, there's an old idea.

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:18.250
It goes back to Frank
Capra films, you know, oh,

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:19.550
you like the plain spoken
American or the honest American,

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:20.850
but then what's behind
that, you know.

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:22.150
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Yeah.

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:23.720
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So speaking of--

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.530
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: And I like
gunner blood acts by the way.

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:26.830
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah [laughs].

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:28.130
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: I was
an early supporter of it.

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:29.430
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: You were?

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:35.160
The-- so can you talk about the--
about what's malignant here?

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:37.870
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Yeah, well,
there is-- there is a growth on--

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:39.170
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:40.470
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:41.770
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: He's in trouble.

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:43.970
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow,
he looks so sad.

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:45.340
I mean really sad.

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:47.500
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Well, he doesn't--
he doesn't want to have it.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:48.800
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.100
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: He's stuck with it.

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.400
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: He's
stuck, he's stuck.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.580
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: I'm just
glad it wasn't a colonoscopy.

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:56.170
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I'm glad you
didn't say colon Paula-oscopy

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:57.470
[phonetic] there.

00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:00.350
So you got to raise again
with the noses and again,

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:02.590
you're going with both
of them lying.

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:03.890
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Yeah.

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:05.190
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: But you're
putting them in opposition.

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:06.490
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez:
This-- this gives back to--

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:07.790
to what you're saying earlier.

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:09.090
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:10.390
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Am I
going to go with Trump?

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:11.690
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:12.990
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: No, because
I mean-- he-- she lies.

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:14.290
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:16.880
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: He-- she-- he is
in a whole different lead from her.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.180
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: He's
in a class by himself?

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.120
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Yeah
class by himself.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.420
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: OK.

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:22.720
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And-- but
this is me being optimistic.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.020
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:25.600
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: This is me thinking
Americans are going to be fed

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:29.460
up with lies eventually and
whoever lies first is going to--

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:30.980
whoever lies the worst--

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:32.280
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.580
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: -- is
going to be finished.

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:34.880
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: OK.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.890
So you're-- you're saying
Gary Johnson is going to win?

00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:39.190
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Jill, Jill Stein.

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:40.490
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: Jill.

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:41.790
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Jill Stein, OK.

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:47.410
And can you talk about this-- this
with each one, the split balloon?

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:48.710
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Yeah.

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:51.860
Well, I-- every chance I get, I
try-- I try to be even had to--

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:56.460
here, this was when
the FBI announced

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:59.480
that they were not
going to indict Clinton.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.780
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.080
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: But at
the same time, it seem--

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.820
they seemed to make a
case for an indictment.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:05.120
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.480
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And the Republicans
ceased on the case they made

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:11.450 position:56%
for the indictment and the Democrats
ceased on the fact that she--

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:12.750
there was nothing they could prove.

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:14.050
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: Yeah.

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:15.350
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:18.130
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: So, that's a
literal representation of--

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:19.430
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Of the wording.

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:20.770
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: -- of them
looking at the same sentence.

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:22.070
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:23.370
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And saying two
completely different things.

00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:25.360
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Same
two sides, you got Trump

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.870
and you got the hair
[inaudible] here.

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:28.170
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Yeah.

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:30.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: The only thing we
have to fear is Muslims and Mexicans

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:34.460 position:56%
and China and Hillary and people
who are upset about police brutality

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:38.850
and then the NATO members
and on and on and on.

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:42.170
You know, we should-- I did want
to quickly get to, you know,

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:45.620
you and I have talked in
interviews about police brutality

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:50.320
and you've talked about
your mom gave--

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:53.680
made sure when you were a
boy that you lose a toy gun

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.240
that was a translucent
toy gun, that it was clear

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.720
that it wasn't a solid
toy gun, that, you know,

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:02.150
we talked about having a
conversation, when we-- and you--

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:06.810
you have, you know, you
have a couple of children.

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:08.490
I know you have a baby.

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:10.990
The-- So you know, you
talked about police brutality

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:12.480
and then [inaudible]
with everything.

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:16.240
I mean that-- that comes up
that you must feel passionate

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:20.970
in your current cartoons because
as a reader, something comes to it.

00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:25.200
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Well,
I-- I could have--

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.470
I was an editorial
cartoonist in the '90s.

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:35.370
I was a freelancer and I quit after
9/11 to focus on my comic strips.

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:36.670
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:38.260
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And I-- I
just did not want to do it.

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.560
I was happy.

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.610
I was happy not having to
watch the news everyday

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:45.440
and creating my own little universe

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.700
and ignoring this one
when it got too bad.

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.000
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.680
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: But then
Trayvon Martin got shot.

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:51.980
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:57.190
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And that whole
thing-- the country divided into--

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:58.490
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:00.380
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: -- and half the
country was saying he deserved it.

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.680
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:05.540
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And it
was so just dehumanizing.

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:06.840
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:10.680
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: I thought, and
when Zimmerman was acquitted,

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:15.310
I wrote a week of strips where
he accompanies Trayvon Martin

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:16.610
through the afterlife.

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:18.080
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, and we
should say this is in Candorville.

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:19.380
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Yeah.

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:20.680
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: It was--
it was a great series.

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:22.820
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And by the
end of it, I realized I--

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:25.340
I had to leave out most
of what I wanted to say

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.690 position:56%
because this is still a comic strip.

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:28.990
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:32.460
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And I realized I
could have said all these stuff

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:33.760
on the editorial page.

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.060
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:38.000 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: So, next opportunity
I got, I asked my editor,

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.360
"Are you still interested in
me doing editorial cartoons?"

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.660
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:42.960
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And
she said, "of course."

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.260
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:45.560
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: So--

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:46.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And there you go.

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:48.160
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: So I-- I-- but
it goes back to when I was a kid.

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.460
I-- I could have been Tamir Rice--

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:50.760
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.060
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: --
because of that gun.

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:53.360
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.690
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: My-- My mom, she
didn't tell me why but she told me

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:59.520
that I couldn't play with the
same toy guns my other friends

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.820
played with.

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:05.260
She said I had to play with this
bright green ugly translucent

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:06.560
water gun.

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:09.370
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And so I did,
and so I was walking to--

00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:12.420
I was walking to a corner store
one day, snuck out of the house,

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:14.520
I was too young to leave
by myself but I wanted

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:17.040
to go get a comic book
and play [inaudible].

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.340
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:19.640
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: So, I was--

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.840
I was there with my gun and
I was shooting the bench,

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:24.000
I was shooting the stop
sign and everything

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.490
because there were Stormtroopers
in the sky, and I was Hans Solo.

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:28.790
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:32.630
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And I knelt down to
fill up the gun from the puddle--

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:33.930
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:35.230
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And there
was a shadow and I looked up

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:37.220
and it was a police officer.

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.520
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.820
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And
he had his gun out.

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:41.120
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:44.130
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And he said that--
he asked what I was doing there,

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:48.530
he asked where I live, he
said they had some complaints.

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:50.090
He took my gun from me--

00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:51.390
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:52.690
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And then he went--

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:53.990
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: That's
why you're really mad, is it?

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:55.290
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Well--

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:56.590
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez:
I'm just kidding.

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:57.890
I'm just kidding.

00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:59.190
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: But
if it had been instead

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:00.900
of bright green translucent--

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:02.200
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.500
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: -- plastic--

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:04.800
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.100
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: I might
not be here right now.

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:07.400
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.700
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And I was
just being a regular kid.

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.000
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.710
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: So this is-- this
is important to me especially now

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:16.490
that I have a son who is
almost 3 and I look at him

00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:19.610
and I'm thinking what am I going
to have to talk to him about this.

00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:20.910
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:22.210
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: We--
we've been with--

00:42:22.210 --> 00:42:24.700
whenever people bring guns
to the park, we take him home

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:26.740
and take him somewhere else
because I don't want him

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:28.040
to want to play with them.

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:29.340
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:33.270
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: So, I don't know
how to do an awful lot of things.

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:34.570
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:35.870
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: But I know
how to be a cartoonist.

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:37.170
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:39.160
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And every time
I sit down to draw a cartoon,

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:43.050
every time something like this
happens where some innocent--

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:45.000
innocent person, Black,
White, whatever,

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.710
is shot by the police,
I think about my son.

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:50.010
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:52.940
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: And I think I need
to make the world better for him.

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:54.240
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.540
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: The only
way I know how to do it is

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:56.840
to keep talking about it.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.140
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:42:58.140 --> 00:42:59.440
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: So
that's-- that's what I do.

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.740
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yes.

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.040
Well, I wish we have time.

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.340
Well said--

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.640
[ Applause ]

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.030 position:56%
Well said, quickly, can I-- I should
probably jump ahead to this one.

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:08.950
You've drawn Trump there
as the Lincoln Memorial,

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:11.070
you had a house divided and--

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:15.770
and then Trump with
outreach in a whack, right?

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:17.070
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Mm-hmm.

00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:18.370
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, and-- and--

00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:25.590
oh, Hillary, well this one
caught my-- Hillary with candor,

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:29.050
penicillin, you know, with the
pneumonia news with the pneumonia,

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:32.420
even had candor, I
thought that was powerful.

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:35.590
And then like we talked about being
killed because of their color,

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:39.070
you're willing to also brought by
the police when they're, you know,

00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:44.280
were on the-- were only
targeted, and it's OK.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.930
Let's just say we feared
for our lives.

00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:48.980
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: 2015
was a bad year for that.

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:51.330
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, wow, wow.

00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:52.770
We're-- we need to wrap up.

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:56.640
So let me just ask each of
you guys, as cartoonist,

00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:01.030
not as American citizens but
as good American cartoonists,

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:04.710
you don't just say who you're-- who
you're voting for or who you want

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:08.610
but are there certain aspects
of each candidate that getting

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:11.070
in to the new year, you
just sort of salivate.

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:15.380
Is there satirical red
meat on the horizon?

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:18.220
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Well, I'll
just say the obvious one.

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:20.520
Both of them have trouble
with the truth.

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.820
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:23.120
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Neither one
of them is straightforward.

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.420
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:25.720
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: They're--

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:27.130
They're both hiding things
that we deserve to know.

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:28.430
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:30.050
So there will be material
no matter--

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:32.400 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: You know, I have
to say as a political cartoonist,

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.760
I'm voting for both of them.

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:35.720
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow, OK, yeah.

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.020
OK.

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:38.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Ramirez: One's in
California and one is in Chicago.

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:40.160
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: OK.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:45.210
Yo might-- you could do two in
Chicago into a price of one.

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:48.810
Well, thank you guys because you
enlightened, you make us laugh,

00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:52.640 position:56%
and at the same time we're informed
because you guys do true journalism.

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:55.010
A big hand please for Michael
Ramirez and Darrin Bell.

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:56.310

00:44:56.310 --> 00:44:57.610
Thank you guys.

00:44:57.610 --> 00:45:00.240
&gt;&gt; Darrin Bell: Thank you.
