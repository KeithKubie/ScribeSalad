Here's part 2 for our math quill guide for unit 5. I mentioned learning about

00:00:04.412 --> 00:00:08.119
entering numbers is scientific notation. Let's see how we can do this. To enter

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:12.372
a number in scientific notation. You'll want to type in the leading number or

00:00:12.372 --> 00:00:16.329
decimal followed by the asterisk symbol. This asterisk symbol will create a dot

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.925
or a multiplication in between our first number and our power of 10. Be sure you

00:00:20.925 --> 00:00:24.860
don't type x for the multiplication sign. We'll think it's a variable instead.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.274
Next, you'll type in the number 10 followed by the carrot symbol and then the

00:00:29.274 --> 00:00:33.594
exponent of 5. So now you try it out. You can follow these keystrokes to enter

00:00:33.594 --> 00:00:37.605
this number in scientific notation and then, try these on your own. Enter your

00:00:37.605 --> 00:00:39.824
answers here and good luck.
