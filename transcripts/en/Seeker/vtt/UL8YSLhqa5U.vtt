You might think vertigo is a problem that
people have when they’re afraid of heights...or

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.540
are Jimmy Stewart.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.540
Nope!

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.340
Vertigo is all in your head...specifically,
your ears.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.820
Hey guys, Lissette here for Dnews.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.200
Vertigo is one of the four main categories
of dizziness - it’s a subjective experience

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.199
that makes you feel like you’ve lost a sense
of your surroundings.

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.449
But there are some very real causes behind
it - in some cases, vertigo can even lead

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.780
to nausea, vomiting and your eyes to twitch
from side to side.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.370
There are two types of vertigo: peripheral
vertigo and central vertigo.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.829
Central vertigo is a neurological problem--
usually in the brain stem or cerebellum--

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.809
which can be caused things like multiple sclerosis,
stroke, and tumors.

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.840
But the most common by far, and what we’ll
be focusing on here, is peripheral vertigo.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.700
Because, as a 2002 study in The British Journal
of General Practice reports, at least 93%

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.429
of patients with vertigo, are those with peripheral
vertigo...which has a lot to do with problems

00:00:58.429 --> 00:00:59.739
in your ears.

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.840
Your ears are super important for keeping
your balance and navigating the world.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.430
They help you orient yourself in it.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.980
In your inner ear, there are these tiny hairs
called stereocilia, that line a pouchlike

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.860
structure called the saccule.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.580
And interspersed between these hairs, is a
sticky goop called glycoprotein that holds

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.579
tiny crystals in place.

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:23.270
These guys are made up of calcium carbonate,
and move whenever we move, which causes them

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.800
to bang up against the hairs in our ear.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.189
When the hairs sense the crystals moving,
they send signals through nerves in our ears

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:35.730
to our brain that give it information about
our vertical and horizontal movement - essentially,

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.040
these crystals tell our brains where the heck
we’re going and help us keep our balance.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.110
On top of these nerves, crystals, and hairs,
we also have fluid in our ears.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.000
Like the crystals, the fluid moves when we
move and that’s picked up by our hairs which

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.860
send information to our brain.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.430
Our brain uses the information coming from
both ears to figure out whether we’re stationary

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.990
or moving, and how we are oriented!

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.969
Vertigo occurs when something in this system
goes wrong.

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.520
The spinning sensation or dizziness is your
brain trying to figure out what the heck is

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.520
going on.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.100
It’s getting cues that don’t make sense.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.780
And a number of different conditions can cause
this.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.850
In the cases of vestibular neuritis and labyrinthitis,
parts of your ear become inflamed, usually

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.370
because of a viral or bacterial infection.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.180
When one of your two ears is inflamed - particularly
the ear’s nerves - it causes your brain

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.860
to get imbalanced information so you can end
up with vertigo.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.460
Meniere’s disease, although it’s not well
understood, it’s thought to be caused by

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.040
too much liquid in your ear, which causes
the same dizzying symptoms.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.700
And researchers think migraines can cause
vertigo because they cause changes in our

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.460
vascular and nervous systems, which affect
parts of our ears.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.010
Finally, one of the most common causes of
vertigo- benign paroxysmal positional vertigo

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.410
- has to do with the crystals.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.340
Sometimes these crystals fall out of place
- possibly due to a head injury or because

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.440
the goop that holds them in place in the inner
ear becomes too weak.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.540
When they fall off, these crystals can end
up in places where they don’t belong, like

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.650
the middle ear, and cause our brain to receive
signals that don’t make sense to it.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.120
They throw everything off!

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.770
Luckily, this one can often be fixed by simply
following a set of head movements that move

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.040
the crystals out of where they don’t belong.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.950
Invented by Dr. John Epley in the 1980’s,
this non-invasive procedure can be effective

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.900
in up to 90% of these vertigo cases..

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.760
Other causes of vertigo can be treated with
medication, although in more extreme cases

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.470
surgery may be necessary.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.090
As nasty as that sounds, some people do undergo
these procedures, because vertigo can be horrible.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.710
It can last anywhere from hours to months
at a time - and can be debilitating.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.560
On top of that, just moments of Vertigo can
cause a lot of harm.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.550
If we lose our balance and fall, this can
lead to broken bones or other injuries - which

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.990
is particularly concerning when it comes to
the elderly.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.380
Vertigo is more than just the spinnies.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.700
