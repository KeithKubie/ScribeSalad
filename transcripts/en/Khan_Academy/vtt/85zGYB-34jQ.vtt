00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.020
So far, we've used integrals
to figure out the

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.950
area under a curve.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.320
And let's just review a little
bit of the intuition, although

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.830
this should hopefully be second
nature to you at this point.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.720
If it's not, you might want
to review the definite

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.360
integration videos.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.280
But if I have some function--
this is the xy plane, that's

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.300
the x-axis, that's the y-axis--
and I have some function.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.430
Let's call that, you know,
this is y is equal to

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.660
some function of x.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.750
Give me an x and
I'll give you a y.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.740
If I wanted to figure out the
area under this curve, between,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:40.910
let's say, x is equal to
a and x is equal to b.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.980
So this is the area I
want to figure out.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.870
What I do is, I split it up
into a bunch of columns

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.890
or a bunch of rectangles.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.510
Where-- let me draw one of
those rectangles-- where you

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.610
could view-- and there's
different ways to do this,

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.330
but this is just a review.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.080
Where you could review-- that's
maybe 1 of the rectangles.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.720
Well, the area of the
rectangle is just base

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.530
times height, right?

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.360
Well, we're going to make these
rectangles really skinny and

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.100
just sum up an infinite
number of them.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.340
So we want to make them
infinitely small.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.060
But let's just call the
base of this rectangle dx.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.590
And then the height of this
rectangle is going to be

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.620
f of x, at that point.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.545
It's going to be f of-- if this
is x0, or whatever, you can

00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:25.690
just call it f of x, right?

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.170
That's the height
of that rectangle.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.470
And if we wanted to take
the sum of all of these

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.090
rectangles-- right?

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.210
There's just going to
be a bunch of them.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.160
One there, one there.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.910
Then we'll get the area, and if
we have infinite number of

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.860
these rectangles, and they're
infinitely skinny, we

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.840
have exactly the area
under that curve.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.160
That's the intuition behind
the definite integral.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.140
And the way we write that--
it's the definite integral.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.300
We're going to take the sums of
these rectangles, from x is

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.490
equal to a, to x is equal to b.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.120
And the sum, or the areas that
we're summing up, are going to

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.770
be-- the height is f of x,
and the width is d of x.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.580
It's going to be f
of x times d of x.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.970
This is equal to the
area under the curve.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.630
f of x, y is equal to f
of x, from x is equal to

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.040
a to x is equal to b.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.440
And that's just a
little bit of review.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.720
But hopefully, you'll now
see the parallel of how we

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.250
extend this to taking the
volume under a surface.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.670
So first of all,
what is a surface?

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.130
Well, if we're thinking
in three dimensions, a

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.540
surface is going to be
a function of x and y.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.060
So we can write a surface as,
instead of y is a function

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.930
of f and x-- I'm sorry.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.060
Instead of saying that y is a
function of x, we can write a

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.810
surface as z is equal to
a function of x and y.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.270
So you can kind of view
it as the domain.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.460
Right?

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.030
The domain is all of the set
of valid things that you

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.200
can input into a function.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.690
So now, before, our domain was
just-- at least, you know, for

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.070
most of what we dealt with--
was just the x-axis, or kind of

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.640
the real number line
in the x direction.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.580
Now our domain is the xy plane.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.040
We can give any x and any y--
and we'll just deal with the

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.740
reals right now, I don't
want to get too technical.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.480
And then it'll pop out another
number, and if we wanted to

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.950
graph it, it'll be our height.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.970
And so that could be the
height of a surface.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.960
So let me just show you what
a surface looks like, in

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.800
case you don't remember.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.360
And we'll actually figure out
the volume under this surface.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.080
So this is a surface.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.140
I'll tell you its function
in a second, but it's

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.370
pretty neat to look at.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.400
But as you can see,
it's a server.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.760
It's like a piece of
paper that's bent.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.870
Let's see, let me rotate it
to its traditional form.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.485
So this is the x direction,
this is the y direction.

00:03:37.485 --> 00:03:43.120
And the height is a function of
where we are in the xy plane.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.880
So how do we figure out
the volume under a

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.970
surface like this?

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.540
How do we figure
out the volume?

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.810
It seems like a bit of a
stretch, given what we've

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.500
learned from this.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.300
But what if-- and I'm just
going to draw an abstract

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.186
surface here-- let
me draw some axis.

00:04:02.186 --> 00:04:03.730
Let's see, that's my x-axis.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.072
That's my y-axis.

00:04:09.072 --> 00:04:11.650
That's my z-axis.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.970
I don't practice these videos
ahead of time, so I'm often

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.590
wondering what I'm
about to draw.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.960
OK.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.420
So that's x, that's
y, and that's z.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.990
And let's say I
have some surface.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.330
I'll just draw something.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.380
I don't know what it is.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.050
Some surface.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.090
This is our surface.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.300
z is a function of x and y.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.470
So, for example, you give me a
coordinate in the xy plane.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.360
Say, here, I'll put it into
the function and it'll

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.630
give us a z value now.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.290
And I'll plot it there
and it'll be a point

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.440
on the surface.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.250
So what we want to figure
out is the volume

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.990
under the surface.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.670
And we have to specify
bounds, right?

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.330
From here, we said x is equal
to a, to x is equal to b.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.030
So let's make a square
bound first, because this

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.610
keeps it a lot simpler.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.150
So let's say that the domain or
the region-- not the domain--

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.770
the region of-- the x and y
region of this part of the

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.000
surface under which we want
to calculate the volume.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.650
Let's say, the shadow-- if
the sun was right above

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.800
the surface, the shadow
would be right there.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.530
Let me try my best to
draw this neatly.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.110
So this is what we're
going to try to figure

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.240
out the volume of.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.210
And let's say-- so, if we
wanted to draw it in the xy

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.950
plane, like you can kind of
view the projection of the

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.980
surface of the xy plane,
or the shadow of the

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.240
surface of the xy plane.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.450
What are the bounds?

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.470
You can almost view-- what are
the bounds of the domain?

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.650
Well, let's say that this
point-- let's say that this

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.340
right here, that's 0,
0 in the xy plane.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.470
Let's say that this is y is
equal to-- I don't know,

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.780
that's y is equal to a.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.010
That's this line right here.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.370
Y is equal to a.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.940
And let's say that this line
right here is x is equal to b.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:05.910
Hope you get that, right?

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.230
This is the xy plane.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.080
If we have a constant x, it
would be a line like that.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.740
A constant y, a line like that.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.370
And then we have the
area in between it.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.080
So how do we figure out
the volume under this?

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:23.130
Well, if I just wanted to
figure out the area of--

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.310
let's just say, this sliver.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.560
Let's say we had a--
well, actually let

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:26.950
me go the other way.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:28.570
Let's say we had a constant y.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.060
So let's say I had some sliver.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.100
I don't want to confuse you.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.980
Let's say that I had
some constant y.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.020
I just want to give
you the intuition.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.810
You know, let's say.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:40.620
I don't know what that is.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.665
It's an arbitrary y.

00:06:42.665 --> 00:06:47.820
But for some constant y, what
if I could just figure out the

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.810
area under the curve there?

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.600
How would I figure out just
the area under that curve?

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.210
It'll be a function of
which y I pick, right?

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.050
Because if I pick a y here,
it'll be a different area.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.280
If I pick a y there, it'll
be a different area.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.790
But I could view this now
as a very similar problem

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.560
to this one up here.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.265
I could have my dx's-- let
me pick a vibrant color

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:13.530
so you can see it.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:14.930
Let's say that's dx, right?

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.760
That's a change in x.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:27.940
And then the height is going
to be a function of the x

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:33.440
I have and the y I picked.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.000
Although I'm assuming,
to some degree, that

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.660
that's a constant y.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:42.990
So what would be the area
of this sheet of paper?

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.100
It's kind of a constant y.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.390
It's part of-- it's a sheet
of paper within this volume,

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.990
you can kind of view it.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:53.750
Well, it would be-- we said
the height of each of these

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:59.030
rectangles is f of xy, right?

00:07:59.030 --> 00:07:59.515
That's the height.

00:07:59.515 --> 00:08:03.270
It depends which x and
y we pick down here.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:06.000
And then its width is
going to be d of x.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.830
Not d of x, dx.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.120
And then if we integrated it,
from x is equal to 0, which was

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.530
back here, all the way to x
is equal to b, what

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.006
would it look like?

00:08:16.006 --> 00:08:20.600
It would look like that.
x is going from 0 to b.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.120
Fair enough.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:26.220
And this would actually
give us a function of y.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:30.290
This would give us an
expression so that I would know

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:35.670
the area of this kind of sliver
of the volume, for any

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:36.690
given value of y.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.300
If you give me a y, I can tell
you the area of the sliver

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.680
that corresponds to that y.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.720
Now what could I do?

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.110
If I know the area of any given
sliver, what if I multiply the

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:51.680
area of that sliver times dy?

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.660
This is a dy.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.650
Let me do it in a
vibrant color.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:59.180
So dy, a very small
change in y.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.430
If I multiplied this area
times a small dy, then

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.970
all of a sudden I have
a sliver of volume.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.840
Hopefully that
makes some sense.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.970
I'm making that-- that little
cut that I took the area of--

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.800
by making it three dimensional.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.490
So what would be the
volume of that sliver?

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.820
The volume of that sliver will
be this function of y times dy,

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.280
or this whole thing times dy.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:31.910
So it would be the integral
from 0 to b of f of xy dx.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.670
That gives us the area
of this blue sheet.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:39.130
Now if I multiply this
whole thing times dy,

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:40.710
I get this volume.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.150
It gets some depth.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.150
This little area that I'm
shading right here gets

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.010
depth of that sheet.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:51.650
Now if I added all of those
sheets that now have depth, if

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:55.130
I took the infinite sum-- so if
I took the integral of this

00:09:55.130 --> 00:10:04.120
from my lower y bound-- from 0
to my upper y bound, a, then--

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:08.860
at least based on our intuition
here-- maybe I will have

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:12.110
figured out the volume
under this surface.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:13.690
But anyway, I didn't
want to confuse you.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.670
But that's the intuition of
what we're going to do.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:18.140
And I think you're going to
find out that actually

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.840
calculating the volumes are
pretty straightforward,

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.660
especially when you have
fixed x and y bounds.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.510
And that's what we're going
to do in the next video.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.012
See you soon.
