Speaker 1:          00:01          My first lecture on the known world focused on the question of knowledge and the problems of knowledge that the text raises for us, uh, through out both at the formal level and at the thematic level, so I ended up with a reading of the account of the Broussard trial and how more and more detailed knowledge comes to us through the voice of the narrator and were really left for that question. Where does that knowledge come from? Now I suggested in the first lecture that my second lecture was going to be about an equally abstract subject and that is how how can anything exist in the world. I'm going to get that to that about in the middle of the lecture. Beginning from this question though where we ended last time about the Broussard trial and the problem of knowledge where knowledge comes from. If we look a little bit earlier in the passage about the Broussard trial on one 7,172 you find what I think is quite a striking model for the very problem of this novel as a whole. And this is when Skiffington is trying to write an account of Broussard's crime, and here it is on the bottom of one 71

Speaker 1:          01:27          he's having trouble filling out this form. Skiffington picked up the list of questions. Now he would have to start all over again. Nature of the alleged crime. Are there witnesses to the alleged crime? Can such witnesses be believed? So the problem of evidence and the problem of whether witnesses are to be trusted, the problem of enumerating a crime, these are all problems that the novel as a whole takes up for the crime of slavery.

Speaker 2:          02:03          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:03          So we can think of the novel itself as a version of Skiffington [inaudible] report. Now it's important that Skiffington has such a problem writing it. The very difficulty of writing is the Matteis over and over and over again. Not just in moments like this where it's actually talking about writing, but I'm going to argue, uh, in a number of ways that are much more subtle and to show you one of them. I want to look on one side, one 92 with you. This is the scene where Stanford, the slave is trying to remember the names of his parents and this is how he does it. This is the middle of one 92.

Speaker 2:          02:59          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:01          He closed his eyes and took his parents in his hands and put them all about the plantation where he had last seen them, his mother in his left hand and his father in his right hand, but that did not feel right. And so he put his father in his left hand and his mother in his right hand and that felt better. He set them outside the smoke house, which had a hole in the roof in the back. Hands come down that hole and take you to the devil. And older boy had once told him Stanford was five and it had been on not been long since his parents had been sold away. And you get more of the story. And he finally, uh, to remember the parents' names, his parents' names. Why does he take them in these specific hands? His father in his right hand and his mother in his left that did not feel right.

Speaker 1:          03:58          So he put his father in his left and his mother in the right. I would argue that this is for two reasons, a figure of Jones, his own writing. Uh, first of all, in the obvious sense that it's an act of recovery of recovering a past that needs to be imagined or somehow entered into, not through rational thought, but through an imaginative act. So that's one reason that Stanford in this moment is a double of Jones. But the other reason is this handedness that's noted. Uh, I'm going to tell you throughout the lecture a few things about Jones, his life and his work outside of this novel. And so here's the first piece of that story. Um, Edward P. Jones was the son of a very poor single mother living in DC. He had a younger brother who was mentally disabled, who had to be given away to an institution because the mother could not support him. Uh, Jones, his mother was illiterate.

Speaker 2:          05:09          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:09          So here is someone writing this novel and his background is an illiterate mother. This matters enormously to him. He in his first story collection and has, uh, has a, a story called, I think it's called first day, where he tells the story of a young girl going off to school for the first time, holding the hand of her illiterate mother Jones reveres his mother when he talks about her. Uh, it's with incredible reverence and love. Jones sees his mother very much as a source of his writing. So here's that first tension in the of writing that here is a writer who takes as his source spiritual source, an illiterate woman.

Speaker 1:          06:08          That's why the mother has to go in his right hand in this scene. Now. Um, of course not everybody writes with their right hand, but I think no matter whether Jones his right or left handed, and I think Andy Hazel for pointing out our wonderful ta, Andy Hazel for pointing out that in the photograph of Jones he is wearing his watch on his left hand. And so this would suggest that he is perhaps right handed, but even if we didn't want to rely, Oh Neil, you're going to give me trouble. Um, even if you did not want to rely on that little piece of evidence, we can say that in the cultural vocabulary of handedness, the dominant hand is the right hand for writing. So I would say that whenever you see right handedness or left to right movement Jones is meditating on and figuring the act of writing.

Speaker 1:          07:16          And I'm going to show you some more examples because it's quite striking. It's subtle and strange but quite striking. So the, the mother has to go on the right hand because she is the source of inspiration. The Father Jones, his father was very distant. He only met him when he was much older and he was not really a part of Jones his life at all. Uh, it really revolved around his mother. So if writing is undermined by the shadow of illiteracy for Jones, it's undermined in other ways too. And I want to look at one of those stranger episodes. This is on one 40 to one 43.

Speaker 2:          07:59          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:00          Um, this was the story of how Henry began to court Caledonia at for Nelsons dinner table. And this is a very, um, detailed scene. This is in the middle of one 42. He's telling Caledonia that she needs to look up when she rides her horse. He took the pepper Shaker in his right hand, extended his arm before him and move the arm from right to left. Everyone at the table was now watching him. The hand with the Shaker moved smoothly, gracefully from the right to the left. That's how everyone else, everybody else rides. Henry said, me and everybody else, Henry put the pepper Shaker in his left hand, tipped it and Ooh, moved his arm less gracefully from the left to the right as it moved, pepper poured out of the shaker onto ferns, white tablecloth. He said, I'm sorry to say this, but that's how you ride.

Speaker 1:          09:03          Henry did this with the Shaker several times going from right to left, the pepper Shaker was upright, but going from left to right, the pepper flowed down for and thought there was something rather sad about the pepper falling and it was all the sadder because it really didn't have to be that way. She said to Anderson, the pamphlet here from Canada, it was, this was his clumsy way of telling Caledonia. She was losing something by not looking up. How odd that insistence on the movement left to right, right to left. It figures Henry's mixed up relation to both language and the act of creation. It's mixed up because when he's moving in the direction that text is read, read and written left to right, he's using his left hand and the, the uh, corroborative of that left handedness of his relation to language is in the dialect. He doesn't speak correctly in fern Alston's house, no matter how hard she tries to teach him.

Speaker 2:          10:14          Okay,

Speaker 1:          10:14          so he is clumsy not only in spilling pepper on the table, but also in not being able to speak proper English. But the other thing about that movement is that when it goes left to right, pepper spills on the table, this is an image of ink flowing out of a pen. It is black on the white tablecloth and it's an image for language in jeopardy because of course it's dust, it's powder, it will never cohere. It's the sign of his uncouth table manners. So it's never going to be a redemptive medium for him and it's represented by this pepper that then he can a scrape into a little pile. This is the fragmentation of language in it's very literal sense.

Speaker 2:          11:11          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:12          There are other examples of this. I'm in one 80 on one 89 when you get the first account of the frozen dog that Calvin is so interested in in the photograph from New York.

Speaker 2:          11:27          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:27          Once again, direction is, is carefully noted in the front yard alone was a dog looking off to the right. The dog was standing its tail sticking straight out as if ready to go at the first word from someone on the porch and I'm going to skip down. He had a very tiny hope that when he got to New York, he might be able to find the house and those people and that dog and learn what had transfixed him. There was a whole off to the right that the photograph had not captured off to the right is the direction of flowing narrative, a world, a possible world that his imagination is drawn to and it's a visual image of the imagination and it's seduction, but because of this obsessive direction noting I would read it as a textual imagination that there's a narrative off to the right and you can see that Jones is novel, works this way.

Speaker 1:          12:31          There's always a narrative proximate to wherever you are, a little narrative that arises from the next character who shows up on the road and you'll get that narrative. So this is just one of those that doesn't quite get articulated, but Calvin can imagine that it's there. He can see as if he can see the form of the novel that Jones is writing. And then there are just even tinier ones on one 62 um, this is John Skiffington sitting and reading the Bible. After visiting Clara's house, Skiffington looked up and followed a male cardinal as it flew from the left to right and settled in one of the peach trees. They're all over the place once you start noticing them. So I think this is why that it's a constant meditation among the multiplying versions of meditations on the composition of this novel within the novel. So we'll get to some others. The problem is that the written word is always threatened. So if writing has all this static that surrounds it, it also has some more direct and aggressive enemies. And on three 75, you see one version of that.

Speaker 1:          14:02          This is the account of Barnum Kinsey's grave marker that his son makes after they leave Manchester County and he dies. This is the bottom of three 74 Matthew stayed up all the night before he was buried. This is Kenzie son putting his father's history on a wooden tombstone. He began with his father's name on the first line and on the next he put the years of the father's coming and going. Then all the things he knew his father had been, and then lists this whole set of things. The boy filled up the whole piece of wood and at the end of the last line he put a period his father's grave would remain, but the wooden marker would not last out. The year text is fragile as a material object. So that's what this scene tells us in a poignant way. But of course the most poignant example of this is when Augustus is free. Papers are eaten by Travis. So the real terror of the written word comes in that scene. Now the terror is of course that it's an exercise of power, arbitrary, violent. It will end in Augustus's death back in slavery.

Speaker 1:          15:32          There are lots of ways of imagining what the terrorism, I'm going to go into some of them, but this is the sign of it that even though Augustus has memorized every word of his free papers, remember we're told that he has them read to him every day for a month. He's illiterate. He has them read to him every day for a month until he has them totally memorized, after he gets his freedom, even though those words will exist forever. In Augustus's mind, his freedom is nowhere once the written word has gone. So this is my question. How can something exists in the world here? The ultimate thing to which that question applies is freedom. How can freedom exist? What makes Freedom Exist?

Speaker 1:          16:28          Well, in the law, those free papers make freedom exist for Augustus, but the law cannot guarantee that freedom exists. When the physical artifact of the text is gone. That's how weak writing is. It seems to be everything. This is something that Mildred understood, uh, quite early on, on one 13, when she and Augustus are worried about Henry hanging out with Robin's, she says in suggesting that it's okay to let Henry go about with William Robbins, them free papers. He carried with him all over the place. Don't carry enough freedom. She said to her husband with slavery behind him, she wanted her son to go about and see what had always been denied him.

Speaker 2:          17:32          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          17:33          So she wants the world to be a big place for him. She sees that freedom is something much more than those papers. But the problem is that freedom cannot be without them and that once they're gone, it is gone too.

Speaker 1:          17:51          So that is one of the threats that is associated with writing, but there are more of them. Um, on three 11 and three, 12, one danger is that it's simply in the effort to write justice in law. It's simply ineffective. So here is the story we get of Skiffington trying to write up this crime, the crime of selling Augustus, a free man back into slavery. This is on three 12. Um, he's been in contact with, uh, a man named Sanderson in, uh, I think it sees in Georgia. You got a letter from Sanderson three days after that the crime had indeed been committed. He wrote and Sanderson included material he had copied from book saying so. So skiffington wasn't sure whether it was really a crime. Somehow he began to get confused and you can see that confusion. I won't read it, uh, on the prior page on three 11 in the middle of the page.

Speaker 1:          18:59          Um, so when Skiffington once again starts writing up the crime, he becomes confused. Did he really have a crime to describe? He gets confirmation that he does, but skiffington heard from Richmond. Yes. It's a letter from Richmond again, four days later in handwriting, he did not recognize a grace. Yella Sanderson let him know that her husband Harry was dead and that he was now she was now charged with keeping up his correspondence. He read the eight page letter twice, but he found nothing in it about what Virginia was doing, about the crime of selling free negroes. The widow told him about her husband, how she had met him when he vacationed in Italy, how he had wooed her, brought her to America after their wedding and made her a happy woman in Richmond quote where the governor is in residence quote and then she closes with comments about the weather.

Speaker 2:          19:53          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          19:53          so the law's effort to deliver justice through the writing of a crime. The documenting of a crime is displaced by a woman's effort to recover her last husband by telling that story. So there are competing claims on language in this scene, the widows and Skiffington ins and more distantly Augustus's and Mildred's. None of these claims are adjudicated in any kind of way that puts one above the other. And skiffington is weakness, of course, is that he will never seek to right. That balance, he resigns himself to the weakness of writing

Speaker 1:          20:45          more chillingly. I think more complicating Lee writing also carries the risk of reinstating the master slave relationship and I think it does this by direct reference back to Jones himself. If you read slowly through the scene of Augustus being sold back into slavery, it's quite striking. The way contingency or happenstance plays a part in the scene. So after Travis has eaten Augustus's papers, this is at the very bottom of two 12 a wagon twice as large as Augustus's came up to the four men driving. It was a large black man and beside him, a much smaller white man. And Travis teases Darcy, the slave trader about how he's never known the time in his life, but suddenly here he is at exactly the right time. Then he later says, as he's formulating the idea of selling Augustus to Darcy, he says, God works in mysterious ways. This ain't exactly what I had in mind when I stopped this nigger, but this year we'll do just the same. Who made that wagon appear? Why does that wagon appear? Jones made that wagon appear. What we're given is not a fiction about Travis intending to sell Augustus back into slavery, but what we're given instead is a surprise on the road. Who makes that surprise appear only one person, the person in charge of making the narrative.

Speaker 1:          22:52          So the problem with writing is not just that it's shadowed by the fact of illiteracy. It's not just that it's vulnerable to physical decay. It's not just that it's weak and it can't make anything exist in law. It's not just that it's demanded by multiple people for different purposes that come to cancel each other out. It's that by writing, by taking on that quality of masterfulness, you begin to be complicit in the very crime that you're describing. The imagery of God looking down on his creation is everywhere in this novel. And it's to all kinds of characters, uh, including, uh, including Henry who thinks that he will look down on his slaves the way God looks down on his creation from heaven. That position of mastery and that geographic remove of being above your subject is associated with the slave master, but it's associated very much with Jones. And I'll come back to this, uh, in a minute when I talk about the tapestry, because of course the tapestry at the end of the novel Alesis tapestry is the most dramatic figure for the whole novel. There are lots of figures for the novel, including the map of the known world, but foremost that tapestry at the end, which mimics the, the novel in, in every way. Even that has the perspective of little figures looking up. So it even puts Alice in that masterful position or indeed anyone who looks upon that tapestry.

Speaker 1:          24:58          So if writing is so weak, if it entails such terror, are we given any alternative for creative durability? And I think we are in the plastic arts now. Uh, I'm sure you've noticed how much carving goes on in the book, not just because Augustus is a woodworker, but you know, because, uh, Elias carbs for Celeste, that's his first act of love. And if you read John's a story, this is a rampant in his stories. He has carvers everywhere and various kinds of workers in, in plastic arts. Alice's, another example, working in textiles, clay paint some amalgamation of a sculpture and painting.

Speaker 2:          25:51          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          25:52          On to 79, the two arts, the verbal art and woodworking are put in competition with one another or injects to position with one another. And I think you see, uh, who has the upper hand here. This is an account of Skiffington bookcase, which Augustus made.

Speaker 2:          26:16          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          26:16          In winter, Fred and John Skiffington, his parlor, there was a wondrous looking bookcase case, lovely oak alions Groundling face at each edge of the top ends three shelves, the second hand item made by Augustus towns in La not long after Augustus bought his freedom. He had first thought he would keep it for himself and the family he would buy out of slavery, though none of them could read them. He and Mildred would never learn to read. There's that shadow of our attention is called to it. The minute the books are mentioned, he would keep it as a kind of symbol for his determination to get them. But then he realized that what he could get for the bookcase would bring his wife and child closer to him. So he put a price on it, $15. It had been originally sold to a man of two slaves who lost his sight.

Speaker 1:          27:03          Another risk to reading. You can go blind. And so as he told Skiffington lost his hunger and thirst for books. Skiffington bought it for $5. Augustus's art is durable. It can be passed from person to person and it maintains it's figurative power. It's important that all of his work is figurative. It suggests narrative. And so it's aligned with Jones art in that way, but it is not subject to the vulnerability of texts. And here in this bookcase you see the vulnerability of texts set right next to the wondrous durability of the bookcase. There are other examples, um, when Rita is discovered and the box of walking sticks, when she sent in a box out of slavery to New York, she hands the boy who is looking down at her, the walking stick with Adam and eve and all their generations. It's as if in that act, Rita's freedom is instantiated, that she and all her descendants emerge into this new world. And that that is a kind of gift to the family that takes them in, in the north. So it has a very evocative narrative power that doesn't depend on people's being able to read it. And we're told in that scene that the boy receives it as if this is what he had been waiting for. All along suggests a perfect receptivity. No going blind here. Perfect receptivity.

Speaker 2:          28:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:50          Uh, there is also on to 19 one of Augustus's chairs that I think is worth looking at.

Speaker 2:          29:04          Yeah. This

Speaker 1:          29:05          is when Travis is reflecting on or, or we're being told about how Travis first came to know Augustus. He had first come to know Augustus towns in many years ago through a chair Augustus had made for a white man in the town of Manchester. The man weighed more than 400 pounds and then I'm skipping down in the man's parlor was Augustus as chair. Plane, not even painted, but smooth to the touch. And when the man sat in it, the chair did not complain, not one squeak. It just held up and did its job waiting for the to put on another 300 pounds. Travis examined the chair, looked all about it, trying to discover it's secret. The chair gave nothing. It was a very good chair. Was a chair worth stealing? The chair gave nothing. Well, it gave nothing in terms of knowledge to Travis. It would not give up its secret of durability. And that's in a way what makes it durable, that it can hide the essence of itself. Keep it to itself. It takes the weight without one squeak. It's very silence is what marks. It's in vulnerability. It's also what enrages a man like Travis.

Speaker 1:          30:33          So the novel sets up a competing set of art forms, carving foremost among them against the art form of language. The tapestry at the end answers one of our questions from the first lecture, which is, who knows, the known world known by whom. What we come to find out is that Alice, although she seemed insane, is the one who knows Manchester County. She has walked all over it in the freedom carved out by her insanity. One thing that's interesting about, uh, Alice is that she, despite her insanity seeming insanity, is the one most in control of her language. She is the most successful storyteller in this novel. So if you think of other alternatives, Moses, he tells Caledonia stories that finally failed to persuade her imagination that any slave she owns could be free. We're told explicitly as Calvin tries to persuade her at the end of the novel that it's her failure of imagination that keeps her from emancipating her slaves after Henry's death.

Speaker 1:          32:03          Despite all of Moses stories, she still cannot see him or anyone else as a free person. So Moses is, storytelling is, it is a complete failure in this way, but how Ellis' storytelling about the mule that kicked her in the head, we find that out early in the novel. That's the story about her. That's why she said to be crazy was we're told so vivid, so sad that everybody believed it. The very control she has over her crazy are what persuades the whole world around her that she's not worth bothering with as she wanders around the roads with impunity.

Speaker 2:          32:54          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          32:54          It also gives her occasion to mock the master, the structure of slavery, the patrollers, and she can do it with impunity as well. So she has a freedom of mind as well as a freedom of movement that nobody else in the novel has who was a slave.

Speaker 1:          33:15          So she has doubly marked as an artist in language and in the plastic arts, but she's importantly, uh, I think not a writer. You'll note if you look at three 84, three 85, where the tapestry is described, there still some whiff of that fragility. Um, and I see that in the admonition that is hung next to the tapestry and that Priscilla repeats. When Calvin reaches out to touch it, she says, please do not touch. There's that sense that this is still something that needs to be protected. Now why the terror? Why the fragility? Well, I think this has a lot to do with how this novel was composed. Edward P. Jones wrote his first book of short stories in the 1990s, in the early nineties. I can't remember the date exactly. And it was very successful, but not successful enough to support him. So he worked as an editor at a journal called tax notes.

Speaker 1:          34:39          It was a journal of tax law. Scintillating Jones was working there. And I'm going to tell you a story now that he tells in some of his interviews, but I heard first from his agent, a guy named Eric Simon off, um, who I had up to visit one of my classes. Um, when we, uh, we're studying this novel, um, Eric says that he heard from Edward that Edward had this idea for a novel about a black slave owner, but he said, you know, don't tell anyone this is a stealable idea. So, you know, Eric, when he went down to DC would occasionally stop in over the years and see Edward and he'd say, how's the novel going? Hmm. Didn't seem to be much on paper and time passed 10, 10 years or so. And Eric Thought, you know, I'm not sure if this novel is ever going to get written.

Speaker 1:          35:45          In the meantime, John's had amassed about 125 books of history of the period, uh, that he's working in, in the novel because he felt that in order to write a novel like this, he really needed to master that history. It was very intimidating to him though. So that combined with his tax notes job, he had about 12 pages written. So he went on vacation after a long time. He hadn't had a vacation. He had about a six week vacation. He finally got a start and one of the ways that he got himself to start was he decided that he was going to forget about the history. He was going to make it all up. So all the historical sources, if you read the back of the book, you will know this. All the historical sources are fictional here. The census reports, every detail is fictional. So that was his first move. Then he got laid off from text notes right after this vacation. Edward P. Jones then wrote this novel in three months.

Speaker 2:          36:56          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          36:56          And Eric says that it became clear to him over the years that Jones had in fact memorized entire chapters of what became this novel. It was all in his head, all the words in their order. And so when he had the time and when he freed himself from the obligation to history out at came. I think this says a lot about the images of writing that you see all over the novel. Imagine the kind of terror that you would feel knowing that you had all this in your mind and knowing also that it didn't yet exist on paper, that you had only 12 pages. Maybe if you're writing papers now you feel this terror of the blank page. It's possible.

Speaker 2:          38:02          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:04          That's a real terror for a writer. Combine that with the shadow of illiteracy, the feeling of possible betrayal for a son to be a writer when his beloved mother had no access to the written word. This is a very vexed, complex psychological relationship that I would suggest my guests is that it has a lot to do with how he, the relative fragility and the relative power of fiction versus these other arts. So Jones models his narrative on those other arts in an effort to solve the problems that are presented by the terror of the written words. Fragility. It's very uneasy relation to existence. Does a novel exist? Does it not? And I think there's actually even a figure for Jones in a particular character, one of these tiny characters on uh, three 43.

Speaker 2:          39:27          Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:29          Uh, this is a young man with a wonderfully complicated mind.

Speaker 2:          39:36          MMM.

Speaker 1:          39:38          Wilson had learned a great deal at that university in his mind would have contained even more but well, and his second year of the cadavers began to talk to Wilson and what they said made far more sense than what his professors were saying. The professors being gods did not like to share their heaven with anyone dead or alive. And they sent the young man home in the middle of his second year. Here you see a figure for someone whose imagination is so powerful that it makes the dead talk. And think back again to the image of Stamford finding by placing the image of his parents all over the mansion, all over the plantation, finding their names. That's a little like, uh, talking to cadavers, they are dead. Those parents,

Speaker 1:          40:36          it verges on insanity. This is another problem with the mode of composition that a mind, this powerfully populated by an alternate reality comes to look insane. And I think this is another reason why Alice is what she is as a character. If she's going to be one of the major doubles for Jones, her insanity is part of that picture. We can think of it as a willed insanity, but it has the residue of doubt about it. Maybe she really is insane to some degree. Is there a sharp line between and imagination that can produce a narrative so thoroughly populated as this one and a narrative, uh, and a mind that, uh, sees cadavers talking to you.

Speaker 1:          41:37          Another thing that is remarkable about Jones, his work, and um, this relates back to what I was saying about postmodernism and grand narrative last time. Jones's work is seemingly very fragmented. There are lots and lots of narratives, but they don't all come together in one narrative. So it seems fragmented and when you start to read it, it looks disorienting. If you read his stories, you will see that all the stories are interconnected back to the novel to Jones his life. So for instance, in all antique ours children, his most recent story collection, I think it came out in 2007 there is a woman who has a walking stick that is clearly made by Augustus in the 20th century.

Speaker 2:          42:39          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          42:39          What I was saying about the durability of the plastic arts is imagined in that quality of his fiction, these objects of carving turnip throughout his stories. Also, people are related to each other in separate stories. They're related to people in this novel. The title of this novel appears in a story called tapestry in all and Hagar, his children, he is obsessive about putting the locations of all the places that he lived in DC into his stories perfectly accurately. When an editor at the New Yorker tried to get him to change one of these descriptions and the address in one of the stories that he submitted for the magazine, he was very resistant. He, he finally changed it for the New Yorker, but when it went into the story collection, it went back because he wanted to be absolutely accurate to what it was like when he lived there. What it actually looks like on that corner in DC, what I think Jones is doing in the largest version of his project is actually one of the most wide reaching and ambitious unifying efforts that I know of in contemporary fiction.

Speaker 1:          44:00          So this is not about the fragmentation of grand narrative. It's about the enormous large scale accumulation of wholeness. He is piecing a world together bit by bit by bit as he adds to his literary of, so this is a vision of unity that goes way beyond generic boundaries. Is it a short story? Is it a novel? This is something more like an opus that Jones is building and more importantly, it's something that lives in his mind very clearly. These people, these characters live in his mind. There is no one doing what Jones is doing today. If there's something truly postmodern, I would say Jones is it. He looks very different from what comes before him. And modernism and it's a ascendancy in the mid 20th century. He is making pretty dramatic claims for the power of fiction, for the power of narrative to put the world together.

Speaker 3:          45:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          45:26          But at the same time, as I've noted, acknowledges the very difficulty of that project, the very weakness that lies at its heart. And I think that's what for me, makes his work extremely powerful. That for all its ambition, we are never allowed to forget. It's ambivalence that ambivalence is always there on the surface and it's bodied fourth in the kinds of moral problems that this novel dwells upon. The question of how human love can exist in slavery, whether it can exist all it's complicated forms, what the forms of freedom look like, how freedom can possibly exist, how you build it, how it can be maintained. All these things are there in an incredibly ambitious literary form. That's what Jones is doing that nobody else is doing at this moment. So I will stop there and we will think about what forward is doing on my, I will think about what forward is doing on Monday.
