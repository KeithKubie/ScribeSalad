JONAH JONES: Hi everyone.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.480
Thanks for coming.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.300
Today, Yatin and I are going to
give you guys a little talk

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.160
about the process we went
through when we were

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.570
redesigning the new Google Maps,
as I'm sure you saw in

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.970
the keynote on Wednesday.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.960
Hope you guys are
enjoying this.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.440
So, my name's Jonah.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.200
I'm lead designer on the
new Google Maps.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.690
YATIN CHAWATHE: And I'm Yatin.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.620
I'm the engineering director.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.030
I led the team that built
the new Google Maps.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.470
JONAH JONES: So, as we were
going through this process of

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.220
doing this redesign from
the ground up--

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.090
as Bernie and I mentioned when
we were on the stage on

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.950
Wednesday--

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.810
there were three main concepts,
and we're going to

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.960
do a deep dive on two
of them today.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.770
Now, one of them was that we can
build a new map with every

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.250
click, and there are some quite
interesting, difficult

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.600
problems that we had to solve
in order to do that.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.860
And another one is that we
wanted to make sure that all

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.450
of the imagery we have in the
world is very easy to discover

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.890
and fun and immersive as well.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.940
So we're going to go
through those two.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.420
So, on the first one, let's talk
about how we build a map

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.920
for every place.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.340
Now, one of the most important
things in building this map

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.449
for every place is highlighting
and making sure

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.020
that we're labeling
the right roads.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.270
And this is actually
quite a challenging

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.570
thing to get right.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.130
So I'll tell you a little
story first.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.150
Which is that--

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.350
I like to travel a lot.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.490
And I think it's amazing that
we've got these digital maps

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.210
nowadays, and we can carry these
around in our pocket.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.930
And we can look at them on our
computers and everything.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.660
But there's something missing a
little bit from the old days

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.840
of having an analog map.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.240
So, this is an example of a map
that was drawn for me when

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.820
I first moved to Sydney
a few years ago.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.375
And you probably remember when
you were traveling when you

00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:39.655
were a little bit younger,
maybe you went

00:01:39.655 --> 00:01:41.220
and stayed in a hotel.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.840
And the hotel concierge
would draw you a map.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.320
And he'd annotate on top
of the existing map.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.350
So, maybe they'd highlight some
of the roads that you

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.720
need to use to get to places
that you're interested in.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.650
They'd highlight
places for you.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.480
And this map is great, because
it was a map that has been

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.640
drawn for you and is
unique to you.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.670
And it also is quite nice that
it serves as a form of

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.810
nostalgia afterwards.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.250
So after your trip is done, you
can take this out one year

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.750
later and look back on it.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.940
And we were wondering how we
can build a map that feels

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.190
customized to you, but
also fit for purpose.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.590
So, if we look at how Google
Maps looks today, you can see

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.690
that this is a fairly
reasonable,

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.100
plain map of this area.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.770
This is actually close to
my house in London.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.160
And if we wanted to draw a map
of how to get to this park in

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.330
the middle here-- the
Pullens Gardens--

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.890
you could imagine that most
traditional maps would

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.060
probably just stick a pin
inside the map and

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.390
be done with it.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.710
But that probably isn't the
best map that we could

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.160
possibly draw for this place.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.250
For a start, the two cross
streets that you see right

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.960
next to the Pullens Gardens--

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.030
they're not even labeled.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.210
And that's perfectly
reasonable.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.070
These are very small streets,
and in the general scheme of

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.220
things, these are not the most
important roads to label here.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.480
But in the context of the
Pullens Gardens, these are

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.590
super important.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.780
And you can also see that
generally, there's just a lot

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.590
of information.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.230
So even if we were labelling
those streets, no attention

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.750
would be drawn to those streets
as being particularly

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.280
important amongst all
of the other streets

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.325
that we've got nearby.

00:03:14.325 --> 00:03:17.540
Now if we were to take
a different approach.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.470
My wife actually just drew
this map on a napkin.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.420
And you can see here that this
is a vastly simplified

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.060
representation of how to get to
the Pullens Gardens in the

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.670
middle here.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.710
Now this might be a little bit
hard for you to read her

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.340
handwriting, so let
me simplify this a

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.540
little bit for you here.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.220
This is my diagrammatic
representation of the

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.890
information that we're
showing on the

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.880
Pullens Gardens map here.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.820
Now we've got several things
we've left out and several

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.660
things we've left in here.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.800
So, the first is the
major highways--

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.500
the major thoroughfares of the
city I left in, because these

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.400
roads are going to always
be important.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.780
Because they're context and part
of the overall structure

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.710
of the city.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.180
But the other thing we did was
we drew Penton Place, Amelia

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.220
Street, Crampton Street,
Illife Yard--

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.160
all of these more minor streets
that you need to take

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.000
to get to the Pullens Gardens
from the major streets--

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.480
we made sure that those
were highlighted

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.300
and labeled as well.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.380
And of course, we also drew--

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.220
there's only one point of
interest that's really

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.170
important for this one, which
is Kennington station.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.920
This is the local subway
station that

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.960
you'd need to get there.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.030
But you could imagine that if
there's other major landmarks

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.020
nearby, perhaps where you're
going to be turning off the

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.620
streets, they would
be an important

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.800
thing to show as well.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.960
So again, here's the map
that we had before.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.060
And now here's the map that we
draw in the new Google Maps.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.570
Now, this isn't quite such a
startlingly different change

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:49.600
as you might first think.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.360
Because you might think, Oh, why
didn't they just draw the

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.700
equivalent of this napkin map?

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.540
But actually, that's not exactly
what we want in a new,

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.610
modern, interactive map, because
maybe you missed your

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.700
turning, and you still need to
be able to know what the other

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.610
roads are nearby for context.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.500
Or maybe you're going to
drag the map away, or

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.680
zoom in, or zoom out.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.080
So we still need a map that's
going to be useful in the

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.920
general case, but we're going
to subtly highlight all of

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.480
these roads that are important
and make sure

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.200
they're labeled as well.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.860
So I'm going to hand you over to
Yatin to explain how we did

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.950
this process of selecting
the right roads.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.630
Because although it might be
quite easy for one person to

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.360
draw a local road for their
local area, you can imagine

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.630
that it's quite challenging to
do this for absolutely any

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.660
place in the world.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.490
So I'll hand you over.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.130
YATIN CHAWATHE: Thank
you, Jonah.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.940
So, how do we go
from this map--

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.730
which is a very simple base map
with a marker stuck on it

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:42.860
for Pullens Gardens.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.760
This is what you normally see
in the classic Google Maps.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.900
How do you go from here to the
map that Jonah just showed

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.680
moments ago?

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.890
Well, for starters, Google has
access to a significant amount

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.010
of anonymized information
about how our users--

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.880
our millions upon millions
of users--

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.540
use Google Maps every
single day.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.040
We can analyze all of this
information and use that to

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.760
extract signals that allow us
to figure out which roads to

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.910
highlight on this map, for
this particular location.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.560
And we can do that over and over
again, every time a user

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.501
looks at a map.

00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:27.190
So let's look a little
bit more.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.350
What information can we use in
order to figure out which

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.000
roads are important for
Pullens Gardens?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.410
What I've shown here is every
single Driving Directions that

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.710
any user in Google has ever made
to the general vicinity

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.130
of Pullens Gardens.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.140
So we look across all of our
driving directions that users

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:54.230
do millions of times every
single day, and figure out

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.170
which of those driving
directions are leading to the

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:00.490
general vicinity of Pullens
Gardens, and created a map

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.305
that looks somewhat like this.

00:07:02.305 --> 00:07:04.470
Now obviously, this
is a lot of data.

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.790
If I use this to highlight every
single road that this

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.500
map is showing in blue, that's
not really going to give me

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.800
any more compelling of a map
than what we had before.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.530
So what do we do next?

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:22.000
Well, we can look at each one
of these driving directions

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.130
and start aggregating them to
figure out which little bit of

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:27.510
road segment--

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:31.060
how popular it is, and how many
of our users are going to

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.090
use it to get to Pullens
Gardens.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.690
So you can, again, analyze all
of those Driving Directions

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.140
for every road segment that
leads from one intersection to

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.420
the next intersection.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.370
You can figure out how many of
those Driving Directions would

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.880
have used that particular
segment

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.900
to get Pullens Gardens.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.400
And once you do that, you can
rank all of the roads based on

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:58.070
the popularity that they have
for getting to the location

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.570
that you want to highlight.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:02.290
And that's what this version
of the map is showing.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:06.610
The deep blue roads are the ones
that were marked as more

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.730
important, more relevant for
getting to Pullens Gardens.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.290
The light blue ones are all of
the other roads that we had in

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.070
the previous slide.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.000
So you're now starting to
see a little bit of

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.150
structure to the map.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.930
I'm just going to take away all
of the light blue so we

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.505
can see this a little
bit more clearly.

00:08:22.505 --> 00:08:26.410
At this zoom level, this now
starts to look like a

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:30.340
relatively clean and useful
map for Pullens Gardens.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.010
It's starting to look very
similar to those napkin

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:36.559
sketches that Jonah was
showing earlier.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:39.240
Let's zoom in a little bit more
and see what that looks

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.995
like at a closer zoom level.

00:08:40.995 --> 00:08:45.420
So here's what that same data
looks like as you zoom in to

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.490
be able to see the general
neighborhood

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.740
around Pullens Gardens.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.240
And notice that those important
roads are still

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.530
highlighted.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.150
The roads that actually lead
directly to Pullens Gardens

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.090
are also highlighted.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:01.140
So Penton Place and Amelia
Street are marked

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.390
as important there.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:06.610
But we're still missing some
other important context around

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.300
the immediate vicinity
of Pullens Gardens.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.490
The cross streets that abut
either end of Pullens Gardens,

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.630
those are not pulled out yet.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:19.210
So what the next step that the
algorithm does is it does a

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:23.215
very localized search around
the immediate vicinity of

00:09:23.215 --> 00:09:26.870
Pullens Gardens and starts to
look for signals that might be

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:31.320
relevant to highlight on the
map for Pullens Gardens.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.430
And what that ends up pulling
out are these two smaller

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.430
roads that are not really that
relevant for our Driving

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:40.250
Directions or walking directions
from further away

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.220
coming down here, but they are
really relevant as contextual

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.330
information.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:45.890
When I talk about Pullens
Gardens, I'm

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:46.990
going to say, oh, yeah.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:49.320
It's on Amelia Street
between Illife Yard

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.710
and Crampton Street.

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:54.201
And that's what this ends up
allowing us to pull out.

00:09:54.201 --> 00:09:58.100
So you put all of this together
and you have the set

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.910
of roads that you might
want to highlight.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:03.970
So now you have the base signals
that you want to use

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:08.060
to create the map that
Jonah showed earlier.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.770
Again, as he mentioned, you
don't really want to just show

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:14.130
a map as desaturated as this.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.820
You end up losing a lot of other
contextual information

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.450
that may be useful to some
users, even though it's not

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:22.920
the most useful information
for this place.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.510
So how do you go about
doing that?

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:28.170
Let's start again with the base
map and just a marker.

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.500
That's all we have.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.060
And now let's start pulling in
the signals that we captured

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.620
in the previous slide.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.640
So the first step that the
algorithm does is it runs a

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.330
restyling filter on
this basemap.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.640
For every single road that we
picked out as an important

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:48.010
road that we marked as blue in
that previous slide, we will

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:51.720
increase the intensity of the
color and the strokes

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.760
used for that road.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.630
So I'm going to flip back and
forth between these a couple

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.830
of times so you can see
it more clearly.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:59.960
Here is what the basemap
looks like.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.790
Here's what the new
map looks like.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.020
Basemap.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.250
And new map.

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:06.790
And what you see is that the
roads that are important have

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.550
now become wider, and
the strokes have

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.470
become darker and stronger.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.710
So they get pulled out a little
bit, but not so much as

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:16.130
to be in your face.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:19.290
And the other thing you notice
is all the other roads get

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.240
dimmed out a little bit.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.440
Those other roads are
not as relevant.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.840
You don't want to take them off
the map, because somebody

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.870
else might care about them.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.210
You want to leave them on the
map, but reduce their

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:33.030
intensity so that you can
actually pull out the roads

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.670
that matter.

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:36.650
So again, just one last time,
I'm going to show the previous

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:40.020
thing, and the new one.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:40.970
So this is step one.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:42.430
You restyle everything.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:46.170
But notice that the streets that
we thought were really

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:49.650
relevant, like Crampton Street
and Amelia Street, are still

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:51.390
not labeled on the map.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:54.750
So that's the next step that the
algorithm does is it runs

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:59.480
a relabeling pass in real time,
as you've just clicked

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:03.380
on this location, and
that gives you this.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:07.200
So now, Amelia Street is
labeled, Crampton Street is

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.480
labeled, and we've made the
label for Pullens Gardens a

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.970
little bit bolder and stronger
because that is obviously the

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.660
most important label here.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.260
Again, I'll flip back and
forth once or twice.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.370
Here's what it looked like, and
here's what the new thing

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:21.160
looks like.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.480
The other thing that the map
does is it takes away some of

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.110
the labels on the less
relevant streets.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:30.250
So minor side streets that
might have been labeled

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.720
earlier because there was enough
space on the map to

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.970
label them, we'll take away
some of those labels.

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:38.100
Because those labels don't
matter nearly as much anymore.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.900
But the labels of the streets
that are nearby that we've

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.780
identified as important
streets-- they're really

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:46.160
important, so we'll label
them more strongly.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:52.440
So this, in a nutshell, is the
core set of algorithms that we

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:57.130
use to figure out how to create
a map that is truly

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.320
about Pullens Gardens.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.520
And we take advantage of the
immense amount of computing

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.850
power that we have at our
disposal in Google's data

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:10.270
centers to be able to run this
algorithm every single second,

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.490
for every single user,
for every single

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:13.740
task that they perform.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:17.420
The next thing we're going
to talk about--

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.820
I'm going to hand it back to
Jonah-- is to talk a little

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.930
bit more about how we explore
the world around us, around

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:26.490
Pullens Gardens or one of the
other places that you might

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:29.190
want to search on the map.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:30.900
JONAH JONES: All right,
thanks Yatin.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:36.580
So when I first joined Google,
I was living in London, and

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.590
then I went and joined
the Zurich office.

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:42.790
And so, I packed up my bags and
went and traveled there.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:44.030
And I was living in
Zurich, and that

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:45.460
was all very exciting.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.540
And every Christmas, I would
come back, and I

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.320
would visit my family.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:55.210
And my grandma, at the time, she
was getting quite old, and

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:58.120
she wasn't really able
to travel anymore.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.220
But she really wanted to
know what it was like

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.930
nearby where I lived.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:05.560
And she'd never been to
Switzerland either.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.510
So this is a picture
of Street View--

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.080
and this is my house
in Zurich--

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.990
and the amazing thing was from
our living room or our kitchen

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:17.410
in London, I was able to
go use Google Maps.

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.920
And we were able to fly to
street level and go and

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.960
explore the area around
where I lived.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.980
And we called this going
for a drive.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.120
And this was incredible,
because it gave her the

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.060
ability to travel to Switzerland
and actually see

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:34.350
this area where I lived.

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:39.850
Now, my grandma's no longer with
us, unfortunately, but if

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:43.200
I had the ability to fast
forward and show her what

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.460
we've done today, I think I'd
be really proud to show her

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:45.920
what we've done.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.590
Because not only do we have this
immersive Street View, we

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:51.660
also have this incredible Earth
inside the browser,

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.370
which lets you feel as if you're
flying all over the

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:55.960
city in a helicopter.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.910
And we also have these amazingly
immersive 3D tours.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:01.670
And this is actually a photo
that I took of the

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:04.940
main river in Zurich.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:09.920
And the 3D tools are a really,
really interesting part of

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.350
this, which have very difficult
engineering

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.230
challenges associated
with them.

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.860
And we wanted to make sure that
this wasn't a horrible,

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.220
overwhelming, enormous
slide show.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.470
And we want to make sure that it
was also more immersive and

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:24.420
more engaging than just flipping
through one photo

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:25.380
after the other.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.750
So we used a lot of techniques
from cinematography to make

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.190
sure that we picked the right
photos and transition nicely

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:32.680
between them.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.730
And, again, as with that napkin
map, this might be a

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:39.570
fairly easy task for a human
to do if they were to do it

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:40.510
one by one by one.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.860
But if you're going to generate,
using an algorithm,

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:46.305
a great 3D tool for thousands
and thousands of places for

00:15:46.305 --> 00:15:49.190
all over the world, this is
a pretty challenging task.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:51.550
So I'm going to hand it back
to Yatin to explain how we

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:53.490
went about doing this.

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:55.480
YATIN CHAWATHE: Thanks, Jonah.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.905
So, before I delve into the
technical details--

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:08.340
before I go into the technical
details of how we build these

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:12.410
3D tours, let's take a
look at a 3D tour in

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:13.680
the new Google Maps.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.470
What this is is a tour of the
Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris,

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:20.170
which is one of my favorite
cities in the world.

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.880
And it's showing you
many different

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.280
facades of the cathedral.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.210
It shows you a lot of detail
work on some of the most

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:33.090
interesting aspects of the
cathedral, and then zooms out

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.410
and rotates around to
give you a final

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:36.700
other view of the cathedral.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:47.370
So how did we go about building
this 3D tour and

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.620
other 3D tours like it?

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:54.790
Again, one of the big themes
around how we went about

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:57.070
building a lot of the
technologies behind the new

00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:01.070
Google Maps is the immense
amount of information that

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:02.980
Google has access to.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:08.180
So for 3D photo tours, the core
set of information that

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:12.140
we started to look at is the
thousands upon thousands of

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:17.300
photos that users like you and
I and Jonah have uploaded to

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.260
Google for public consumption
by everyone else.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.180
So this might include photos
that you might have uploaded

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:27.640
to Google+ that you've
explicitly marked as shareable

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.500
with the entire world, photos
that users might have uploaded

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.710
to the Panoramio photo sharing
site, and any other similar

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:38.960
site within the Google
ecosystem.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.120
So what this is showing you is
just a sliver of the tens of

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.320
thousands of photos
that we have of

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.220
the Notre Dame cathedral.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.750
There's a whole bunch of these
photos, and what we want to

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:54.020
now do is figure out, how do you
take all of these photos

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:58.530
and go from them, and create a
single photo tour out of them.

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:02.290
So the first step of the
entire process involves

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:06.340
running a long series of
complex computer vision

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:09.640
algorithms that analyze this
entire collection of photos

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:14.670
for the Notre Dame, and try to
figure out exactly where that

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.210
photo was taken in the real
world, and where in the real

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:22.060
world every single pixel in
every one of these photos

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.610
corresponds to.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:27.940
So for each pixel in every
photo, we know exactly which

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.900
other pixel in every other
photo that particular one

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.360
might correspond to.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:38.170
And what that allows us to build
is a fairly detailed

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:41.750
three-dimensional model of
the Notre Dame cathedral.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:45.260
And I'll show you what such
a model would look like.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:49.290
So what you're seeing here is
what we call a 3D point cloud.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:52.300
It's a whole bunch of dots
thrown into three-dimensional

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.570
space-- and then I've
just captured a

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.280
screen shot of that--

00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:01.110
and what each of these dots
represents is one point across

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:04.920
the entire set of photos
that we identified.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.760
Each of these points identifies
a point that was

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:12.220
matched in a set of pixels
across all of these photos.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:16.190
And you can see, although the 3D
point cloud isn't complete,

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:20.050
you can clearly see that this
is a representation of the

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.170
Notre Dame Cathedral.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:25.880
So what do we do once we have
this 3D point cloud?

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.200
The next step is, again,
as I said earlier--

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.520
we have on the order of tens of
thousands of photos of the

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.940
Notre Dame.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.240
If I were to show you all of
those, that would look like a

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:42.000
tour of your poor cousin's trip
that he took, and you

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.330
don't want to really sit through
those 10,000 photos.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:47.520
So what we really want to pull
out is a handful of photos

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:51.720
that really represent, that
bring out the essence of what

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.970
the Notre Dame looks like.

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:03.740
One thing we want to capture is,
what does the Notre Dame

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.370
look like in context?

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:08.730
What does it look like in the
surroundings where it's

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:09.820
physically located?

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:13.580
So that's one photo zoomed out
far enough where you can see

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.560
the entire cathedral.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:20.790
You see it's right on the main
river that runs through Paris.

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:24.770
You want another one that really
brings out what the

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:26.050
cathedral is about.

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:32.130
So this is a front facade
photo of the cathedral.

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:35.340
Each of these photos that we're
picking, we also rank

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.740
them based on how popular
they are.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.840
How many users have looked at
that photo, How many people

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.970
like that photo, and so on.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:45.930
Here's the third photo.

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:51.850
This really gives you a
sense of detail that

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:53.080
represents the cathedral.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:57.630
Again, this is the central arch
in the front facade of

00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:58.460
the cathedral.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:02.920
And what this is capturing is
one of the main aspects of the

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.410
cathedral that lots and
lots of users are

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:07.970
taking pictures of.

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:10.710
Another thing you might want
to capture is yet another

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:13.310
perspective on what the
cathedral looks like.

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:17.320
So you might want something that
captures a photo from the

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.450
right hand side and then yet
another one that shows you the

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:23.080
right hand side facade of the
cathedral, as we saw at the

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.050
end of the tour.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:28.770
So this gives you somewhat of a
sense of what the cathedral

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:31.300
would look like from
various angles.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:36.740
But that's not quite enough to
really give you an immersive

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:40.770
sense of what the cathedral
feels like if you

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:41.980
were to visit it.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:45.550
So another thing we look for is
really picturesque photos

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:46.450
of the cathedral.

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:48.360
And there's a number of signals
that we can take into

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:52.150
account when identifying photos
that are considered

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:53.060
picturesque.

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:56.140
What this shows you is a very
beautiful nighttime view of

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:56.850
the cathedral.

00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:00.170
The cathedral is beautifully lit
up and really gives you a

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:03.960
sense of a very different way
of looking at the cathedral.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.310
What might be examples of photos
that you don't want to

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:10.800
choose for your photo tour?

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.440
Here's a couple.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.810
Now, this photo on the left--

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:18.210
it's a really beautiful photo
of a bunch of flowers.

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:20.810
If you want to look at the
cathedral, it's not nearly as

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:22.900
representative of
the cathedral.

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:26.420
You can see bits and pieces of
the cathedral in the top left

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.810
corner, but they're
kind of blurry and

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:30.180
not really in focus--

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:32.720
it's not a very representative
photo.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.050
And then that other photo
on the right.

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:38.400
It's a wonderful family enjoying
a great vacation in

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.970
Paris, not something that's
representative

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:42.890
to this entire audience.

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:46.020
So those are a few things that
we look for when we try to

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.400
figure out which photos may
not be good photos as

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.730
canonical photos.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:52.890
So now we have all
of these photos.

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:56.830
What those green dots around the
3D point cloud are showing

00:22:56.830 --> 00:23:01.100
is the specific camera position
where that photo was

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:01.900
taken from.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.755
And this is, again, something we
can infer as we're building

00:23:04.755 --> 00:23:08.240
the 3D point cloud.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.020
So now we have a set of photos,
and we know where

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.220
those photos were taken from.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:15.100
What's the next step?

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:18.120
What Jonah mentioned earlier
when he was giving you a very

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.440
high level overview of these
photo tours is, we want to

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:27.340
take into account how
cinematographers have really

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:31.600
thought about how to navigate
through a scene, create a

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.790
camera motion model that really
reflects that and gives

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:38.610
you a very smooth, fluid motion

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:40.300
throughout the entire scene.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.390
So we take all the canonical
photos and arrange them such

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:47.200
that you can create a path from
camera position to camera

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.840
position that feels very
fluid and natural.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.450
And that's what this reflects.

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:55.470
We're going from the photo on
the bottom right all the way

00:23:55.470 --> 00:24:00.240
around in clockwise direction.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:04.520
Let's take all of those and
arrange them in sequence now.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.070
So that's what this
would look like.

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:09.060
So if you only took this
information and started to

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:14.490
create a 3D slide show out of
this, you would end up with a

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:16.610
lot of artifacts.

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:19.750
Going from the photo on the far
left to that next photo,

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:23.310
nighttime photo of the
cathedral, you're going to see

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:26.300
a lot of stretching if you try
to just warp one photo into

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.740
the next photo.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:31.290
So what you want to do now is
identify a few interstitial

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:33.910
frames that you can use to
really create a smooth

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:35.690
transition effect.

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:38.840
Now, what you know here is the
set of photos that you really

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.090
want to linger the camera on.

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:43.150
And then you just want to
identify a few additional

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:45.360
photos that you can breeze
through without

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.780
spending a lot of time.

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:51.430
And you know the general camera
path that your tour is

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:52.650
going to take.

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:55.610
So what you can now do is go
back to your dataset of tens

00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:58.580
of thousands of photos and start
looking for a few other

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:02.770
photos that match that
general camera path.

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:04.590
And that gives you something
like this.

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:08.140
Those red dots are the new
camera positions that we added

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:11.240
where we found a few
interstitial frames, and we

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.290
added those frames to this
entire sequence.

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:17.950
Now these interstitial frames,
they don't need to be terribly

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:19.040
high quality.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.870
You can use fairly
low-resolution photos and

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:24.840
still be OK because they're
merely being used as filler

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:28.276
material as you're going from
one photo that you're going to

00:25:28.276 --> 00:25:31.080
linger the camera on
to the next photo.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.790
So you have a lot of flexibility
in being able to

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:36.110
identify photos that really give
you a very nice, smooth

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:37.680
transition.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.850
You put all of this together,
and that ends up giving you a

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:44.210
3D tour of the Notre Dame.

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:47.580
We can do this not just for the
Notre Dame, but for any

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:51.090
other landmark around the world,
and we can do it not

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:52.370
just for landmarks.

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:59.330
So let's go back to the center
of Zurich where Jonah used to

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:03.250
live and see a photo tour
of the center of Zurich.

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:08.150
This is showing you a tour
around the Limmat River in the

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:09.240
center of Zurich.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:14.010
And it gives you sort of a nice
360 degree view of the

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:15.356
heart of Zurich.

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:25.070
So this was a very quick
overview, but I hope you were

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:29.470
able to get somewhat of a sense
of what the underlying

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:33.460
techniques are that go into
building these 3D photo tours.

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:37.750
So before I wrap up, I just want
to go back and summarize

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:40.430
the two main things
that we covered.

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:45.120
The first one was, how do you
build a map of a place every

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.270
single time, for every
single user?

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:52.550
We use a lot of information
that Google has access to

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:56.230
about how places are structured,
how people

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:59.930
navigate to get to those places,
to build these maps.

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:03.220
And the second is, once you
figure out how to get

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:06.320
somewhere, you want to really
get to know that place better.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:09.090
And so we have a number of
different techniques that we

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:13.140
use to really give you a rich,
immersive feeling for what

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.450
these places look like
in the real world.

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:19.080
Now both of these techniques
that I described, they are

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.650
very much in their
infancy today.

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:24.620
We think we've taken a very big
leap forward with the new

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:29.130
Google Maps from what online
mapping can do these days, but

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:31.640
we still have a long
way to go forward.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.130
And we hope that you've
enjoyed what we've

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.180
shown you so far.

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:40.220
We believe there are a lot of
still very hard, difficult

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:43.120
computer science problems to
solve that will keep making

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.580
these experiences better
and better over time.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:48.560
And we hope you will continue
on the journey with us as we

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.730
try to make a mapping experience
that is truly

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:55.590
unique, truly for you, and truly
about every single task

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:58.570
that you do every single day.

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:01.220
With that, I think we'd like
to open it up for any

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:02.450
questions you might have.

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:06.420
There is a pair of microphones
here that you can walk up to,

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.910
and we'll be able to take any
kind of questions and

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:11.210
not drop the mike.

00:28:14.186 --> 00:28:23.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:25.620
AUDIENCE: I wondered when do you
think we might see the new

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:30.890
personalized maps showing up on
mobile, on Android AND iOS?

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:34.350
JONAH JONES: So the thing that
we talked about during the

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:37.960
keynote on Wednesday was that
we kind of came up with this

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:42.350
vision of how the future of
Google Maps would be as we're

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:43.510
moving forward.

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:46.470
So the thing that we announced
on desktop on Wednesday was

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:49.570
the desktop incarnation of where
we're heading towards in

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:52.360
that future, and I think that
as time progresses, you're

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:56.260
going to generally see this kind
of experience be mirrored

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.450
across all different devices,
because we want everyone to

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:01.450
have a very seamless experience
across all devices.

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:04.380
So the desktop is a preview
of where we are now.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.770
YATIN CHAWATHE: So
what we have now

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:07.750
is the desktop version.

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:11.100
We will continue to work on
improving our look and feel of

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.545
Maps and unifying them across
all of our platforms.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.165
AUDIENCE: In terms of how the
new mapping system relates to

00:29:20.165 --> 00:29:22.830
the old mapping system, how much
extra does it cost you in

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:24.990
terms of compute power
to do this?

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:28.470
And is there any saving in
terms of data flow from

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:29.720
cutting down these maps?

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.170
YATIN CHAWATHE: I can't go into
a lot of specifics on

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:40.400
exactly what is different, but
we take advantage of a lot of

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:45.930
different levels of both
simplification and easier and

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:49.470
better serving systems to allow
us to build these maps.

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:54.170
So, obviously, creating a map
on the fly for every single

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:57.260
user, every single task that
they perform, is going to take

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:59.140
more computing power.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.150
But we try to be fairly
efficient about how we go

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:05.340
about doing it so it doesn't
become an overwhelming thing.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:08.830
Even for Google, we do want to
be conscious about not using a

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:12.440
lot of compute power, so we try
to be fairly efficient.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.190
JONAH JONES: There's a
distinction between, of

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:16.540
course, client side computing
power and the server side

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:19.080
computing power as well, so in
terms of the download that you

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.280
get to your local machine,
the amount of data

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.780
we send should be--

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:25.390
for the basic map case-- should
be similar or even less

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:27.710
because it's more efficient
with sending vector maps.

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:28.590
YATIN CHAWATHE: That is true.

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:31.520
Because we send vector data down
to the client, now the

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.180
total amount of data
that we send to the

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.550
client is much lower.

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:39.110
And we can take advantage of all
of the compute power that

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:41.820
each of you have to draw
the map for us.

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:46.080
So that becomes a shared
responsibility where we do all

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.420
the hard work in our
infrastructure and then send

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.847
very simple information down
to the client and allow the

00:30:50.847 --> 00:30:53.350
client to render stuff.

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:56.000
AUDIENCE: I think one of the
most interesting things was

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.200
the way you guys did the WebGL
rendering in the browser.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.860
And reading the media coverage
about this, it doesn't seem

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:04.290
like anybody noticed that.

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:05.230
I was wondering if you could
talk a little bit about the

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:06.770
challenges of doing that.

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:10.380
I'm specifically interested in
how you're able to share that

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.330
code across all the different
platforms you're supporting

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:14.910
including Android and iOS.

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:19.050
YATIN CHAWATHE: So the WebGL
stuff that we worked on is

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:20.700
primarily for desktop.

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:24.090
The vector maps that our mobile
platforms use, use a

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:25.650
native variant of it.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:30.550
We do try to share a lot of
themes across all of these

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:33.540
platforms, so we have the same
look and feel for the Maps no

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:35.550
matter which platform
you're browsing on.

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:40.410
So when it comes to a bunch of
the 3D rendering, we share a

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:44.300
number of the low level shader
code that each of these

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:49.440
platforms rely on, but then
WebGL, iOS, and Android have

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:53.340
their own variants of
implementation on top of that

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.318
that are native to the platforms
that we work on.

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:02.945
AUDIENCE: So what you showed
here is a very cool, but you

00:32:02.945 --> 00:32:05.200
said it is still in
an early stage.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:09.300
What I'm curious to know is,
what are the major areas you

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:14.260
see that needs to be enhanced?

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.420
YATIN CHAWATHE: Be enhanced?

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.090
Sure.

00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:21.460
There's a lot of improvement
we can make to our product

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.780
every single time.

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:27.270
We are very proud and very
happy about how far we've

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:30.280
come, but there is so much
more that can be done.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:34.780
A map that is truly about
you continues to evolve.

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:41.680
As I evolve, as you evolve, what
we expect out of online

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.380
maps evolves.

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.980
We're going to continue
to want to improve it.

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:49.400
So we see this sort of as just
one step forward in what

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.320
people will come to expect
out of online maps.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:56.420
As people get to used to this
new way of exploring the

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:59.800
world, there will be newer and
newer things that we'll want

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.040
to do with our maps.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.620
There's a number of interesting
ideas that

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:05.080
hopefully we'll be able to share
with the world as we

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:09.040
start building those and
creating an even richer

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.650
experience.

00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:12.690
JONAH JONES: Yeah, I think
it's a really interesting

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:15.230
challenge, because the two
things that we showed today

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:17.980
are kind of trying to
algorithmically generate

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:20.430
something that a talented human
would be able to do, and

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:21.640
that's really tough, right?

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.350
So I feel like the fact that
we've got as far as we have

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:28.000
with the 3D tool is amazing,
but that's still--

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.280
if it were a human doing it, it
would become a mediocre 3D

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:30.910
tour, right?

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:32.460
And wouldn't it be amazing
if the 3D tour could be

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.740
incredible like one of the top
directors has done it.

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.890
And very similar with
the hand drawn maps.

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:39.980
I think it's amazing how far
we've come, but there's still

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:41.390
a long way we can
go with that.

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:47.150
AUDIENCE: Do you have a fixed
database of landmarks for

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:49.810
which you generate the 3D tours,
or is it just possible

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:52.525
for anyone to ask for a
3D tour of any place,

00:33:52.525 --> 00:33:54.180
essentially, on the planet?

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:55.640
YATIN CHAWATHE: We--

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.510
it varies.

00:33:56.510 --> 00:34:00.790
So, we can create the 3D tour of
any place for which we have

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:02.470
a large number of photos.

00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:04.650
You do require a reasonable
number of photos.

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:07.250
If you only have five to 10
photos, you can't really

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:10.440
extract a rich enough 3D
structure out of that.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.409
But once you have enough photos
of a place, then it's

00:34:13.409 --> 00:34:15.764
pretty easy to create
a 3D tour of that.

00:34:15.764 --> 00:34:19.159
Now, obviously, we don't have
anything in our current

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:22.610
product that allows you to
just create a 3D tour of

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:24.699
something that you
generate, but--

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:27.409
so what we take into account
are signals like, what are

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:30.210
places that are going to be
interesting to our users, what

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:33.730
are the most relevant places
for, say, any given city

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:36.820
around the world, and try to
take those signals into

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:38.820
account when we figure
out where we want to

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:40.590
publish these 3D tours.

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:42.429
But the basic concept--

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:46.750
if you took 1,000 photos of your
house, you would be able

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:48.620
to create a 3D tour
of your house.

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:50.159
JONAH JONES: If everyone in
this room went outside and

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:52.860
took a photo of the Moscone
Center, we'd probably have a

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.219
Moscone Center tour
pretty soon.

00:34:54.219 --> 00:34:56.639
AUDIENCE: So do you choose these
places manually, or is

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:58.150
there some algorithm that
chooses those places?

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:00.260
YATIN CHAWATHE: No , we don't
choose them manually, it's

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:02.560
algorithmic, there's
many, many tours

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.710
around the whole world.

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:06.540
So, yeah, there's a whole bunch
of algorithms and a

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:07.880
number of signals
that go into it.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.050
Basically, at a very high
level, it's driven by

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:11.680
popularity.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.590
The most popular places we
want to create tours for.

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:18.980
AUDIENCE: Somewhat related to
the previous question, when

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.960
you're looking at all these
thousands of photos, is there

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.740
some level of manual filtering
that you do with the photos,

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:25.720
as well, or is it purely
algorithmic?

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.680
YATIN CHAWATHE: The first pass
is purely algorithmic.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:32.480
We do perform some manual
moderation to verify that the

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.180
algorithms work well.

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:37.990
That will go down over time as
we gain more confidence and as

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:41.090
we gain more signals to feed
into our algorithms.

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:45.000
JONAH JONES: I think there's
quite a lot of manual work

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.480
that goes even before this as
well, right, because the

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:50.370
photos that are selected are the
popular ones for Panoramio

00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:52.260
or from Picasa.

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:55.060
And something being popular is
obviously a very, very human

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:58.000
thing which is, people like it,
they share it, all of that

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:58.490
kind of thing.

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:00.670
So there is very much a human
element in the beginning

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:00.840
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.100
about the popularity, and
then the algorithm

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:03.850
takes over from there.

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:06.140
YATIN CHAWATHE: And that
manual work is taking

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:09.490
advantage of the immense
human computing power

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:10.740
of the entire world.

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:17.450
AUDIENCE: Just to touch back on
the idea that if I was to

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:21.410
take 1,000 photos of my house,
a 3D tour could be

00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:22.180
created around it.

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:26.700
Is that a service that you
might want to offer to

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:30.350
amateurs like me, that I could
plug a bunch of photos in and

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:31.400
it would do that for me?

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.710
YATIN CHAWATHE: It sounds like
a great idea, we'll have to

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:34.960
take it into account.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.050
Any more questions?

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:48.058
I don't think there's anything
else here, but--

00:36:54.046 --> 00:36:55.940
JONAH JONES: We're lucky that
didn't happen in the keynote.

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:57.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:58.450
YATIN CHAWATHE: All right, this

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:00.546
thing has the old password.

00:37:00.546 --> 00:37:02.480
JONAH JONES: All right.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.610
It looks like that's all the
questions then, so, thank you

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:05.620
everyone for coming.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:10.833
[APPLAUSE]
