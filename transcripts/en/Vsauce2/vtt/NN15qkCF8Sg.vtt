00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.560
Researchers from the California Institute
of Technology in Pasadena have discovered

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.690
a brand new species of parasitic bacteria
that may play a role in gum disease because

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.400
it lives in human saliva.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.570
And a recent poll suggests Americans expect
pizza delivery drones by the year 2036.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.500
Which isn’t nearly soon enough!

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.500
Vsauce!

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.500
Kevin here.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.689
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:32.369
Geologists are making their own lava to generate
and study explosions.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.080
Scientists from the University of Buffalo
are eager to understand how the interactions

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.210
of molten rock and water sometimes cause massive
explosions and sometimes times don’t.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.110
Their recipe for lava includes basalt, a magnetic
induction furnace that heats up to 2,500 degrees

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.860
fahrenheit and after 3 to 4 hours, results
in 10-gallons of lava.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.960
They pour it into a gravel formation and inject
water before it forms a crust to help learn

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.650
about the dangers of volcanoes near oceans,
lakes and ice.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.560
How do you get this job?

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.640
The path to sustainable roads may be paved
with pig manure.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.830
With 43 billion gallons of swine manure generated
every year, researchers at North Carolina

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.210
Agricultural and Technical State University
have created a pig manure sticky binder that

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.850
can make asphalt.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.700
At only 56 cents per gallon its much cheaper
than petroleum and the manure stink is filtered

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.810
out during processing.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.840
And the hope is for this bioadhesive to prevent
manure from getting into water supplies and

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.060
making people sick and instead put it to use
on the pig poop highway.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.610
Using the last bit of shampoo may no longer
be a struggle.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.790
While coatings to help the flow of food have
existed for a while, soap has been more difficult

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.729
due to its surface tension.

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.619
So a new plastic bottle lining developed at
Ohio State University features a microscopic

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.560
coating of y-shaped structures.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.310
These structures then hold the soap droplets
above tiny pockets of air, preventing it from

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.510
touching the bottle and allowing it to glide
smoothly into your luxurious hair or onto

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.880
your luxurious body.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.870
Being called a bird brain may now be a compliment.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.930
Thought to have lower information-processing
capacity because of their size, Avian brains

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.750
were found to have significantly denser concentrations
of neurons than mammals.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.950
Large parrots can have the same or even more
forebrain neurons than monkeys with larger

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:28.950
brains.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.340
Allowing them to make and use tools, solve
problems, recognize themselves in mirrors,

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.900
and plan for their future needs.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.000
You can follow the biggest fish in the world
online.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.560
Conservation International scientists in Indonesia
are using satellite transmitters attached

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.030
to the dorsal fins of whale sharks to study
their migratory movements and diving behavior.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.360
The real-time map allows anyone to see where
Moby, Mitch or any of the currently unnamed

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.720
sharks are located.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.480
Moby’s diving record is more than a mile
beneath the surface.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.190
And they’ve learned that while the whale
sharks are mostly homebodies, they have taken

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:12.470
mysterious road trips, one of which was 2,485
miles and they know that it wasn’t for mating…so

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.489
yeah…they don’t why.

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.610
The GEAR controller allows gamers to play
using their feet.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.280
Gyorgy Levay, a devoted gamer, lost both of
his hands in 2011 due to a menengitis infection.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.540
He and two other grad students from John Hopkins
designed a game interface capable of being

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.099
operated by the player's lower limbs.

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:37.379
Three sensors under the padding of the sandle-like
controller detect foot movements like tilting

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.710
or raising the heel which are then translated
to different commands in the game.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.040
And so far they’ve successfully played Counter-Strike,
Fallout 4, and World of Warcraft.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.239
Finally, 3.9 billon years ago a monster black
hole shredded a star and echoes of X-rays,

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:59.379
which first reach Earth on March 28, 2011,
have been used to map the black hole’s disk.

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:03.659
Researchers realized they were witnessing
the aftermath of tidal disruption event.

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:09.180
A star ripped apart by the monster black hole
at the galaxy's center.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.481
Some of the stellar material fell toward the
black hole forming an accretion disk and a

00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:15.170
jet pointed in our direction.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:21.019
I’m gonna leave you with a programmable
and customizable walking robot named Marty

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:31.780
- and as always, thanks for watching.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:42.340
You see the heterodynes are feeding back into
the stimulus reaction activators, causing

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.610
snaps of the motor control units.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.449
Oh, that's good!

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:47.669
No, lady.

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:48.900
That's bad.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.620
But your regenerative circuits are torn dyssynchronously
and that causes concatenation in the intermediate

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.620
amplifiers.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.090
Oh, that's bad.

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.690
No, that's good!

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.430
Everyday in our homes and in our offices,
as well as in our motor cars, hundreds of

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.389
these little robots are doing more things
than we realize.

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:14.720
Taking care of the routine tasks and leaving
us free to live, work and play in greater

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:34.400
ease and comfort and safety.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.520
I'm extremely excited to announce the launch
of The Curiosity Box!

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.000
Something Michael, Jake and I have been working
on for a really long time.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.950
You may remember the past couple of years
we had Holiday Boxes that were filled with

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.010
exclusive Vsauce gears and other curious items.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:54.250
Well, The Curiosity Box comes out quarterly
so when you subscribe, you get a brand new

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.460
one delivered to your door every three months.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:03.060
Michael, Jake and I are literally working
on every single thing that goes into these

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.060
boxes.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.120
This is Inq.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.259
Inq is an octopus.

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:07.930
Inq is short for Inquisitive.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.820
We love Inq.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.169

A portion of the proceeds go to Alzheimer's
research.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.380
So if you love amazing things.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.380
You love brains.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.030
