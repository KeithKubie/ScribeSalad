00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The effective mass of the rear is obviously way smaller than the mass of the quarter of that car.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Due to its low mass, it is much easier to accelerate than decelerate the wheel

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
than to accelerate or decelerate the car which has a larger mass.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So when we want to study equilibria of the wheel slip that its values which stays constant,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
we can start by thinking about the velocity of the car is a slow variable

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and the velocity of the rim of the wheel is a fast variable.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We have cheated a little and say, okay, let's assume that the velocity of the car is almost constant

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but assuming that the velocity of the car is almost constant, this idea about the fast changing W

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and the slowly changing V helps us to think about the equilibria of the wheel slip.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
If that wheel slip reaches an equilibrium, its temporal, its rate of change becomes zero.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It does not change anymore. This is the meaning of equilibrium.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
If s doesn't change and V is almost constant,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
we learned that W must not change, but we have an equation for the rate of change of W.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It's the friction force divided by the effective mass of W minus the braking deceleration of the wheel.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
These two expressions have to be equal.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We find approximately this equation for the equilibria of the wheel slip.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
When the wheel slip does not change with time, the friction force

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
divided by the effective mass of the wheel has to be almost equal

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
to the deceleration of the wheel by the brake.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Given this equation, the task is now to determine the number of equilibria,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
the number of stable equilibria, and the number of unstable equilibra.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
For that, assume that the car is braking slightly below the optimum value

00:01:49.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and ignore the case that s, the wheels that equals one, which means perfect locking.
