00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:08.761
A farmer grows 531 tomatoes
and is able to sell 176 of them

00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:15.460
in three days, so is able to
sell 176 of them in three days.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.670
Given that his supply of
tomatoes decreases by 176,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.520
how many tomatoes
does he have remaining

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.260
at the end of three days?

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.570
So he starts with 531 tomatoes.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.230
Let me give myself a little
bit more space to work with.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.280
He starts with 531 tomatoes,
and he's able to sell 176.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.910
So he's essentially going to
subtract the 176 that he's

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.470
selling if we want to figure
out how many he's left with.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.996
So we're going to subtract 176.

00:00:48.996 --> 00:00:50.620
That's how many he
sells in three days.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.120
And they're asking
us, how much does

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.810
he have left at the
end of three days?

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.860
We just have to subtract
those 176 from the amount

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.730
that he grew.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.310
So it turns into this
straight-up subtraction

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.030
problem, so let's
see if we can do it.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.390
So if we go straight
to the ones place

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.989
right over here--
and actually, let

00:01:06.989 --> 00:01:08.530
me do it in parallel,
because I think

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.140
that might be
interesting over here.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.920
I'm going to do it the way
you traditionally do it

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.470
here on the left,
and then I'm going

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.040
to show you what's happening
over here on the right.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.640
So 531 is the same thing
as 500 plus 30 plus 1.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.550
And if you subtract 176,
that's the same thing

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.840
as subtracting 100,
subtracting another 70,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.350
and subtracting another 6.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.250
And I wrote it this way,
because the 5 in 531

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.880
is the same thing as 500.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.660
The 3 in 531 is
in the tens place,

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.530
so it's really representing 30.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.890
The 1 in 531 is in the ones
place, so it represents 1.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.770
And now it'll be a
little bit clearer

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.370
what we're doing when we're
borrowing or regrouping

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.490
on this problem right over here.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.453
And so let's start off
with the ones place.

00:01:53.453 --> 00:01:56.500
1 is less than 6.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.430
It'd be great if we can
regroup some of the value

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.120
from the rest of the places
so we could go straight

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.160
to the tens place.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.220
The tens place, we can
borrow or regroup 10 from it.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.280
So if we take 10 from
here, this becomes 20.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.300
We're going to take that
10 and add it to the 1,

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.720
so this will become 11.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.870
We just added 10.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.660
We moved over 10 from the
tens place to the ones place.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.820
If you look at it over
here, you could say, look,

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.240
we're taking 10 from the 30.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.357
That becomes a 20, and
then the 1 becomes an 11.

00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:31.690
The way when I was first in
school, people would say you

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.760
would borrow 1 from the 3.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.040
And you'd kind of just stick
that 1 right over here.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.970
But what you're really doing
is you're taking a 10 from a 30

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.725
and making it into a 20, and
you're adding that 10 to the 1

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:43.880
and getting 11.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.120
But either way, you'll end
up with 11 in the ones place.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.390
And now you can subtract.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.556
11 minus 6 is 5.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.340
Now we go over to
the tens place.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.250
In the tens place we
now have 2 minus 7,

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.670
which is really
representing 20 minus 7.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.980
Well, that 70 is
bigger than 20, so we

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.826
want to add some more
to the tens place.

00:03:08.826 --> 00:03:10.450
Well, we could go to
the hundreds place

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.380
to find some more
value to regroup.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.920
So let's see if we can do that.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.900
We have 500 here.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.250
What happens if we
take 100 from that?

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.560
So we're just left
with 400 here.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.370
And we take that 100, and
we put it in the tens place.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.250
So instead of 20,
we now have 120.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.260
If you look at it
on this problem,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.690
since we're using
the places here,

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.160
we're going to take 100
from the 500 and have 400.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.340
And then we're going
to take that 100

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.090
that we took and put
it to the tens place.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.540
Well, 100 is 10 tens.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.530
So we're going to
add 10 to this,

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.450
so this is going to become a 12.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.670
Once again, the more
mechanical or rote way

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.100
of thinking about it is that,
oh, you took 1 away from the 4.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.090
And you stick that 1
onto the front of the 2.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.080
But you're really taking 100
from the 500 to make it 400

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.890
and then adding that 100 to
the 20 here and making it 120.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.070
But you write it here as
a 12 because it's 12 tens.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.175
You're in the tens place.

00:04:10.175 --> 00:04:11.050
Let me write it down.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.670
This is the ones place.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.954
This is the tens place, and
this is the hundreds place.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.245
So now that our number
on top in the tens place

00:04:24.245 --> 00:04:26.620
is bigger than our number on
the bottom, we can subtract.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.640
So we get 120 minus 70.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.320
That is 50, or 12 minus 7 is 5.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.130
But that 5 is in the tens place,
so it's really representing 50.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.860
Let me circle it
with the same color

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.860
so you recognize that
this 5 is representing 50.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.350
Then finally, we're
in the hundreds place.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.654
400 minus 100 is 300.

00:04:50.654 --> 00:04:53.860
4 minus 1 is 3, but
this 3 represents 300.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.420
This 5 represents 50.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.250
This 5 represents 5,
and so we're done.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.810
We get 355.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.200
The farmer is left
with 355 tomatoes

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.070
at the end of three days, or
300 plus 50 plus 5 tomatoes.
