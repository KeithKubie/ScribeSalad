<i>[rock music]</i>

00:00:03.378 --> 00:00:05.046
- This is my forge.

00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:07.257
My own tools.
I know what I have.

00:00:07.257 --> 00:00:10.844
I may not quite know where
it's at, but I know it's here.

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:14.931
We have a little mini mill
for sanding.

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:17.726
I hate changing drill bits,
so I have several drills.

00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:21.062
And we have this anvil here
in the--in the front.

00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:24.524
This anvil belonged
to my grandfather.

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:27.694
We have a 50-pound
mechanical power hammer.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:31.030
My first hammer that I--
that I ever owned.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.367
And then we have a band saw
for cutting the bar stock.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:38.288
And one of the things that's
kind of important in this shop

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:40.957
is I have my little
pallet jack.

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:44.169
<i>I can move most of
my heavier machines around</i>

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:49.174
<i>to whatever configuration is
most comfortable at the time.</i>

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:51.801
- Welcome to Clinton,
Mississippi.

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:53.553
Let me show you my shop.

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:56.181
This was the first 2x72 grinder
I built

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:57.599
from an old office desk.

00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:00.185
This is a little nicer 2x72.

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:01.895
It's got variable speed control

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.938
and several different
tooling arms.

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:06.191
This is a fly press.

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:09.068
This allows me to do
a lot of controlled forging.

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:11.279
And this is a really, really
old tool--

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:15.074
probably a good--
close to 200 years old.

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:19.454
My number one pride
and joy in the shop right now

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:22.373
obviously is the self-contained
air hammer.

00:01:22.373 --> 00:01:25.585
This takes my forging
from the anvil

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:29.839
and turns it into
a much easier task.

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:31.591

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:34.427
- 30 years ago,
I quit my real job,

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:36.721
started blacksmithing
full time.

00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:41.893
I've been making fire screens,
fire tools, railings.

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:45.063
Here was have a railing
I was commissioned to do.

00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:49.442
And making all the vines,
they're all forge welded.

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:52.278
Each one of these is
an individual piece,

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:55.532
welded to each other,

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:58.451
and then a short piece
welded,

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:01.120
and another vine
welded on there.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.624
And when it got all done,
it looks awesome.

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:07.085
- I made both of these forges.

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:09.128
This is just a small
one-burner forge,

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:12.507
and I'll do the majority
of my forging in this guy,

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:13.633
and then when I need to heat
something

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.093
that's a little bit longer,

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:17.470
I'll use this--this big forge
right here.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.390
This is a inline treadle
hammer.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.604
This allows me to do things
where I would need a striker

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:28.398
or might need some help.

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:31.609
I can actually put work
in here

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.736
and do things with two hands,

00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:36.364
rather than having to
juggle with one.

00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:41.202
A welder and then
an old washing machine motor

00:02:41.202 --> 00:02:43.121
that's been turned into
a grinding station.

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:45.874
I've had the buffer
throw my knife before

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:47.750
but it never got me.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.002
So that's my shop.
