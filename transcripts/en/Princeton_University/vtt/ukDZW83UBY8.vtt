[SINGING]

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:16.094 position:56%
DAN LINKE : Can you tell me what was
there to love about Princeton?

00:00:16.094 --> 00:00:18.007
ROBERT F. GOHEEN: Oh.

00:00:18.007 --> 00:00:20.021
How can you ask?

00:00:20.021 --> 00:00:23.040
It's been part of my
life since I was a kid.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.081
It was a tremendous
feeling to have

00:00:26.081 --> 00:00:33.032
responsibility for a place
as an important as Princeton.

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:35.071
ROBERT K. DURKEE: For
much of the 20th century,

00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:38.036
Bob Goheen's life
was at Princeton.

00:00:38.036 --> 00:00:41.075
And for a good portion of that
time, the life of Princeton

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:44.009
depended on Bob Goheen.

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:46.017
During his presidency,
the world's issues

00:00:46.017 --> 00:00:48.038
became Princeton's issues.

00:00:48.038 --> 00:00:50.072
In his guidance
was an inner voice,

00:00:50.072 --> 00:00:53.097
which bore testimony to
Adlai Stevenson's observation

00:00:53.097 --> 00:00:56.082
that in quiet places,
reason abounds.

00:00:59.068 --> 00:01:02.043
Born in India to
medical missionaries,

00:01:02.043 --> 00:01:06.063
he received his undergraduate
degree in classics in 1940,

00:01:06.063 --> 00:01:09.062
and after a stint in the
Army, returned to earn

00:01:09.062 --> 00:01:13.036
his Ph.D. in classics in 1948.

00:01:13.036 --> 00:01:16.083
A mere nine years later,
in succeeding Harold Dodds,

00:01:16.083 --> 00:01:20.051
he became at 37 the
third-youngest president

00:01:20.051 --> 00:01:21.064
in Princeton's history.

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:32.020
REPORTER: WPRB presents
a special program devoted

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.006
to the selection of assistant
professor of classics

00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:37.056
Robert F. Goheen as president
of Princeton University.

00:01:37.056 --> 00:01:39.068
ROBERT F. GOHEEN: After
the presidential search had

00:01:39.068 --> 00:01:42.093
been going on a while, a
number of my faculty friends

00:01:42.093 --> 00:01:45.025
say, we hear you're on the list.

00:01:45.025 --> 00:01:47.046
And I said, well,
that's nonsense.

00:01:47.046 --> 00:01:52.011
Why would they look at
a youngster like me?

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:53.057
ROBERT K. DURKEE:
Under the pretext

00:01:53.057 --> 00:01:56.020
of wanting the views
of younger faculty,

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.016
the trustees asked Bob to meet.

00:01:58.016 --> 00:01:59.095
ROBERT F. GOHEEN: I
was completely relaxed.

00:01:59.095 --> 00:02:02.040
I didn't think it
related to me at all.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.089
I told them quite candidly
what I thought about Princeton

00:02:05.089 --> 00:02:08.054
and what some of
its problems were

00:02:08.054 --> 00:02:12.051
and what its tremendous
potential was

00:02:12.051 --> 00:02:14.057
and about individuals
who I thought

00:02:14.057 --> 00:02:20.082
would be or not be good
presidents, so I had a ball.

00:02:20.082 --> 00:02:22.040
ROBERT K. DURKEE:
Some time later, Bob

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.063
was spending the
weekend in Connecticut

00:02:24.063 --> 00:02:27.038
when he received an
unusual phone call.

00:02:27.038 --> 00:02:30.021
ROBERT F. GOHEEN: Mr. Helm
said, some of us trustees

00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:33.000
would like to meet with you
Sunday morning in New York.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.067
Can you make it?

00:02:33.067 --> 00:02:36.059
And I said, Mr. Helm,
it's a great honor,

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:42.071
but right now I'm with
my roommate and his wife

00:02:42.071 --> 00:02:45.071
and we don't get away
very often and can't it

00:02:45.071 --> 00:02:46.072
be some other time?

00:02:49.063 --> 00:02:50.093
And he said, no.

00:02:50.093 --> 00:02:52.050
He said, I think it's important.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.093
You better come.

00:02:53.093 --> 00:02:55.047
REPORTER: Professor
Goheen's election

00:02:55.047 --> 00:02:57.091
was announced by Harold
H. Helm, chairman

00:02:57.091 --> 00:02:59.079
of the executive committee
of the University

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.014
Board of Trustees.

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:04.036
ROBERT F. GOHEEN: There were
five trustees, the senior-most

00:03:04.036 --> 00:03:05.067
of the trustees.

00:03:05.067 --> 00:03:09.045
We chatted a little while and
he gave me a glass of sherry.

00:03:09.045 --> 00:03:12.072
And they said they wanted me to
be president of the university.

00:03:12.072 --> 00:03:17.033
I almost went through
the floor, but I

00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:21.061
said, yes, I would try it.

00:03:21.061 --> 00:03:23.082
EDWARD R. MURROW: He was
described by its predecessor

00:03:23.082 --> 00:03:27.091
as an intellectual who can
hit 225-yard drives down

00:03:27.091 --> 00:03:28.075
the fairway.

00:03:28.075 --> 00:03:30.012
ROBERT F. GOHEEN:
If one believes

00:03:30.012 --> 00:03:35.076
as intensely in the importance
of a liberal education

00:03:35.076 --> 00:03:40.046
for our times as I do, then
Princeton is a wonderful place

00:03:40.046 --> 00:03:41.035
to work for.

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:46.079
One of the most
senior and I must

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.030
say powerful Princeton
trustees said to me,

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.066
the University's in
great financial shape

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:57.015
and you won't have to spend
a lot of time raising money.

00:03:57.015 --> 00:04:00.043
You can concentrate
on education.

00:04:00.043 --> 00:04:03.037
Well, even as an
assistant professor,

00:04:03.037 --> 00:04:07.009
I knew that wasn't the
way things were here.

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:10.098
Anything that you try to do
well is going to cost money.

00:04:10.098 --> 00:04:13.093
I'm sure a good television
show, Mr. Murrow,

00:04:13.093 --> 00:04:15.080
is an expensive operation.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.090
Harvard took the lead and
boldly launched a $92 million

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.060
capital campaign, the
first thing of its kind

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.018
certainly in our times.

00:04:27.018 --> 00:04:30.088
And that emboldened us to
start to work right away

00:04:30.088 --> 00:04:33.023
and develop a capital
campaign, which

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:40.060
I guess we announced sometime
in late '58 or early '59,

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.012
for $53 million.

00:04:43.012 --> 00:04:45.024
Then let's go out
to the Windy City.

00:04:45.024 --> 00:04:48.080
DONALD: We report $2,496,000.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.084
ROBERT F. GOHEEN: Hooray!

00:04:52.068 --> 00:04:53.079
Thank you, Donald.

00:04:53.079 --> 00:04:55.038
God bless you.

00:04:55.038 --> 00:05:00.052
You figure $53 million is
nothing in current currency.

00:05:00.052 --> 00:05:04.038
But in the 1950s, it was a
hell of a whole lot of money.

00:05:04.038 --> 00:05:06.093
ROBERT K. DURKEE: For some
perspective, $53 million

00:05:06.093 --> 00:05:11.012
was about half the cost of the
Soviet Union's Sputnik space

00:05:11.012 --> 00:05:14.027
program, the success of
which was on everyone's mind

00:05:14.027 --> 00:05:18.027
when Goheen was interviewed
by Edward R. Murrow in 1958.

00:05:18.027 --> 00:05:20.048
EDWARD R. MURROW: Dr. Goheen,
are you troubled at all

00:05:20.048 --> 00:05:23.061
by the Sputnik-inspired
suggestions for crash

00:05:23.061 --> 00:05:25.095
programs in the sciences?

00:05:25.095 --> 00:05:27.070
REPORTER: Today, a new
moon is in the sky.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.062
ROBERT F. GOHEEN: I really do
believe that Sputnik generated

00:05:30.062 --> 00:05:33.061
in America a much
renewed and heightened

00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:36.010
sense of the importance
of higher education.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.083
In the next 10 years
or so, resources

00:05:38.083 --> 00:05:41.066
came to the universities
that had just been quite

00:05:41.066 --> 00:05:43.081
out of their reach before.

00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:46.071
These assets will
pay large dividends

00:05:46.071 --> 00:05:48.097
for Princeton in
the years ahead.

00:05:48.097 --> 00:05:51.052
REPORTER: President Goheen has
just made the opening address

00:05:51.052 --> 00:05:54.074
to dedicate the new building
for the Woodrow Wilson

00:05:54.074 --> 00:05:57.064
School of Public and
International Affairs.

00:05:57.064 --> 00:05:59.098
CHANTING: Hip, hip, hip!

00:05:59.098 --> 00:06:04.017
Sis, sis, sih!
Boom, boom, boom! Aaaah!

00:06:04.017 --> 00:06:09.008
ROBERT F. GOHEEN: And so, ladies
and gentlemen, [INAUDIBLE], we

00:06:09.008 --> 00:06:12.044
say thank you very much
indeed and good night.

00:06:21.072 --> 00:06:25.000
I think I'd confess that
through most of my life,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.047
until the early '60s, I had been
largely oblivious to the issue

00:06:29.047 --> 00:06:32.019
of race in this country.

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:34.095
Then as these reports
started to come out

00:06:34.095 --> 00:06:40.001
of the South about civil
rights activities there,

00:06:40.001 --> 00:06:41.091
that led me to
try to see what we

00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:45.027
could do to increase the racial
diversity on the Princeton

00:06:45.027 --> 00:06:46.049
campus.

00:06:46.049 --> 00:06:49.081
Not easy, because
as we found out,

00:06:49.081 --> 00:06:54.057
blacks who might
academically be eligible many

00:06:54.057 --> 00:06:56.066
turned away because
of its reputation

00:06:56.066 --> 00:07:00.005
as having been a place which
rejected blacks, and not

00:07:00.005 --> 00:07:04.082
the least because of Woodrow
Wilson's activity as president

00:07:04.082 --> 00:07:07.096
in denying blacks entry
into the civil service.

00:07:07.096 --> 00:07:08.079
That was a shocker.

00:07:08.079 --> 00:07:11.088
Wilson had to me
always been a hero,

00:07:11.088 --> 00:07:13.080
and was up until this time.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.057
Then suddenly I
learned about what

00:07:15.057 --> 00:07:19.046
he'd done with respect to
the blacks in Washington.

00:07:19.046 --> 00:07:23.041
And I was clear he
was a Southern racist.

00:07:30.046 --> 00:07:34.064
I saw that women were playing
an increasingly influential role

00:07:34.064 --> 00:07:35.037
in this world.

00:07:38.056 --> 00:07:41.051
We just were not in touch
with this whole segment

00:07:41.051 --> 00:07:44.072
of our society that were going
to be influential players

00:07:44.072 --> 00:07:46.047
in the society.

00:07:46.047 --> 00:07:48.084
Princeton had fallen
behind in this respect.

00:07:48.084 --> 00:07:51.049
STUDENT: If Princeton
doesn't have girls here,

00:07:51.049 --> 00:07:54.013
it's going to lose out on the
top students in the nation.

00:07:54.013 --> 00:07:56.038
ROBERT F. GOHEEN: That was
an important factor for us.

00:07:56.038 --> 00:08:00.081
We like to think we're
dealing with the future movers

00:08:00.081 --> 00:08:02.014
and shakers of the country.

00:08:02.014 --> 00:08:06.085
And for some to just refuse
to come and be educated here

00:08:06.085 --> 00:08:10.067
for that reason
was a great shock.

00:08:13.049 --> 00:08:16.099
I asked Howard Helm,
the ranking trustee,

00:08:16.099 --> 00:08:19.019
the chairman of the
executive committee,

00:08:19.019 --> 00:08:22.018
if he would head a
committee to study

00:08:22.018 --> 00:08:23.097
the issue of co-education.

00:08:23.097 --> 00:08:27.021
And Harold said, but
I don't believe in it.

00:08:27.021 --> 00:08:29.051
And I said, Harold, I didn't
ask you to believe in it.

00:08:29.051 --> 00:08:30.098
I asked you to study it.

00:08:30.098 --> 00:08:32.081
REPORTER: Princeton
University in Princeton,

00:08:32.081 --> 00:08:34.028
New Jersey today
announced the end

00:08:34.028 --> 00:08:36.099
of its all-male
educational tradition.

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:38.041
STUDENT: It's like
making history.

00:08:38.041 --> 00:08:39.014
I'm a pioneer.

00:08:39.014 --> 00:08:40.068
DAN LINKE: In retrospect,
is there anything

00:08:40.068 --> 00:08:42.052
you wish you could
have done differently?

00:08:42.052 --> 00:08:44.082
ROBERT F. GOHEEN: I hate to
sound like President Bush,

00:08:44.082 --> 00:08:48.036
because I think
things went well.

00:08:48.036 --> 00:08:50.021
STUDENTS: (SINGING)
We like co-education.

00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:55.036
ROBERT F. GOHEEN: Diversity,
pushing the effort

00:08:55.036 --> 00:08:58.007
to get more blacks
and other minorities

00:08:58.007 --> 00:09:01.007
into the University body,
whether it be student body

00:09:01.007 --> 00:09:04.000
or faculty, and then the women.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.006
I think both of those changed
the character of Princeton

00:09:07.006 --> 00:09:08.014
for the better.

00:09:08.014 --> 00:09:13.054
Those are the things I'd be
most proud of, I think, yeah.

00:09:13.054 --> 00:09:16.011
RICHARD NIXON: I have
concluded that the time has

00:09:16.011 --> 00:09:18.006
come for action.

00:09:18.006 --> 00:09:19.056
ROBERT F. GOHEEN:
Looking backwards,

00:09:19.056 --> 00:09:24.017
I realize that my first
decade, from '57 to '67

00:09:24.017 --> 00:09:27.077
was a wonderfully calm
time on the campus.

00:09:27.077 --> 00:09:31.069
RICHARD NIXON: This is not
an invasion of Cambodia.

00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:33.015
ROBERT F. GOHEEN:
It happened to be

00:09:33.015 --> 00:09:35.069
this night the
University was receiving

00:09:35.069 --> 00:09:39.011
a bunch of distinguished
Russian scientists.

00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:44.018
Toward the end of the
evening in Prospect,

00:09:44.018 --> 00:09:48.027
word came that the incursion
into Cambodia had occurred.

00:09:48.027 --> 00:09:51.007
REPORTER: A packed crowd of over
2,300 persons in the Princeton

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:52.014
University Chapel.

00:09:52.014 --> 00:09:53.072
ROBERT F. GOHEEN:
Immediately followed

00:09:53.072 --> 00:09:57.057
by all kinds of noise
of people rallying,

00:09:57.057 --> 00:10:00.031
people had come to the
chapel for a demonstration.

00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:04.020
At that initial point, I had no
idea what kind of demonstration

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.028
it was going to be.

00:10:05.028 --> 00:10:09.007
But I asked the Russians
if they wanted to go.

00:10:09.007 --> 00:10:11.054
STUDENT: So instead of
going to our classes,

00:10:11.054 --> 00:10:16.049
I say let's go into the streets,
not to burn this country down,

00:10:16.049 --> 00:10:18.047
but to remake this country.

00:10:18.047 --> 00:10:20.005
REPORTER: The reaction
on the campuses

00:10:20.005 --> 00:10:22.007
was swift and predictable.

00:10:22.007 --> 00:10:24.080
ROBERT F. GOHEEN: And it
was madness, sort of unreal.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.030
REPORTER: Princeton students
called for a nationwide student

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:28.000
strike.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.047
STUDENT: We are on strike, yes.

00:10:29.047 --> 00:10:31.001
That's very clear.

00:10:31.001 --> 00:10:32.085
ROBERT F. GOHEEN: I saw
the Russians quietly

00:10:32.085 --> 00:10:34.013
remove themselves.

00:10:34.013 --> 00:10:36.071
REPORTER: A rather disorganized
scene, as hundreds of people

00:10:36.071 --> 00:10:38.099
turned to look at Princeton
President Robert Goheen.

00:10:38.099 --> 00:10:41.024
ROBERT F. GOHEEN: I sat there
and decided it certainly

00:10:41.024 --> 00:10:46.058
was not the time for anybody
official to try to intervene.

00:10:46.058 --> 00:10:50.094
It would just be a
travesty to try to do that.

00:10:50.094 --> 00:10:52.044
REPORTER: When our
reporter proposed

00:10:52.044 --> 00:10:55.011
that Goheen talk to us,
he seemed visibly shaken.

00:10:55.011 --> 00:10:57.007
ROBERT F. GOHEEN: I think
I've made my position

00:10:57.007 --> 00:10:59.080
on the war clear many times.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.031
I went from being
a quiet proponent

00:11:02.031 --> 00:11:07.042
of that war to being a very
quite outspoken opponent of it.

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:10.067
I do not believe to strike
against the University

00:11:10.067 --> 00:11:14.067
because it's the nearest
thing at hand makes any sense.

00:11:14.067 --> 00:11:17.092
[BOOS]

00:11:17.092 --> 00:11:21.011
We never completely closed
our doors academically.

00:11:21.011 --> 00:11:24.008
And I thought that
was important.

00:11:24.008 --> 00:11:26.017
ROBERT K. DURKEE: Two years
earlier the University

00:11:26.017 --> 00:11:28.051
had implemented a
series of reforms

00:11:28.051 --> 00:11:32.001
aimed at involving students
and faculty more actively

00:11:32.001 --> 00:11:34.018
in the University's
decision-making.

00:11:34.018 --> 00:11:38.023
In May of 1970, as some
campuses erupted in violence,

00:11:38.023 --> 00:11:40.020
Princeton stayed peaceful.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.022
ROBERT F. GOHEEN: We had
two general assemblies

00:11:42.022 --> 00:11:45.037
in Jadwin Hall, where
everybody from the University

00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:48.049
and community were invited
to come and sound off.

00:11:48.049 --> 00:11:52.024
And I think there was just a
healthy airing of frustration

00:11:52.024 --> 00:11:54.037
and anger and so on.

00:11:54.037 --> 00:11:56.081
Those in favor of the
amendment -- Mr. Canaan,

00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:57.031
excuse me.

00:11:57.031 --> 00:11:59.040
I didn't see your hand.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.057
I also had 10 faculty meetings.

00:12:01.057 --> 00:12:04.035
And that was quite
wonderful, because the core

00:12:04.035 --> 00:12:08.003
of the Princeton faculty
really rallied around and took

00:12:08.003 --> 00:12:09.054
all of this seriously.

00:12:09.054 --> 00:12:12.051
PROFESSOR: I would like to
move that this faculty give you

00:12:12.051 --> 00:12:14.098
a standing ovation.

00:12:14.098 --> 00:12:16.052
ROBERT F. GOHEEN:
My only response

00:12:16.052 --> 00:12:18.081
is that it's a great
faculty to work with,

00:12:18.081 --> 00:12:21.028
just as it's a great
student body to work with.

00:12:24.013 --> 00:12:26.011
ROBERT K. DURKEE:
In March of 1971,

00:12:26.011 --> 00:12:28.005
Bob Goheen announced
his retirement,

00:12:28.005 --> 00:12:32.050
saying the University would
profit from fresh leadership.

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:37.074
He left office in 1972 after 15
years as Princeton's president.

00:12:37.074 --> 00:12:41.018
That year, he became president
of the Council on Foundations.

00:12:41.018 --> 00:12:45.065
In January 1977, he became
president of the Edna McConnell

00:12:45.065 --> 00:12:47.041
Clark Foundation.

00:12:47.041 --> 00:12:50.006
Less than five months
later, however, he

00:12:50.006 --> 00:12:52.066
was appointed
ambassador to India,

00:12:52.066 --> 00:12:54.097
the country of his birth,
by President Carter.

00:12:57.098 --> 00:13:03.058
I thought to be an ambassador
you had to either be very rich

00:13:03.058 --> 00:13:07.012
or a very active member
of the political party

00:13:07.012 --> 00:13:08.034
of your president.

00:13:08.034 --> 00:13:11.040
I was neither rich nor was
I a political partisan,

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:17.060
so it was a nice
shock to be invited

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.020
in the sense just for me
because I knew something

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.054
about the country.

00:13:21.054 --> 00:13:23.075
PROFESSOR: Dr. Tilghman,
please raise your right hand

00:13:23.075 --> 00:13:25.098
and repeat after me.

00:13:25.098 --> 00:13:27.043
I do solemnly swear --

00:13:27.043 --> 00:13:29.063
SHIRLEY TILGHMAN: I
do solemnly swear --

00:13:29.063 --> 00:13:33.058
ROBERT K. DURKEE: In 2001, 32
years after Princeton admitted

00:13:33.058 --> 00:13:36.009
women on his watch,
Goheen participated

00:13:36.009 --> 00:13:39.059
in installation ceremonies for
the University's first woman

00:13:39.059 --> 00:13:41.073
president.

00:13:41.073 --> 00:13:43.052
ROBERT F. GOHEEN: We
took in women students

00:13:43.052 --> 00:13:44.044
quite a long time ago.

00:13:44.044 --> 00:13:47.073
It was certainly time
to get more women

00:13:47.073 --> 00:13:48.096
high in the administration.

00:13:48.096 --> 00:13:52.086
And here she's headed right
at the top, which is great.

00:13:52.086 --> 00:13:57.069
I for one today feel
full of good hope.

00:13:57.069 --> 00:13:59.097
I don't know what
my legacy is, but I

00:13:59.097 --> 00:14:03.066
might say that I was able
to start a process of change

00:14:03.066 --> 00:14:06.044
in the University,
creative change, which

00:14:06.044 --> 00:14:09.054
has been carried forward by
each one of my successors.

00:14:09.054 --> 00:14:11.032
I don't know if that's
a legacy or not,

00:14:11.032 --> 00:14:14.023
but anyhow it's very
gratifying to see

00:14:14.023 --> 00:14:16.065
that the University's
not stopped and said,

00:14:16.065 --> 00:14:18.071
now we've done it.

00:14:18.071 --> 00:14:20.067
We’re there.

00:14:20.067 --> 00:14:23.035
Let's just continue to
do what we were doing.

00:14:23.035 --> 00:14:25.068
DAN LINKE: I just want to ask if
there's anything on your mind

00:14:25.068 --> 00:14:27.010
that we haven't
discussed that you

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:29.027
want to record for posterity.

00:14:29.027 --> 00:14:30.073
ROBERT F. GOHEEN:
I don't think so.

00:14:30.073 --> 00:14:32.080
You've drawn me
out very well, Dan.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.085
And we've talked
now for four hours.

00:14:34.085 --> 00:14:40.008
And I think I've spilled
all the beans, as they say.
