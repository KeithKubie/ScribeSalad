00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.200
Hello, I'm Jonathan Simon with
the Google Cloud Platform team.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.140
I'm going to show you a demo of
using Compute Engine to set up

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.214
a simple Cloud based web server.

00:00:10.214 --> 00:00:12.380
That way you can see the
process and then try it out

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.470
for yourself.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.760
Let's get started by pointing
a browser to cloud.Google.com.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.628
Click to My Console link to
view the developer's console.

00:00:21.628 --> 00:00:24.044
Now that we're in the console,
we'll create a new project.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.770
We're creating a
test web server,

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.180
so we'll call it
Web Server Project.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.060
We'll also change the
suggested product ID.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.150
Agree to the terms of service,
and then click Create.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.950
That'll start the
project creation process.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.920
Now, the project
that's being created

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.070
will have access to all
of Google's Cloud Platform

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.570
services.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.202
Compute Engine is
a paid service,

00:00:58.202 --> 00:00:59.660
so the first thing
we'll need to do

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.180
is set up our
billing information.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.760
You'll likely be surprised at
how affordable experimenting

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.020
with Compute Engine can be.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.960
After we've entered our
billing information,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.045
we'll navigate to the
Compute Engine VM Instances

00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:16.720
page, where we should see a
list of the virtual machines

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.990
that we've created.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.010
We don't currently have
any, so let's add one.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.165
Start by clicking the
Create Instance button.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.660
We'll specify the name
as Test Web Server.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.540
For the zone, we'll
create our instance

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.980
in US central1 F. For the
machine type, since this

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.620
is a test, we'll select the
smallest one available-- The F1

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.615
micro, with just over
half a gigabyte of memory.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.460
And we'll go with the suggested
default image, which is debian.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.185
Next, click the Allow
HTTP Traffic check

00:01:55.185 --> 00:01:59.360
box, since this VM is
going to be a web server.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.769
All the other settings should
be OK for our purposes,

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:03.310
so we can now click
the Create button

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.573
to create the virtual machine.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.800
Note that because we went
with the default settings,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.260
a 10 gigabyte persistent
disk will be created, named

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.350
Test Web Server.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.150
That will be used as the
boot disk for the instance.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.850
Persistent disks are
especially useful,

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.460
because they can live on beyond
a specific virtual machine's

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.430
lifetime.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.110
This allows you to save the
state of your virtual machine

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.432
at any point in time,
and then restore it

00:02:39.432 --> 00:02:40.515
at any time in the future.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.504
Our instance is almost ready.

00:02:57.504 --> 00:02:58.920
Some final health
checks are being

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.130
run, which is the last
step before the server is

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.926
ready to use.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.330
There, now our instance
has been created.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.420
In order to make changes,
like in selling software

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.190
on our Compute Engine
virtual machine,

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.360
we'll need to remotely
access the machine.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.080
There's a quick way to do that
right from the Instance Details

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.350
page.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.820
Next to the VM's details,
there's an SSH link.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.570
Clicking that link
will open a new browser

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.780
tab that contains a secure
shell into the VM instance.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.220
And there we go.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.210
We've remotely accessed
our test web server.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.080
Here we are at the command line.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.590
Well, let's install
some software.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.184
Specifically, some
web server software.

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:48.100
The web server software
we're going to install

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.970
is Apache Web Server.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.830
A standard command used on Linux
to install software is apt get.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.380
So we're going to type sudo to
run the command as super user,

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.120
apt get install Apache 2.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.050
It's going to ask us to confirm
that we want to install it.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.190
Hit Y, and press Enter.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.925
The installation
process has started.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.839
And now Apache has
been installed.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:20.880
As part of the
installation process,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.012
Apache creates a
default web page.

00:04:23.012 --> 00:04:24.470
We can try loading
that default web

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.511
page in a browser to
confirm that we are actually

00:04:26.511 --> 00:04:27.650
serving web pages.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.320
Back in the
developer's console, we

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.870
can easily do this by
clicking the external IP

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.730
address of the VM instance.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:35.760
And there we go.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.050
The default Apache page.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.440
Great, our test web server
is serving up web pages.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.620
Now, to prove that
this is our web server,

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.720
let's modify the
default web page.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.960
We'll jump back over to
our SSH tab, and type

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.960
the following command to
open up our default web

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.580
page in an editor.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.520
We'll start by typing sudo, to
run the command as superuser,

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.430
nano, which is the
text editor we'll use,

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.510
and then the location
of the default web page,

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.676
which is var/www/index.html.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.490
When we run that, it opens
the web page in an editor.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.680
First, we'll remove the
default text that's there.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.200
And then we'll paste in
an image so we can easily

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.210
tell that the page
has been modified.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.150
We'll save the page
in nano by pressing

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.740
the Control key
and X, and then Y

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.970
and Enter to close
and save the file.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:38.030
Back in the browser, we should
be able to refresh the page.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.360
And there is our new
custom default web page.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.609
Now, I would call
this test a success.

00:05:42.609 --> 00:05:44.650
The final thing we need
to do to wrap up our test

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.750
is to delete the virtual
machine and the persistent disk.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.920
As I do that, let's make
a calculation about how

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.110
much this whole test cost.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.580
We'll select our
test web server,

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.880
and click the Delete
button to delete

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.067
the VM and its persistent disk.

00:06:00.067 --> 00:06:01.775
Click the Delete button
again to confirm.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.500
The deletion
process has started.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.950
So, how much did it
cost to run this demo?

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.710
The current virtual machine
price for the type we used is

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.730
$0.80 per hour.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.500
Compute Engine VM
instances are built

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.330
at a minimum of 10 minutes,
and we ran our server

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.380
for less than that.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.430
So our virtual
machine usage cost

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.560
comes in at under
2/10 of one cent.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.260
Their persistent disk pricing
is $0.04 per gigabyte per month.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.100
So that comes to well under
a cent for the default 10

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.380
gigabyte boot disk that we used.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.920
So everything we just
did on Compute Engine,

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.003
for less than one cent.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.970
And there we go, the virtual
machine and its persistent disk

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.360
have been deleted.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.750
Thanks for watching.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:48.902
Now it's your turn.

00:06:48.902 --> 00:06:50.860
Go try creating your own
cloud based web server

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.880
on Compute Engine.
