00:00:01.235 --> 00:00:03.070
So there's an on-line petition
to get the Cincinnati Bengals

00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:05.572
to change their name
to the Cincinnati Harambes

00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:09.576
after the Cincinnati Zoo gorilla
famous for... well, you know

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.245
that thing
that we all got upset about.

00:00:11.278 --> 00:00:14.481
That's the gorilla that made us
forget all about Cecil the lion.

00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:16.517
The Change.org petition
is so close

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.418
to getting the 25,000 signatures
it needs

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:20.087
to get someone
from the Bengals organization

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.391
to glance briefly at it before
throwing it in the garbage.

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:26.360
Comedians, a beloved Internet
martyr like Harambe deserves

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:29.696
to have more than just
a football team named after him.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.131
What are some other things
that should be renamed

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:32.799
in honor of Harambe?

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:34.968
-Steve.
-Denny's Moons Over Harambe.

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:36.904
-Yeah.
-(laughter)

00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:39.273
Yeah.

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:42.075
-Those are...
-Grand slam.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.244
-Uh, Emily.
-That Cranberries song

00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:47.881
where she's like...
♪ Harambe, Harambe

00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:51.251
♪ Harambe,
ay-uh, ay-uh, ay-uh. ♪

00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:52.920
I'm gonna give you
an extra hundred points...

00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:55.989
-(applause and cheering)
-Yes! -...for committing

00:00:56.023 --> 00:00:58.792
to the Dolores O'Riordan cackle.
Kurt Braunohler.

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:00.527
Uh, they should have renamed

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:00.627
that three-year-old so he never
forgets what he (bleep) did.
