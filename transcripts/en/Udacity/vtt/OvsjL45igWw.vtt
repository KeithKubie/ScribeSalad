00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.719
Mitochondria perform a really important function inside

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:07.220
cells. They produce boatloads of energy in

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.370
the form of a molecule called ATP,

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.910
or adenosine triphosphate. Without mitochondria, life as we

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.520
know it just wouldn't be possible. Now, a cell can have many mitochondria at a

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.310
time. Ranging from a few to several thousand. And each mitochodria has its own

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.770
mitochondrial DNA. Mitochodrial DNA exists in the form of a chromosome just like

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.790
our nuclear chromosomes, but our chromosome

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.570
here isn't linear, it's circular. One circular

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.933
chromosome in the mitochondrial genome has

00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:45.540
only 17,000 base pairs. Remember all the

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.800
linear chromosomes of the nuclear genome have more than 3 billion base pairs.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.540
The fact that mitochondria have their own mitochondrial DNA in the form

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.170
of circular chromosomes, is evidence that

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.650
supports a model claiming that mitochondria used

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.450
to be free living bacteria that were engulfed by an ancestral cell

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.490
and incorporated into our cells and thus our bodies, in an essential way.
