00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:07.270
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.810
&gt;&gt; Our final talk before the
break is from Stephen Robertson

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.290
who is Director of the Roy
Rosenzweig Center for History

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.710
and New Media and Professor History
at the George Mason University.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.730
He will tell a story
about Digital Harlem,

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.330
a project that won the American
Historical Association's Roy

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.940
Rosenzweig Prize for
Innovation in Digital History

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.000
and the ABC CLIO Online
History Award

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.550
of the American Library
Association in 2010.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.380
You're on, Stephen.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.180
&gt;&gt; Stephen Robertson: Good morning.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.140
[ Applause ]

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.440
Applause [inaudible].

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.020
I just want to start with a quick
shout out to the wonderful team

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.710
of people here at the
Library of Congress

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.330
who have brought us all here
today, and a fascinating group

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.920
of people they've brought.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.300
I'm going to go back to maps which
it shows you a lot at the beginning

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.400
to talk about data in place.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.650
Historical sources are full of
data about places and locations.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.030
The spatial data is not very
intelligible in textual form,

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.340
and even when extracted and
organized in tabular form,

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.170
it really doesn't tell us a lot.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.330
It's hard to discern the
story that it has to tell us.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.410 position:56%
Now, mapping has been around for a
long time as a tool for making sense

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.420
of the spatial data, but it's
only really with the advent

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.920
of web mapping that
it's become accessible

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.310
to a wider range of people.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.330
You used to have to go find the
GIS person in your university

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.560 position:56%
to make you a map for a project,
and that was going to be the one map

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.850
that you did if you had
the months to do that.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.770
The web has fundamentally
transformed that, and the project

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.530
that I'm here to talk
about today owes its form

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.960
to the launch of Google
Maps in 2005.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.250
Shane White put together
a team of four historians,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.050
University of Sydney, of
which I was the junior member,

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.380
to do a study of everyday life

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.390
in New York City's Harlem
neighborhood in the 1920s.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.320
Our key sources for this
to get beyond the political

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.190
and artistic elite
that dominate accounts

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.200
of Harlem was New York City's
two black newspapers, The Age

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.030
and the Amsterdam News
and the records

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.930
of the Manhattan District Attorney.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.200
Now, I was in that project because
I'd used those legal records

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.840 position:56%
in my dissertation, and I knew from
the dissertation that they were full

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.730
of information about where things
happened that I'd found no way

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.430
to use and analyze when
I did the dissertation.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.910
So, what I suggested
as my contribution

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.040
to this larger project was
an effort to map our sources.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.500
Now, when we got funding for the
project in 2004, the technology

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.140
for doing that was our GIS, and
I went away to find collaborators

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.460
at the University of Sydney,

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.030
our experts in art GIS,
to make that happen.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.330
And, at Sydney at that time,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.220
it was the archeological
computing laboratory.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.770
However, the problem
with art GIS in 2004 was

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.400
that it was not possible
to use it on the web.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.740
It wouldn't run on our
beloved Macintosh computers,

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.650
and it simply was, as it still
is, far too hard to master

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.910
and far too complex
to make it worth using

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.530
to analyze the qualitative
data that we had.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.240 position:56%
So, and, thankfully, with the launch
of Google Maps in 2005 and thanks

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.470 position:56%
to Damian Evans, one of our team who
created a hack between our database

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.530
and Google Maps, we launched
Digital Harlem in 2009

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.160
as a web based form of mapping.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.850
As with any large digital project,

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.410
there's a whole team
of people behind that.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.080
And, before I say anything
more, I want to acknowledge all

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.210
of those people in addition to
the ones I've already named,

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.980
a team of historians,
graduate research assistants,

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.980
technologists of various kinds,
and almost a million dollars

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.540
of Australian government money
which always amuses people.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.330
But, the Australian government,
at least in the early 2000s,

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.960
was interested in funding
innovative scholarship even

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.710
about black neighborhoods
thousands of miles away.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.860
Now, Digital Harlem was one

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.710
of the first historical
we mapping projects,

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.260
and one of the first digital
history projects to shift

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.090
from what the Valley of the Shadow
was really interested in doing,

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.160 position:56%
digitizing material, creating online
collections towards visualizing

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.460
those sources.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.530
Now better technologies now
exist for web mapping projects.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.080 position:56%
Nevertheless, Digital Harlem remains
a useful starting point for thinking

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.420
about mapping as a means of
making sources more accessible,

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.290
more visual, and more useful.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.340
The contrast here is
research with access

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.860
and sources through a database.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.530
I think Michell Whitelaw's
formulation which I'm sure many

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.010
of you are familiar
with, captures this best.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.250
Search is ungenerous.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.350
Demanding a query and returning
only the terms you enter.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.060
Withholding information about the
structure and materials available

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.400
and filtering out any
alternative hypotheses.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.190 position:56%
Visualizations, by contrast, are
generous, rich, browsable interfaces

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.550
that reveal the scale and
complexity of the data behind them

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.980
and provide a context, a context
that enriches the exploration

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.090
and analysis of that data.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.020 position:56%
So, Digital Harlem is not an
interface to a collection of forces.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.410
Thanks to copyright, licensing, and
restrictions imposed by archives,

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.790
it's not possible for us, even if
we'd wanted to, which we didn't,

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.660
to offer access to the sources
on which the site draws.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.880
But, those restrictions do not
prevent the creation of data

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.180
from those sources which is
what Digital Harlem contains,

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.060
information about events, an
ill-fated tennis tournament

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.320
in this case, about people, and to
a much lesser extent, about, sorry,

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.860
much lesser extent about people.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.770
A lot about places.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.650
It's worth noting that those of
us who work on the 20th century

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.430
and beyond encounter
this problem with access

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.030
to sources far more
often than our colleagues

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.800
who work in earlier periods.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.130 position:56%
We need to be talking more about the
way in which restrictions on access

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.320
to sources shape the kind of
digital projects we can do

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:18.110 position:56%
on the 20th century and how creating
data is a way of getting access

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.040
to material that's
otherwise under copyright.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.650
To create data, however, requires
a different engagement with sources

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.710
than humanity scholars
typically have.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.910
Whereas, to use Miriam
Posner's words,

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.240
we usually immerse
ourselves in our sources.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.900
Dive in. Understand
them from within.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.780
To create data is to
extract information.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.140 position:56%
And, features from sources requiring
a decomposition of a subject

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.290
or object into attributes
and variables.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.250
If you're now increasing range
of computational tools to do

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.030
that extraction for you,
the data that we gathered

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.070 position:56%
for Digital Harlem was done by hand.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.680
And, because of the problems of
access to digitized newspapers

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.720
and the limits of ACR,
it's still a process

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.050
that needs to be done by hand.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.320
So, myself and the team of research
assistants who appear briefly

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.600
on the screen recorded
details of every location

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:15.480
and every event associated with
the location in those legal records

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.810
that I was talking about.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.990
And, in the Harlem's
two black newspapers.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:24.320 position:56%
And, crucially, in a way that Ed was
alluding to, not just information

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.350
from the news stories,
but information

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.480
from every section
of the newspapers.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.340
The fraternal reports, the
church records, the sports pages.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.910
There's far more information and
far more spatial data in newspapers

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.780
than we're used to thinking about
when we roll the microfilm through

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.010
and looked for the news
stories that were part of that.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:47.870
We organized that information
into a data model,

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.970 position:56%
entered it into a database, and
geocoded it so that could be mapped.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.390
Now, the metaphor that we commonly
use to describe that process,

00:07:55.390 --> 00:08:00.530 position:56%
mining, sits awkwardly with humanity
scholars concerned with development

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:05.140
of empathy with an appreciation of
the position of the person or group

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.960
or the qualities of an object.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:12.270
It sets up a sense of creating
data as somehow dehumanizing.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:15.460
Mapping data can somehow
mitigate that consequence,

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.990
can align with an orientation
towards [inaudible] data,

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.340
one element of which is articulated
by [inaudible] as an appreciation

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:27.310
of context, interdependence,
and vulnerability.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:32.990 position:56%
Maps as a visualization express this
relationship of parts one to another

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.690
and to many to a greater whole.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:41.880
Mapping data, mapped data is
seen at its geographical context,

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.500
and [inaudible] Digital Harlem by
the use of a historical map player.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.730
A Bromley Real Estate atlas which
shares a lot of the information

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.190
and qualities of the [inaudible]
and Sanborn fire insurance maps.

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:57.880
It provides building footprints,
information on the height

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.120
of those buildings, the
material they're made out of,

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.590
whether they have shops
or stores in them.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:05.400
What it does most dramatically in
terms of the maps that we're used

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.850
to looking at in historical
scholarship is filled

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:10.370
in the spaces on a street map.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:15.330
And, in that way, the
space literally divides,

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:19.380
helps to subdivide and divide
Harlem into multiple smaller places

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.420
and to give some indication
of how those places interact.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.990
And, if you know anything about
the history of Harlem in the 1920s,

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:29.000
I chose this flock because on the
corner is renaissance ballroom

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.620
and casino, the sight of a lot
of dances and entertainment

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.370
and basketball games next

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.120
to the establishment
Abyssinian Baptist Church,

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:40.090
one of the main line middle class
moral racial [inaudible] of Harlem.

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:44.340
And, the hall to the right of
that was the former headquarters

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.250
of Marcus Garvey's
black nationalist UNIA.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:51.600
A very interesting gathering of
people walking down those blocks

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.200
in a way that we don't appreciate
without this kind of level of data.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.900
One of the very exciting things
going on right here at the Library

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.140
of Congress is the digitization
of Sanborn fire insurance maps.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.000
We're just going to put
these incredibly rich sources

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.220 position:56%
into people's hand, make them freely
accessible, transform the kind

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.590
of historical mapping
projects we can do

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.110
by adding this incredibly
rich layer of data

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.240
about what the place is like.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.170
Layer the different data,
and hence large quantities

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:23.490
of data can be combined on a
single map, providing an image

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:24.900
of the complexity of the past.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.620
And, I'm going to come back to
this really complex looking map.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.550
You can examine maps of sources at
different scales, make comparisons,

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.480
discover relationships by
visually detecting spatial patents

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:39.870
that remain hidden in those texts
and tables that we started with.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.830
Now, mapping data has become
an increasingly common form

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.530
of interface for a lot
of digital collections.

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:50.640
But, too often, those projects
map only a single collection

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.940
of material.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:56.520
That approach takes really only a
small part of the power of mapping.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.970
Geographic location provides
a means to integrate material

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.950
from a wide range of
disparate sources.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:07.000 position:56%
So, what's important about assigning
a geographic reference to data,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.470
as Karen Kemp puts it, then
becomes possible to compare

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:14.670
that characteristic of the
phenomenon, etc. with others

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:17.630
that exist or have existed
in the same geographic space.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:22.090 position:56%
What were previously unrelated facts
become integrated and correlated.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:26.200
The power of maps to bring
disparate things together is

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.340
where we really need to be
going with them as a technology.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:34.210 position:56%
Used in this way, the geospatial web
can help us capture the confluence

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:38.490 position:56%
of multiple rhythms that [inaudible]
argues make up everyday life.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.690
So, this is one of my go
to examples for talking

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:43.210
about Harlem in the 1920s.

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:45.650
It's a map of nightlife
during prohibition using data

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:49.620
from newspapers, undercover
investigations, legal records.

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:53.850
It shows the venues which drew
crowds to Harlem, the night clubs,

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:58.030
the speakeasys, and the venues
that black residents opened

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.750
in their apartments,
known as buffet flats,

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.150
catering exclusively to blacks.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:06.940
The map highlights the different
geographies of those venues and,

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.470
in particular, the clustering
of buffet flats in sections away

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:14.450
from the other venues, away from
whites, and drew our attention

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:18.410
to how blacks developed spaces
apart from whites as they flocked

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.790 position:56%
to Harlem's night life in the 1920s.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:25.050 position:56%
Now, while this map captures some
of how prohibition shaped night life

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:28.080
and leisure in Harlem,
it's only a partial map

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.720
of the commercialized leisure
available in the neighborhood.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:36.530
Digital Harlem lets you create
the context by adding dance halls,

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:42.360
theaters, pool rooms, the halls
that hosted basketball games

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.050
and boxing bouts, and
then you can add

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:46.610
to those commercial
venues [inaudible]

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:49.880
to understand night
life, all of the places

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.480
where noncommercial leisure took
place in Harlem in this period.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.780
Meetings of church
groups, fraternal lodges,

00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.280
community organizations,
and social clubs.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.910
You end up with this
incredibly complex map.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:05.210
Social clubs.

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:06.580
Incredibly complex map

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:11.830
which highlights fundamentally
just how a small segment of leisure

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:15.400
and night life in Harlem actually
appears in discussions focused

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.760 position:56%
on prohibition which defines the way

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.590
that we understand what
Harlem was like in the 1920s.

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:25.510
In regards to mapping
events rather than places,

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:29.000
this is one of the first maps
we created, arrests for numbers

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.070
in 1925, which gave our
research a new focus.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:36.370
It shows in the first instance
the sheer pervasiveness

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:39.830
of numbers gambling which is
a picture that a multitude

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:43.680 position:56%
of sources reinforced in Harlem,
and it's one reason why Shane White,

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.430
Steven Garton, and Graham
White, and I wrote a book

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:51.240
about the wide ranging economic and
cultural role of numbers gambling

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.270
in Harlem as one of the
outcomes of our collaboration.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:59.670
Zooming in to that map highlights
how placing bets was woven

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:00.990
into everyday life.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:04.970
Arrests occurred on street corners
as residents get on their way

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:08.080
to work, and the businesses
lining the avenues

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.530
as they went shopping
and ran errands.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.430
And, in their homes,
on the cross streets

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:17.220
as numbers runners went door
to door collecting bets.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.540
Our original concept for Digital
Harlem also included mapping

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:24.320
individual lives, but assembling
enough data to reveal more

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.620
than a single moment

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.880
of an individual's life
proved beyond our resources.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.610
However, we did generate maps
for a handful of people based

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:35.500
on information on their
residence, work, and leisure

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.200
and probation and parole records.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.620
Those maps make visible the
extent to which the lives

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:45.910
of Harlem's residents were not
bounded by the neighborhood,

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:50.410 position:56%
made clear that the census data that
we commonly rely on to determine

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:54.130
where people lived ultimately
only tells us where they slept.

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:58.110
So, for example, during the five
years that Morgan Thompson was

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:02.550
on probation, his work as a laborer
took him not only outside Manhattan

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.620
but to the Bronx, Queens,
and Brooklyn.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:09.320 position:56%
We've used lines linking residents
with the workplaces and other places

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.310
that people frequented
while [inaudible]

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:14.290
to suggest their movement
through the city.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:16.640
The geography of work was
often different for women.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:20.400
Annie Dillard, like the majority
of Harlem women in the workforce,

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.480
found paid employment as a
domestic servant in homes

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.260
on the upper west side,
hotels in midtown,

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.650 position:56%
and in a laundry in lower Manhattan.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:31.950
The newest version of Digital
Harlem adds a timeline to this

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:34.430
to understand how these
lives evolved.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.870
Two strikingly different
geographies,

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:39.500
two strikingly different
reminders that living

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.240
in a city is not living
in the neighborhood.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.980 position:56%
It's moving across the city in a way

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:48.680
that we don't often place African
Americans in places like New York.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.180
Now, for all the maps that
we feature on the site

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.860
and that we discuss in our
scholarship, much of the usefulness

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:58.350
and impact of Digital Harlem
comes from how it allows users

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:02.520 position:56%
to make their own maps, to visualize
the data that interests them rather

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:06.660
than being constrained to what
interests the site's creators.

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:10.930
That capacity highlights that
these maps are exploratory,

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:14.180
not illustrative, that
they raise questions rather

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:15.610
than answering them.

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:19.340 position:56%
But, the site itself, unfortunately,
offers limited help in making sense

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.160 position:56%
of a map and the data it visualizes.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.390
That design is in keeping with the
original conception of the site

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:28.060
which was as a research
tool for those

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.860
of us collaborating on
the original project.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.770
When we decided to share the
site, we added some material

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:37.510
about the places and
events featured on the site

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:40.890
and on the individuals
whose lives can be mapped.

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:43.990
And, we created a blog that
linked to the site with posts

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:47.980
about additional maps of places and
events such as traffic accidents

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:51.500
in this example that
incorporate additional material

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.130
like photographs.

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:57.080
Unfortunately, those after the
fact efforts can only go so far.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.700
Creating a real context
for understanding the data

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.870
in Digital Harlem is a
project in its own right

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:06.600
that will require a wholesale
redesign of the site,

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.170
and it's one of the things that we
need to think about the difference

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:12.370
because producing sites that
are research tools for people

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:16.360
who understand the data at some
level and sites that are shared

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.670
and are going to be used by people

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:21.440
who don't bring the researcher's
understanding to the site.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:25.480
Now, an emerging offer, option
for making data more accessible

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:29.270
and useful is to use what's
in Digital Harlem as the basis

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:32.390
for a spatial narrative
rather than simply a map.

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:35.640
I'm currently exploring
that approach for a project

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:39.690
on the 1935 Harlem Riot for which
we're creating another version

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.730
of Digital Harlem based
on that single year.

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:47.010 position:56%
By the 1930s, there's a much greater
wealth of information about life

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:49.250
in Harlem than there
is in the 1920s.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:51.600
Now, a platform like the widely
used story map [inaudible]

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.700
which creates a linear single path

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.320
through a map cannot effectively
tell the story of a complex event

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:03.680
like the riot in which multiple
things happened at any given time.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.290
Neither, for that matter,
can following the timeline

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:11.250 position:56%
on Digital Harlem let you understand
what is going on in the riot.

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:14.770
Neatline, a mapping plugging for
[inaudible] which Ed was talking

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:19.030
about earlier, gives some scope
for more complex storytelling,

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.940
and I've created a prototype
narrative of the riot just

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:26.690
to think about, there we go, just
to think about what's possible.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:30.320
What I really like about Neatline
is that the timeline slider

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:34.410 position:56%
at the bottom of that image provides
a means of navigating the exhibit.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:37.890
Dragging it not only changes the
points that appear on the map.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:42.300
It also alters the way
points visible on the right.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:47.940
While points display information
on particular events, way points,

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.910
way points can be used
for broader arguments

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.640
which can be grouped together
rather than being tied

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.550
to a single point on the timeline.

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:59.500
What that means is that it
gives you some flexibility

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.840
in how a narrative is reared.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:05.310
You can roll over each way
point in a group or explore them

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.540
in a sequence, or out of sequence.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.110
Each way point can be associated

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:11.930
with a zoom level on
a specific location.

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:16.310
Clicking on a series of way points
can, thus, move you around a map.

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:20.330
And, you can annotate those way
points, attach them to polygons

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:23.870
and lines as I have in this
prototype to draw attention

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:27.350
to the analysis of space in my
understanding of what's going

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:31.790
on in the riot, to movement,
direction, proximity,

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.260
connection, and patterns.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:38.810
Used in that way, annotations
shift some of the argument

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:43.570 position:56%
into visual form, and that's
ultimately where I think we're going

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:47.240
with the kinds of visualizations
we've been making in maps,

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:51.560
that the future direction in
visualizing data using maps

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:56.440
that this prototype points to
is the capacity more extensively

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.600
and dynamically integrate
maps in narratives.

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.580
To visually combine data

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:06.820 position:56%
and interpretation while retaining
the orientation towards putting data

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:08.950
in context, which, to me,

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:12.470
is the most powerful thing
that mapping lets us do.

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:14.120
Thank you.
