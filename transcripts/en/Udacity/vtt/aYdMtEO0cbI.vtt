Welcome to topic four.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.390
Topic four is all about expressions and
equations.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.330
The difference between expressions and
equations

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.400
comes down to a simple equal sign, but
that equal sign is pretty powerful.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.379
Equations help us understand
natural phenomena using numbers.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.120
Let's get started.
