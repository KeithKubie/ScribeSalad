00:00:00.722 --> 00:00:03.028
Voiceover:Solve the
equation for T and express

00:00:03.028 --> 00:00:06.189
your answer in terms
of base 10 logarithms.

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:10.580
And this equation is 10 to
the 2T - 3 is equal to 7.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.182
We want to solve for T in
terms of base 10 logarithms.

00:00:14.182 --> 00:00:16.214
So let me get my little
scratchpad out and I've

00:00:16.214 --> 00:00:18.607
copied and pasted the same problem.

00:00:18.607 --> 00:00:21.388
So I'm just going to
rewrite it, so they have 10

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:25.028
to the 2T-3 is equal to 7.

00:00:25.028 --> 00:00:27.069
Actually, let me color
code this a little bit.

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:36.989
So 10 to the 2T - 3 is equal to 7.

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.053
So this is clearly an
exponential form right over here.

00:00:40.053 --> 00:00:41.960
if we want to write it
in logarithmic form,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.977
where we could, that'll
essentially allow us to solve

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:47.146
for the exponent, so we could say,

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:50.191
this is the exact same
truth about the universe

00:00:50.191 --> 00:01:06.205
as saying that the log base
10 of 7 is equal to 2T - 3.

00:01:06.205 --> 00:01:07.850
Let's just make sure that makes sense,

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.724
this is saying 10 to the 2T - 3 = 7

00:01:10.724 --> 00:01:13.362
This is saying that the power
that I need to raise 10 to

00:01:13.362 --> 00:01:19.021
to get to 7 is 2T - 3, or 10
to 2T - 3 power is equal to 7.

00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:20.880
So these are equivalent statements.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.130
What this form does is it
starts to put it into a form

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.835
that's easier to solve for
T, now if we want to solve

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:29.307
for T, we can add 3 to both sides.

00:01:29.307 --> 00:01:34.698
So if we add 3 to both
sides, we are going to get,

00:01:34.698 --> 00:01:46.717
log base 10 of 7 + 3, plus 3.

00:01:46.717 --> 00:01:48.813
And this +3 is of course
outside of the logarithm

00:01:48.813 --> 00:01:51.321
to make it clear, it's just like that.

00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:55.427
And on the right hand side
this is going to be equal to,

00:01:55.427 --> 00:01:58.788
this is going to be equal to just 2T.

00:01:58.788 --> 00:02:02.302
And now to solve for T we
just divide both sides by 2.

00:02:02.302 --> 00:02:06.932
So if we divide both sides by 2 we get,

00:02:06.932 --> 00:02:14.290
T is equal to all of this
business, log base 10 of 7 + 3

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.311
all of that over 2, so let me
see if I can remember this,

00:02:19.311 --> 00:02:25.959
and write it in the actual
box that they gave us.

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:37.488
So we want to do log base
10 of 7 and then that + 3

00:02:37.488 --> 00:02:40.646
yup it's formatting it
right, divided by 2.

00:02:40.646 --> 00:02:43.518
So that's what I'm
claiming the T is equal to

00:02:43.518 --> 00:02:46.517
in terms of Base 10 logarithms.

00:02:46.517 --> 23:59:59.999
So let me check my answer
and I got it right.
