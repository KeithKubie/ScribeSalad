00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.656
The world we live in is made of things,

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.176
billions and billions of different things,

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.016
like pickles and pianos
and dump trucks and octopi.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.496
And even though these things
seem totally different,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.176
they're all made of the same stuff,
just combined in different ways.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.496
To give you an idea
of how this combining works,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.856
let's take something apart.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.216
Let's start with this bowl
of macaroni salad.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.056
If you were to reverse
a recipe for macaroni salad,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.256
you'll see it's made by mixing together
a bunch of ingredients,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.616
like macaroni, mayo,
vinegar, vegetables, and mustard.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.056
This type of combining
is called a mixture.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.296
When you make a mixture,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.416
you're combining
two or more things together

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.480
without actually changing
the chemical identity of those things.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.416
Like mud, for example.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.576
The soil and water in mud
haven't actually changed.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.376
They're still soil and water,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.776
you've just created
a mixture of soil and water -- mud.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.416
It turns out that macaroni salad
is actually a mixture of mixtures

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.176
because many of the ingredients,
like mayo and mustard,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.936
are already mixtures themselves,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.216
which is nice for us
because if we look closely,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.296
we'll the see the three main types
of mixtures that exist.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.536
The size of the particles in a mixture
determines the type of mixture.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.376
On one end of the scale is a suspension,
like our muddy water example.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.736
You get this if you take
big chunks of something

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.176
and mix it with something else
so those chunks are just floating around.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.896
Take runny mustard for example.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.776
You'll see a bunch of little particles

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.656
like mustard seeds, pepper,
allspice, and minced shallots

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.376
all floating around in a liquid,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.176
in this case vinegar with water.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.736
This is called a suspension

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.576
because you've got particles of one thing
suspended in another.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.056
Now, on the other end
of the spectrum is a solution.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.096
The particles in this
mixture are so small,

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.936
they are the actual molecules.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.416
A solution is sort of
like a suspension of molecules

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.096
where one type of molecule
is blended or dissolved with another.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.136
Vinegar is an example of a solution

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.376
where the molecules of acetic acid
are blended with molecules of water.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.096
The chemical properties
of the molecules haven't changed,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.016
they're just evenly mixed together now.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.016
Saltwater and carbonated soda
are both examples of solutions

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.336
where other molecules
are dissolved in water.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.816
The last type of mixture
is called a colloid,

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.616
which is somewhere
between a suspension and a solution.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.069
It's when you take two materials
that don't dissolve

00:02:17.093 --> 00:02:20.416
and you make the particles so small
that they can't separate.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.776
Mayo is what happens
when you take oil and water,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.016
which don't mix,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.376
and you bind them together,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.416
usually with the help
of another substance called an emulsifier.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.216
In the case of mayo,
it's lecithin, found in eggs.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.776
And now you are left
with really small globs of oil

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.496
hanging out with really
small droplets of water.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.536
Whipped cream, hairspray,
Styrofoam, and Jello

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.096
are all other examples of colloids.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.416
So, let's get back to macaroni salad.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.456
You've call colloids like mayo,
suspensions like mustard,

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.016
and solutions like vinegar,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.239
but you've also got celery, shallots,
and all other vegetable chunks

00:02:52.263 --> 00:02:53.794
that are also part of the salad.

00:02:53.818 --> 00:02:56.453
These aren't mixtures, really,
but we can break them up,

00:02:56.477 --> 00:02:57.962
just like a TV can be broken up

00:02:57.986 --> 00:03:00.296
into smaller and smaller
complex component parts.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.056
In the case of vegetables,
if you keep breaking things up,

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.656
they'll eventually end with thousands
of complex organic molecules,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.776
things like ATP synthase

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.056
and RNA transcriptase

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.280
and water.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.896
So now, once we've unblended
all the solutions,

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.056
unmixed all the colloids,
separated all the suspensions

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.016
and taken apart all of our vegetables,

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.536
we've reached the end
of what we can unmix physically.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.336
What we're left with
is a whole bunch of molecules,

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.096
and these molecules
remain chemically the same

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.978
whether they are by themselves
or thrown together in a salad.

00:03:33.002 --> 00:03:35.616
If you want to separate
these guys even further,

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.136
we need to unmix things chemically,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.160
which means we need to start
breaking some bonds.
