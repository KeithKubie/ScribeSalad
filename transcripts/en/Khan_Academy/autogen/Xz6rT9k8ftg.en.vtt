00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
 Let's solve a few word problems. 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.790
 They say 5% will be added this year. 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.830
 If your salary is $ 45,000, how much 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.960
 you had before the increase? 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.790
 Let's say my previous salary was x. 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.670
 x equals previous salary. 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.030
 And I'll add a 5% increase to this salary. 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:32.549
 So x + 5% zx, plus 5% · x ... that's my addition 

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:37.880
 here ... will be my new salary. 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.390
 Well, my new salary, they tell us how much it will be. 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.680
 It's $ 45,000. 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.850
 And let's see if we can do it a bit mathematically 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:47.500
 pohrát. 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.050
 5% is the same as 0.05, 5% 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.960
 Per cent literally means "out of a hundred." 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.580
 So it's the same as 5/100. 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:05.770
 This is 5%, out of 100, the same as 0.05 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.960
 So we can say it's the same as 1x plus ... 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:17.630
 I'll write it x beautifully ... 1x plus 0.05x is 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.230
 equal to 45000. 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.670
 1 of anything + 0.05 of the same thing. 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.550
 We can put coefficients together. 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.530
 So we add these two. 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.200
 So we get 1.05x equals 45000. 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:45.720
 And now we'll solve for x, divide both sides by 1.05 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.280
 Here it goes. 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.195
 And now we got x equals 45000 / 1.05 

00:01:54.195 --> 00:01:56.850
 And let's figure out how much it is. 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:04.820
 So 45 ... 1, 2, 3 ... 45000 dollars divided by 1.05 with 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.240
 equals $ 42,857. 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:18.160
 I'll say $ 42,857 again. 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.540
 This is your annual income for last year. 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.160
 Let's make sure it makes sense. 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.240
 Let's see if it works. 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.370
 So we'll check it out, we'll start with this 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.300
 Consider 5% 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.700
 So times 0.05 equals ... that's the increase I got 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.350
 plus old pay, plus 42857. 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.060
 And of course, we've rounded it up a bit, 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.500
 so it won't be exactly accurate. 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.020
 It equals almost $ 45,000. 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.280
 We have 14 cents less. 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.740
 So $ 45,000. 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.090
 That confirms the answer 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.100
 Let's do another one. 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.930
 It costs $ 250 ... I'll write it down here ... it costs $ 250 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.570
 put the carpet in room 14 on 18. 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.860
 How much will it cost to put a carpet in room 9 on 10? 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.700
 And the units here are tracks (1 foot is about 30.5 cm) 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.910
 Well, if you've never laid a rug, normally 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.910
 you lay the carpet according to the size of the room or 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.920
 by square feet of room. (For us by square meters). 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.000
 So what can we do?
