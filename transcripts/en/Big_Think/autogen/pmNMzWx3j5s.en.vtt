that every asthmatic

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380
that every asthmatic
 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.220
that every asthmatic
basically ends up with at least a

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230

the asthma care

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830
 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.629
it makes huge sense to have

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639
it makes huge sense to have
 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:52.950
it makes huge sense to have
as much alignment as you can possibly

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960
as much alignment as you can possibly
 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.739
as much alignment as you can possibly
get between the revenue stream and the

get between the revenue stream and the
 

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:59.219
get between the revenue stream and the
care delivery and and so we we need to

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229
care delivery and and so we we need to
 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.619

that's not what people want to buy today
 

00:12:12.039 --> 00:12:14.369
that's not what people want to buy today
and so the cell phone market is

00:12:14.369 --> 00:12:14.379
and so the cell phone market is
 

00:12:14.379 --> 00:12:16.019
and so the cell phone market is
constantly changing constantly improving

00:12:16.019 --> 00:12:16.029
constantly changing constantly improving
 

00:12:16.029 --> 00:12:17.849
constantly changing constantly improving
because they're rewarded by the change

00:12:17.849 --> 00:12:17.859
because they're rewarded by the change
 

00:12:17.859 --> 00:12:19.979
because they're rewarded by the change
they don't they're not changing because

00:12:19.979 --> 00:12:19.989
they don't they're not changing because
 

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:21.359
they don't they're not changing because
they like to change their changing

00:12:21.359 --> 00:12:21.369
they like to change their changing
 

00:12:21.369 --> 00:12:22.590
they like to change their changing
because they're trying to get to that

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:22.600
because they're trying to get to that
 

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.739
because they're trying to get to that
next market share because there's a win

00:12:25.739 --> 00:12:25.749
next market share because there's a win
 

00:12:25.749 --> 00:12:28.109
next market share because there's a win
for them by coming up with a better

00:12:28.109 --> 00:12:28.119
for them by coming up with a better
 

00:12:28.119 --> 00:12:30.359
for them by coming up with a better
phone they engineer the better phone

00:12:30.359 --> 00:12:30.369
phone they engineer the better phone
 

00:12:30.369 --> 00:12:32.729
phone they engineer the better phone
there is no win and healthcare right now

00:12:32.729 --> 00:12:32.739
there is no win and healthcare right now
 

00:12:32.739 --> 00:12:35.629
there is no win and healthcare right now
for coming up with a better outcome

00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:35.639
for coming up with a better outcome
 

00:12:35.639 --> 00:12:39.359
for coming up with a better outcome
there is no there's actually a loss and

00:12:39.359 --> 00:12:39.369
there is no there's actually a loss and
 

00:12:39.369 --> 00:12:41.369
there is no there's actually a loss and
so you've got to change that that has to

00:12:41.369 --> 00:12:41.379
so you've got to change that that has to
 

00:12:41.379 --> 00:12:43.859
so you've got to change that that has to
change and healthcare people are just as

00:12:43.859 --> 00:12:43.869
change and healthcare people are just as
 

00:12:43.869 --> 00:12:46.349
change and healthcare people are just as
smart as cell phone engineers so if you

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:46.359
smart as cell phone engineers so if you
 

00:12:46.359 --> 00:12:49.319
smart as cell phone engineers so if you
change that then the entire system will

00:12:49.319 --> 00:12:49.329
change that then the entire system will
 

00:12:49.329 --> 00:12:50.729
change that then the entire system will
follow that and that's where the change

00:12:50.729 --> 00:12:50.739
follow that and that's where the change
 

00:12:50.739 --> 00:12:52.979
follow that and that's where the change
has to happen and it's got to be in

00:12:52.979 --> 00:12:52.989
has to happen and it's got to be in
 

00:12:52.989 --> 00:12:54.419
has to happen and it's got to be in
rewarding a different set of outcomes

00:12:54.419 --> 00:12:54.429
rewarding a different set of outcomes
 

00:12:54.429 --> 00:12:57.380
rewarding a different set of outcomes
and then

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:57.390
and then
 

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:00.480
and then
people will organize differently put

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:00.490
people will organize differently put
 

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.250
people will organize differently put
toolkits in place to get to those

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:02.260
toolkits in place to get to those
 

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.650
toolkits in place to get to those
outfits
