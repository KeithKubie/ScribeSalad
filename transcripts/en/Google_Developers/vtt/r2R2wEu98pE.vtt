00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.406
CHRISTOPHE BAROUX: Good.

00:00:15.406 --> 00:00:17.520
Hello, everybody.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.530
After this long and very
interesting technical session

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.710
from Alfredo, I'm going to talk
to you a little bit about

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.680
what we see in terms of
a mobile and gaming

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.950
applications, what are the
trends and what are the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.409
solutions we have here.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:37.940
And after that, Bastian will
dig a little bit more in

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.590
details, in technical details.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.730
So as Alfredo did, I'm
going to introduce

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.210
myself a little bit.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.020
My name is Christophe.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.800
I've been working in the cloud
for about four years now.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.820
I work on business
development.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.630
I'm only 50% Italian.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.000
This is what explains the fact
that I don't speak Italian

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.400
today, even if it's one
of my long term goals.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.100
So sorry, and forgive
me for that.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.540
This is my email address.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.940
So if you need to contact me,
do not hesitate, of course.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.510
How many of you are now working
or want to develop a

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.600
mobile or gaming application?

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.060
Can you raise your hands?

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.490
OK, so maybe 30% of
the attendants.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.200
Good.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.070
So those are the trends
that we see in mobile.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:47.670
What we see first is the
consolidation of applications

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.410
coming from laptops
going mobile.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.180
So just to give you some
examples, we have partners

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.080
today that tell us they want
to stop developing

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.640
applications that run on
laptops, and they want to

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.580
focus on applications built
for mobile devices.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.830
So this is one of the things.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.330
In terms of trends, what we
also see is development of

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.220
back ends for mobile
applications.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.360
And I can tell it's taking
a lot of energy, a lot of

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.100
investment at Google Cloud
platform to enable you to use

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.940
Cloud platform as a back end.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.570
So we are investing quite
heavily on this.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.020
And we'll talk about
it also later.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.350
Monetization.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.630
This is something that is
growing very fast for our own

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.760
mobile apps.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.050
I will also explain a little
bit later how you can use

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.140
Google solutions to monetize
your apps.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.390
And you will see
some examples.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.040
Also apps powered by your back
end, what we see is that they

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.030
are more engaging?

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.340
Why?

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.660
Because it enables to give more
services to your users.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.440
It's different to a static
app because you have more

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.210
interactions.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.040
And also you're able to push
more services, more

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.110
information, of course.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.950
And, of course, I think
this is something you

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.450
experience every day.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.650
What we see is that usage
for mobile apps is

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.610
growing very fast.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.080
So this is the value proposition
we bring to you,

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.700
we bring to our partners for
mobile applications.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.320
First, meet your needs, what
we do with cloud platform.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.310
And you may see often this.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.100
What we bring is different
technology bricks and

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.290
technology layers to enable
you to focus on your

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.180
application.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.137
The idea is that you get rid of
the heavy lifting, and you

00:03:46.137 --> 00:03:49.940
let Google manage and
run it for you.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.320
Start easily.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.080
So developing and running an
application on App Engine, for

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.560
instance, is a very easy.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.380
You can keep using development
tools you are used to, upload

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.360
your code in App Engine, and
have App Engine run it for you

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.000
and, for instance, manage
scalability for you.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.610
Pay as you go.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.660
This is also something
which is very

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.330
interesting for start ups.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.200
As I said before, we
offer free quotas.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.590
And this free quota enables
you, for instance, to make

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.370
your developments, to start
testing, to start having your

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.790
first users.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.260
And you will start paying when
you experience success.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.900
That is the idea actually.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.530
So you can launch a lot
of applications.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.910
Maybe you will fail.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.280
But as we say, you can fail,
you can fail often, but you

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.430
can't fail fast.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.690
And at some point in time
you will succeed.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.260
And then you will
start paying.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.380
So you can take the risk.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.670
Last week I was in
San Francisco.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.560
We took some customers to visit
our briefing center.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.010
And there was somebody from
Google who was working on our

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.430
internal project.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.120
He said that 80% of innovative
ideas fail.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.710
So I think Cloud platform is a
good platform to start and to

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.660
test innovations.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.790
You can fail.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.010
It doesn't really matter,
because for this it

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.720
won't cost a lot.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.670
Distribution, very important as
well, in particular for, as

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.490
I said, new kinds
of applications.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.400
Because with distribution you
can bring new services like

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.650
push, for instance.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.970
I mentioned focus on your app.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.450
The idea is to benefit from the
right environment and also

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.560
self manage environment
to fuel your

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.670
application and grow fast.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.950
You never know when you're
going to meet success.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.430
As soon as possible,
of course.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.350
But when you meet success, then
maybe you will jump from

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.690
about 1,000 users
to 1 million.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.290
And then you need to
build on a platform

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:11.540
that is going to scale.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:21.550
So App Engine is, from my
point of view, the right

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.250
solution to enable to deliver
dynamic content, mobile

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:34.070
applications, and gaming to a
million or billion users.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.100
What we think at Google is
that when you launch an

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.670
application, you must have
in mind that it has to be

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.700
designed, and it has
to be ready to

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.130
serve 1 billion people.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.390
This is why we have designed
App Engine.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:56.990
And I think you can really bet
on this platform and use it

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.880
during the whole life cycle
of your application.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.960
To give you another example,
App Engine is the platform

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.330
that we use for our
internal portal.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:13.750
So most of Google applications
today run on App Engine.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:19.350
So this is what we've seen
today in terms of what is

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.130
necessary for a mobile
application.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.980
First, as I said, it has to
scale without effort.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.330
So it means that you don't have
to hire new people to

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.620
manage routers, servers, cable,
that kind of thing.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.910
It has to be easy to use, as
I said, no more staff.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.670
You need high performance.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:47.630
So high performance means high
service level agreements, also

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:54.080
the ability to launch new VMs
to meet requests, for

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.140
instance, when you
need to scale.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.710
And also you need a pricing
model that is going to be

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:06.090
aligned on the activity
of your business.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:07.450
About those two last points--

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.960
high performance services,
service level

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.780
agreements, and pricing--

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.530
you can launch App Engine,
of course, going to

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.550
cloud.google.com.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:25.000
But if you're interested to
have a higher level of

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.010
support, you can also contact
us on the website and ask to

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.510
have more support.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:35.320
We offer different
kinds of support.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.610
There is the, let's say, default
support which is

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.400
called bronze.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.310
We also have silver,
gold, and platinum.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:48.610
So, for instance, if you want
to launch a new business

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:53.590
critical application, you may be
interested to have 24 hour

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:54.970
by 7 support.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.520
So this is the service
we offer.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.770
Just go on the website.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.820
Cloud Storage can be
used as well, for

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.440
instance, for static games.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:11.510
So if you want to launch a game
that users will upload,

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.930
you can simply use
cloud storage.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:16.030
It's very easy to use.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:19.670
It's REST API based.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:23.040
You will experience low
latency and low cost.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.020
Why low latency?

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:28.820
Because it's based in using
Google network, which is one

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.210
of the biggest networks
and biggest private

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.180
networks in the world.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:40.280
Something we see more and more
is analytics for mobile and

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.530
gaming applications.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.220
How many of you are already
using analytics for

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:47.970
applications?

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.720
Can you raise your hands?

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.950
OK, so a little bit less than
the people who are interested

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.550
in mobile apps.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:10:00.180
What we see, for instance, in
gaming is the fact that our

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.220
partners are interested to
understand what is the

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:08.900
behavior of their users, how far
they go in the different

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:14.940
level of the games, when they
make what is called in-app

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.070
purchasing.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:21.930
So the idea is that you are
able to link what your

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.600
customers are doing, what
they're experiencing, and when

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.280
they are buying, for instance,
new weapons in a game.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.570
So using analytics,
it's very easy.

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.490
It's very fast to link this

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:34.920
information and to make decisions.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.840
So, for instance, at a certain
level in a game, should I make

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.280
things a little bit
easier so that my

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.790
players can move forward?

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.350
To manage and to perform
analytics, you can use

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.905
different solutions.

00:10:48.905 --> 00:10:51.280
The first one is Google
Analytics.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.670
And also we offer Big Query.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.615
We'll talk about it later.

00:10:55.615 --> 00:11:00.170
So Big Query is a fast
request tool.

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:04.630
And you can also run Hadoop
and MapReduce either on

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.320
Compute Engine or
on App Engine.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:17.190
For mobile apps, another trend
is the fact of providing

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:19.310
personalized applications.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:26.140
So we offer user APIs, which
enable you to authenticate

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:31.600
your users in order to give
them personalized content.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.550
And you can also use Cloud
Endpoints to deliver services,

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:39.580
Google Accounts that can be
linked with user APIs.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.640
And you can also, of course,
use Google Play to deliver

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.790
your applications and also to
monetize your application.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.850
Push notifications, of course,
they are very important to

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:55.880
deliver new information,
new services.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.270
What's important to have in
mind is that with Cloud

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:03.640
Platform, you can do it for,
of course, Android and also

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.093
for iOS applications.

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.740
And what we also see is that
more and more applications

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:14.740
need to use geolocation.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.510
And, of course, we are
for Google Maps.

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:22.570
And you have the Search API,
which enables you to integrate

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:24.455
maps in your mobile
application.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.310
Another service which is part of
Cloud Platform that you may

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:34.320
not have heard about it,
it's Google Translate.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.570
So Google Translate, as its name
indicates, enables us to

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:42.850
translate, very fast, text.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:47.280
So it's like Google Translate on
the web, but you can use it

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.350
using an API to translate what's
in your application,

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:52.560
what's on a website.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:58.880
It's used by a lot of websites
in travel, for instance.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.990
Google Play, I think you
all know Google Play.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:08.710
So very easy to deliver
applications, to monetize your

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:09.960
applications.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.560
So this is a simple
presentation, [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.260
presentation of Cloud Platform
that Umberto presented before.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.730
The two main components
are Compute Engine.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:27.020
So this is infrastructure
as a service.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.730
Somebody asked a question
before about location.

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.510
So I think Umberto told it.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:35.420
But I want to reemphasize
this point.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.440
With Compute Engine, App Engine,
and also the other

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.390
services, you can locate your
application, your data, in the

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:44.210
European Union.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:48.210
More precisely, it's
based in Belgium.

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:53.120
And there are also two other
services which are important.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.480
Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.950
And there is also a new one
that was announced at I/O

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:03.800
about one month ago, which is
cloud data store, which is a

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:08.400
NoSQL database, and some
other services.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.760
And Bastian will cover
that later.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:20.470
So this is an example of a
mobile gaming architecture we

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:22.850
can implement.

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:27.580
So as you see, the idea with
Cloud Endpoints is that you

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:32.360
bring applications for iOS and
Android with cloud endpoints

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:32.795
and globally.

00:14:32.795 --> 00:14:38.460
Using Cloud Platform as a
mobile back end, you can

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:42.900
concentrate on developing
the clients for Android.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:46.460
All the rest is managed
by Cloud Platform.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:51.920
So it can be App Engine, and you
can also use sub features

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:56.770
of App Engine, like scheduling
tasks, queues, for instance.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:00.290
And you can also use Compute
Engine to deliver, as I said

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:04.710
before, analytics and big data,
for instance, running

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:08.370
Hadoop if you want to make
statistics on your users and

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.150
what they are doing.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:15.640
And you can also use Big Query
for fast, SQL requests.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.920
So this is another example.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.690
The idea is that you can use
Cloud Platform, you can use

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:24.160
the different bricks, to build
the right architecture for

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.900
your game or your mobile app.

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.920
Some customer stories.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.620
So, Pulse, actually they
were bought maybe one

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.390
month ago by LinkedIn.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:39.270
Pulse have used Cloud
Platform.

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.400
Umberto mentioned it before.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.950
And they were able to cope with
a very huge increase in

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:45.590
terms of users.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:50.350
Philips, they have launched
a new product.

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:54.580
It's a bulb light product.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:59.130
And you can use a mobile
application, which is here, to

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:01.350
manage the light
in your house.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:05.770
So for instance, if you went on
holidays to Capri, and you

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:09.540
like the picture there and the
light, you can upload the

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:13.970
picture, and then the lights,
the bulbs, will deliver the

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:19.020
same light that you had on
the beach where you went.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:24.700
It was sold in Apple stores
in the US about Christmas.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.800
It was a huge success.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.580
All of them were sold.

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:32.410
And this app runs on App
Engine, actually.

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:35.500
Some other examples.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.510
This company, I think they're
based in Sweden.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.700
Those guys are based
in France.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.600
This one maybe in the US.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.830
The idea also is that if you
run an application on App

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:50.380
Engine, it enables you to
be global very fast.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:54.630
And I think you can also use the
other services from Google

00:16:54.630 --> 00:17:02.140
like Google+ or social network
to talk about your application

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.900
to increase market awareness.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:11.609
OK, so in a nutshell we're
happy to help you perform

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:12.180
different things.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.359
First, reduce time to market.

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:18.450
We think that using App Engine
you can reduce the time and

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:23.550
also the cost to deliver your
mobile app by 30%, because, as

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:28.800
I said before, all the mobile
and the gaming back end is

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.440
already prepared.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.440
You can start for free.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:40.680
So if you have Python, PHP,
Java, go to cloud.goolge.com

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.560
and start using it.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.850
It will be free.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:46.980
Focus on apps, of course,
be ready for scale,

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.230
and pay as you go.

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:57.960
So as a conclusion, we're
happy to have

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:01.240
you test Cloud Platform.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:05.756
We think it's the right
architecture for developers.

00:18:05.756 --> 00:18:09.010
So test it and come
back to us.

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:10.400
You have my email.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.230
Tell us what you have
experienced.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.950
You can focus on your app.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:19.800
And also what we want to bring
to you is the R&amp;D and the

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.370
innovation from Google.

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:26.290
For about 15 years we've been
working on platforms that

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:31.890
power, of course, google.com,
that power YouTube.

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:35.085
And we're continuously working
on them, on performance, of

00:18:35.085 --> 00:18:37.580
course, but on security.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.250
And you will be able to benefit
from all of this R&amp;D

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.500
over the time.

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:46.400
Do you have some questions?

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.470
Otherwise, I'm going to talk a
little bit about monetization.

00:18:51.215 --> 00:18:52.574
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:18:52.574 --> 00:18:54.740
You have the user API separate
from Google account.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.080
I thought they were
one and the same.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.330
Or is there a separate
user API?

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:04.890
CHRISTOPHE BAROUX: This user
API is linked with a Google

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:06.290
account, yes.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:10.570
OK.

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:12.930
So let's talk a little bit
about monetization.

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:15.910
Are you familiar with
monetization?

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:16.310
No.

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:20.150
So the idea is that with Cloud
Platform, you can build your

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:23.000
application, you can run your
application, you can store

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.300
your data, you can
analyze the data.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.720
But at some point in time,
depending on the application

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.240
you want to launch,
you may also be

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.470
interested to make money.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:39.430
OK so this is also services that
Google provides, how to

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:43.020
help our partners monetize and
make money, of course.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:48.340
So those are some examples of
our partners and customers.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:52.060
The idea is that for an app
developer, you can make money

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.230
doing different things.

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:58.800
You can advertise or monetize,
and you can make sales or make

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.380
transactions in a way, OK?

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:05.020
So if you want to advertise, it
can be in app advertising.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.060
It can be search.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.550
It can be on display.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:13.130
And for sales, you can
sale virtual goods.

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.560
You can sell physical goods.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.710
What's important also is that
those two sectors are growing

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.670
fast and growing a lot.

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:29.170
So you see the growth,
plus 360%, plus 160%,

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:32.860
from 2012 to 2016.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:36.860
So it's really interesting for
you as a developer to have a

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.110
look at [INAUDIBLE]
monetization.

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:45.900
Google offers several services
and products to monetize and

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.170
to make transactions.

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:54.840
So we offer what's called DFP,
Double Click for Publishers,

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.340
Double Click Ad Exchange.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.740
We also offer AdMob.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:03.090
So AdMob is the fact of putting
advertising on a

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:05.460
mobile application.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:10.890
And for sales you can use Google
Play and Google Wallet.

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:12.970
And we also offer
carrier billing

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.220
for some other purpose.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:22.810
So, yes, in app display
is probably what we're

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:24.810
interested in today.

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:27.540
The idea is that you
put advertising

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.600
in the app, of course.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.850
So the idea is that the idea of
advertising is embedded in

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:37.540
the mobile application.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:43.880
And then the business model is
based around the fact that the

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:47.290
monetization will be done either
on a cost per click.

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:53.790
So the ad is displayed on the
application, and when a user

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.590
clicks on the ad, then you
will receive money.

00:21:56.590 --> 00:22:00.330
Or it can also be used
on a cost per mille.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:05.520
That is to say when 1,000 people
look at your ad, then

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.510
you monetize, and
you get money.

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:12.390
So some kind of typical
applications for this can be,

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:13.880
of course, gaming.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:17.900
So for instance, in France we
have a partner that is using

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:18.790
Cloud Platform.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:21.280
They are called Magma Mobile.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:26.180
What they make, they only
make free gaming.

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:29.165
I think for the last three
years, they have launched

00:22:29.165 --> 00:22:31.730
about 50 games.

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:35.490
And they make money with
this, cost per click

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:37.010
and cost per mille.

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:40.670
OK, they are quite simple games,
kind of games you play

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:44.570
in the metro or when you
don't know what to do.

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:49.150
But using this, AdMob,
it's very efficient.

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:54.810
So just to give you an example,
let's take an app.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:05.775
Once they show the ad 100,000
times, they have a click

00:23:05.775 --> 00:23:09.455
through rate of 1.5%,
which is not a lot.

00:23:09.455 --> 00:23:13.950
It gives them 1,500 clicks.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:21.940
And what they get in terms
of price is $0.10.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:26.200
It will bring them
$150 of revenue.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.610
So you see, if, of course,
you're able to increase the

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:31.680
number of impressions, if you
have other mobile or gaming

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:35.880
applications, you can grow the
revenue significantly.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:41.060
So we have some customers that
are able to make some millions

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:45.810
of euros in terms of revenue
using monetization.

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:51.320
This is an example, a company
called LevelUp Studio.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.210
It's a small company.

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:53.490
It's a developer company.

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:55.570
They have four people.

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:59.350
They sell gadgets like this.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:07.370
And they've been able to make $1
million of revenue selling

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:11.420
their small apps.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:17.750
They were sold about $2.00
on Google Play.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:21.660
So this gives an idea of how you
can benefit from the scale

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:25.920
of Google Play and app engine
and also with our solution in

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.170
terms of monetization.

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:33.720
So the idea is quite simple.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.090
If you want to enable
monetization, you need to

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:39.040
determine your business model.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.160
You can use Google Play.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.660
And then you can either
advertise or make sales.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.010
And actually, you
can make both.

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:48.850
We have some customers that
make transactions.

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:51.900
They sell physical goods
for some time, and

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.390
they'll also monetize.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:56.550
So at some point, if you
experience the fact that the

00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:01.740
customer may not buy your
product, you can decide to

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:06.350
send ads in order to make
money on the ad spot.

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:13.310
So in terms of implementation,
the idea is that first you

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:14.560
open an AdMob account.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.970
You can do it on our
website, of course.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.860
You create your app entry
within the platform.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:24.860
There is an AdMob SDK, and you
have to integrate the AdMob

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.430
SDK in your app.

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:29.690
And there is what we call an ad
unit that you must put in

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:32.170
the code of your app and
you're ready to go.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:40.870
We have a team in Italy, of
course, in Milan, where

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.940
Alfredo and Umberto are based.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:47.850
And we also have a team that is
focused on monetization and

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:49.050
transaction.

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:51.720
So actually Maurizio could
not be here today.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:55.870
But if you have more questions
on how to monetize your apps,

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:57.720
you can contact him.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.550
So thank you.

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.207
I don't know if you have
any more questions.

00:26:01.207 --> 00:26:10.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:12.120
CHRISTOPHE BAROUX:
No question?

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.870
Bastian?

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:14.970
Alfredo?

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:16.220
Thank you, everybody.
