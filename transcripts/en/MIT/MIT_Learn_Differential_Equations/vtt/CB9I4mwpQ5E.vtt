00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.550
GILBERT STRANG: OK.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.950
We're still talking about first
order differential equations

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.290
with a dy dt.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:16.070
And there is still a gross term
proportional to the balance.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.410
This might be the interest
that's added on to y.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.525
And then there is
input, a source term,

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:30.610
of deposits being
made all the time.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.380
So I'm looking to solve
that differential equation.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.830
And this is the best
possible function

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.190
for differential equations.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.650
Exponentials.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.590
Because the derivative of
exponential is exponential.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.960
It's just easiest to work with.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.310
And the output, the
solution is called

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.170
the exponential response.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.840
That word response says what
comes out when e to the st

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.880
goes in.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:04.310
And as before, we have some
starting deposit, y of 0.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.920
Initial condition at time 0.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.710
OK.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.600
Here is the key point, that
with this nice source function,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.570
the solution, or one solution,
a particular solution,

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.040
will be just a multiple of e
to the st. So all I have to do

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.250
is find that number, capital
Y, and I've got a solution

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.560
to that equation.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.460
How do I do it?

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.770
Substitute this
into the equation

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.450
and solve for Y.
So let's do that.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.180
The derivative of this, the
derivative of exponential

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.250
will bring down a factor s.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.210
So there'll be a ys e to
the st from the derivative.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.365
And that will have
to equal a times Y

00:01:52.365 --> 00:01:59.300
e to the st, plus the source
term e to the st. good?

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.280
I just substituted it in.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.220
Now, the nice thing, I
cancel, I divide by e

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.660
to the st, which is never 0.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.970
So I divide by-- factor out
e to the st, factor that out.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.140
It just leaves me with a 1.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.950
So I have Y times s,
Y times a, plus 1.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.700
So let me write that
equation so you see it.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.070
That's just s minus
a times Y is 1.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.810
Right?

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.050
I took a times Y and put it on
the left side of the equation.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.250
So I've discovered the
exponential response.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.180
1 over s minus a.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.900
OK.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.050
So I have a solution
to the equation.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.840
That's not the end,
because that solution won't

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.250
match the initial condition.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.300
So how do I match an
initial condition?

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.110
What I've found is a
particular solution,

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.620
and I need also the null
solution, the homogeneous

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.490
solution.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:11.490
So the full solution, y of
t, is this Y particular.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.350
So capital Y, I
now know is that.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.610
So I have an e to
the st over-- I'm

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.520
putting in Y, the
right value of Y.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.150
So that's the particular
solution that I've found.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.200
Plus any null solution.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.220
So remember, the null
solutions, that term is gone.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.920
So the source is 0.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.600
That's why the word null.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.320
So I'm looking for the
solution to dy dt equal ay.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.595
And the solutions
to dy dt equal ay

00:03:46.595 --> 00:03:52.930
are e to the at,
times any number.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.680
Because the right-hand
side is 0 now.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.100
This is y particular.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.370
And let me write that.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.540
This is y particular, and this
is y null, or y homogeneous.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.180
So that's the general solution.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.400
The complete solution
has that form.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.940
And now I can match y
equal y of 0 at t equal 0.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:25.770
I put in t equal 0, I get y of 0
equals-- t equals 0, this is 1.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.770
So 1 over s minus a.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.360
And when t is 0,
this is 1, so plus C.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.120
So now I know what C is.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.880
And notice, C is not just y of
0, as sometimes in the past.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.750
C is y of 0 minus this.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.930
Are you ready now for
the complete solution

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.200
with satisfying the
initial conditions?

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.930
So now I'm going to--
this in the correct form.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.520
This tells me what C has to be.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.050
So I put it in and I
have this solution.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:13.820
y of t is e the st over s minus
a, the easy one, plus C. Now,

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:20.330
C is y of 0 minus
1 over s minus a.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.380
That's what we needed.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.520
Times e to the at.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.550
That's our answer.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.890
That's our answer.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.800
I can make it look
a little nicer.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.990
I want to.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.460
I want to separate out the y
of 0 part, the part that's just

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.950
growing from the
initial condition,

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.650
from the part that is
coming from the source term.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.980
So I just want to put
that together with this.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.640
So I have the same
s minus a below.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.830
Here is an e to the st above.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:05.260
And I have a minus, that 1 over
s minus a, times e to the at.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:11.400
And then I have this
term, which is growing.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.120
Well, this is really good.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.540
This is the part growing
out of the initial deposit.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:28.470
I'm using, again, money in a
bank with additional deposits,

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.500
e to the st. And this
is the part coming

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.160
from those later deposits.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.770
Initial part, and the
part coming from there.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.260
So this is, again,
a null solution.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.110
A multiple of e to the at.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.400
This is another
particular solution.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.370
Remember, there isn't just
one particular solution.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.000
Any solution is a
particular solution.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.470
And this is, I call that the
very particular solution.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:04.080
Because it has the nice
property that it starts from 0.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.440
So a t equals 0, that's
1 minus 1, I'm getting 0.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.500
So I would call that y vp.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.800
I'll introduce those letters,
not standard, for that part.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:23.080
And then y homogeneous,
or y null, is this part.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.420
OK.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.550
Problem solved.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:32.010
The exponential
grows in this way,

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:36.800
and the initial condition
grows directly that way.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.300
OK.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.960
The problem is solved
with one exception.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.430
And now I have to take a
minute with that exception.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:52.920
The exception is the formula
breaks down if s equals a.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:56.370
If s equals a,
I'm dividing by 0.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.310
My formula is falling apart.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.530
And that's the
case of resonance.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:11.470
So let me put over
here, s equal a.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.010
That resonance.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:18.160
And we always have
to expect that that's

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.450
a possibility, that
we're putting money

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:28.570
with the same exponential as
the natural growth of the money,

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.380
or whatever we're growing.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.970
And our formula has to change.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.640
You what you might
say it's infinite,

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.240
because I'm dividing by 0.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:45.680
But notice the part
above is also 0.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:52.230
If s equals a, this is e to
the st minus e to the at.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:53.930
Those are the same.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:57.680
So I have a 0/0 situation.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.980
My formula is breaking
down, but it isn't dying.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.240
It needs more thinking.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.850
The case of resonance
needs to-- I

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:14.030
have to understand what
this is when s equals a.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.370
Let me tell you what it is.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.780
And then show you why.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.530
So this is the case s equal a.

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:33.810
So if s equal a, then y very
particular plus y null space.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.610
So it's this very
particular solution that

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.580
has to have a different form.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.620
And here's the form it gets.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.670
A factor t appears.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:48.090
You just learn to recognize
resonance by that factor t.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:52.700
So it'll be a t e to the at.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.950
a is the same as s now,
so s doesn't appear.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:00.510
So that's the solution
which starts from 0,

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:04.040
and it comes from the input.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:13.330
And this is the part that
starts from y of 0 and grows.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:17.330
So you see, eventually, this
is going to be the bigger one.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.880
The resonant case,
it grows like e

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.950
to the at, with that little
bit extra growth of t.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:26.920
OK.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.490
So now I have a solution
in that special case

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.264
also, when s equals a.

00:10:33.264 --> 00:10:34.530
All right.

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:39.820
Do you want to know how
this comes out of this

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:43.390
as s approaches a?

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.500
Let me take three minutes
to tell you about that.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.410
It's L'Hopital's rule.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.380
Do you remember
from calculus, 0/0,

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:55.200
the way to deal with that was
called by this guy's name,

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:55.700
L'Hopital?

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.460
Hospital, I guess.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:04.350
Probably hospital in French.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:10.820
And you this 0/0 expression.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.520
It's a ratio of two things.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:17.160
The top going to 0
when s goes to a,

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.770
because these become the same.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:22.190
The bottom going to
0 when s goes to a.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.000
And the right--
L'Hopital's cool idea

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.830
was you get the same
answer if you take

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:32.640
the ratio of the derivatives.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.570
So L'Hopital says,
take the ratio

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:46.050
of the derivatives of the top
minus the derivative-- oh,

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:50.170
divided by the
derivative of the bottom.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:54.401
And then let s go
to a in the end.

00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:54.900
OK.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.750
So I have to take
this derivative,

00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:00.230
I have to take that
derivative with respect to s.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:03.880
Often in calculus, it was an x.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.800
Here it's an s.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.070
No big deal.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.960
So that derivative is--
You take the derivative

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.190
with respect to s.

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:14.240
We'll bring down--
ah, here comes the t.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:20.310
The derivative of
s is t e to the st.

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:24.680
And the derivative
of this thing is 1.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.540
And now I let s go to a.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.740
Well, it's easy to
let s go to a now.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:36.390
This thing approaches that.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.890
I have the t e of
the at in the limit.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:43.660
So L'Hopital's
rule was the reason

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:47.390
behind this formula
for resonance.

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:52.720
But again, I emphasize
that expect a factor t

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.620
when you have this resonance.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:56.170
OK.

00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:00.880
So that's the solution for the
best possible right-hand side

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.480
e to the st. Well, maybe
the best is a constant.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.110
Second simplest
is an exponential.

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:10.910
Next, will come
sines and cosigns.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:12.660
That's the next lecture.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.210
Thanks.
