00:00:00.484 --> 00:00:02.447
- It is believed that the first humans

00:00:02.447 --> 00:00:05.882
settled North and South
America, or began to settle it,

00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:10.049
about 15 to 16,000 years ago
and the mainstream theory

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.919
is that they came across
from northeast Asia,

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:20.723
across the Bering Strait, during
the last glaciation period,

00:00:20.723 --> 00:00:24.909
when sea levels were lower
and there was a land bridge,

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:28.704
the famous Bering Land Bridge
connecting the two continents

00:00:28.704 --> 00:00:31.045
and we have archeological
evidence of humans

00:00:31.045 --> 00:00:34.878
in southern Chile as
early as 14,500 years ago

00:00:36.134 --> 00:00:40.301
and as well in Florida as
early as 14,500 years ago.

00:00:41.457 --> 00:00:45.624
So humans had migrated into,
and settled in the Americas

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:50.497
many, many, many thousands of years ago.

00:00:50.497 --> 00:00:52.842
And like other places in the world,

00:00:52.842 --> 00:00:56.263
they followed similar
development patterns.

00:00:56.263 --> 00:00:58.724
The first evidence we
have of the development

00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:02.745
of agriculture in the
Americas is about seven

00:01:02.745 --> 00:01:06.254
to eight or nine thousand years ago

00:01:06.254 --> 00:01:09.462
so once again, it coincides
with when agriculture,

00:01:09.462 --> 00:01:13.436
we believe, started to emerge
in other parts of the world.

00:01:13.436 --> 00:01:15.245
And the more archeological evidence

00:01:15.245 --> 00:01:17.327
we find, we'll probably find dates that go

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:19.500
even further back than that, in fact,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.720
I've seen some that go eight,
nine thousand years ago.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.059
Now one misconception,
significant misconception,

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:31.078
about the Americas is that
when the Europeans colonized,

00:01:31.078 --> 00:01:34.373
remember Columbus comes sailing in 1492,

00:01:34.373 --> 00:01:38.092
looking for the East Indies
and then he bumps into this,

00:01:38.092 --> 00:01:40.616
he actually doesn't bump
into the whole continent,

00:01:40.616 --> 00:01:43.130
he bumps into an island
that's close to the continent,

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.345
but with that you start
having the beginning

00:01:45.345 --> 00:01:48.392
of the European colonization
of the Americas,

00:01:48.392 --> 00:01:51.501
roughly the last 500 years,
and one misconception

00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:54.234
that folks often have
is, well it was maybe

00:01:54.234 --> 00:01:58.307
sparsely populated, mainly by
hunter-gatherer nomadic people

00:01:58.307 --> 00:02:01.944
and nothing could be
further from the truth.

00:02:01.944 --> 00:02:05.743
The modern estimates of the
population of the Americas

00:02:05.743 --> 00:02:08.604
at the time of the European colonization,

00:02:08.604 --> 00:02:12.271
roughly around 1500 is
50-100 million people

00:02:17.425 --> 00:02:18.895
and to put that in perspective,

00:02:18.895 --> 00:02:23.105
so that's right around
there, that's about 10 to 20%

00:02:23.105 --> 00:02:25.529
of the world population at that time.

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:27.128
The world population at that time

00:02:27.128 --> 00:02:31.770
was about 500 million people
and given that the Americas is

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.937
about one third of the land,
if you don't count Antarctica,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.090
it's not that different
of a population density

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.322
than the other continents,
and we have significant cities

00:02:44.322 --> 00:02:48.061
that were in place in
the pre-Columbian era,

00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:51.910
in the era before Columbus
and the European colonization.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.111
For example, you might
have heard of the Aztecs,

00:02:56.111 --> 00:02:59.501
this really, the core, the Mexica people,

00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:03.418
the Mexica tribe, in many
ways the foundations,

00:03:04.792 --> 00:03:08.792
of the Mexican people
pre-European colonization.

00:03:10.587 --> 00:03:14.061
You might also be familiar
with the Mayan civilization,

00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:18.039
one of the longest lasting
civilizations in, actually,

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:21.132
in history, they're famous for
one of the earliest cultures

00:03:21.132 --> 00:03:24.575
where we have the hieroglyphics,
where we have writing.

00:03:24.575 --> 00:03:27.806
You're probably familiar
with the Inca Empire

00:03:27.806 --> 00:03:29.938
and yes, that is me on a recent trip

00:03:29.938 --> 00:03:31.887
and at the time of the Inca Empire

00:03:31.887 --> 00:03:35.130
it is believed that it was
possibly the largest empire

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.610
on the earth at that time,
incredibly complex structures

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.414
and social structures, they had.

00:03:42.414 --> 00:03:44.121
Now what's often less talked about

00:03:44.121 --> 00:03:47.104
are things like the Mississippian culture,

00:03:47.104 --> 00:03:50.673
which was in North
America right over here.

00:03:50.673 --> 00:03:53.249
The Mississippi River is named for them.

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:55.576
This if their famous city of Cahokia

00:03:55.576 --> 00:03:58.348
near St. Louis and in there, in that peak,

00:03:58.348 --> 00:04:01.592
it would have 40,000 people in it.

00:04:01.592 --> 00:04:03.875
Around the world at that time,

00:04:03.875 --> 00:04:05.617
at the time of the Mississippian culture,

00:04:05.617 --> 00:04:07.390
there weren't many cities in the world

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.818
that had 40,000 people,
so it wasn't these,

00:04:10.818 --> 00:04:13.984
just hunter-gatherers and
people who were nomadic,

00:04:13.984 --> 00:04:16.881
there were sophisticated civilizations,

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:21.785
with sophisticated cultures
and dense population centers

00:04:21.785 --> 00:04:25.868
and it had also been in
place for a long time,

00:04:25.868 --> 00:04:29.256
similar, in timeframe, to
some of the great ancient

00:04:29.256 --> 00:04:31.763
civilizations that we see in Mesopotamia,

00:04:31.763 --> 00:04:34.346
the Indus Valley, and in China.

00:04:35.432 --> 00:04:38.805
For example, the oldest
civilization we know of,

00:04:38.805 --> 00:04:43.102
in Mesoamerica, is the Olmec civilization,

00:04:43.102 --> 00:04:47.064
right over here, here's a few
of their artifacts they have.

00:04:47.064 --> 00:04:50.897
If we go into the Andes,
near modern day Peru,

00:04:52.916 --> 00:04:57.269
we have the Chavin
culture, right over there.

00:04:57.269 --> 00:04:59.201
As you can see, a lot of these cultures,

00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:00.839
at least the ones that I'm putting here,

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:03.081
and this is just a sample,
I'm sampling some around

00:05:03.081 --> 00:05:05.407
North America, some around Mesoamerica,

00:05:05.407 --> 00:05:09.734
and some in the Andes, and then
you can even go further back

00:05:09.734 --> 00:05:13.151
and you can go to the Caral civilization,

00:05:14.635 --> 00:05:17.895
and what's really interesting
about the Caral civilization

00:05:17.895 --> 00:05:21.073
is some archeologists call
this the first civilization

00:05:21.073 --> 00:05:23.215
and it's unclear whether they had,

00:05:23.215 --> 00:05:25.830
whether they farmed grains and cereals

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.115
that we often associate
with civilizations, they use

00:05:28.115 --> 00:05:30.970
their surplus crops to have a
more specialized labor force,

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.053
but they were a maritime
culture, even today

00:05:33.053 --> 00:05:36.841
the coast of Peru is a
significant source of all of the,

00:05:36.841 --> 00:05:39.245
or a good chunk of the
seafood in the world

00:05:39.245 --> 00:05:41.135
but a significant culture developed there,

00:05:41.135 --> 00:05:44.835
these are the remnants of their pyramids,

00:05:44.835 --> 00:05:49.601
and they developed, we believe,
in the 4th millennium BCE,

00:05:49.601 --> 00:05:51.267
so this is around the same time

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:55.766
as when Egypt first got
unified around Menes, by Menes,

00:05:55.766 --> 00:05:59.599
or you have the first
Sumerians in Mesopotamia

00:06:00.552 --> 00:06:04.078
and as far back as them you
have these Quipus knots,

00:06:04.078 --> 00:06:07.653
which many archeologists
view as a form of writing,

00:06:07.653 --> 00:06:09.401
it was a form of record-keeping

00:06:09.401 --> 00:06:13.149
and it was even used
later on by the Incas.

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:15.801
So the big take away here, is to challenge

00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:19.968
that misconception that the
Americas somehow were not as,

00:06:22.595 --> 00:06:26.244
has populations and civilizations
like everything else,

00:06:26.244 --> 00:06:27.784
it was only when the Europeans came in

00:06:27.784 --> 00:06:30.003
that all of that started to happen, no.

00:06:30.003 --> 00:06:32.074
Well before the Europeans came in,

00:06:32.074 --> 00:06:34.806
North and South America had been settled,

00:06:34.806 --> 00:06:37.236
agriculture developed
at a similar timescale,

00:06:37.236 --> 00:06:39.763
significant, complex civilizations,

00:06:39.763 --> 00:06:43.189
writing developed on a similar timescale,

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:45.821
but once you have the
European colonization,

00:06:45.821 --> 00:06:47.598
some people say it was intentional,

00:06:47.598 --> 00:06:49.211
it was probably a
combination of intentional

00:06:49.211 --> 00:06:52.584
and just diseases that were
unfamiliar to the people here,

00:06:52.584 --> 00:06:56.751
within 150 years, that 50
to 100 million population,

00:06:57.652 --> 00:07:01.572
so now we're talking
about, roughly by 1650,

00:07:01.572 --> 00:07:04.360
so you move a little bit forward in time,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.944
the population had gone to
roughly six million people,

00:07:07.944 --> 00:07:10.078
some people refer it to a genocide,

00:07:10.078 --> 00:07:11.686
some people would say it's a combination

00:07:11.686 --> 00:07:13.911
of an intentional extermination of people

00:07:13.911 --> 00:07:17.744
plus just inadvertent
disease, whatever it is,

00:07:19.507 --> 00:07:22.174
this was the significant decline

00:07:23.054 --> 00:07:26.670
of a complex and diverse
set of populations.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.478
This is just a small sample

00:07:28.478 --> 00:07:31.015
of the major civilizations
that were there,

00:07:31.015 --> 00:07:34.650
you had thousands of tribes
across North and South America

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.479
that had different cultures,
different languages,

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:40.866
different traditions
and different religions.
