00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.890
The first thing we need to do is
find the second decimal place.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:05.730
Here, the second decimal place is 9.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.870
And now we look to the right.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.980
That's the 4.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.500
And now we need to decide whether 4 is
5 or greater or if it's less than 5.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.440
Since 4 is less than 5, we can just
drop off these last two decimal places,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.679
and then we're left with 3.59.
