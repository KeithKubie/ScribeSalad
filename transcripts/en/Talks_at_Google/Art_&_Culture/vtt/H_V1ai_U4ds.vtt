FLORIE HUTCHINSON:
Thank you to Mike

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.440
and to Google for
inviting me in today

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.690
to talk about my
very personal journey

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.240
down the rabbit hole of emoji
over the last 18 months--

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.730
the sequence of
events which led me

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.250
to the creation of the
woman's blue flat shoe

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.010
and my subsequent conviction
in the power of emoji

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.040
to enrich the pop
cultural landscape

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.700
and simultaneously be a very
subtle catalyst for change.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.400
As an emoji enthusiast,
it's great fun for me

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.740
to think about this
visual lexicon, which

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.620
has exploded, and more
importantly, where it's going.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.320
However, it's very
much a new area for me.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.341
Had someone told
me 18 months ago

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.590
that I would create an emoji
that would become a cause

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.400
celebre and be anointed
as a feminist symbol,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.470
I genuinely would have chuckled.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.780
And yet, here we are.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.930
When I look at this little
emoji available on over 20

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.200
billion smart-connected
devices across the globe,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.880
I see my worldview reflected
and represented in a small, yet

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.330
perfect little illustration.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.020
That worldview is the product
of my twin occupations.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.510
The first as a fiercely
committed mother

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.130
to four young daughters.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.900
And the second as
a media strategist

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.420
within the arts
and culture sphere.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.640
As a mother, I spent
a lot of time thinking

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.980
about early childhood language
acquisition and screen

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.060
time, literacy, and
implicit gender biases faced

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.280
by women in all age groups.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.610
As an arts professional,
I have a profound belief

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.560
and deep conviction in
the knowledge produced

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.670
by artists and their
unparalleled ability

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.150
to tap into the zeitgeist
before many others do so.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.310
I do also see the
world and experience it

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.320
through a very visual lens.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.780
It is in that paradigm and
the combination of these two

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.750
occupations that led me
to this little emoji that

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.490
launched 1,000 thoughts.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.340
Bear with me as I try
to tackle a few of them.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.590
As I mentioned, I am
the mother to these four

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.600
formidable daughters
ranging from seven

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.350
years old to 10 weeks.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.610
However stepping
back to spring 2017,

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.760
I was just beginning to
reemerge from the newborn vortex

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.949
as my third daughter--
the blonde--

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.620
started inching her way toward
sleeping through the night.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.040
She had joined us
in November of 2016,

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.840
on election night no less, and
was our first US-born child.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.860
By May 2017, my partner
and I had finally

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.230
arrived at that happy
equilibrium in the family

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.270
dynamic where one
of you following

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.700
the addition of a new child
is actually comfortable

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.300
being left alone with
all of your children.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.916
And so on this glorious
weekend in May,

00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:41.210
I tore my way through some
very unglamorous, but highly

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.550
practical Saturday
chores, mostly

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.130
related to the domestic sphere.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.110
Our first stop was the
local grocery store.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.970
Now keep in mind, we
all live in Palo Alto,

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.340
where the produce is incredible
and this presentation is

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.050
something of a visual feast.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.570
Yet my Saturday morning
shopping in no way

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.090
resembles luxurious UX.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.600
Quite the opposite, it's more
of a military-grade blitzkrieg

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.890
operation.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.050
On this particular
day, as I grab

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.180
the shopping cart to wiz my
kids around the produce section,

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.790
I instructed our
two older girls,

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.680
who were five and
three at the time,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.540
to sit down near the
book carousel area

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.950
at our local grocery store.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.100
Yes, there are books
for children there.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.850
And yes, my children
sat down on the floor

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.680
and read them while
I try and choose

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.390
our fruits and vegetables.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.310
Now normally, this would
be done in lightning speed,

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.170
but that morning, our happy
chaos was abruptly interrupted.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.750
The book that both of
my children had chosen

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.340
was this one--

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.540
"Polite as a Princess."

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.140
I tried-- albeit in
vain-- for a few seconds

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.350
in my sleep-deprived haze to
turn the carousel and look

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.640
for its male counterpart--

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.230
"Polite as a Prince."

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.420
It should come as no surprise
that it didn't exist.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.740
It still doesn't.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.620
So I remove the books from my
daughters' hands, placed them

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.990
in the cart, and made my
way to the checkout line,

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.630
while simultaneously
expressing my disappointment

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.375
with this book using
Disney's Instagram hashtag.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.140
Next up, we cross the street
to our local baby boutique,

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.910
where on my punch
list was a desire

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.760
to replace my existing
baby carrier, which was now

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.809
five years old and
egregiously stained,

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:14.600
because surely the
design and the materials

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.019
had gone through some innovation
since I originally bought mine.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.820
As I reviewed the new options--

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.910
and there were literally
20 boxes on the shelves--

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.400
I had an alarming realization.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.550
Only one package among the
20 depicted a male figure

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.100
toting his child.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.380
It was a Norwegian
brand called Stokke.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.400
It seemed that only Norwegian
fathers carried their children.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.260
Frustrated by this
visual reminder

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.870
that women are expected
to literally carry

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.350
the brunt of child-rearing
responsibilities,

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.390
I hot stepped out of the
store with my three daughters

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.800
and went home.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.200
As a side note, this
very topic became

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.760
something of a rather viral
episode a few months ago,

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.460
which some of you
may have seen, when

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.890
Piers Morgan took to Twitter
and insulted Daniel Craig--

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:59.390
a.k.a.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.244
Bond-- for toting his kid.

00:05:02.244 --> 00:05:04.160
In a similar spirit,
"The Wall Street Journal"

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.220
recently published a huge
feature on male-focused

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.250
designed carriers displaying
such masculine motifs

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.220
as camouflage and
neutral color ways.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.520
It would only be
later that night

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.040
as I was nursing the baby
while everyone was asleep

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.560
that the stiletto's appearance
became the emoji that broke

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.090
the proverbial camel's back.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.060
I was sending a message
to a friend in Europe

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.434
when I typed the seemingly
innocuous word "shoe."

00:05:29.434 --> 00:05:31.100
And it was the first
time that I noticed

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.240
that emoji autopopulated.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.780
And this was what appeared.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.830
And in it, I saw the
final visual reminder--

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.590
this time, in the
virtual universe--

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.900
of all the unrealistic
expectations

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.300
bestowed upon women.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.510
How does one begin to unpack
the litany of thoughts

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.600
that entered my mind at 3:00
AM when I saw this symbol--

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.600
this small little
picture that said to me

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.270
that we, as women,
are expected to walk

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.850
the world in high heels?

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.900
I think this is a
great place to start.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.980
This is a work by a hot young
artist-- male artist-- named

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.650
Torbjorn Rodland, who's
represented by David Kordansky

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.510
Gallery in Los Angeles.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.410
In this singular image,
the stiletto evokes danger,

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.240
seduction, provocation with
more than a soupcon of pain.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.050
It's a tool of power,
which women ought to own.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.430
Yet this was my reality.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.860
This photograph is by Vivian
Maier, who some of you

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.390
may have seen the documentary.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.500
And it's very much like most
of her photographic oeuvre,

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.450
showing this woman
who was anonymously

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.930
shot without the consent
of the subject in the '70s.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.360
This woman in Manhattan
is wearing that shoe,

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.540
and is literally
injured, and has even

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.350
gone to the lengths of
crafting a heel for her cast.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.960
And so I began to ask
myself whether my aversion

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.040
to stilettos was simply a unique
byproduct of spending literally

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.170
the last eight years
either pregnant,

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.350
carrying a baby on my
torso, pushing a stroller,

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.860
or bending over while helping
a little person learn to walk.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.400
In other words, was my mom
attire in the footwear category

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.650
an isolated experience?

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.810
The resounding answer
after weeks of research,

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.570
which would ultimately
inform my emoji proposal,

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.666
was no, it was not isolated.

00:07:22.666 --> 00:07:24.540
I started looking at
the history of footwear.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.340
And what I unearthed
very quickly

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.890
was that the red high heel
and all of its implications

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.530
that accompany it date
back at least 70 years

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.390
to the days of "Mad Men."

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.820
The following is a small
sampling of the vintage

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.277
as I unearthed.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.154
I particularly liked
this one, which

00:07:50.154 --> 00:07:52.070
is actually an editorial
from "The New Yorker"

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.290
magazine in the 1950s.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.060
Can anyone guess who it is?

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.340
It's Andy Warhol.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:02.100
Not only is it done by
Warhol, but the red high heel

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.700
is literally equated with
success for female workers

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.230
in New York City.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.480
Interestingly, I actually
discovered this spread

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.880
on the Whitney's
Instagram stories

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.310
from their current major
Warhol retrospective--

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.650
the first in over 30 years.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:19.860
Shifting my gaze from
historical ads and editorials,

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.780
I turned my eye to
the contemporary

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.700
and started examining
how footwear is used

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.760
to communicate to women today.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.250
And what I found was that
we have made no progress.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:33.809
In many ways, I think
it's actually worsened.

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:36.030
Here is an ad from the
breastfeeding lobbying group

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.750
in the UK, in which you can
save your money from formula

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.110
to be a yummier mummy.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:44.310
Here's one from Clinique.

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.492
I would challenge to
ask where is the comfort

00:08:46.492 --> 00:08:47.325
in the red stiletto?

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.610
In this GEICO ad,
women are literally

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.660
encouraged to switch
their insurance policy,

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.500
so they can famously save
and redeploy said savings

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.820
to the things they love--

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.410
red pumps.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.540
Interestingly, the male
counterpart of this ad,

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.370
which appears in
men's magazines,

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:06.730
is a big hunk of steak.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.520
In this one-- another
great export from the UK--

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.710
the National Health
Service equates

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:15.100
motherhood with the abandonment
of a very specific version

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.340
of femalehood.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.310
Here, we have the TSA
espousing better convenience

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.160
at the airport while traveling.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.780
Yet I would challenge that
the most inconvenient part

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.290
of removing shoes is
actually shoes with laces,

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:31.780
not the heel, plus I
don't know many women

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:36.600
who actually wear heels while
traipsing across the airport.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.600
The US Postal Service equates
fashion with high heels

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.810
and suggests that neither
fashion nor the post office

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.500
rest on Sundays.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.530
Zappos-- a category buster,
which I'll return to later

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:49.790
in the footwear space--

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:54.810
suggests that women
all love red stilettos.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.840
Barclays, in urging financial
literacy and acumen,

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.360
again suggests that
those funds that you save

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.530
should be spent on shoes.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:07.410
The newly-launched magazine,
which went viral earlier this

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.060
month and some of
you may have seen

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.970
because of a sensationalist
image of Rachel McAdams pumping

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.030
in designerwear,
has this tagline--

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.910
"bringing back the
woman stiletto."

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:22.570
I find it ironic given
the title of the magazine.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:24.940
For Giving Tuesday,
Bruno Magli donated

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:28.340
100 pairs of these
burgundy suede stilettos.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.670
They're named the Gala Pump.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.860
Now, I would venture
to say that a woman who

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.290
is new to the job search
and interview process

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:37.790
should have one fewer
thing to be thinking about,

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.150
which is learning to walk
in six-inch stilettos.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.820
Of course, we're here at Google,
and one of my very first places

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.400
when I went down that rabbit
hole was to look at Google Arts

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.690
and Culture.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:53.860
This shoe is an item of footwear
intended to protect and comfort

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.530
the human foot while the wearer
is doing various activities.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:00.880
Now I don't know about you,
but nothing about this shoe

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.520
made me think of
comfort or walking.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.610
To Google's credit, within
24 hours of me Instagramming

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:07.690
it-- "come on Google.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:08.680
You can do better."--

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.430
They changed it.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:10.750
It's now a raggedy old boot.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.730
This is a scent
that was recently

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.380
launched by Carolina Herrera.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.120
And wait for it, it's
called Good Girl.

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:26.830
The text used to get women
to buy it says it all.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:31.320
It's good to be bad, provocative
intent, lethal charisma,

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.840
seductive charisma,
and there's no escape.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.910
It's about ruthless power.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:39.970
Now that we spent some time
investigating how stilettos

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:42.640
are generally depicted and the
weighty expectations that they

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.680
carry with them as
a visual emblem,

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.470
I wanted to talk also about
my observations with emoji

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:49.390
specifically, which
have been formed

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:51.640
through the eyes of
my young children.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:55.510
As I mentioned at the beginning,
I was very much an emoji novice

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.830
18 months ago.

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.650
Only the casual sort of
kiss-sending face or the heart

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:01.450
appeared in my text messaging.

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:05.440
Yet this all changed when my
children began attending school

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:10.870
and suddenly, emojis seemed
to be literally everywhere.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.770
So let's talk about how
much my children love emoji

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:16.950
and how omnipresent they
are in their daily existence

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:19.050
because in many ways,
the impetus to create

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.090
my flat-shoe emoji
was one driven

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.330
by parental
responsibility and duty.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.570
If my kids were going to be
using emoji and seeing them

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.180
repeatedly in their routines,
shouldn't I at least

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.620
try to create some
semblance of balance

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.830
to the three existing
high-heeled options that

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.850
existed.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:37.600
There was apparel.

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.700
You can make
bracelets with emoji.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.510
You can wear your
emoji to school.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.210
You can keep your innermost
thoughts in an emoji diary.

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.460
And if you don't feel like
describing your emotions,

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.770
you can use the emoji stickers.

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:57.310
You can get National
Geographic to help you decode

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:00.760
the emoji language, literally.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.340
At this point, I had accepted
that my children were

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.670
using emoji, not necessarily
as a language, but as

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.380
an expressive plaything.

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.030
So I turned to the
other world that I

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.580
know and love and occupy--

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.830
the arts.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.180
And I started thinking about
how artists were engaging

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.600
with the subject matter.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.900
And it became very
clear that they too

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.600
were questioning the
broader sentiment that emoji

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.660
were simple little playthings,
throwaways, a trend

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.205
to be dismissed and outgrown.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.220
The original emoji set here,
which I'm sure many of you

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.890
know, seems like a really
good place to start.

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:41.440
Released exactly 20 years ago
in 1999 and including 176 emoji,

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.390
its acquisition
by MoMA last year

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.726
was certainly viewed as a
legitimizing watershed moment.

00:13:46.726 --> 00:13:48.760
MoMA's collection in
New York is filled

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.830
with examples of
design innovations

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.240
that radically
altered our world.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.010
So for emoji, including the
little red pixilated stiletto

00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:00.010
next to the scissors
and the hamburger,

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.020
to become part of
that collection

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.360
was historically significant.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.880
Now that institutional
backing was in place,

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.950
I was really curious about
how artists themselves

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:12.420
were dealing with emoji today.

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.850
I first came across
this image last August

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:18.060
via Mary Boone Gallery's
Instagram page.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.730
It depicts the fist and
the painting-nail emoji.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.420
And my curiosity,
as you can imagine,

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.060
was immediately piqued.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:27.090
The work is by Derrick Adams,
a young African-American

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.760
multidisciplinary artist
based in Brooklyn, whom I've

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.830
been following for some time.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.890
When I contacted the gallery a
few weeks ago for the purpose

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:38.220
of this presentation and to
learn more about this painting,

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.220
it emerged that is actually
part of a whole new body of work

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.640
which will be shown in
March entitled New Icons.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.830
Through multiple layers
of CNC-applied paint

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.640
and also by hand,
Derek has purposely

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.690
mimicked the digital world.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:55.230
And he's created this
new series of portraits

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:59.430
using only the emoji library
as a point of reference

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:03.450
to an individual that because
of his or her radical nature,

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:07.030
Adams feels is important to
American popular culture.

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.750
This specific work is of a woman
named Sister Souljah, which

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.790
some of you might
know is an author,

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:14.820
activist, and was known for
the Sister Souljah moment

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.710
during the Bill Clinton
presidential campaign.

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:20.220
So here, we have a
highly engaged artist

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.430
exploring the force of
popular culture and the media

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:26.430
on the perception and
construction of self-image

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:31.450
using emoji as a vehicle and a
whole new form of portraiture.

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:33.680
Next up, I looked
to Laura Owens--

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.320
the brilliant
female artist in LA,

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.420
who is known for her
large-scale paintings that

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.580
intertwine our
historical references

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.560
with painterly techniques.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.070
I was fascinated by this
installation from 2015

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.395
in a club called The
Dirty Rag Soccer Club

00:15:47.395 --> 00:15:50.590
Club in Chicago, which
is an exhibition space

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:53.760
in a former Polish soccer bar.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:58.170
In it, Owens installed hundreds
of these emojis ceramic

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:00.450
sculptures above a
fully functional bar

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:02.610
opposite her paintings.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:06.120
She made by hand 426
emoji sculptures.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.420
And there are 383 of
them which are available,

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.180
if anybody wants to buy one.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:17.160
Taking it one step further,
actually last November in 2017

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.380
to coincide with her
major retrospective

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:22.770
at the Whitney Museum, they
one-upped it and they cleverly

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:27.730
converted each of these emoji
into a free digital sticker

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:32.650
pack, which I love
and use incessantly.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.510
In another example of
a contemporary artist

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:37.420
incorporating emoji, I
turned to Trevor Paglen--

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.070
the MacArthur
Genius prize winner

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:42.900
and previous artist-in-residence
at Stanford Cantor Arts Center.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.700
Paglen is widely known for
an artistic practice which

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.740
seeks to expose and
investigate areas that

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.330
don't wish to be examined--

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.630
surveillance, military
operations, intelligence.

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:56.200
He played a crucial role with
Laura Poitras in "Citizenfour"

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.970
and his body of
work is currently

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.790
on show at the Smithsonian
in a major mid-career survey

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:02.330
exhibition.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:05.200
This specific work, known
as the Symbology series,

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.119
looks at the totemic
visual language

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:10.200
inherent in military culture.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.650
A typical uniform
will sport patches

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.650
identifying its wearer's
job, program affiliation,

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:18.420
achievements, and place
within that hierarchy.

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.180
These markers of
identity and program

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:23.869
heraldry begin to create a
very peculiar symbolic regime

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:26.660
when they depict one's
affiliation with what

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.810
the defense industry insiders
call the black world--

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.030
the world of classified
programs, projects,

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:35.305
and places, whose outlines
and even existence

00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:36.305
are deeply-held secrets.

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:42.590
And finally, I turn to the
legendary John Baldessari,

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.530
who at 87 years old,
remains as forward thinking

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:49.070
as ever, known for using found
imagery that he recomposes

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:52.400
by carefully selecting pictures,
pairing them with text,

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.670
and often overlaying them with
large dots and swaths of color

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:58.700
to mask or bring attention
to the areas of detail.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.880
For this series of paintings,
he focused on the animal emoji

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.200
specifically.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.450
Taking this interest
in issues of context

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:07.430
and cultural
specificity further,

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:10.280
the new Emoji Series
evaluated the ubiquitous,

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.590
seemingly innocuous
images that we

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:16.340
use in everyday conversations.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:19.100
And then this past
November, Baldessari

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.080
did a new Emoji Series.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.720
Some of the text is
ironic and suggestive,

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.760
while some seem
completely random,

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:30.110
thus challenging the viewer to
make sense out of the pairings.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.810
While emojis are indeed
straightforward images that

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.270
take the place of
their real-life words,

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:36.920
Baldessari's works
seem to suggest

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.560
that their meanings are not
actually set and are rather

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.570
subject to interpretation.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:45.120
These universal images that
transcend cultural, social,

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.120
and linguistic
boundaries are easily

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.720
subverted when removed
from their iPhone context

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.250
and paired within
different text.

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:56.300
Even the hyper-bright white
background of the works

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:59.060
seems to recall the lighting
of the phone background

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.940
where these are typically
seen, thus making the artwork

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:06.210
itself represent something
beyond its material nature.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.580
If you're curious,
the peaches sold out.

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:14.490
More recently, a couple of weeks
ago, the Prado Museum in Madrid

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.860
released its own bespoke
emoji via Twitter

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.140
to celebrate its
200th anniversary.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:23.370
So if you #Prado200, you
immediately got this wonderful

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.430
Like button.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.500
Segueing now from
the art world context

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.650
and into the unexpected
applications of emoji,

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:34.920
here you have an example of
actual text being translated

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.280
into emoji, which made me think
will Google Translate offer

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.900
that service?

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.879
The traditional
emoji nativity, which

00:19:42.879 --> 00:19:45.295
went around and was widely
circulated during the holidays.

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:51.180
A portmanteau of emoji to
describe that sensation

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.790
many of us are currently
feeling back at work.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.290
This is one of my favorites--
shopping by emoji.

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:01.790
Again, Zappos.

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:03.290
So if you go into
the Zappos app,

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:05.570
you can actually shop by emoji.

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:07.070
But unfortunately,
if you're a woman

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:10.470
who's looking for a flat shoe,
it's not readily visible.

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:12.650
However, the next
two screens do show

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.740
what you get when you put
in, say, the mermaid emoji

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:18.180
and the lips emoji.

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:19.290
I did contact Zappos.

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:20.460
They assured me
it's in there now.

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.001
So if you put in my
little flat shoe,

00:20:22.001 --> 00:20:25.900
you get pages and
pages of ballet flats.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:29.100
This is a page from the December
issue of "Elle" magazine,

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.400
again shopping for
your loved ones

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.920
based on their emoji usage.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.620
I found this on Instagram.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:42.160
This one also went viral, which
is quite fun and entertaining

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.450
looking at emoji usage on
a national country level.

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:49.600
And it began to make me think,
hmm, are emoji usage actually

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.360
sort of the national
psyche and what

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.690
does that mean for profiling?

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.720
There's the good aspect of emoji
targeting, like this endangered

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.805
species campaign.

00:21:00.805 --> 00:21:02.800
And for those of
you that don't know,

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:07.390
you can actually buy emoji
usage data from Twitter

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:09.500
and then use it for your
marketing campaigns.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.830
So while this is a fantastic
illustration of that tool,

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:15.220
another option is you're
sitting watching the Super Bowl,

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.386
and you're tweeting at your
friend that you're about

00:21:17.386 --> 00:21:19.900
to order pizza, and you get a
discount code from Domino's.

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.858
And then the next week,
you get a discount code

00:21:21.858 --> 00:21:25.150
for Jenny Craig for a
weight-loss program.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:28.540
Another unexpected byproduct
of my emoji journey

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.030
was learning that at the
University of Michigan

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:32.740
within the art
history department,

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.540
there exists a class
for undergraduates

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.010
called Emoji Worlds.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:39.520
It's taught by Joan Kee,
who has a PhD in art history

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.190
and a specialty in
Asian art contemporary,

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:44.950
but also has a JD
from Yale Law School.

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:48.580
And this class spends
about 12 weeks looking

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.920
at every aspect of emoji.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.930
For their final
assignment, they were

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:57.330
each required to submit
an emoji proposal

00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:00.090
and guaranteed an A-plus, by
the way, if it got adopted.

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:05.690
And with this image, I want
to finish on the significance

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:07.340
of design thinking.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:11.270
Everything about this
crosswalk makes me smile.

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:13.590
It's insane.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.750
And yet the design
and interpretation

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:18.030
of my emoji across
some platforms

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:21.270
was absolutely disheartening,
as though the intent

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:25.200
of the emoji at its very core
had been completely overlooked.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.490
I'll let you guess which ones.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:33.960
When John Baldessari was asked
about his new emoji series,

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.330
he once responded
that emoji to him

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:40.260
represented the most
democratic living language.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.030
It is crowdsourced after all.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:44.310
And that every time
you use one, you

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.560
are in essence casting a vote.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.270
With that thought, I
wanted to point out

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:52.530
the design difference in the
newly-adopted brick emoji

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:55.785
and leave you to thinking about
what vote you are casting.

00:22:58.998 --> 00:23:00.462
Thank you.

00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:02.902
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.950
MIKE UY: Thank you for coming to
Google and telling your story.

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.110
It's fascinating to me
every time I hear it.

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:14.670
So I mean, I really,
really appreciate it.

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:15.250
Thank you for
sharing that with us.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:16.750
FLORIE HUTCHINSON:
It's my pleasure.

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:21.110
MIKE UY: I was going to ask
you which implementation?

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:25.140
I mean, you've been all over
with this emoji campaign.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.830
Now that you see
it in real life,

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:30.620
which implementation are
you the happiest with?

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.704
I won't ask you which one
you don't like because I

00:23:32.704 --> 00:23:33.953
think that was pretty obvious.

00:23:33.953 --> 00:23:35.480
FLORIE HUTCHINSON:
I think the Apple

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.600
emoji was the truest to the
initial design I submitted.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:43.670
It was Prussian blue, which
was a very considerate choice

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:47.360
to sort of flip on its head the
whole idea of blue is for boys,

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.245
pink is for girls.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.970
One of the sort of
unexpected surprises

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:55.130
that I loved actually
about the Apple emoji

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:57.620
is that where all the
other shoes are actually

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:00.770
displayed at a
45-degree tilt, Apple

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:04.310
went further and truly made
it flat and horizontal,

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.710
which wasn't something
I had considered.

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:11.030
And yet, it really accentuates
the flatness of it.

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:14.840
I also loved that
within the Apple emoji

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.150
architecture and order,
the flat shoe actually

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:18.590
precedes the stiletto.

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:21.560
So when you scroll through
the apparel category,

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.660
the flat shoe is
the very first one.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.414
And that made me smile a lot.

00:24:25.414 --> 00:24:26.330
MIKE UY: That's great.

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:26.981
That's great.

00:24:26.981 --> 00:24:28.730
Can you tell us a
little bit-- you told me

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:32.480
about how you actually went
about designing the flat shoe

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.290
emoji in the first place.

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:37.070
You spoke to an
artist friend and then

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:39.155
you had some very
specific requirements

00:24:39.155 --> 00:24:41.030
of how you wanted it
drawn and why you wanted

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:42.238
it depicted it a certain way.

00:24:42.238 --> 00:24:43.890
I thought it was
really interesting.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:45.348
FLORIE HUTCHINSON:
So I reached out

00:24:45.348 --> 00:24:47.540
to a graphic designer
named Aphee Messer, who

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.540
had been the illustrator for
the woman with a headscarf,

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.700
otherwise known as
the hijab emoji,

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.520
and coincidentally is also a
children's book illustrator.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.250
And I thought she
would perfectly get

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:00.950
what I was trying to get at.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:03.860
And my directors were
really quite open.

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:07.130
I absolutely wanted
it not to be pink,

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:08.810
so I said you can
choose the colors,

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.300
but it needs to
be gender neutral.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.600
I wanted both options to be
available in terms of a flat

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.939
with a bow and one without.

00:25:16.939 --> 00:25:19.230
Some people have asked me,
why did you include the bow?

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:21.440
It's such an overtly
feminine thing.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.680
And the reality is in my
research of flat shoes,

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.180
all of the original
flats had that

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.280
binding to keep the shoe on.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.050
And so it was
actually a reference

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.960
to the historical design of
flat shoes, which of course were

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.350
also woven by men.

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:38.150
And so I really wanted
the ultimate designers

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:41.540
to have the option of both
a flat with a bow and one

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:42.140
without.

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:44.620
And there were six color ways.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:48.200
And I wanted the heel to be
as nonexistent as possible,

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.710
while still translating
on a microscale.

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:53.990
MIKE UY: So you submitted
several versions of this

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:55.439
to Unicode?

00:25:55.439 --> 00:25:57.980
FLORIE HUTCHINSON: Yeah, so I
submitted two silhouettes-- one

00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:59.210
with the bow and one without.

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:01.880
And each silhouette was
available in six colors,

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:07.860
which ranged from dark blue,
dark green, nude, brown, black.

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.860
MIKE UY: So it's fascinating
that you approached

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:14.450
the whole emoji proposal from
the art world perspective

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:17.960
because you're not in
tech, like everybody here.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:22.460
And you taught yourself
how to propose to Unicode

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:24.710
and you wrote the whole
proposal yourself, right?

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:26.270
What was that like?

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:27.740
Where did you
start when you said

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:30.410
I wanted to get this emoji
accepted and adopted.

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:32.630
Did you even know there
was a Unicode organization

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:33.740
that you had to apply to?

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:36.240
And how did you how do you
start that whole journey?

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.930
FLORIE HUTCHINSON:
It was a really fun.

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:40.430
I get goosebumps
thinking about it

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:42.800
because I had an
excuse to get back

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:46.290
on sort of that student learning
curve and nerd out really.

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:48.537
And it all kind of
happened when no one

00:26:48.537 --> 00:26:50.120
was looking in the
middle of the night

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:54.350
because until that red
stiletto autopopulated,

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:56.360
I had no idea how
emoji were made.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.770
I literally held my
phone and I was like,

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:01.820
hmm, is Apple so smart
that this device has

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:05.450
some sort of mythic AI
that knows what my shopping

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:08.760
habits have been for the last
12 months, has aggregated that,

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.210
and therefore this
device knows that there's

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:14.510
a female holding this
phone and has predicted

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:16.280
that this is the stiletto--

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.750
that this is the
shoe emoji that's

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:19.310
going to resonate with me?

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:23.190
That was literally my
justification rationale.

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:25.820
And then I-- thank you, Google--

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.290
went down the
rabbit hole of how--

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:30.500
I literally typed in
"how do emoji get made?"

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.590
And that's when I lighted
on the most horrific Unicode

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:37.100
Consortium web page and
sort of navigated my way

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.234
through the like, how does
one submit a proposal.

00:27:39.234 --> 00:27:41.150
And that's when my light
bulb moment went off,

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:42.720
which was, oh, wait a second.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.940
Emoji are crowdsourced.

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:48.260
Anyone from me in Palo Alto
to an 85-year-old man in India

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:52.100
to a 15-year-old girl in
Berlin can submit a proposal.

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.500
They just need to fill
out this template.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:58.340
And then once I realized that,
actually from a friend of mine

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:03.080
who's in the audience, I reached
out to the dumpling emoji

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.330
creator Jennifer 8.

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:07.360
Lee, and cold emailed
her from her website,

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.470
and said this is my idea.

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:10.870
This is my observation.

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:12.200
Am I crazy?

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.350
And with a matter of
hours, she came back to me

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:17.930
and very succinctly said,
this is a good idea.

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:19.990
The deadline is July 1st.

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:24.010
And so at this
point, it was June.

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:26.200
And I thought to myself,
OK, I've actually

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.300
vocalized this to someone.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:31.210
I now have my marching
orders, no pun intended.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:34.030
And I spent basically the next
three weeks putting together

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:37.280
the proposal entirely on my own.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.850
And it was really fun.

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:42.430
The one thing that
I still think about

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:44.230
is if you go on the
Unicode website,

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:46.900
they make a point of
saying no emoji proposal

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:50.320
should be for "a
cause," quote unquote.

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.010
It will be dismissed.

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:54.100
There are some emoji
that get adopted,

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:57.800
however it's in spite of the
cause, not because of it.

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.940
And so one of the sort of lenses
that I was seeing my proposal

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.970
through was really trying
to downplay the cause

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:06.880
factor, which in fact, when
you look at that blue shoe

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:11.560
and you know me, you know it's
blatantly a cause-driven emoji.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:18.580
And so I had to make it as
empirical and statistically

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.300
significant as possible.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.360
And so I downplayed
the actual narrative

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.240
and made it about usage
adoption and creating

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:27.825
a really compelling
argument for it to be made.

00:29:27.825 --> 00:29:30.680
MIKE UY: Fascinating,
fascinating.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:34.422
So you're kind of all in
now-- you said you nerded out.

00:29:34.422 --> 00:29:35.380
FLORIE HUTCHINSON: Yes.

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:37.664
MIKE UY: And you
love this process.

00:29:37.664 --> 00:29:39.080
Some of us have
to do it for work,

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.630
but you love this process.

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:48.290
And you're not just stopping
with the flat-soled shoe emoji.

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:51.770
I've heard you've actually got
some other projects in the work

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:54.641
and not for women,
but men as well.

00:29:54.641 --> 00:29:55.640
FLORIE HUTCHINSON: I do.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.790
This past spring, I
coauthored a proposal

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:02.270
for a one-piece bathing suit
because the only swimwear

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:05.900
option right now is an itsy
bitsy, yellow, polka dot

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:06.710
bikini.

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:07.850
MIKE UY: Even for men?

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:09.770
FLORIE HUTCHINSON:
Even for men, which

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:11.990
is why the proposal
actually included

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:16.170
a one-piece swimsuit, a swim
trunk for men, and a swim brief

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:17.930
for men.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:19.790
It's now been shortlisted.

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:21.450
MIKE UY: Oh, great.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:23.030
So when do you hear about that?

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:27.060
FLORIE HUTCHINSON: I believe the
committee will vote in October.

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:31.400
And if all goes well, it will
roll out next year in 2020.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.900
MIKE UY: Well, if
that happens, we'd

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.210
love to have you back here.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:36.210
Maybe you could help.

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:39.260
So I don't know if you know
this, but the emoji sets--

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:43.040
like once Unicode decides the
emoji, how they're actually

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:47.967
depicted is up to each of the
companies, as you pointed out.

00:30:47.967 --> 00:30:49.550
But there is a process
that we have at

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:53.150
Google that you could actually
get involved in if you wanted

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:55.070
to help do the Google version.

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:56.570
FLORIE HUTCHINSON:
100% count me in.

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:59.097
Where do I sign up?

00:30:59.097 --> 00:31:01.430
MIKE UY: And thank you for
getting swim trunks out there

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:02.570
because every time
I text and like,

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:04.690
you know, bring your trunks,
I don't have an emoji.

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:05.690
FLORIE HUTCHINSON: Yeah.

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:07.036
Hopefully, you'll get one soon.

00:31:07.036 --> 00:31:07.952
MIKE UY: That's great.

00:31:10.284 --> 00:31:12.200
I wanted to get into
some of the other topics.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:20.800
You said that you see emoji
as more than just as art.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:21.822
It's become language.

00:31:21.822 --> 00:31:23.280
And you touched on
it a little bit,

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:25.790
but we've had a
longer conversations

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:29.492
about how you see emoji
becoming part of linguistics.

00:31:29.492 --> 00:31:30.950
I was wondering if
you'd comment on

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:32.825
that because that was
really fascinating, now

00:31:32.825 --> 00:31:35.070
that your kids are growing up.

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:37.380
FLORIE HUTCHINSON: Well,
I'm not an academic,

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:41.390
but there is a term known
as elocutionary text.

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:44.900
And so sort of thinking back
to when the original emoji set

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.060
were introduced,
emoji were really

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:49.550
meant to be that
aspect which got

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:54.320
lost in electronic messaging of
the nonverbal-- so emotional,

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.680
facial, nonverbal
cues, intonation.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.390
And you were able
to supplement sort

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:02.600
of just the purely textual
with the nonverbal cues

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.400
through an image.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.050
And I find that
really interesting

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:08.760
because now when we
look at emoji usage,

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.670
they don't necessarily
replace words,

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:13.070
but they certainly
add the meaning

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:16.710
and the practical
meaning of a sentence.

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:19.160
And so some would say it's
part of the linguistic channel

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.800
of communication is
these nonverbal cues

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:25.070
that you can now
include pictorially.

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:29.180
And so to me, it's one of
those really interesting things

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:31.550
in that also, I mean,
there is a reason

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:35.360
the cliche "a picture is worth
a thousand words" exists.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.480
And I've been thinking
a lot about how

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.810
certain emoji can be a time
capsule in and of themselves.

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:44.090
I mean, one of the things
that I didn't cover at all

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:47.510
is while my emoji
escapades were happening,

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:51.530
a lot of other greater
cultural things were happening.

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:55.820
I had my realization
moment in May 2017.

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:59.300
And basically three months
later in August, Melania Trump

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:03.350
tiptoed on her stilettos
to Hurricane Harvey, which

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:05.360
set the whole media furor.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.600
And then a month later, the
Harvey Weinstein Me Too thing

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:14.270
happened, which again
changed the dialogue forever,

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:15.020
I'd like to think.

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:18.980
And then in January of 2018,
you had Time's Up happening

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:19.940
during the Oscars.

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:21.510
So that was a year ago.

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:23.750
And then in May, you had
the Cannes Film Festival,

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:26.000
where literally Kirsten
Stewart and a whole bunch

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.130
of A-list actresses were
removing their shoes

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:29.810
to walk the red carpet.

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:33.770
And so I'd like to think
that 30 years from now

00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:39.080
when my kids are still seeing
at that little flat shoe emoji,

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:42.110
that they can sort of pinpoint
exactly what was happening

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:45.200
on a broader cultural level.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.710
In the same group of the emoji
that mine was released in

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:50.780
is the mosquito emoji,
which to someone

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:53.420
who doesn't know the
context of that proposal,

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.336
they might think why do
I need a mosquito emoji.

00:33:56.336 --> 00:33:57.710
But then when you
drill down, you

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:01.760
realize that was proposed by
a team from the Johns Hopkins

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:05.300
infectiology team and the Bill
&amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.160
And you suddenly realize
that that mosquito

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.639
is there for the purpose of mass
instant global communication

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:13.790
and thinking about how do you
communicate across countries

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:16.280
where maybe populations
aren't literate,

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:19.460
but completely understand
this image of a mosquito being

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:22.730
the vehicle by which
disease is transmitted?

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:26.350
Again, I think in a way, this
brick emoji and the brick wall

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:28.159
will immediately point
to a specific moment

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:31.110
in history and debate.

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:35.949
And so it's interesting to
me that these little images

00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:38.230
can actually point to
historically-significant

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:40.190
moments if you know
the backstory to them.

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.947
MIKE UY: Hmm.

00:34:40.947 --> 00:34:43.030
So my one last question,
and then we'll open it up

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:45.370
to everybody here and online.

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:47.900
But from that
perspective of history,

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:50.920
there is a lot of criticism
that the emoji library

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.320
has gotten too large.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.070
And even on our team
in Android messages,

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:55.840
we're thinking of
new ways to let

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.660
people search and browse
emoji because it's

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:02.830
gone from the original
400 to over 2,700.

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:06.310
And there's talk about
should some emoji

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:09.040
be retired or replaced?

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.320
From the perspective of history,
what are your thoughts on that?

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.440
Should emoji be retired?

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:15.940
FLORIE HUTCHINSON:
It's a tricky one

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:19.450
because I can see the
unwieldiness argument,

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:25.690
but I also am not one
to use that argument

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:28.510
to justify retiring some.

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:31.240
Whenever the sort of quantity
argument comes into play,

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:33.910
I point to the fact that there
are like 13 phases of the moon

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:35.110
emoji.

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:36.460
Do we need 13 of them?

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:38.890
Probably not, but then
it becomes a point

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:41.680
of view decision-making matrix.

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:46.090
And so I would hate to
think that the minority

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:48.730
voice or the quietest
emoji would get

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:52.180
retired because its
usage or adoption

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:57.040
rate is lower than the
twinning Playboy bunnies.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.789
So I think that's a bigger
question for the engineers

00:36:00.789 --> 00:36:01.705
in the room to tackle.

00:36:04.474 --> 00:36:05.890
but you know, like
I think there's

00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:08.540
some statistic that by the
time a kid is five years old,

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:11.740
they've used and
heard 40,000 words.

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:15.100
So in the context
of 2,200 emoji,

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:17.350
yes, it's a bit unwieldy
to scroll through and find

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:20.320
the ones that are part
of your daily vocabulary,

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:23.369
but work harder.

00:36:23.369 --> 00:36:24.160
MIKE UY: Thank you.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.890
That's great.

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:28.300
All right, I'm going
to grab this mike.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:29.920
AUDIENCE: How did
you put it out there

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.680
and how did it start
to go viral in the way

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.540
that it ultimately did?

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:38.170
FLORIE HUTCHINSON: So I came
up with the idea for the emoji

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:40.870
in May of 2017.

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:43.930
I sat on it for
a couple of days.

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:48.160
And then while going to an event
at the pop up magazine in San

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:52.912
Francisco, I floated it past
a very close friend, who said,

00:36:52.912 --> 00:36:53.620
you should do it.

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:55.020
You've got nothing to lose.

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.200
And I was like, OK.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:00.200
And then because I thought,
oh, well, you know,

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.014
Apple is the one
that dictates emoji,

00:37:02.014 --> 00:37:04.430
I turned to a friend of mine
who worked at Apple and said,

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:06.513
can you introduce me to
someone on the design team

00:37:06.513 --> 00:37:09.585
so that I can talk to
them about this stiletto.

00:37:09.585 --> 00:37:10.960
And she was like,
well, actually,

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.850
Apple doesn't determine emoji.

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:15.560
The Unicode Consortium does.

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:19.300
And so that's when I taught
myself how to do the proposal.

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:22.331
I submitted it without really
telling many people that I did.

00:37:22.331 --> 00:37:24.580
It was one of those things,
like college applications.

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:25.690
You don't really
want to tell people

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:26.650
where you've applied
because you don't

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:28.316
want to have deal
with like telling them

00:37:28.316 --> 00:37:29.830
that you didn't get in.

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:32.230
And so there are a
few close friends

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:35.410
who knew that I was going
through the process.

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:38.230
When I got wind that it
was getting shortlisted,

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:41.470
I decided to contact a friend
of mine who happened to have

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:45.160
written a huge piece two years
prior in "The Atlantic"--

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.717
and had gone to college
with me-- on stilettos.

00:37:47.717 --> 00:37:49.300
And I called her up
and I said, I just

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.949
want you to know I'm going
through this process.

00:37:51.949 --> 00:37:53.990
I don't know whether it
will get accepted or not,

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:56.530
but I thought given
that you've allocated

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:58.570
this much ink to
stilettos in the past,

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:00.310
you might find this funny.

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:02.770
And she immediately got
back to me and was like,

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:04.270
I want to write about this.

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:05.350
Can I interview you?

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:07.640
And I said, sure, why not?

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:12.290
So that was in August
after the shortlisting.

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:14.050
And we agreed to
time the release

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:16.780
of that article in "The
Atlantic" to the Friday

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:20.560
before the Unicode committee
would be voting on the Monday.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:24.640
What I didn't expect is that
between that Friday morning

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.700
and the Monday that "New York
Magazine" would basically

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.310
syndicate "The Atlantic"
piece, that it would become

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:32.560
the most-read piece
for the next 36 hours

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:34.600
on all of "New York
Magazine's" website

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.390
and most-shared article, and
that every single other outlet

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:38.890
would call me on
the Monday morning.

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:44.560
And so by the time the committee
met Monday afternoon to vote,

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.540
they literally I
think probably felt

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:48.130
like they had no
choice but to face

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:50.800
the wrath of a million
women who suddenly felt

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:54.850
this desperate need to have
a flat-soled shoe emoji, even

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:56.770
though they'd never
realized until that

00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:59.480
moment, its omission.

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:01.240
And that's one of
the sort of feedback

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.250
that I got also with
the swimsuit emoji

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:05.620
when that sort of went
out in the public domain

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:08.680
was I was speaking to a
journalist at "The Times"

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.090
in the UK.

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:13.771
And she said, you know, the day
after the chief fashion critic

00:39:13.771 --> 00:39:15.520
of "The New York Times"
wrote a huge piece

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:20.020
about the swimsuit emoji,
our entire editorial team

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:23.500
got together and said,
how did we miss this?

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:27.640
How did none of us realize that
the bikini is the only one?

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:31.055
And I think that's the thing
where emoji can course-correct,

00:39:31.055 --> 00:39:33.990
in that you've got this
incredible ability in a fairly

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:35.370
quick timeline--

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:37.230
I mean, 18 months
from start to finish--

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:39.490
to enrich this vocabulary.

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:41.470
I mean, we're not talking
about legislation,

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:42.969
which can get bogged
down through 20

00:39:42.969 --> 00:39:43.960
years of bureaucracy.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:48.420
We're talking about a
world that it prides itself

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:51.030
on its agility to act fast.

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:54.420
So that was how we did it.

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:58.460
We bullied them into it.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:39:59.820
Thank you, media.

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:02.840
MIKE UY: You ran a very
successful media campaign.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.280
You didn't bully anybody.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.019
Yes?

00:40:06.019 --> 00:40:08.310
AUDIENCE: What are your
thoughts on the inconsistencies

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:11.550
of the depiction of the
emoji submitted to Unicode

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:12.600
on the various platforms?

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.660
Obviously, like Apple,
Google, and Facebook

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:18.270
all have wildly different
depictions of the shoe.

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:20.820
Can you talk more
about your thoughts

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:25.110
and what you'd recommend, if
fragmentation is a good thing

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:29.454
or if you'd prefer consistency
in your next emoji submission?

00:40:29.454 --> 00:40:30.870
FLORIE HUTCHINSON:
I hate the fact

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:31.994
that they're all different.

00:40:31.994 --> 00:40:35.790
To me, it's oxymoronic
because emoji

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:39.210
are supposed to be instantly
recognizable between all

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:40.380
the platforms.

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:44.490
I would love nothing more than
to see it consistently applied.

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:46.350
That said, I recognize
that platforms

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:49.710
have a very distinct visual
and aesthetic language.

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:53.400
And so, you know,
Google has its own sort

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.990
of visual language versus Apple.

00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:57.330
And it would be
ridiculous for me

00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:00.090
to expect them to
somehow coordinate across

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:03.240
platforms and agree in
a consensus-style format

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:06.450
to one singular design.

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:09.810
I do think it's really funny
to think about how the design

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:10.980
aspect is rolled out.

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:12.540
I don't know if
you've noticed, say,

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:16.560
the jacket emoji
on Apple platform

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.475
looks eerily like a
Burberry trench coat.

00:41:19.475 --> 00:41:20.850
And then you think
about the fact

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:23.932
that Angela Ahrendts was the CEO
of Burberry for over a decade

00:41:23.932 --> 00:41:25.890
and is now in charge of
merchandising in Apple.

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:29.700
And you think, oh,
OK, I get this.

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:34.140
And so that jacket looks totally
different on Apple and Twitter.

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:37.710
And so it kind of to me
defies the very intent

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:41.430
behind emoji, which is I
send my flat shoe to someone

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:44.970
in Jaipur who uses a Samsung.

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:47.940
To me, those should
be the same images.

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:50.340
But again, I think that's a
coding and a brand problem

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:51.840
rather than--

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:55.360
in an ideal world,
it would be one.

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.310
AUDIENCE: I wanted
to ask your opinion

00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:02.620
on I've heard the argument that
emojis are actually taking us

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:05.260
back, evolutionarily
speaking, linguistically

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:10.060
to hieroglyphics, and that
it's a reductionist form

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:18.220
of language, and actually the
word-form language actually

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:22.660
allows us to
communicate more freely.

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:24.100
So I just didn't
know do you feel

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:28.430
like there is a parallel
between hieroglyphics

00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:29.680
FLORIE HUTCHINSON: Absolutely.

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:33.130
I think emoji are
just hieroglyphs 2.0

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:35.810
in terms of pictorial language.

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:37.810
I think the main difference
though is obviously,

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:41.140
hieroglyphs were
created before words

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:43.360
existed in sort of
the traditional,

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.840
as we know it sense.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:50.560
And I think in a way, if
you look at that slide

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:53.440
where they literally translated
Moby Dick into emoji,

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.180
no one is using
emoji in that way.

00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:59.950
Whether it reduces sort
of vocabulary acquisition,

00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:01.450
that's certainly
a concern of mine.

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:02.866
And it was actually
a conversation

00:43:02.866 --> 00:43:04.780
I had with a journalist
from "Newsweek,"

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:09.580
who said, do you know of any
linguists or sort of language

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:11.350
acquisition specialists
in childhood

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:14.230
who could talk to me
about sort of the downside

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:17.740
or the effects of emoji
on young brains in 0 to 5

00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:19.330
because we learn
80% of what we're

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:22.600
going to know our whole
life in that age group.

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:25.290
And I said, no, you
know, it's such a nascent

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:28.960
and embryonic state,
but no one has actually

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:31.120
done the research yet.

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:34.240
I think about the fact
that for our generation,

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:36.670
screen time-- is it
going to be like tobacco

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:37.770
the generation before?

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:39.520
We're all using it and
thinking it's fine.

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:42.215
And 20 years from now, all of
the studies and researchers

00:43:42.215 --> 00:43:44.590
are going to come out and be
like, how did you miss this?

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:46.870
How did you not notice
the nefarious effect

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:48.190
of these things on you?

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:51.070
And so I do wonder
whether children--

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:53.320
our children-- in
20, 30 year's time

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:56.200
are going to get the results
from all those academic studies

00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:00.100
that show that emoji
usage, screen time literacy

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.200
rates are plummeting.

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:07.490
I'm optimistic and I'd like to
think that it won't, but I'm

00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:08.740
not an academic in that field.

00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:11.920
I think it takes a sociologist
to figure that one out.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:15.940
MIKE UY: After the
swimsuit emoji,

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:18.379
is there anything else
top of mind or anything

00:44:18.379 --> 00:44:19.420
else you plan to work on?

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:21.545
Is this going to become
like a side career for you?

00:44:21.545 --> 00:44:22.970
FLORIE HUTCHINSON: I don't know.

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:24.970
There are a couple of
things that have been

00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:27.370
sort of percolating in my head.

00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:30.640
One obvious one, which I think
would be kind of a coding

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:34.480
nightmare, is that
obviously, the family emoji

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.550
stop at two kids.

00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:39.530
And clearly, I need
more than that.

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:43.510
So I'd love to see an emoji that
has two parents with four kids

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:48.610
and maybe get large families
lobbying for it with me.

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:50.290
Another one, which
again, I think

00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:53.930
is reflective of my worldview
is the play category

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:56.310
is completely missing.

00:44:56.310 --> 00:44:57.390
There aren't any slides.

00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:58.389
There aren't any swings.

00:44:58.389 --> 00:45:01.090
There aren't any seesaws,
which are very much

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:05.740
part of my weekend existence.

00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:08.170
And certainly, I've
been thinking a lot

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:10.090
about the sort of
natural disaster

00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:14.590
and natural catastrophe
category, which was sort of

00:45:14.590 --> 00:45:16.300
inspired by the mosquito emoji.

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:19.690
And that if we're going
to use these little images

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:26.410
to communicate on a broad,
massive, instantaneous level,

00:45:26.410 --> 00:45:29.470
can't we use it to alert
people to an earthquake,

00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:32.740
alert people to a tornado,
alert people to a hurricane,

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:34.480
and in one little
image, get people

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:38.170
evacuating quickly rather than
going through the Amber Alert

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:40.870
System, for example?

00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:47.110
It's exciting, but one of the
things that does sort of keep

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:51.550
me up is this idea of emoji
usage eventually being mined

00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:53.860
and used to profile people.

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:56.350
You know, like if
you use the fist bump

00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:59.560
and it's of a dark-skin
tone, will that

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:03.520
register you in some
capacity at an agency

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:06.610
and lump you into one box?

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:13.210
And so I think if I do another
emoji, it has to be important.

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:15.520
Like to me, the shoe
emoji was never about,

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.350
oh, I just want a shoe emoji.

00:46:17.350 --> 00:46:20.270
It was about everything else.

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:23.270
And I think it's easy to
lose sight of that intent,

00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:25.090
if you don't know the backstory.

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:32.140
But I say that, and yet I was
on the Unicode page last week

00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:35.800
and I noticed in the shortlisted
list was an emoji proposal

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:39.240
for fondue, which as someone who
is half Swiss, they designed it

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:40.740
with a little
[INAUDIBLE],, which is

00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:43.810
a traditional sort
of copper-orange pot

00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:45.550
handle with the two sticks.

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:46.930
And I loved it, you know.

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:49.930
Like the levity aspect
is one of the things

00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:53.170
I think that makes emoji
so attractive and fun.

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:55.900
And I was like, yes, I
hope it makes it because I

00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:57.390
want that fondue emoji.

00:46:57.390 --> 00:47:00.862
So you need to balance the two.

00:47:00.862 --> 00:47:02.320
MIKE UY: Well,
thank you very much.

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:04.370
You're certainly welcome
back here anytime at Google.

00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:04.820
FLORIE HUTCHINSON: Thank you.

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:06.736
MIKE UY: And we'd love
to hear more if there's

00:47:06.736 --> 00:47:08.302
other emoji that get approved.

00:47:08.302 --> 00:47:10.010
We'll certainly be
tracking them as well,

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:10.810
but thank you very much.

00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:10.960
FLORIE HUTCHINSON: Great.

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:11.459
Thank you.

00:47:11.459 --> 00:47:14.460
