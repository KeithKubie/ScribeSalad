00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
Our third question, student Redmars asks,

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.540
"Why did we choose Python?"

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.510
&gt;&gt;So, there are lots of languages we could have chosen--

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.940
The real reason for choosing Python is--

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.710
it is a very simple language, but it is also a language that is widely used,

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.950
and can very quickly get you on the path to building interesting programs.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.450
There are many, many programming languages.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.500
It is definitely important, and a great thing as you develop as a computer scientist

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.690
that you learn more and more languages.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.600
But, to start with a language that will be easy to learn, and still powerful--

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.000
Python is a great choice for that.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
There are certainly some other choices,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
but I happen to think Python is a good one for this class.
