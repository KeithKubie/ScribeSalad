(soothing music)

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.900
- We are very pleased, along
with the Graduate Council,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.930
to present Leon Wieseltier,
this year's speaker

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.780
in the lecture series.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.050
Leon Wieseltier, as you'll soon
hear, was born in Brooklyn.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.660
He attended the Yeshiva of Flatbush

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.910
and later Columbia University
and Oxford and Harvard

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.020
and is currently a member of the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.190
editorial board of the
Jewish Review of Books.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.910
Leon is an acclaimed
writer, critic, historian,

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.290
longstanding literary
editor of the New Republic.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.530
And since beginning the
beginning of his tenure there

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.740
in 1983, he's published
many influential articles

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.500
in the New Republic and
of course elsewhere.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.370
And for many years,
he's written the weekly

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.380
and very widely read Washington Diarist

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.200
and is author of several
critically acclaimed volumes,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.623
including Nuclear War, Nuclear
Peace, Against Identity,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.550
and of course his deeply
learned, deeply moving

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.960
and deeply lyrical work Kaddish,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.960
a meditation on the Jewish
prayer for the dead.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.040
Leon Wieseltier has also
published a number of translations

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.790
of the works of Yehuda Amichai

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.880
and other modern Hebrew
poets in the New Republic,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.340
the New York Times, and the New Yorker.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.550
Most recently he edited and
introduced a volume of Lionel

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.280
Trilling's works titled The

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.463
Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.700
Most importantly, I think,

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.238
Leon also appeared in The Sopranos.

00:02:26.238 --> 00:02:28.850
(audience laughs)

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.563
It doesn't require any
further explication.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.093
You may see why he was cast
in one of these roles shortly.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.130
All of his works are imbued
with a deep intelligence

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.560
and rapier like wit, so much
so that in the New York Times

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.020
feature article about Leon,
Sam Tanenhaus described him

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.720
as part Maimonides, part Oscar Wilde.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.610
Now I'm not sure exactly
how accurate that is,

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.570
but it is a wonderful way to be spoken of.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.844
This afternoon's talk is
entitled A Passion for Waiting,

00:02:59.844 --> 00:03:02.423
Messianism, History, and the Jews.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.190
After Amichai passed away in 2000, Leon,

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.530
together with Amichai's widow, Chana,

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.370
went through a treasure

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.360
trove of the poet's unpublished writings.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.820
In a fragment that Leon translated,

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.267
Amichai wrote the following,
and here is Leon's translation.

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:22.647
"As in the story of the
Jew who keeps the Sabbath

00:03:22.647 --> 00:03:25.067
"and finds a gold coin on the Sabbath

00:03:25.067 --> 00:03:27.777
"and does not wish to
touch it and stands over it

00:03:27.777 --> 00:03:29.977
"until the three stars that
announce the end of the

00:03:29.977 --> 00:03:32.557
"Sabbath have appeared in the sky.

00:03:32.557 --> 00:03:35.167
"I stand and I stand.

00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:37.147
"Oh, the pain in my legs.

00:03:37.147 --> 00:03:42.147
"I stand and I stand,
but where are my stars."

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.870
Maybe the stars represent
the awaited Messiah.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.520
I'm not sure.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.950
At any rate, this is how the
great modern Hebrew poets

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.510
so poignantly describe the
Jewish passion for waiting.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.430
Now it's time for us
to hear Leon Wieseltier

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.570
on that very subject.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.070
So please join me in welcoming

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.993
to UC Berkeley Leon Wieseltier.

00:04:03.062 --> 00:04:05.520
(audience applauds)

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.240
- Thank you, I'm very
honored to be giving the

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.340
Foerster Lecture on Human Immortality,

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.940
and I hope my words lift
you to a higher realm.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.350
It is one of the commonplaces
about Judaism, historical

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.830
and spiritual, that it was responsible

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.660
for the idea of the messiah.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.240
That messianism was Judaism's innovation

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.760
or Judaism's gift, a gift
that backfired on the giver

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.840
when it was acted upon by
those Jews who precisely

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.723
because they acted upon it
became known as Christians.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.170
But Jewish messianism, as many historians

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.120
and theologians have observed,

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.100
was in significant ways
divided against itself.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.550
In a people so given
over to messianic theory,

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.470
the scarcity of messianic
practice is striking.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.010
From the very beginning, there appeared

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.240
to be a contradiction between
the intensity of the Jewish

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.130
traditions interest in
the idea of the messiah

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.440
and the coolness of the
Jewish tradition toward

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.313
the prospect of the Messiah.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.650
This contradiction might be

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.490
formulated a little more sharply.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.960
For the Jews, the history
of messianism has been

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.780
the history of false messianism.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.530
It is a fact of singular
importance that the people

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.160
who invented the messiah has
never accepted a messiah.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.650
So the Jewish gift, if a
gift it was, was not merely

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.170
the idea of the messiah.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.090
It was the idea of the
messiah and the simultaneous

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.090
refusal to accept one, the
reluctance to be redeemed.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.100
This eschatological
skepticism, as I will argue,

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.680
was not merely a matter of
historical circumstance.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.620
Indeed, Jewish circumstance
might seem to have mandated

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.920
the opposite desire, the hunger

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.830
for a swift historical release.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.670
But the culture of a
minority, any minority,

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.620
or of an oppressed people,
any oppressed people,

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.040
cannot be adequately explained solely

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.000
by reference to its minoritarian status

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.690
or its experience of oppression.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.480
Even in adversity, people may
inwardly determine themselves.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.540
So I do not believe that the
messianic ideas of the Jews

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.540
can be reduced to the
circumstances of the Jews.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.200
Instead, I wish to show
that the hesitation

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:20.200
about the messiah was internal
to the messianic idea itself.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.450
In the Jewish tradition,
the longing for redemption

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.870
is regularly accompanied by a
suspicion of such a longing.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.070
More often than not, the
longing for redemption is

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.370
to be mastered rather than fulfilled.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.270
As the Israeli poet, Yehuda
Amichai once wrote in a poem

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.770
in the 1970s, (speaking foreign language).

00:06:43.917 --> 00:06:47.397
"I seek new beginnings
and find only changes."

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.900
For a believer of course, all
this is not really a problem.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.040
A believer would explain
that the distinction

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.730
between the idea of the
Messiah and the reality of the

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.980
Messiah is not really
a contradiction at all.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.910
The redeemers whom the Jews
have rejected were turned

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.930
away simply because they
were not the true redeemers,

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.300
since they did not meet the
strict and clear requirements

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.780
that the rabbis devised

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.573
for the evaluation of any
such eschatological claim.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.470
The intellectual consistency of this

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.490
rabbinical stubbornness was very powerful.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.590
Consider this passage from an
epistle by Jacob Sasportas,

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.750
the 17th century jurist
and polemicist who was

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.350
the great adversary of Sabbatai Zevi,

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.430
and one of the most unfairly maligned

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.810
figures in Jewish history.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.300
In 1666, Sasportas wrote from Hamburg

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.740
to the rabbis of Amsterdam, quote.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.570
Sometimes I will read
a little in the Hebrew.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.010
Otherwise I will give you
my translations of it.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:49.087
He wrote, quote, "Have you,
where have you seen it written

00:07:49.087 --> 00:07:52.617
"in any book that we are
obliged to believe that anybody

00:07:52.617 --> 00:07:55.947
"who says I am the messiah,
really is the messiah,

00:07:55.947 --> 00:07:59.237
"prior to his having behaved
in the manner that Maimonides,

00:07:59.237 --> 00:08:03.027
"in his code of law, specified
that messiahs will behave.

00:08:03.027 --> 00:08:06.857
"Everything depends on the
propriety of his actions.

00:08:06.857 --> 00:08:09.477
"Otherwise anybody who wants
the name of the messiah

00:08:09.477 --> 00:08:12.437
"can have it, if his
piety has been proven.

00:08:12.437 --> 00:08:14.047
"And there will be as many messiahs

00:08:14.047 --> 00:08:15.980
"as there are pious people."

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.500
Close quote.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.690
It was because he believed
in the Messiah that Sasportas

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:23.350
did not believe in Sabbatai Zevi.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.060
This is a perfectly representative

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.610
expression of the traditional standpoint.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:31.270
Opposition to a messiah is
not opposition to the Messiah.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.820
When a savior presents
himself who will meet the

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.520
requirements of saviorhood,
well then the Jews will

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.763
straightforwardly agree to be saved.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.310
But an unbeliever or, more
pertinently, a historian

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:46.030
cannot be satisfied by such an explanation

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.883
for the Jewish lack of
enthusiasm for redemption.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.850
He may seek a different kind
of explanation, a political

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.060
explanation for example,
according to which the power

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.430
of a messianic figure
posed to great a threat

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.210
to the power of the
rabbinical establishment.

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:04.760
In such a view, the contradiction
between Jewish theory

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.370
and Jewish practice in
the case of messianism

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.210
was the inevitable result
of the refusal of rabbinical

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:13.930
elites to entertain a
challenge to their authority.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:17.640
No religious establishment
welcomes a charismatic figure

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.493
or renewal of revelation.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.770
It is certainly true
that messianic activism

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.870
in the medieval and early
modern Jewish world was often

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.970
an expression of social
and theological defiance.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.900
And it is also true that there
existed a strong rabbinical

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.100
interest in the
discreditation of messiahs.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:40.060
But a purely social or political
explanation trivializes

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.800
the perplexity that
provoked the eschatological

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.693
skepticism of the rabbis.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.590
The contradiction between messianic theory

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.210
and messianic practice
was indeed an attempt

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:51.250
to avert a collision

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.970
between two types of authority in Judaism.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.110
But I would argue that the
aversion of that collision

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.700
was more than the interest of an elite.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.610
It was the interest of an
entire spiritual temperament.

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:02.980
And the short name for that

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.780
temperament is (speaking a
foreign language) or the law.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.250
The reluctance to be redeemed
is a startling thing.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.600
The Jews after all were in exile.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.540
And in many times and in many places,

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.620
exile meant also persecution.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.240
The wretched conditions in
which many Jewish communities

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.390
found themselves should have prepared them

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:26.490
to welcome a great reversal
of their misfortune.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.120
And yet the opposite was the case.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.760
The reluctance to be redeemed
was nothing less than

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.140
an indifference to their own happiness

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.940
or a refusal to confer
upon their happiness

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.853
centrality in their life.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.520
And the same, surprisingly
enough, may be said

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.260
about the messianic expectancy.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.270
One of the most striking
facts about Jewish messianism

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:51.300
is that there is no correlation
between eschatological

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.960
activity and the
experience of persecution.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.497
As Gershon Cohen long ago
observed, quote, "There is no

00:10:58.497 --> 00:11:00.507
"discernible connection between oppression

00:11:00.507 --> 00:11:02.357
"and messianic movements.

00:11:02.357 --> 00:11:04.277
"Jewish messianic movements were not

00:11:04.277 --> 00:11:06.347
"the religion of the oppressed.

00:11:06.347 --> 00:11:09.627
"The Crusades, the Almohad
invasion, the expulsions

00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:13.077
"from England and France,
the blood libels, the Pastora

00:11:13.077 --> 00:11:15.777
"onslaughts, and the
persecutions at the time of the

00:11:15.777 --> 00:11:18.947
"Black Death, indeed even
the expulsion from Spain

00:11:18.947 --> 00:11:21.367
"and the (speaking foreign
language) massacres did not

00:11:21.367 --> 00:11:24.677
"generate a single messianic movement.

00:11:24.677 --> 00:11:27.947
"Conversely, all the
messianic efforts made in Iraq

00:11:27.947 --> 00:11:31.477
"and Persia, and above all
in Spain and North Africa

00:11:31.477 --> 00:11:33.067
"were undertaken in areas

00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:35.627
"and in periods of relative stability."

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.290
Now, subsequent scholarship
has somewhat complicated

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:42.640
Cohen's picture of the
distribution of messianic energy

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.910
across the various Jewish cultures.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:47.580
But even if there were
some messianic stirrings

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.560
in the French and Germanic
lands, they were exceedingly rare

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.900
and disproportionately fewer than the

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.720
miseries of Ashkenazic
experience might have warranted.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.970
Cohen's main point still stands.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.100
Jewish messianism cannot
be properly understood

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.340
simply as a response
to harsh circumstances.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.510
It was not chiefly a social

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:10.690
or political or economic phenomenon.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.683
It was a religious phenomenon.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:16.580
The expression of a spiritual temperament

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:20.210
within Judaism that continues
to clash to this day

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:22.420
with a different and more
normative temperament

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.803
within the same faith.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.950
The clash between the Jewish Adventists

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:31.270
and the Jewish anti-Adventists
may be described as follows.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.980
For the Adventists, or those
who hunger to experience

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.990
the climax, redemption
is required for meaning.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:41.330
For the anti-Adventists, or
those who actually hunger not

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.860
to experience the climax,
redemption is not required

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.810
for meaning, and sufficient
meaning exists prior

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:52.000
to redemption in the
fallen or punished state.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.810
Redemption, after all, promised an

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:56.090
exchange of one reality for another,

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:58.650
a transformation in totality.

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:00.740
In the words of the
great messianic thinker,

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:03.580
Yehudah ben Bezalel el
Loew, the Maharal of Prague,

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.507
quote, "The coming of the
Messiah represents the

00:13:06.507 --> 00:13:09.847
"creation of a new reality
and will cause the reality

00:13:09.847 --> 00:13:11.960
"that proceeded it to be lost."

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:12.880
Close.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.670
It was the transformative
nature of redemption,

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:19.110
its totalism that posed the problem.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:23.060
Historical transformation
for the Jews has two faces.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.820
The arrival of the Messiah
threatened the Jews not only

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.730
with a consummation of meaning,

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:30.203
but also with an expiration of meaning.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.800
The dream of a perfect
future has always served as

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.830
the standpoint for the most damning

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.670
indictments of the imperfect present.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.440
For all its failings, however,
the world in which the

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.390
rabbis found themselves
did not seem too paltry

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:49.630
or too poor to nourish
the soul or the community.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:52.100
The world as they found
it was not everything,

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.670
but it was also not nothing.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.900
Their eschatological skepticism
may be properly understood,

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.040
in fact, as a defense of
the sufficiency of their

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.380
circumstances, for the significance
that they were enjoined

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:07.740
by tradition to impute to their lives.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:11.160
And this sense of the
sufficiency of the actual world

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.470
is foundational to Jewish
civilization in ways that have

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.423
not yet been properly explored.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.790
Now the rejection of redemption
reveals an extraordinary

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:25.830
confidence about one's spiritual
and existential situation.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:29.980
And the proof of this confidence
in Judaism was the law.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.400
The obligation to
perform the Commandments,

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.840
ethical commandments, ritual commandments,

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.050
implied that this imperfect
world is not so imperfect

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:42.800
that the ideal of perfection
is impossible within it.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.280
The premise of Halacha life

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.700
was that the absolute is
here and now adequately,

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.500
if not completely available.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:54.600
Jews of all people resolutely
do not hate the world.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.250
And the Halacha life may be seen

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.010
as a regular rejection of such a hatred.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.170
If the Jews preferred to wait
it is because they did not

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.610
lack the means with which to begin,

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:08.000
because they already found
themselves in the middle.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.570
They could be patient for the end,

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.650
because they were already in
the thick of an engagement,

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:16.410
a steady and stable
engagement with the eternal.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.780
Indeed, it was impatience that was deemed

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.450
by the rabbis to be the supreme distortion

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:24.409
that messianism visited upon Judaism.

00:15:24.409 --> 00:15:27.527
Jews as is well known are
forbidden by the Talmud quote,

00:15:27.527 --> 00:15:30.580
"To force the end and
to calculate the end."

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.430
They are forbidden, that is,
to repudiate the present,

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.010
which is the only improper time

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:37.480
for moral life and ritual life.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.993
For the rabbis, the fear of the
Messiah was the fear of sin.

00:15:42.526 --> 00:15:45.276
They viewed the rupturing of
history as the rupturing of the

00:15:45.276 --> 00:15:46.590
ritual and ethical framework.

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.190
And the law as they knew
it, that framework as

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:52.300
they observed it, was a
theater of religious meaning

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:56.400
more desirable than any
glamorous abrogation of it.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.790
Thus the four cubits of
Halacha were capacious enough

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:02.770
and strenuous enough and enchanted enough

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:06.220
and the fifth cubit of the
Messiah could be resisted.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.680
The overwhelming Jewish
presence was for waiting.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.440
The Jews had a passion for waiting.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.880
I take this phrase from Walter Benjamin,

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.767
who once wrote, quote,
"That one cannot appreciate

00:16:17.767 --> 00:16:21.200
"the charm of a cafe unless
one has a passion for waiting."

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.290
Close quote.

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:25.090
It's actually a very good
sentence to speak in Berkeley.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.630
I wish to suggest that
one cannot appreciate the

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:31.900
charm of the Messiah unless
one has a passion for waiting,

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.453
at least if one is a Jew.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.810
There is something very
radical and hugely beautiful

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:39.290
about such constancy,

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.020
about preferring tradition to salvation.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.350
And this preference is
stated with surprising

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:47.900
but not entirely adequately
remarked upon candor

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.260
throughout the medieval
and modern tradition.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.030
Let us follow it briefly,
beginning in 1263

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:57.460
in a remarkably blunt
statement about messianism made

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.850
by Nachmanides on the second day of the

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:02.890
dramatic Disputation at Barcelona.

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.940
Nachmanides addressed his
words directly to the King,

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:09.110
James I of Aragon, who was in attendance

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:11.230
and keenly followed the discussion.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.777
Quote, "My Lord King hear me.

00:17:13.777 --> 00:17:17.547
"The essence of our law and our
teaching is not the Messiah.

00:17:17.547 --> 00:17:20.567
"You are worth as much
to me as the Messiah.

00:17:20.567 --> 00:17:23.027
"You are a king, he is a king.

00:17:23.027 --> 00:17:24.867
"You are the sovereign of your nation.

00:17:24.867 --> 00:17:26.967
"He is the sovereign of Israel.

00:17:26.967 --> 00:17:29.617
"For the Messiah is nothing
other than a king of flesh

00:17:29.617 --> 00:17:31.790
"and blood like yourself."

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:32.623
Close quote.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.740
Nachmanides point in this
exchange was not only

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:39.060
to diminish the centrality
of messianism and Judaism.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.490
He proceeded to a still
more startling remark,

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:43.180
again addressing the King.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:47.357
Quote, "When I serve my Creator
by your leave in your realm

00:17:47.357 --> 00:17:49.607
"in the conditions of
exile and persecution

00:17:49.607 --> 00:17:52.647
"and servitude in which we
suffer the scorn of the nation's

00:17:52.647 --> 00:17:54.967
"daily, my reward is great.

00:17:54.967 --> 00:17:58.177
"For I am making of my own
body and offering to my God,

00:17:58.177 --> 00:18:00.667
"and therefore I am more
and more worthy of life

00:18:00.667 --> 00:18:02.287
"in the world to come.

00:18:02.287 --> 00:18:04.847
"But when a king of Israel,
a king of my own faith

00:18:04.847 --> 00:18:07.407
"will rule the world,
and I will perforce abide

00:18:07.407 --> 00:18:08.867
"by the laws of the Jews,

00:18:08.867 --> 00:18:11.550
"my reward will not be so considerable."

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:12.950
Close quote.

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:14.470
Nachmanides was here arguing

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:17.080
for the spiritual utility of adversity.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:20.290
It was almost an argument for exile.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.460
The passage is especially surprising

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.770
in the light of
Nachmanides' own immigration

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.660
or flight to the holy land

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.630
in the aftermath of the
Barcelona Disputation.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.770
And it reverberates
interestingly for present day

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:34.010
discussions about Judaism in a Zionist

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:36.590
and allegedly post-Zionist world.

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:39.520
But nevermind its contemporary
relevance for now,

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.250
it is Nachmanides'
circumscription of the messianic

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:45.390
idea that I want to
recommend to your attention.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:48.050
In this avowal of the
great rabbi we find, again,

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:50.290
the Jewish attachment to the world,

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.780
the insistence that the
observance of the Commandments

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.610
as the Jews' highest purpose

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:58.720
and the confidence that
adversity and exile of whatever

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.720
intensity do not impair the Jews' ability

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.693
to fulfill that purpose.

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:07.580
Some of Nachmanides'
bluntness in this exchange

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.500
may be attributed, of course,
to the charged context

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.470
in which he was speaking.

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:14.830
The discussion of messianism
throughout the medieval

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:18.490
tradition was frequently
accompanied by harsh echoes

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:21.330
of the disputation between
Jews and Christians

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.160
about the interpretation of biblical

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.610
and rabbinical eschatology.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.700
Yet it is clear from his other
writings that Nachmanides

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.010
relaxation of messianism was not

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:34.470
merely a polemical or diplomatic matter.

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:38.490
It was rather an external
expression of his internally

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:42.803
considered view of the place
of the eschaton in Jewish life.

00:19:42.803 --> 00:19:43.950
(speaking foreign language)

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:46.170
Or the Book of Redemption,
which he appears

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:47.430
to have composed also

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:50.730
in the early 1260s, is not
addressed to the Christian

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:54.400
authorities of Spain but
to his own Jewish brethren.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.810
And it includes this
reflection on what he calls,

00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:00.270
quote, "The essence of our
longing for the messianic age."

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:03.677
Quote, "To be sure, we
cling to the prospect of the

00:20:03.677 --> 00:20:06.367
"messianic redemption,
because it is a well known

00:20:06.367 --> 00:20:09.787
"truth expounded by our
scholars and our prophets.

00:20:09.787 --> 00:20:12.997
"And we attest to its truth,
and we refute the words of the

00:20:12.997 --> 00:20:14.777
"heretics with the proof of its truth,

00:20:14.777 --> 00:20:17.417
"and we rejoice in it for
the reason that we hope

00:20:17.417 --> 00:20:19.967
"that this redemption will
bring us closer to God.

00:20:19.967 --> 00:20:24.757
"But no God help you that were
we to decide in our hearts

00:20:24.757 --> 00:20:27.377
"that our sins and the
sins of our fathers have

00:20:27.377 --> 00:20:30.637
"disqualified us from the
promises of consolation.

00:20:30.637 --> 00:20:34.837
"And so the exile will lengthen
and endure without end.

00:20:34.837 --> 00:20:38.617
"And were we also to conclude
that God wished to torment us

00:20:38.617 --> 00:20:41.847
"for his own reasons or for
our own good in this world

00:20:41.847 --> 00:20:45.587
"by subjugating us to the
nations, none of this would

00:20:45.587 --> 00:20:48.827
"do any harm to the
foundations of our faith.

00:20:48.827 --> 00:20:53.017
"For the purpose of our reward
is not the messianic era

00:20:53.017 --> 00:20:55.637
"or to enjoy the fruits of that holy land

00:20:55.637 --> 00:20:59.557
"or the hot springs of Tiberius
or other such pleasures.

00:20:59.557 --> 00:21:01.827
"Even the restoration of the sacrifices

00:21:01.827 --> 00:21:05.807
"and the services at the
temple is not our highest wish.

00:21:05.807 --> 00:21:08.937
"No, the object of our
desire and of our gaze is

00:21:08.937 --> 00:21:11.187
"the world to come, the Foerster Lecture

00:21:11.187 --> 00:21:15.017
"in Human Immortality and
the delight of the soul

00:21:15.017 --> 00:21:17.167
"in what is known as the Garden of Eden

00:21:17.167 --> 00:21:19.990
"and the rescue of the soul
from the punishment of Hell."

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.823
Close quote.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:24.330
So according to Maimonides,
the belief in the Messiah

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:26.260
has a place in the Jewish faith,

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:29.000
but it does not have pride of place.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.680
The objective of the
faith is not redemption.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.313
The objective of the redemption is faith.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.960
The idea of the supreme
priority of messianism

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.300
for Judaism is not an
ancient or medieval idea.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:45.840
It is a modern idea, developed
and promoted by scholars

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.460
and philosophers who worked

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.170
in an age of historicism and revolution.

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:52.640
But that theme is for another day.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.370
What I would like to stress
here is that one of the most

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:58.330
striking elements of
Nachmanides' statement is his

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:02.820
unequivocal promotion of the
spiritual over the historical.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.720
And the rabbis' eschatological
patience strikes one

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.590
with even greater force a few pages later

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:12.360
in his own treatise, where
he records his conviction

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.347
that (speaking foreign language).

00:22:15.147 --> 00:22:18.040
"We are ourselves living
in the end of days."

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.253
Perhaps he even enjoyed the hot
springs of Tiberius himself.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.980
This historical patience
that I've used Nachmanides

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:29.680
to illustrate had a long career
in the history of the Jews.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.810
I will give some examples
so as to gradually build

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:36.780
my portrait of this
un-messianic messianism.

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.210
The same calming influence may be detected

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:42.040
in (speaking foreign language)
or the light of the Lord,

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.500
which Hasdai Crescas, the fiercely

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.560
anti-Maimonidean thinker and one of the

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.470
great statesmen of the
Jewish community in Spain

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:53.120
completed in Zaragoza in 1410.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.840
(speaking foreign language)
was the first part,

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.180
the philosophical part of Crescas'

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.130
projected systematic treatment of

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:01.610
Jewish beliefs and practices.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:03.500
In the third section of his book,

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.810
Crescas lists those articles of faith,

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:08.517
quote, "That we have seen
fit to include among the

00:23:08.517 --> 00:23:11.247
"cornerstones of the
Torah so that the belief

00:23:11.247 --> 00:23:14.857
"in them is mandatory and the
denial of them is a rebellion

00:23:14.857 --> 00:23:17.357
"so enormous that the denier must be

00:23:17.357 --> 00:23:20.090
"counted among the heretics."

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:21.130
Close quote.

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:24.000
Among those necessary
and inalienable beliefs,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.040
Crescas elected not to include
the belief in the Messiah.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.760
Indeed, he could not have been clearer

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.420
about the loss of its priority.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.137
Quote, "In the absence of the Messiah,

00:23:34.137 --> 00:23:37.290
"the reality of the Torah
is plainly warranted."

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:38.820
Close quote.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:43.170
This moderation of the appetite
for salvation was expressed

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:45.910
by a man whose own son had been murdered

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:49.663
by the anti-Jewish mob
in Barcelona in 1391.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.470
Joseph Albo was a student
of Hasdai Crescas.

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.550
In 1413, he played a prominent
role in the Disputation

00:23:57.550 --> 00:24:00.770
at Tortosa, the longest and
the most troubling of all

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:03.370
the debates that the
medieval Christians imposed

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:05.550
upon the medieval Jews.

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:08.260
In the Latin protocol
of that confrontation,

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.117
it is recorded, quote,
"That is, if in a great rage

00:24:11.117 --> 00:24:13.747
"Rabbi Joseph spoke as follows.

00:24:13.747 --> 00:24:15.997
"Suppose it were proved
to me that the Messiah had

00:24:15.997 --> 00:24:19.357
"already arrived, I would
not consider myself a better

00:24:19.357 --> 00:24:20.940
"or worse Jew for it."

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.340
Close.

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:26.150
So one's Judaism does not stand
or fall on one's messianism.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:28.960
Albo was making the same
point at the debate in Tortosa

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.700
that Nachmanides had made a
century and a half earlier

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.780
at the debate in Barcelona.

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:37.070
And Albo's account of
messianism, like Nachmanides,

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:40.360
was not dictated solely
by political pressure.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.220
In 1425, in Castile, he
completed his great work

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.520
on Jewish belief (speaking
foreign language)

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.370
or The Book of Principles.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:50.980
It was written in part
to fortify Jewish faith

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.830
in the wake of Tortosa,
which had been the cause of a

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:57.033
significant number of Jewish
conversions to Christianity.

00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:59.970
Near the conclusion of his treatise,

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:03.263
Albo discusses the place
of messianism in Judaism.

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:08.437
(speaking foreign language)

00:25:20.907 --> 00:25:23.197
"Whoever does not believe
in the coming of the Messiah

00:25:23.197 --> 00:25:24.717
"denies the words of the prophets

00:25:24.717 --> 00:25:26.897
"and violates a positive Commandment.

00:25:26.897 --> 00:25:29.167
"And yet the belief in
the coming of the Messiah

00:25:29.167 --> 00:25:31.657
"is not so fundamental that the failure

00:25:31.657 --> 00:25:34.917
"to believe it will annul
the Torah in its entirety.

00:25:34.917 --> 00:25:37.197
"The belief in the future
reward is obligatory

00:25:37.197 --> 00:25:39.377
"for all who profess the divine Torah

00:25:39.377 --> 00:25:41.797
"and whoever denies it is heretic.

00:25:41.797 --> 00:25:44.467
"But an individual who
believes that the future reward

00:25:44.467 --> 00:25:48.527
"accrues only to the soul
and only in the world to come

00:25:48.527 --> 00:25:51.897
"or accrues to the body only
at the resurrection of the dead

00:25:51.897 --> 00:25:54.487
"and denies that the future
reward will transpire

00:25:54.487 --> 00:25:56.947
"in this world, that is, with
the coming of the Messiah,

00:25:56.947 --> 00:25:59.397
"he is not considered a heretic."

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:04.400
In Nachmanides, in Crescas, in
Albo, the survival of Judaism

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.440
was more vital than the
arrival of its redeemer.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.070
And this medieval disposition
had a long subsequent

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.690
history in the early modern centuries.

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:15.570
In Italy in the latter
half of the 16th century,

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:18.310
at the conclusion of a
comprehensive and skeptical

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:20.820
review of the traditions
of messianic calculation

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:24.250
in Judaism, Azariah dei
Rossi cited Nachmanides

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:28.230
demotion of messianism as
the last word on the subject.

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:30.438
In his revolutionary work,
(speaking foreign language)

00:26:30.438 --> 00:26:33.130
or the Light of the Eyes,
the book that inaugurated

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:35.430
the critical study of Jewish history,

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:37.927
Azariah called the
Nachmidean position, quote,

00:26:37.927 --> 00:26:40.940
"Dearer than gold and sweeter than honey."

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.670
And after quoting it at great length,

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:44.597
he epitomized it this way, quote,

00:26:44.597 --> 00:26:46.957
"Our goal is not the messianic era.

00:26:46.957 --> 00:26:49.143
"It is only the keeping of the Torah.

00:26:50.077 --> 00:26:53.347
"Whether our redemption comes
soon or whether it comes late

00:26:53.347 --> 00:26:56.137
"when we least expect
it, we will not deviate

00:26:56.137 --> 00:26:58.667
"from any obligations of the law."

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:03.010
The principle of historical
composure makes a forceful

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:06.680
appearance elsewhere in
the 16th century in Greece.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:10.520
There, Azariah's contemporary,
Solomon ben Isaac Halevi,

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.657
known as (speaking foreign language),

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:14.920
a great preacher and communal leader

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.730
and the grandson of exiles from Portugal,

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:21.060
asserted in a sermon in
Evora synagogue in Salonika,

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:24.117
a congregation of
Portuguese Jews, that quote,

00:27:24.117 --> 00:27:26.987
"It is commonly known
that we do not uphold the

00:27:26.987 --> 00:27:30.097
"Torah of Moses so that
the Messiah will come.

00:27:30.097 --> 00:27:32.917
"Quite the contrary, we
believe that the Messiah will

00:27:32.917 --> 00:27:35.587
"come, because we uphold
the Torah of Moses.

00:27:35.587 --> 00:27:38.617
"Even if we conjecture that
the Messiah will not come,

00:27:38.617 --> 00:27:42.030
"Moses is truth and his Torah is truth."

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.300
The point could not be clearer.

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:48.657
In a sermon in the winter of
1573, Solomon remarked, quote,

00:27:48.657 --> 00:27:51.287
"Many times I have preached
to the populace that a man's

00:27:51.287 --> 00:27:54.137
"reason for being a Jew
is not that in the future

00:27:54.137 --> 00:27:56.017
"the Messiah will arrive.

00:27:56.017 --> 00:27:58.567
"Whether the Messiah
does or does not arrive,

00:27:58.567 --> 00:28:01.417
"an individual of Israel
is obligated to be a Jew

00:28:01.417 --> 00:28:03.990
"by the intrinsic truth of Judaism."

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.823
Close quote.

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:08.450
And he proceeded to warn
against the corrupting

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:10.870
effects of the messianic aspiration,

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:14.597
again echoing Nachmanides,
quote, "The reason that we hope

00:28:14.597 --> 00:28:16.817
"for our Messiah who we
do believe will appear

00:28:16.817 --> 00:28:19.347
"in the future is not
that we will then rule

00:28:19.347 --> 00:28:22.277
"in the holy land and acquire
dominion of the nations

00:28:22.277 --> 00:28:24.037
"and not that we will then feast

00:28:24.037 --> 00:28:25.507
"and generally please ourselves

00:28:25.507 --> 00:28:27.287
"with the pleasures of the world.

00:28:27.287 --> 00:28:29.607
"The sole reason is that
we will then be able

00:28:29.607 --> 00:28:32.467
"to serve God by fulfilling
all his commandments

00:28:32.467 --> 00:28:35.608
"that require our presence
in the holy land."

00:28:35.608 --> 00:28:37.120
(speaking foreign language)

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:40.040
The commandments that can be
fulfilled only in the land.

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.190
That is the sum total of Solomon's

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:44.083
idea of the messianic utility.

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:47.100
It was just as well that Solomon lectured

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.870
on the limits of messianism
often during the year,

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:53.210
because on that particular
Shabbat his cautionary words

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:55.730
about a historical
convulsion were defeated

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:57.870
by a natural convulsion.

00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:00.940
In a brief preface to his
sermon, Solomon recorded

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:04.377
an extraordinary event,
quote, "As I was preaching,

00:29:04.377 --> 00:29:08.047
"the ground shook powerfully
and only I did not feel the

00:29:08.047 --> 00:29:10.917
"earthquake owing to the
intensity of my devotion

00:29:10.917 --> 00:29:12.857
"to the words of the Torah.

00:29:12.857 --> 00:29:14.437
"Most of the people who were present

00:29:14.437 --> 00:29:16.570
"in the synagogue rose and fled."

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:17.720
Close quote.

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:20.790
And so he taught the great
listen eschatological patience

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:21.623
to an empty room.

00:29:21.623 --> 00:29:22.660
(audience laughs)

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.730
He insisted that the world
would not turn upside down

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:27.983
even as it was turning upside down.

00:29:29.841 --> 00:29:32.730
In 1625, Rabbi (speaking
foreign language) preached

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:34.680
a sermon on the holiday of Sukkot

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.360
to his congregation in Amsterdam.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.600
The congregation was
comprised of Jews who had

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.720
once lived as Christians in Portugal

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:44.400
and in Amsterdam had replaced
their false Christian

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.720
identity with a true and in some ways

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.260
quite virulent Jewish identity.

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:51.140
Some years later Mortera acquired

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.790
a brilliant pupil called Baruch Spinoza.

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:57.240
And in 1656, he played a
role and thereby achieved a

00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:01.640
certain modern notoriety in
Spinoza's excommunication.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:05.300
In his sermon of 1625, the
text of which was only recently

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.750
discovered, Mortera pauses in
the middle of a philological

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:11.440
discussion of the name
of the city of Jerusalem

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.704
to make this ringing declaration, quote.

00:30:14.704 --> 00:30:18.621
(speaking in foreign language)

00:30:26.773 --> 00:30:29.087
"Our perfection and our
greatness do not depend

00:30:29.087 --> 00:30:31.187
"on the greatness of Jerusalem.

00:30:31.187 --> 00:30:33.767
"If the Messiah comes or if
the Messiah does not come,

00:30:33.767 --> 00:30:36.407
"we are Jews and all
that concerns us is the

00:30:36.407 --> 00:30:37.917
"observance of the Torah."

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:41.560
Please note, again, that
Mortera has not denied

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:46.083
the belief in the Messiah, but
he has decidedly demoted it.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.650
In the 19th century, Rabbi Moses Sofer,

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:51.250
the great jurist in Pressburg

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:54.010
and the most brilliant enemy
of modernity that Judaism

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:55.970
ever produced, reprised this

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:59.410
tradition of moderation about salvation.

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:02.510
In a response some on the
question of dogma in Judaism,

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:05.420
Sofer declared that the
belief in the Messiah is an

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:09.100
important Jewish belief but
not an essential Jewish belief,

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.847
quote, "It is impossible
for me to believe that our

00:31:11.847 --> 00:31:14.487
"redemption is one of the
foundations of our faith

00:31:14.487 --> 00:31:16.047
"so that if this stone is removed,

00:31:16.047 --> 00:31:19.167
"the wall will come tumbling
down, heaven forfend.

00:31:19.167 --> 00:31:22.677
"Even were we to say God forbid
that our sins have warranted

00:31:22.677 --> 00:31:25.487
"that God condemn us to an eternal exile,

00:31:25.487 --> 00:31:26.647
"as Rabi Akiva said

00:31:26.647 --> 00:31:29.507
"about the 10 tribes that
are banished forever.

00:31:29.507 --> 00:31:32.347
"Is this a sufficient reason
to throw off the yoke of heaven

00:31:32.347 --> 00:31:35.770
"and tamper with even the
smallest detail of the law."

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:36.980
Close quote.

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:40.400
Sofer penned those words
in the spring of 1836

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.470
when the air was thick with expectation

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:46.620
about the year 1840, a year
whose messianic potential

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.550
had been proclaimed by no less a source

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:50.053
than the Zohar itself.

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:53.870
I will conclude this tour
and many more stops could've

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:57.940
been made on it in the 20th
century when the cause of Jewish

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:01.840
inexcitability was taken up
most memorably by a non-legal

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:05.180
thinker and a secular Jew
who nonetheless thought

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:08.400
obsessively and tormentedly about the law.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.000
I am referring of course to Kafka.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.590
In his Notebooks for 1917, 1918,

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:16.877
there appears this aphorism,
quote, "There are two human

00:32:16.877 --> 00:32:19.477
"sins from which all the others derive,

00:32:19.477 --> 00:32:21.837
"impatience and indolence.

00:32:21.837 --> 00:32:23.757
"It was because of impatience that they

00:32:23.757 --> 00:32:25.587
"were expelled from paradise.

00:32:25.587 --> 00:32:28.637
"It is because of indolence
that they do not return.

00:32:28.637 --> 00:32:32.477
"Yet perhaps there is only
one major sin, impatience.

00:32:32.477 --> 00:32:34.797
"Because of impatience,
they were expelled,

00:32:34.797 --> 00:32:38.130
"because of impatience,
they do not return."

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:41.487
And later, in a famous
paradox, Kafka wrote,

00:32:41.487 --> 00:32:44.837
"The Messiah will come only
when he is no longer necessary.

00:32:44.837 --> 00:32:47.647
"He will come only on the
day after his arrival.

00:32:47.647 --> 00:32:51.107
"He will come not on the last
day, but on the very last."

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:56.040
All these Jewish thinkers
believed in the Messiah.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.890
And all of them were content
for the Messiah to tarry.

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:03.740
For all of them redemption
was in some way redundant.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:06.330
And this feeling of the
redundancy of redemption

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:10.060
I want to suggest is one of the
defining achievements of the

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:13.613
Jewish tradition and one of
the conditions of its vitality.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.770
The passion for waiting
was owed then in part

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:20.640
to an anxiety about discontinuity.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.950
But this anxiety was
a measure of strength,

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:24.860
not a measure of weakness.

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.560
This strength was expressed also

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.430
within the traditions
of Jewish messianism.

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:30.440
There is, of course,

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.720
a great diversity of
eschatological views in Judaism.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.920
I want to be absolutely clear about this.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.470
And not all of them
reflect the even temper

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:40.740
about the end that I have been describing.

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:44.740
There were also Jews who
burned with salvific desire.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.100
There was an old strain of
Jewish messianism that was

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:50.030
militantly utopian and
militantly apocalyptic

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:52.030
and dreamed of discontinuity

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.993
and thirsted for a new beginning.

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:57.810
This new beginning would be
announced by a number of signs

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:01.490
and foremost among them was
the abrogation of the law.

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:03.070
Antinomianism is an old

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:06.720
and recurring feature of
apocalypticism in Judaism.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.460
The impatience with history
was frequently expressed

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.710
as an impatience with law.

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:15.380
In the Age of Redemption, certain
laws will become obsolete.

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.410
The Talmud explains that the Hebrew word

00:34:17.410 --> 00:34:20.630
for pig, (speaking foreign
language), a forbidden meat,

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:22.887
was given because, quote, "In the future,

00:34:22.887 --> 00:34:24.898
"God will restore it to Israel."

00:34:24.898 --> 00:34:28.020
(speaking foreign language)

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:30.510
The entire system of
law may even be replaced

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:32.330
with a (speaking foreign language)

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:35.470
or a messianic law, whatever that is.

00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:37.820
For the apocalypticists,
there was an essential

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.920
tension between law and redemption.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:43.040
And they were prepared to
overthrow their present duty

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.380
for their future happiness.

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:48.040
Sholo maintained that this
tension was characteristic

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.940
not only of Jewish
apocalypticism but also more

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:53.380
generally of Jewish messianism.

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.490
Rabbinic authority and messianic authority

00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:57.483
could not but clash he wrote.

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:01.340
In this regard, Sholom claimed too much.

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:04.570
For the striking fact about
apocalypticism in Judaism

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:08.530
is that it was not remotely
coterminous with messianism.

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:11.260
The more prevalent, if
less exciting Jewish belief

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:14.190
in the Messiah was not
an expectation of the

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:16.080
disruption of the system of meaning

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.820
in which the community already lived.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:21.440
It was Maimonides who
established this historical

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.333
sobriety most definitively.

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:26.840
Unlike many of the authorities
that I have just cited,

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:30.230
Maimonides emphatically included
the belief in the Messiah

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:32.470
among the foundations of Judaism.

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:35.930
It was 12th of the 13
principles that comprised

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:39.630
in his controversial catechism
the dogmas of Judaism.

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:42.690
And yet his interpretation
of messianism was a

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:46.600
long instruction in
eschatological equilibrium.

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.972
In the famous last chapters of
his great code of Jewish law,

00:35:49.972 --> 00:35:51.900
Maimonides treats first the Messiah

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.010
and then the Messianic AQge.

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:57.307
About the Messiah he writes,
quote, "Do not assume that the

00:35:57.307 --> 00:35:59.797
"Messiah must perform signs and miracles

00:35:59.797 --> 00:36:02.397
"or introduce any new thing into the world

00:36:02.397 --> 00:36:05.097
"or resurrect the dead or the like.

00:36:05.097 --> 00:36:07.737
"For the laws and the
statutes of our Torah

00:36:07.737 --> 00:36:09.857
"are for always and for all time.

00:36:09.857 --> 00:36:12.820
"There is no adding to them
and no subtracting from them."

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.140
Close quote.

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:17.420
The anti-antinomianism
could not be more plain.

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:21.410
Eschatology here finds its
absolute limit in the law.

00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:24.130
Not only is the abrogation
of the law not a sign of the

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:27.500
appearance of the Messiah, it
is a sign that the appearance

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:32.060
of the Messiah was a false
one, an illusion, a hoax.

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:35.260
In the uncensored version
of this chapter of his code

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:37.380
which includes an
explicit refutation of the

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:40.760
messianic pretensions of
Jesus, Maimonides makes the

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:44.400
supremacy of Halacha and its
role as the proper context

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.660
for the consideration of the

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:48.260
end of history completely clear.

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:51.610
When the Messiah arrives, he
declares, those who maintained

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:53.670
that he would nullify
the law, who said, quote,

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:55.947
"That the Commandments were
true, but they have lost their

00:36:55.947 --> 00:36:57.870
"validity and are no longer binding."

00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:58.790
Close quote.

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:01.677
Will, quote, "Recant and
realize that they have inherited

00:37:01.677 --> 00:37:03.910
"nothing but lies from their fathers."

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:05.270
Close quote.

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:08.790
And this indissolubility of
law is not only historical,

00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:10.730
it is also cosmic.

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:13.460
Maimonides begins the next
chapter, which is the final

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.060
chapter of his code,
with these exceedingly

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:19.278
sober and naturalistic words.

00:37:19.278 --> 00:37:22.945
(speaking foreign language)

00:37:30.857 --> 00:37:33.217
"Do not assume that in
the days of the Messiah

00:37:33.217 --> 00:37:35.707
"any of the laws of
nature will be annulled

00:37:35.707 --> 00:37:37.597
"or that any new thing will be introduced

00:37:37.597 --> 00:37:39.577
"into the order of creation.

00:37:39.577 --> 00:37:42.707
"The world will follow
its customary course."

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.960
For the Messianic Age to be experienced as

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.970
the fulfillment of what came before it,

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:52.014
some continuity had to be necessary.

00:37:52.014 --> 00:37:54.530
Maimonides made the
Messiah less frightening

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:57.380
by making the Messiah less revolutionary.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.850
By assuring the community
that upon the arrival of the

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:04.850
Messiah, their world would
still be recognizable to them.

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:08.190
In the concluding part of
his code, Maimonides famously

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:10.810
cited, as the correct
definition of the messianic

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:13.040
difference, the remark in the Talmud

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:16.880
by the sage Shmuel in the
late 2nd or early 3rd century

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.607
that, quote, "The sole difference
between the present age

00:38:19.607 --> 00:38:21.807
"and the messianic days is delivery

00:38:21.807 --> 00:38:24.150
"from servitude to foreign powers."

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:25.380
Close quote.

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:28.710
The messianic change
would be only political.

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:32.460
The world would be made
not new, only better.

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:35.270
This was a messianism that
preserved the identity of the

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:38.353
world and preserved the
identity of the self.

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:42.650
It was the titanic figure
of Maimonides who stood

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:46.430
athwart Sholem's lifelong
campaign to secure a scholarly

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:49.323
foundation for his
fascination with apocalyptics.

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.240
He went to great lengths
to deflect and even to deny

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:57.220
the influence of Maimonides
upon Jewish messianic belief.

00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:00.150
He resented the widespread
notion that the medieval

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:03.370
rationalist had established
an eschatological norm.

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:05.530
He resented it on scholarly grounds,

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:08.450
because his researchers had
revealed a vast body of more

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:11.300
melodramatic thinking
about the end of days.

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:14.770
And on philosophical or rather
anti-philosophical grounds,

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:16.470
because he never abandoned the Weimar

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:19.420
romanticism of his youth
which he and many young

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:22.420
intellectuals of his
generation in Germany adopted

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:24.230
as a response to what they perceived

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:26.820
as the sterility of rationalism.

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:30.540
In 1978, in a response to
his critics at a symposium

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:33.550
which was published after
his death, Sholem railed

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:35.570
against the arrogance of Maimonides.

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:39.097
Quote, "How did he dare
to posit as matters of law

00:39:39.097 --> 00:39:41.117
"with the explicit authority of law

00:39:41.117 --> 00:39:44.057
"notions that have no foundation
in any tradition of the

00:39:44.057 --> 00:39:45.570
"founders of are nation."

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:47.005
Close quote.

00:39:47.005 --> 00:39:50.237
Sholem also wondered how,
quote, "The man dared

00:39:50.237 --> 00:39:53.197
"to promote into law
ideas that appealed to him

00:39:53.197 --> 00:39:56.270
"on the basis of his studies
of non-Jewish thinkers."

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:57.180
Close quote.

00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:00.010
Aristotle, Al-Farabi, and the others.

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:02.030
Moreover, Maimonides, according to Sholem,

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:04.950
suppressed the sources
that he did not admire.

00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:08.130
And then Sholem hurled his greatest curse,

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:09.990
that Maimonides owed his prominence

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:12.340
in the understanding of Jewish messianism

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:15.370
to the apologetics of the
emancipated Jews of the 19th

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:18.150
century who wished to
present to Europe a tamed

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:21.320
and reasonable and unthreatening
version of Judaism.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:24.180
Sholem, of course, despised nothing more.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.977
Quote, "I am convinced," he wrote,

00:40:25.977 --> 00:40:28.977
"That the messianic views
of Maimonides are a radical

00:40:28.977 --> 00:40:31.857
"element within the
tradition which pointed a way

00:40:31.857 --> 00:40:34.787
"to all those who had no
interest in apocalypse.

00:40:34.787 --> 00:40:37.197
"It is no wonder that in the 19th century,

00:40:37.197 --> 00:40:39.867
"in the era of civil emancipation
of the Jews of Europe

00:40:39.867 --> 00:40:41.997
"and elsewhere, it was convenient for them

00:40:41.997 --> 00:40:45.007
"to cite the Maimonidean
formulations and portray the

00:40:45.007 --> 00:40:47.957
"messianic idea as purely restorative,

00:40:47.957 --> 00:40:50.747
"built on the denial of
its foundations in myth

00:40:50.747 --> 00:40:53.720
"and their banishment to the
realm of the imagination."

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:54.553
Close quote.

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:57.300
About the arrogance of Maimonides,

00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.250
Sholem was certainly right.

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:01.940
Even the most devoted
Maimonidean can be shocked

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.940
by Maimonides' conception of himself.

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:06.520
Sholem was also right that there is a

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:09.720
diversity of messianic ideas in Judaism.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:12.210
But about the sin of external
influence upon Maimonides'

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:15.570
thought, Sholem is simply embarrassing.

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:18.250
Moreover, even those
thinkers whose eschatological

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:20.970
conceptions were more
robust than Maimonides,

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:23.550
Isaac Abravanel or the Maharal of Prague.

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:26.320
Even they did not carry
their visions of historical

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:30.080
disruption all the way to
the apocalyptic extreme.

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:33.100
And it is inaccurate to
claim that the un-convulsive

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:36.260
messianism of Maimonides
was based only on a single

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:38.750
saying by a single Talmudic figure.

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:41.000
His discussion of eschatology cites many

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.350
biblical and rabbinical sources.

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:46.016
As for the canonical
stature of Maimonides,

00:41:46.016 --> 00:41:48.920
Sholem and the other despisers
of reason may not have liked

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:52.230
it, but it was a brute historical fact.

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:54.560
The Maimonidean construction
of the end of days

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.570
was not a radical element
within the Jewish tradition.

00:41:57.570 --> 00:41:59.930
It was an anti-radical element.

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:02.525
And its influence was immeasurable.

00:42:02.525 --> 00:42:05.110
And its insistence upon
the immunity of natural

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:08.629
law and religious law to
historical convulsion,

00:42:08.629 --> 00:42:11.860
Maimonidean messianism
struck a decisive blow

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:14.963
against the romance of
historical explosion.

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:20.850
In Judaism we might say law
is the antithesis of utopia.

00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:23.220
There isn't a variety of
medieval and early, modern

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:26.140
Jewish thinkers the view
that the immutability of the

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:29.480
Torah, an axiom of Jewish
faith since antiquity

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:32.250
guarantees the immutability
of the world that was

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:35.240
created for it to be fulfilled in.

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.420
I will not trouble you
with these texts now

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:40.100
except to note their
implication that a belief

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:44.130
in the law entails a belief in the world.

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:46.870
The world that abides
is not a perfect world.

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:50.110
The need for law is itself
evidence of its imperfection.

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:51.760
But it is a sufficient world,

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.450
a world right for its purposes.

00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:57.630
The commitment to normativity
removes the grounds

00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:00.490
for a rejection of the world
and also for the hunger

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:03.200
to destroy it so as to renew it.

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:07.080
Law or normativity in this
understanding is an antidote

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:10.730
to the nihilistic element,
the appetite for destruction

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:13.680
in the apocalyptic critique of the world.

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.160
The acceptance of the world
that is a condition of the

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:20.090
law is not a form of complacence
since the law is itself

00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:22.000
a standpoint for criticizing the world

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.970
and for not conforming to it.

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:26.880
But the law abiding Jew
nonetheless feels adequately

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.153
conditioned for a significant life.

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:36.470
Messianism is commonly interpreted
as a variety of idealism.

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:39.250
But if idealism is only a
part of the Jewish tradition's

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:42.680
attitude toward the world,
then messianism must stand

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:45.600
in some relationship also to realism.

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:48.850
What we have here is a
messianic temper that includes,

00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:51.600
that prizes an attachment to reality.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:55.110
And this attachment is not
experienced as a paradox

00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:57.900
or a tension or a contradiction.

00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:00.720
And it helps to make sense
of the paucity of messianic

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.960
activity in this people
who invented the messiah.

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:06.920
For insofar as messianic
activity was an open

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.080
expression of hostility to reality,

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.850
it was bound to be constrained.

00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:15.750
There remains of course the
matter of messianic calculation.

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:19.020
The Jewish tradition of
messianic calculation was long.

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:20.760
It amounted, indeed, to an entire

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.090
genre of Jewish literature.

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:26.150
This vain of messianic
speculation which was often

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:29.190
based upon numerological
interpretations of biblical

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:32.840
phrases and verses proposed
the following years as the

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:35.510
dates for the coming of
the Messiah if the people

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:37.710
made themselves worthy for it.

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:42.710
110, 140, 240, 620, 968, 1130,
1238, 1340, 1306, 1334, 1358

00:44:50.779 --> 00:44:55.779
1403, 1430, 1440, 1503, 1530,
1575, 1598, 1640, 1648, 1713,

00:45:03.251 --> 00:45:08.251
1725, 1840, 1850, 1868, and 1931.

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:13.310
All these annus mirabilis
despite the ancient warning

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:14.930
against calculating the end.

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:17.280
And this is only a partial listing of the

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.190
auspicious and deceptive years.

00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:22.920
So to what end all those calculations?

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.380
In the light of the composure
that I have been sketching,

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:28.403
how are we to interpret all
this redemptive arithmetic?

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:32.370
There were many medieval
calculations that proposed

00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:34.950
not a precise date for
the coming of the Messiah,

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:38.300
but a loose time span, a period in history

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:41.590
or in the medieval vocabulary
a cycle of creation

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:44.910
when the Messiah is most likely to arrive.

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:46.730
In 1497, for example,

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:48.650
in his book (speaking foreign language)

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:50.660
or the Redemptions of His Savior,

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:53.540
the ardent messianist
Isaac Abravanel declared

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:56.620
that all messianic
calculation was general.

00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:59.040
Its task he wrote was
to analyze history into

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.917
three periods, quote, "The
period during which the advent

00:46:01.917 --> 00:46:04.567
"is impossible, the period
during which the advent is

00:46:04.567 --> 00:46:06.087
"possible, and the period

00:46:06.087 --> 00:46:07.920
"during which the advent is necessary."

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:08.820
Close quote.

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:11.000
That is not the sort of
historical information

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.024
that makes one pack one's bags.

00:46:13.024 --> 00:46:14.050
(audience laughs)

00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:15.040
There is a difference

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:19.060
between messianic calculation
and messianic activism.

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:22.210
Indeed, many of the ancient
and medieval calculations

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:25.260
projected the redemption
many years into the future

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:27.590
well beyond the life
times of the respective

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:29.790
writers and their contemporaries.

00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:32.740
For many of the speculators,
the year 6,000 was

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:34.720
an especially enchanted time.

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.020
The next Jewish millennium
which will arrive

00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:39.240
in the Christian year 2240.

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:41.390
We should all be glad
that we will miss it.

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:45.150
The messianic calculations
were not designed

00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:47.560
to incite, though some of them did.

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:50.220
They were designed rather to console.

00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:53.000
They were promises, not plans.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.060
The problems that they,

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:56.610
the problem that they were
designed to solve was not

00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:58.480
the problem of Jewish exile,

00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:01.400
it was the problem of Jewish despair.

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:04.540
For the messianic calculators
were playing with fire.

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:06.310
Eschatological precision ran

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:08.960
the risk of eschatological disappointment.

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:11.395
This was clear already
in the Talmud, quote.

00:47:11.395 --> 00:47:12.527
(speaking foreign language)

00:47:12.527 --> 00:47:15.587
"Said in the name of Rabi
Yonatan, may the bones of those

00:47:15.587 --> 00:47:17.847
"who calculate the end be blasted,

00:47:17.847 --> 00:47:19.947
"for they would conclude
that since the determined

00:47:19.947 --> 00:47:22.397
"time has arrived, but the
Messiah has not yet come,

00:47:22.397 --> 00:47:23.697
"he will never come.

00:47:23.697 --> 00:47:25.420
"No, we must wait for him."

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:26.640
Close quote.

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:29.120
Similarly in the 11th
century Moses ibn Ezra

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:31.880
in his treatise on Hebrew
poetry, sardonically

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:34.637
dismissed messianic calculation as, quote,

00:47:34.637 --> 00:47:36.437
"Ignorance that will do no harm

00:47:36.437 --> 00:47:38.507
"and wisdom that will do no good."

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:42.500
A century later, Maimonides'
12th dogma included

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:45.070
the indeterminacy of the messianic date

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:47.600
as a part of the belief in the Messiah.

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.870
Even if he tarries, we will wait for him.

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:52.237
And Maimonides explicitly
argued that quote

00:47:52.237 --> 00:47:54.887
"One must not fix a specific time."

00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:57.780
Nachmanides warned that
the disclosure of the

00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:59.230
date of redemption would lead, quote,

00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:00.097
to (speaking foreign language).

00:48:01.737 --> 00:48:05.450
"A demoralization and a
weakening of the people's hope."

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:08.120
This is especially striking,
because Nachmanides himself

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:10.400
engaged in eschatological computation

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:14.700
and promoted the year 1358
as the messianic year.

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:17.607
He explained his apparent
inconsistency this way,

00:48:17.607 --> 00:48:19.551
"What we have said about the end."

00:48:19.551 --> 00:48:22.717
(speaking foreign language)

00:48:22.717 --> 00:48:25.337
"Those are words of maybe and perhaps.

00:48:25.337 --> 00:48:27.837
"We possess no knowledge
on the basis of which a

00:48:27.837 --> 00:48:30.327
"certain truth may be
inferred so that we could

00:48:30.327 --> 00:48:32.697
"say it is just so.

00:48:32.697 --> 00:48:35.957
"We are not prophets who can
vouchsafe the secrets of God.

00:48:35.957 --> 00:48:39.417
"It is rather the case that
we hope for the time to come,

00:48:39.417 --> 00:48:42.320
"and we hold this belief generally."

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.930
So it was not knowledge
that these dates furnished.

00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:46.400
It was hope.

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.050
When the prediction's were valued,

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:50.260
it was not for the historical illumination

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:54.290
that they provided, but for
the spiritual fortification.

00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:57.360
Insofar as they abetted
hope, they were acceptable.

00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:00.780
Insofar as they impeded hope,
they were not acceptable.

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:03.200
For as Josef Albo remarked
in his discussion of

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:04.727
these calculations quote,

00:49:04.727 --> 00:49:06.677
"These things are mutually determined.

00:49:06.677 --> 00:49:09.257
"Hope is the cause of
strength and strength is

00:49:09.257 --> 00:49:10.577
"the cause of hope."

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:14.940
While there is no
correlation between crisis

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:16.600
and messianic activity.

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:17.660
There is a correlation

00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:20.520
between crisis and messianic speculation.

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:22.670
This is not hard to understand.

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:25.130
In the wake of persecution
and displacement,

00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:28.141
particular in the wake of
the expulsion from Spain.

00:49:28.141 --> 00:49:29.870
(speaking foreign language)

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:32.760
Words of maybe and
perhaps were not enough.

00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.720
There was a wound to heal.

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:37.660
And the discussion of the
Messiah and the concretization

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:40.760
of the messianic process hoped to heal it.

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:44.190
But again, adversity is
never the whole story.

00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:46.700
I would like to suggest
another way to understand

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:48.790
this disjunction between messianic

00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:51.010
fantasy and messianic activity,

00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:53.143
between the theory and the practice.

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:56.270
This disjunction is problematic

00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:59.490
and seems like a contradiction
only if we continue

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:01.610
to accept the most common assumption

00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:03.860
about Jewish messianism, which is that

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:05.943
it was essentially revolutionary.

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.490
Sholem in particular stressed the

00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:11.300
revolutionary character
of Jewish messianism.

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:13.920
He painted a long and thrilling
portrait of the messianic

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:17.060
energies in Judaism and in
the flamboyant figure of a

00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:19.102
certain Moses (speaking foreign language),

00:50:19.102 --> 00:50:21.740
a Moravian Frankist
who became a free mason

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:25.390
and died with Danton at
the guillotine in 1794.

00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:27.300
Sholem believed that he
had tracked those energies

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:29.150
all the way to the French revolution.

00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:32.520
More generally, the revolutionary
interpretation of Jewish

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:35.060
messianism was popularized
by the so-called

00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:38.340
secularization thesis,
according to which marxism

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:41.000
and the revolutionary
traditions of the modern world

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.420
were at bottom translations
and transpositions of Jewish

00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:46.493
or Judeo-Christian eschatology.

00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:50.410
But what if the opposite is true?

00:50:50.410 --> 00:50:53.110
What if messianism played
not a revolutionary road

00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:56.290
in Jewish life but a conservative role?

00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:59.090
Recall Sholem's most famous
formulation of Jewish

00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:02.507
messianism, quote, "A
life lived in deferment."

00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:06.620
Sholem believed that
messianism demanded a price,

00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:09.070
and the price was a certain unreality

00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:11.370
that attached to Jewish existence.

00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:14.497
Quote, "There is something
grand about living in hope.

00:51:14.497 --> 00:51:15.837
"But at the same time there is something

00:51:15.837 --> 00:51:17.867
"profoundly unreal about it.

00:51:17.867 --> 00:51:20.517
"It diminishes the singular
worth of the individual,

00:51:20.517 --> 00:51:22.367
"and he can never fulfill himself,

00:51:22.367 --> 00:51:25.397
"because the incompleteness
of his endeavors eliminates

00:51:25.397 --> 00:51:28.447
"precisely what constitutes
its highest value.

00:51:28.447 --> 00:51:31.777
"Thus, in Judaism the
messianic idea has compelled a

00:51:31.777 --> 00:51:33.477
"life lived in deferment

00:51:33.477 --> 00:51:36.327
"in which nothing can
be done definitively.

00:51:36.327 --> 00:51:39.237
"Nothing can be irrevocably accomplished.

00:51:39.237 --> 00:51:41.577
"One man, they say perhaps
that the messianic idea

00:51:41.577 --> 00:51:44.717
"is the real anti-existentialist idea.

00:51:44.717 --> 00:51:48.087
"Precisely understood,
there is nothing concrete

00:51:48.087 --> 00:51:51.150
"that can be accomplished
by the unredeemed."

00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:51.983
Close quote.

00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:55.020
To a student of the Jewish
community of the medieval

00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:56.300
and early modern world,

00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:59.540
this passage of Sholem's is deeply vexing.

00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:03.160
Nothing concrete that can be
accomplished by the unredeemed.

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:04.480
As a description of the inner

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:06.850
and outer realities of traditional Jews

00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:09.220
that is spectacularly wrong.

00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:11.910
Jewish life was never as
drained or as postponed

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:14.560
by the future as Sholem described it.

00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:17.520
It was the objective of
Halacha and of the Halachaly

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:20.450
constituted community
to ensure that something

00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:22.480
can be done definitively,

00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:25.270
that something can be
irrevocably accomplished.

00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:28.830
And this objective was
attained annually, monthly,

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:31.890
weekly, daily, and hourly.

00:52:31.890 --> 00:52:34.460
The remarkable thing
about Jewish life in exile

00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:37.663
was not how much was deferred
but how much was not deferred.

00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:42.680
Anyway, what sort of ideal is
the deferment of the ideal?

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:45.460
Is not the deferment of the
ideal in fact a way of making

00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:47.279
peace with the real?

00:52:47.279 --> 00:52:50.020
Sholem describes the duration
before the arrival of the

00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:52.957
Messiah as, quote, "The centuries of exile

00:52:52.957 --> 00:52:55.587
"when Jewish history was
unprepared to come forward

00:52:55.587 --> 00:52:57.820
"onto the plane of world history."

00:52:57.820 --> 00:52:59.090
Close quote.

00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:02.450
I do not quite know what he
means by this Hegelian judgment.

00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:05.600
This long, unredeemed
period in Jewish history,

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:08.640
this allegedly pre-historical
or non-historical

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:11.960
or a-historical era was precisely the time

00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:15.200
in which the Jews created
their civilization.

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.850
More importantly and here
we approach the modern

00:53:17.850 --> 00:53:20.670
bias in the interpretation
of Jewish messianism

00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:23.180
which Sholem perfectly exemplified.

00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:27.100
The Jewish spirit never regarded
itself only historically,

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:30.103
never regarded history as the last word.

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:33.600
If thinking messianically
is the most intense

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.460
way of thinking historically,

00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:37.800
then the circumscription of messianism,

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:39.770
the restoration of a more complicated

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:43.210
and less inflamed view of
its place in Jewish life

00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:45.913
is also a circumscription of historicity.

00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:48.730
So I would describe the conservative

00:53:48.730 --> 00:53:51.460
character of Jewish messianism this way.

00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:54.610
It protected the traditional
acceptance of the world

00:53:54.610 --> 00:53:58.340
by confining the desire
for change to a hope.

00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:00.600
For it was the premise of
the current of thought that

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:03.620
I am here describing that
the acceptance of the world

00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:05.810
was worthy of protection.

00:54:05.810 --> 00:54:07.480
The acceptance of the world, indeed,

00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:09.800
was one of the great
achievements of a people

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:12.313
to whom the world had not been kind.

00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:14.440
This was the spiritual

00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:17.250
challenge posed by Jewish messianism.

00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:20.090
To criticize the world
without rejecting it

00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:23.090
and to change the world
without destroying it.

00:54:23.090 --> 00:54:25.380
Or conversely, to accept the world

00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:27.323
without being complicitous with it.

00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:31.670
The paradoxical character of
this eschatological temper,

00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:34.070
this spirit that wished
to conserve what it wished

00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:37.870
to perfect, accomplished both these goals.

00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:40.477
In one of his letters,
Seneca declared, that quote,

00:54:40.477 --> 00:54:43.850
"You must either hate the
world or imitate the world."

00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:46.020
But surely it is possible
neither to hate it

00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:47.880
nor to imitate it.

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:51.170
Messianic speculation was
an exception to the Jewish

00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:53.490
patients with history,
was not the exception,

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:55.200
it was the expression of it.

00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:58.770
It was the tribute that
realism paid to idealism.

00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:01.670
It bled off the bitterness
about Jewish historical

00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:03.750
experience that otherwise might have

00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:05.663
exploded the whole thing.

00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:09.320
Was hope then false or insincere?

00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:11.170
Was hope a form of bad faith?

00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:12.660
Was hope an illusion?

00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:15.710
Was it, as Sholem believed,
the enemy of reality?

00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:17.410
Not exactly.

00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:20.070
The understanding of
messianism and Judaism will

00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:22.610
not be furthered by platitudinous notions

00:55:22.610 --> 00:55:25.510
about the relationship
of theory to practice.

00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:29.860
For hope stands somewhere
between theory and practice.

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:31.560
It is the ground of but not the

00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:34.130
reason for historical action.

00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:37.420
Hope is a weaker form of historicity.

00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:39.457
Quote, "The longer the Messiah will tarry,

00:55:39.457 --> 00:55:41.100
"the greater will be the hope."

00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:45.050
Maimonides explained to
the Jews of Yeman in 1172.

00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:47.260
Better hope than disappointment.

00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:49.833
That was the Jewish retort to utopianism.

00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:53.410
In the Jewish tradition
then messianic speculation

00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:56.270
may be seen as a kind
of thinking about change

00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:59.610
that was not quite a
preparation fof action.

00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:02.030
Messianic calculation describe the point

00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:04.330
at which the world would be changed by an

00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:06.880
accumulation of actions none of which were

00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:09.067
designed to change the world.

00:56:09.067 --> 00:56:11.587
"The Messiah would arrive,"
the ancient rabbi said,

00:56:11.587 --> 00:56:14.960
"When all the people of
Israel kept two sabbaths."

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:16.700
Did they mean that the
keeping of the sabbbath

00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:18.420
was a messianic activity?

00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:19.820
They did not.

00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:21.900
They meant only that
the performance of moral

00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:24.870
and ritual duties by the
individual and the community

00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:28.180
would have a cumulative effect
upon the destiny of the Jews

00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:30.160
and the destiny of the world.

00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:33.940
But this destiny was to
be attacked indirectly.

00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:36.360
We are not enjoined to live climactically.

00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:38.453
We are enjoined to live significantly.

00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:42.780
A messiah who is not a revolutionary,

00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:47.590
criticism without nihilism,
a change that is not an end,

00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:52.590
fulfillment without closure,
a climax that preserves,

00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:55.770
a hope that neither lulls nor incites,

00:56:55.770 --> 00:56:57.650
those are not contradictions.

00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:59.490
They are rather the terms of a certain

00:56:59.490 --> 00:57:01.920
messianic spirit in Judaism.

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:05.070
And they are remarkably
unlike the terms of messianism

00:57:05.070 --> 00:57:07.470
in modern westers politics.

00:57:07.470 --> 00:57:10.547
At the end of Minima
Moralia, Adorno wrote, quote,

00:57:10.547 --> 00:57:12.877
"The only philosophy
which can be responsibly

00:57:12.877 --> 00:57:15.787
"practiced in the face
of despair is the attempt

00:57:15.787 --> 00:57:18.317
"to contemplate all things
as they would present

00:57:18.317 --> 00:57:20.740
"themselves from the
standpoint of redemption."

00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:22.090
Close quote.

00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:24.180
The Jewish tradition or at
least the portion of it that

00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:27.160
I have presented here, teaches otherwise.

00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:29.330
It teaches that in the face of despair,

00:57:29.330 --> 00:57:32.080
one must resist the
standpoint of redemption.

00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:36.280
For what is redemption if
not an invitation to despair.

00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.630
Perhaps that is precisely

00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:40.100
where modern messianism lost its way.

00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:43.410
It sought to meet despair with revolution.

00:57:43.410 --> 00:57:46.100
Against Adorno and the
modern secularization of the

00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:49.120
apocalyptic dream, I
would leave you with this

00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:52.080
exhilarating remark by
(speaking foreign language)

00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:54.593
in a commentary on a Talmudic parable.

00:57:55.787 --> 00:57:59.454
(speaking foreign language)

00:58:03.327 --> 00:58:05.527
"If an individual cleaves to God,

00:58:05.527 --> 00:58:09.010
"what does the destruction
of the temple matter to him?"

00:58:09.010 --> 00:58:11.557
And he continues, "The
power to cleave and to pray

00:58:11.557 --> 00:58:15.620
"and to plead is available
even in the era of exile."

00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:19.210
And he concludes, "There is
nothing lacking for perfection."

00:58:19.210 --> 00:58:20.290
Close quote.

00:58:20.290 --> 00:58:22.670
Nothing, that is, in history.

00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:24.920
What is lacking for perfection is only

00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:26.430
the lack in ourselves.

00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:28.156
Thank you very much.

00:58:28.156 --> 00:58:31.156
(audience applauds)

00:58:33.192 --> 00:58:35.942
(soothing music)
