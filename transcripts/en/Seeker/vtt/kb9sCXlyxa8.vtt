"This episode of DNews is brought to you by
the all-new G Flex 2, from LG.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.810
Life's Good"

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.180
The bumblebee bat is very tiny only an inch
long, but that’s still pretty big as far

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.180
as life goes.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:16.289
To find to the earth’s smallest living things,
we’re gonna have to look a little bit harder.

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.669
Hey guys, Julia here for Dnews

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:22.279
How small can life get?

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.320
Well bats and humans come from the Domain
Eukarya.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.210
the smallest member of our domain?

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.289
Prasinophyte algae.

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.999
A single cell of which can be 800 nanometers
across.

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.550
But that’s still kinda large for life.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.800
Microorganisms from the Domains Archaea and
Bacteria exist on an unimaginably tiny scale.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.970
How small is small?

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.800
well pretty dang small according to new research
from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.840
and the University of California, Berkeley.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.170
The researchers captured the first detailed
microscopy images of Ultra-small bacteria

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.070
that are so tiny, 150-thousand of them could
fit within the width of a human hair.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.430
The researchers think these ultra-small bacteria
are the smallest life can get at an average

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.470
volume of 9 cubic nanometers.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.420
So Yeah, tiny.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.510
So where do they come from?

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.130
Well probably everywhere.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.119
This sample was scooped from ground water
in Colorado, but the researchers think they

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.340
are quite common.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.670
Using high-tech microscopy imaging they found
that they’re pretty simple organisms.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.290
The cells have densely packed spirals that
are probably DNA, and not very much of it.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.950
Their genomes are about one million base pairs
in length.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.630
In comparison we have about 3 billion base
pairs in our genome.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.359
Their small genome leaves them without many
vital functions.

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:32.590
So maybe their hair-like appendages are like
a kind of “life support system” that connects

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.850
them to other microbes.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.030
This new discovery could unseat the previous
candidate for smallest living thing.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.170
Mycoplasm gallicepticum, a parasitic bacterium
that lives in the guts of primates, can be

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.420
around 200 nanometers across.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.909
Which fit with what researchers thought was
the minimum size required for a free-living

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.560
cell to well... live.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.030
Scientists haven’t really agreed how small
life can get but researchers at a workshop

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.469
hosted by the National Academy of Sciences
theorized that a cell must be at least 200

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.840
nanometers across otherwise it couldn't fit
stuff like DNA and proteins that are kind

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.929
of needed to live and reproduce.

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.500
Looking at another Domain, Archaea are simple
single-celled microbes that get pretty tiny

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.500
too.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.640
Research from some of the same team from the
Lawrence Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley found

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.390
Archaea also with a cell volume of 9 cubic
nanometers.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.970
And in case you were wondering about viruses
- Viruses are really freaking small, some

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.580
can be only 20 nanometers across.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.440
But they aren’t considered living since
they need hosts to reproduce.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.780
They exist in a half-alive, grey area.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.060
So they don’t really count.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.020
Switching gears to a more human scale, we
are really happy that our new channel Seeker

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.200
launched this week!

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.030
Here on DNews, we take a look at the news
from a science angle, and they take a look

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.640
at the news from a human side!

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:59.010
Like this video here about a teenager that
built a braille printer out of Legos...

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.860
So make sure you check that video out, it’s
the first link in the description, and subscribe

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.510
to Seeker so you never miss a video!
