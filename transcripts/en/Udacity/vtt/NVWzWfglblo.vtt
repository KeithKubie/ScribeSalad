00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.840
Scientists like to talk about
the algorithms they build

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.430
in terms of the problems that they
solve, so this mini course is about

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.260
machine learning and let's think about
the problem the machine learning solves.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.280
In most cases,

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.710
machine learning algorithms
are focused on building a model.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.080
What's a model?

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.470
A model is something that takes
in observations like this x here,

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.170
run it through some sort of process,
and provide a y.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.600
So this y is typically a prediction, and

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.900
the x is some sort of
observation of the world.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.650
Examples might be, for us,

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.400
x are some features of stocks and
y is a future price.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.760
There are many other uses
of machine learning models.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.160
That's just one of them.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.230
X can be multidimensional.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.570
In other words, there might be multiple
factors that we're considering,

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.260
might be Bollinger Bands,
PE ratio, and so on.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.610
Y is typically single dimension and

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.860
just represents that single-dimension
prediction that we're trying to make.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.680
Now, there are lots of models
that people have built

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.610
that don't use machine learning at all.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.710
One example is the Black-Scholes
model that predicts option prices.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.810
There are many other types of models
that predict things that people

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.610
build not using machine learning, but
they develop mathematical formulas.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.210
But, of course, with machine learning,
we're trying to use data.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.490
So the machine learning process
is to take historical data, run

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.128
it through a machine learning algorithm
of some sort to generate the model.

00:01:40.128 --> 00:01:44.570
Then at runtime or
when we need to use the model,

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.550
we push x's in it and y's come out.
