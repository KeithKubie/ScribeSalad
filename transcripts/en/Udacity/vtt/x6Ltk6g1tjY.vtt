00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.580
But before we go to raid let's
see if we understood what codes,

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.580
especially parity can do for us.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.680
Suppose we are using parity to detect
bit-flip errors in our dram memory.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.680
Our unprotected memory
has eight one bit arrays,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.400
each of which is 1024 by 1024 bits.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.900
So we have eight small arrays.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.080
Each of these arrays is given
the same row and column address and

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.730
each of these arrays outputs one
bit of the overall eight bit value

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.240
that we're trying to read or
write in this memory.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.840
We want to use parity to
detect bit flips, and

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.830
what we can afford is a parity bit for
every group of four data bits.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:44.580
The question for

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.350
you is whether we should add two more
one-bit arrays of this kind for parity.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.590
So the idea is that we would
add another array here,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.520
and the bit stored here would be the
parity for the first four bits here and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.710
another one would store the parity for
these four data bits.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.330
Or should we add these additional
parity bits every row in each array?

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.730
So that we don't need the extra modules
but what we do is we extend each of

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:19.520
these modules with the extra bits
that protect the data in that row.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.780
Note that the overall number of bits
that we add is the same in these two

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.560
approaches.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.080
The question for
you is which one is better?
