NARRATOR: Kevin
Dykstra and his team

00:00:03.753 --> 00:00:06.131
have traveled once again to
Traverse City, Michigan where

00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:08.675
they have scheduled an
important face to face

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:10.802
meeting with Marty Lagina.

00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:11.845
Gentlemen, welcome.

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:13.179
Why don't we all have a seat?

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.098
NARRATOR: For Kevin
Dykstra, everything

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:18.101
he has spent the past seven
years researching and working

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:21.187
for now hangs in the balance.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.856
Well, gentlemen,
I understand you're

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.442
going to show me some stuff
that brings me up to speed.

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:26.651
I know you've been just intense.

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:27.652
Oh, it's been busy.

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:29.154
Yeah.

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:30.488
I'm hoping for a special
presentation here, Kevin.

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:31.406
Well, I think you're
in store for one.

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:32.657
Good.

00:00:32.657 --> 00:00:35.118
You wanted tangible proof.

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:36.661
This is what we have.

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:37.746
MARTY LAGINA: Comes the box.

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:38.955
[laughter]

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:40.623
This isn't a box.

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:41.791
This is a treasure chest.

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:42.625
That's what this is.

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:46.713
MARTY LAGINA: OK.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:47.714
What have we got here?

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.382
Lot of cool stuff.

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:52.469
It's a lot of rusted parts,
but one of the most telling

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.388
things we found down in
Irwinville where Jefferson

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:58.224
Davis was captured, we
actually found the wagon parts

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:01.311
we went down there to look for.

00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:02.103
It's a bolt.

00:01:02.103 --> 00:01:02.896
It's a bolt.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.147
Threaded bolt?

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:05.648
Threaded bolt.

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:06.900
GARY DRAYTON: I think what
we're seeing is the iron

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.985
remnants of six burnt wagons.

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:10.361
Yeah.

00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:12.989
KEVIN DYKSTRA: It sure
looks like it to me.

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:16.409
As we uncovered the
wagon parts, we then

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.912
uncovered this coin right here.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:20.830
And Gary was very
specific when he

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.290
pulled that out of the ground.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.084
He said that is a
Confederate silver coin.

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:28.296
GARY DRAYTON: It's a coin.

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:33.343
And it's an oldie.

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:34.427
From the Civil War?

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:36.179
GARY DRAYTON: Oh, yeah.

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.558
You can see the stars going all
the way around the edges of it.

00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:42.310
Wow.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.731
I feel nervous because to look
at Marty the treasure hunter,

00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:49.317
I think he wants
to be part of it,

00:01:49.317 --> 00:01:51.402
but Marty is not an easy sell.

00:01:51.402 --> 00:01:52.570
Hackley.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.155
You got to tie
Hackley in for me.

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:58.493
Hackley becomes this
exceedingly wealthy individual,

00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:01.454
claiming that it came from
the lumbering business,

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:03.498
but he never could have
earned the kind of money

00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:05.333
that he spent from the
lumbering business.

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:07.460
So it had to come
from somewhere.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.963
Charles Hackley helped
launder this Confederate gold,

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:12.048
so in the archives we
were able to find--

00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:15.385
he owned gold mines in Utah.

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:17.428
We found that kind
of interesting.

00:02:17.428 --> 00:02:20.181
Gold mines, and of course
smelters with the gold mines

00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:22.225
they could melt
down the gold with.

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:23.852
Which is the
very reason we feel

00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:28.439
that gold was going across
Lake Michigan out to Utah.

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.234
And then we come
across this article.

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:34.696
There was a man out hiking in
the mountains out in Newtown.

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:36.823
He'd come across the
cave, and in the cave

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:43.621
were 280 gold bars
all marked US cavalry.

00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:46.040
Did we bring enough?

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.127
Did we share enough with
you to jump on board with us

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:51.170
on this project
financially and help

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.590
us get a boat to get
to that gold that's

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.549
on the bottom of the lake?

00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:59.470
MARTY LAGINA: This is
probably your best data.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.347
I can tell you for
sure, without this,

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:04.100
I would for sure
be out because this

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.728
is the most hard data you have.

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:09.689
This is necessary
because otherwise

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.526
that gold has no business
crossing the lake, right?

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.236
But this is going to
be very expensive.

00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:24.787
I'm not completely
convinced that this

00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:25.788
is enough to go forward.

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:36.633
But I'm going to tell
you, I'm convinced enough.

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:42.347
[laughs] I guess I'm--

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:43.806
I guess I'm on board.

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:45.141
Awesome.

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:46.517
That's more than
what we could ask for.

00:03:46.517 --> 00:03:48.227
Yep.

00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:52.732
As I was telling Kevin that
I wasn't completely convinced,

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:55.652
I didn't know,
honestly, in my own mind

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:57.445
what the next words
were going to be

00:03:57.445 --> 00:03:59.322
till they came out of my mouth.

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:01.449
It was vaguely reminiscent
of Oak Island, though.

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.952
I mean, one of the thoughts
in the back of my mind

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:07.080
was this is so familiar.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.876
This is enough to
keep you going.

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:13.711
Let's move forward and
go to the next step.

00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:15.129
Let's get your boat.

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:17.423
Let's see what's at the
bottom of Lake Michigan.

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:18.675
Awesome.

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:19.884
Well, Marty, we
can't thank you enough.

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:21.052
I mean, really.

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:23.513
These guys have
worked tirelessly.

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:27.976
They've chased this quest
with me, and this is big.

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:30.103
This is really big.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.604
Now that we have
Marty's support,

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:34.774
I think the whole team is
just as excited as I am.

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:39.946
We made a compelling case that
I verbally said a lot of things.

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:41.406
I think with what
we demonstrated

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:43.908
and what we showed Marty,
we got his support,

00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:45.284
and I'm very grateful for that.

00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:46.327
OK.

00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:47.578
Well, what are we waiting for?

00:04:47.578 --> 00:04:48.287
A boat.

00:04:48.287 --> 00:04:50.623
[laughter]

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.083
Let's get to the
bottom of Lake Michigan.

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:53.584
All righty.
