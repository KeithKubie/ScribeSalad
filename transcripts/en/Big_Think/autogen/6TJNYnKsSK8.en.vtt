question of degrees so and do do you
 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.620 align:start position:0%

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.410 align:start position:0%
think neuroscience is giving us some

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 align:start position:0%
answers as to why some people have it
 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.250 align:start position:0%
answers as to why some people have it
and<00:00:22.449><c> some</c><00:00:22.570><c> people</c><00:00:22.930><c> don't</c>

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 align:start position:0%
and some people don't
 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.890 align:start position:0%
and some people don't
well<00:00:23.650><c> I</c><00:00:23.680><c> think</c><00:00:23.770><c> neuroscience</c><00:00:24.760><c> and</c><00:00:25.000><c> genetics</c>

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 align:start position:0%
well I think neuroscience and genetics
 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.930 align:start position:0%
well I think neuroscience and genetics
as<00:00:26.260><c> well</c><00:00:26.470><c> so</c><00:00:26.740><c> so</c><00:00:27.190><c> recently</c><00:00:27.610><c> there's</c><00:00:27.850><c> been</c>

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:27.940 align:start position:0%
as well so so recently there's been
 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.029 align:start position:0%
as well so so recently there's been
studies<00:00:28.420><c> looking</c><00:00:28.450><c> at</c><00:00:28.840><c> like</c><00:00:29.050><c> musical</c><00:00:29.620><c> talent</c>

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 align:start position:0%
studies looking at like musical talent
 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.380 align:start position:0%
studies looking at like musical talent
and<00:00:30.220><c> it</c><00:00:30.310><c> shows</c><00:00:30.520><c> that</c><00:00:30.700><c> there's</c><00:00:30.940><c> actually</c><00:00:31.330><c> a</c>

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 align:start position:0%
and it shows that there's actually a
 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.229 align:start position:0%
and it shows that there's actually a
really<00:00:31.840><c> large</c><00:00:32.619><c> genetic</c><00:00:33.070><c> component</c><00:00:33.760><c> involved</c>

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 align:start position:0%
really large genetic component involved
 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.150 align:start position:0%
really large genetic component involved
and<00:00:34.420><c> so</c><00:00:34.870><c> I</c><00:00:35.140><c> think</c><00:00:35.260><c> when</c><00:00:35.559><c> we</c><00:00:35.590><c> see</c><00:00:35.860><c> these</c><00:00:36.010><c> people</c>

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
and so I think when we see these people
 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
and so I think when we see these people
who<00:00:36.430><c> are</c><00:00:36.550><c> at</c><00:00:36.610><c> the</c><00:00:36.789><c> way</c><00:00:37.059><c> you</c><00:00:37.390><c> know</c><00:00:37.510><c> top</c><00:00:37.899><c> ends</c><00:00:38.560><c> you</c>

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130 align:start position:0%
who are at the way you know top ends you
 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.010 align:start position:0%
who are at the way you know top ends you
know<00:00:39.250><c> like</c><00:00:39.760><c> three</c><00:00:40.060><c> standard</c><00:00:40.390><c> deviations</c><00:00:40.420><c> out</c>

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 align:start position:0%
know like three standard deviations out
 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.930 align:start position:0%
know like three standard deviations out

from the norm you're looking at a
 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.150 align:start position:0%
from the norm you're looking at a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 align:start position:0%
a talent plus the practice so for you
 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.350 align:start position:0%
a talent plus the practice so for you

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 align:start position:0%
maybe you know you can practice from now
 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
maybe you know you can practice from now
until<00:00:52.510><c> tomorrow</c><00:00:52.660><c> and</c><00:00:53.320><c> you'll</c><00:00:53.410><c> only</c><00:00:53.530><c> get</c><00:00:53.739><c> to</c><00:00:53.860><c> be</c>
