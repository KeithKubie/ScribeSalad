[ rap music ]

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:16.156
&gt;&gt;Narrator: This Fremont High School
student video shows how some students

00:00:16.156 --> 00:00:19.046
spend their spare time and
money in the turbulent world

00:00:19.046 --> 00:00:20.426
of car side shows. 

00:00:26.396 --> 00:00:26.996
&gt;&gt;Student: I'm probably
going to add some stuff.

00:00:26.996 --> 00:00:29.216
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But another group
of Fremont students spends their

00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:31.596
after school hours
doing community service

00:00:31.596 --> 00:00:33.466
and running small business ventures.

00:00:33.916 --> 00:00:37.036
And this year, their diligence
carried them into the finals

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:40.076
of a competition for the best
high school business program

00:00:40.076 --> 00:00:40.816
in the country.

00:00:41.086 --> 00:00:43.666
&gt;&gt;Student: It creates a truancy
problem on our school campus,

00:00:43.726 --> 00:00:48.246
because many students venture
off campus to buy candy and soda.

00:00:48.246 --> 00:00:50.576
&gt;&gt;Student: Is a dollar-twenty-five
good?

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:54.266
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Like most great ventures,
this one began with a simple idea.

00:00:54.676 --> 00:00:58.646
To make money selling good food
from an on-campus lunch cart.

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:01.616
&gt;&gt;Student: Come buy our ribs, chicken
sandwich, they're really good!

00:01:01.616 --> 00:01:02.586
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In one semester,

00:01:02.586 --> 00:01:05.686
the student-run business
sold about 6,000 meals.

00:01:06.176 --> 00:01:11.386
Generating 20,000 dollars in sales,
and reducing post-lunch truancy,

00:01:11.686 --> 00:01:15.006
which had been running at
a staggering 72 percent.

00:01:15.216 --> 00:01:18.526
&gt;&gt;Student: The truancies were
high last year, and the absences.

00:01:19.176 --> 00:01:23.256
We decided that if we can keep as
many students in school as possible,

00:01:23.646 --> 00:01:26.366
they would decrease, plus
we'd get business also.

00:01:26.936 --> 00:01:29.646
&gt;&gt;Narrator: These young entrepreneurs
are members of the "Students

00:01:29.646 --> 00:01:34.146
In Free Enterprise," or SIFE
team, an after-school offshoot

00:01:34.146 --> 00:01:35.846
of Fremont's Business Academy.

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:37.916
In addition to running
the lunch cart,

00:01:38.146 --> 00:01:41.236
they opened several other
businesses, based on an assessment

00:01:41.236 --> 00:01:42.466
of the needs of the community.

00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:45.286
&gt;&gt;Student: So you currently
don't have your W2?

00:01:45.286 --> 00:01:46.116
&gt;&gt;Student: Hm-mm.

00:01:46.376 --> 00:01:49.606
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Fifteen students
passed a rigorous federal exam,

00:01:49.916 --> 00:01:54.076
qualifying them to act as licensed
tax advisors to their peers

00:01:54.116 --> 00:01:55.316
and other community members.

00:01:55.316 --> 00:01:57.036
&gt;&gt;Student: At line 36 and 37?

00:01:58.016 --> 00:02:00.756
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The SIFE team also
started a tutoring program,

00:02:01.086 --> 00:02:02.906
and a business card design firm.

00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:04.316
&gt;&gt;Student: Much bigger, ten?

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:04.636
Twelve?

00:02:04.866 --> 00:02:05.056
&gt;&gt;Student: Twelve.

00:02:06.116 --> 00:02:09.016
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They also responded
to Fremont's request for proposals

00:02:09.016 --> 00:02:11.226
for new small learning communities,

00:02:11.346 --> 00:02:14.196
and ended up designing an
entirely new curriculum.

00:02:14.586 --> 00:02:17.046
&gt;&gt;Student: Expeditionary
learning, authentic assessment,

00:02:17.246 --> 00:02:19.586
cycle of inquiry, multiple
intelligence,

00:02:19.776 --> 00:02:23.336
and culturally relevant pedagogy.

00:02:23.336 --> 00:02:26.156
&gt;&gt;Nidya: Yes, Youth Empowerment
School, it's totally a new idea.

00:02:26.156 --> 00:02:28.026
It's based on the Five
Theories of Instruction.

00:02:28.656 --> 00:02:33.026
And it's completely
project-based, and for students

00:02:33.026 --> 00:02:35.296
to take their education
into their own hands.

00:02:35.296 --> 00:02:40.396
And our experience with SIFE made us
want to go to school, work real hard,

00:02:40.676 --> 00:02:43.346
do more project-based
learning, community service.

00:02:43.546 --> 00:02:47.076
And so we said, "Why can't
everybody learn this way?"

00:02:47.426 --> 00:02:50.246
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In addition
to running the businesses,

00:02:50.246 --> 00:02:52.416
and working on their
new school design,

00:02:52.726 --> 00:02:55.186
the SIFE team entered a
statewide competition,

00:02:55.616 --> 00:02:58.556
where they would make a multi-media
presentation of their work

00:02:58.916 --> 00:03:00.696
to a panel of industry judges.

00:03:01.066 --> 00:03:02.346
&gt;&gt;Nidya: My high school, Nidya.

00:03:03.086 --> 00:03:03.626
&gt;&gt;D'Andre: Wassup?

00:03:03.626 --> 00:03:04.946
My name is D'Andre Williams.

00:03:05.536 --> 00:03:07.856
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The Fremont team
had been a surprise winner

00:03:07.856 --> 00:03:09.326
in last year's competition.

00:03:09.696 --> 00:03:12.206
But as tryouts began for
this year's presenters,

00:03:12.416 --> 00:03:14.646
repeating seemed a distant dream.

00:03:14.816 --> 00:03:17.216
&gt;&gt;Veronica: Well, my name's Veronica
Garcia, and I'm auditioning to see

00:03:17.216 --> 00:03:18.246
if I can present at SIFE.

00:03:18.436 --> 00:03:18.796
Here I go.

00:03:18.796 --> 00:03:28.276
Our mission is to create a
safe place for our community.

00:03:30.106 --> 00:03:31.926
&gt;&gt;Student: Participate in a
[inaudible] free of charge.

00:03:32.316 --> 00:03:34.926
&gt;&gt;Student: Although we value
our entrepreneurialship,

00:03:34.926 --> 00:03:37.676
we also value the community.

00:03:38.806 --> 00:03:42.086
&gt;&gt;Veronica: We also--
although we value entrepreneur,

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:44.646
we also value our community.

00:03:44.856 --> 00:03:44.946
[laughs] Yeah.

00:03:45.876 --> 00:03:48.366
&gt;&gt;Teacher: But that blurb
had an error of parallelism,

00:03:48.516 --> 00:03:49.906
so I can find it for you.

00:03:49.906 --> 00:03:50.906
&gt;&gt;Student: Parallelism?

00:03:50.906 --> 00:03:54.186
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yeah, there's faulty
parallelism somewhere here.

00:03:54.186 --> 00:03:58.296
"Establishing, analyze and
conduct," it has to be "Establishing,

00:03:58.296 --> 00:03:59.956
analyzing and conducting," right?

00:03:59.956 --> 00:04:01.106
&gt;&gt;Student: We're always on the go.

00:04:01.166 --> 00:04:01.656
&gt;&gt;Veronica: Okay, see?

00:04:01.656 --> 00:04:02.266
That's where it comes in.

00:04:02.266 --> 00:04:04.736
&gt;&gt;Student: So that's where I'm
going-- we are always on the go.

00:04:04.736 --> 00:04:04.803
&gt;&gt;Veronica: See?

00:04:04.803 --> 00:04:05.546
That's where it comes in.

00:04:05.546 --> 00:04:06.466
On the go, yeah.

00:04:06.466 --> 00:04:07.796
&gt;&gt;Student: So I should move this way.

00:04:07.796 --> 00:04:11.586
&gt;&gt;Veronica: Yeah, unless you're--
if you want to do that, you know?

00:04:11.586 --> 00:04:12.596
[laughs] Don't do it
too long, though.

00:04:12.596 --> 00:04:13.116
&gt;&gt;Student: Oh, okay.

00:04:13.266 --> 00:04:16.076
We're always on the go.

00:04:16.076 --> 00:04:17.246
&gt;&gt;Group: Aaaaah.

00:04:18.246 --> 00:04:19.566
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Think about
sending your note.

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:20.476
We're going to pick a spot.

00:04:20.476 --> 00:04:20.886
It's right here.

00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:23.146
&gt;&gt;Jamie: There is the
whole other side

00:04:23.146 --> 00:04:25.396
of what kids learn going
through high school.

00:04:25.736 --> 00:04:28.046
&gt;&gt;Jamie: Well, a lot of people
learn how to be evasive,

00:04:28.116 --> 00:04:31.966
how to be invisible, how to like
not look like you know the answer.

00:04:32.116 --> 00:04:35.256
You have to unlearn that
to become a performer.

00:04:35.506 --> 00:04:35.966
&gt;&gt;Group: Veronica!

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:38.726
&gt;&gt;Student: Our needs
assessment shows that last year

00:04:38.836 --> 00:04:42.476
over nine million dollars
went unclaimed in Oakland.

00:04:42.926 --> 00:04:44.306
&gt;&gt;Yvonne: This means that out

00:04:44.306 --> 00:04:48.056
of a hundred tenth graders
only three graduate.

00:04:48.286 --> 00:04:50.126
&gt;&gt;Amy: Yvonne, when
she first rehearsed,

00:04:50.916 --> 00:04:52.936
had some issues with language.

00:04:52.936 --> 00:04:54.296
She's a second language learner.

00:04:54.536 --> 00:04:57.266
&gt;&gt;Yvonne: That the Business Academy
had a shocking graduation rate

00:04:57.336 --> 00:04:59.316
of only 30 percent.

00:04:59.316 --> 00:05:00.186
This means...

00:05:00.186 --> 00:05:02.086
&gt;&gt;Amy: I taught her
English last year,

00:05:02.086 --> 00:05:05.616
and never once did she
contribute to class.

00:05:06.296 --> 00:05:08.726
When she was audible,
she was very quiet

00:05:08.796 --> 00:05:11.406
and soft-spoken, and
she was very shy.

00:05:11.516 --> 00:05:14.776
So when she stepped up to
present, we were delighted

00:05:14.776 --> 00:05:16.986
that this student was
choosing to grow so much.

00:05:17.466 --> 00:05:20.576
&gt;&gt;Yvonne: This chart shows
senior graduation rates from...

00:05:20.576 --> 00:05:20.926
&gt;&gt;Jamie: Wait, wait, wait.

00:05:20.926 --> 00:05:21.346
Which chart?

00:05:22.716 --> 00:05:22.956
That chart?

00:05:22.956 --> 00:05:23.466
&gt;&gt;Yvonne: Yeah.

00:05:24.006 --> 00:05:24.616
&gt;&gt;Jamie: Vanna White!

00:05:25.556 --> 00:05:30.106
That beautiful chart that all
of your students made with you!

00:05:30.366 --> 00:05:31.776
It's amazing!

00:05:32.506 --> 00:05:34.296
Look at where our tax money's going!

00:05:34.296 --> 00:05:35.536
Right there, okay?

00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:37.446
&gt;&gt;Kevin: It's amazing to see
our six presenters get up.

00:05:37.446 --> 00:05:38.996
Some of them were pretty darn shy.

00:05:39.276 --> 00:05:42.616
And to see them really blossom, and
to get up and they're speaking out,

00:05:42.686 --> 00:05:45.926
and they're confident and they
have amazing presentation skills.

00:05:45.956 --> 00:05:47.176
Now they're really building on them.

00:05:47.176 --> 00:05:48.166
So they're doing a great job.

00:05:48.346 --> 00:05:51.276
The students have taken
ownership of it.

00:05:51.436 --> 00:05:54.886
So they wrote the speeches, and
they're editing and constructing

00:05:54.886 --> 00:05:56.536
and changing their speeches.

00:05:56.746 --> 00:05:58.306
They're making and
building the PowerPoint,

00:05:58.306 --> 00:05:59.816
so everything they do,
they're going to retain.

00:06:00.096 --> 00:06:02.286
These are real skills that
will stay with the students.

00:06:02.416 --> 00:06:04.656
&gt;&gt;Student: We even did the
taxes of one of our presenters.

00:06:04.866 --> 00:06:05.116
&gt;&gt;Jamie: Right.

00:06:05.116 --> 00:06:06.936
&gt;&gt;D'Andre: I made thirteen bucks!

00:06:06.936 --> 00:06:07.236
&gt;&gt;Jamie: Nice.

00:06:07.456 --> 00:06:08.676
Okay. Let's go back.

00:06:09.336 --> 00:06:11.296
&gt;&gt;Student: We even did the
taxes of one of our presenters.

00:06:12.166 --> 00:06:13.376
&gt;&gt;D'Andre: I made thirteen bucks!

00:06:13.376 --> 00:06:16.686
&gt;&gt;Student: And because we live
in such a diverse community,

00:06:17.066 --> 00:06:18.906
we even offer our services
in Espanola.

00:06:19.436 --> 00:06:23.356
&gt;&gt;Veronica: Our participation
in SIFE last year encouraged us

00:06:23.436 --> 00:06:25.176
to begin our own small school.

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:26.136
As we began the long
work [inaudible],

00:06:26.486 --> 00:06:28.836
we took part in all areas
of producing this school,

00:06:29.206 --> 00:06:32.566
from writing a 35-page RFP, to
going to local middle schools,

00:06:32.566 --> 00:06:34.016
where we made classroom
presentations.

00:06:34.476 --> 00:06:38.476
&gt;&gt;Nidya: We practiced, and
we rehearsed questions.

00:06:38.736 --> 00:06:43.096
One, because we're so out of it that
we weren't giving it our best at all,

00:06:43.096 --> 00:06:44.376
because we're just so tired.

00:06:44.496 --> 00:06:45.146
&gt;&gt;Nidya: Aloha!

00:06:45.146 --> 00:06:46.926
My name is Nidya Baez.

00:06:47.236 --> 00:06:51.296
&gt;&gt;Nidya: But we woke up
at 4:45 in the morning.

00:06:51.736 --> 00:06:52.256
&gt;&gt;Woman: Wow.

00:06:53.116 --> 00:06:56.886
&gt;&gt;Veronica: Here are the preliminary
results of our qualitative data.

00:06:57.346 --> 00:07:00.636
&gt;&gt;Veronica: It's challenging for us
because, you know, we are low-income,

00:07:01.496 --> 00:07:02.776
you know, people in Oakland.

00:07:03.356 --> 00:07:05.666
But we needed to look presentable.

00:07:05.666 --> 00:07:09.736
We didn't want to mismatch or
look like clothed in a bit of...

00:07:09.806 --> 00:07:11.516
&gt;&gt;Nidya: You left this
one too short now.

00:07:11.516 --> 00:07:13.806
&gt;&gt;D'Andre: I didn't really
have no money to get no suit,

00:07:13.906 --> 00:07:20.126
so Ms. Carpenter she took me to go
get a vest and slacks and a shirt,

00:07:20.346 --> 00:07:22.216
so I could wear it
for the presentation.

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:25.826
&gt;&gt;Nidya: One of the judges called us
too preppy, and we were surprised,

00:07:25.826 --> 00:07:29.486
because it's like we just know
how to dress for the occasion.

00:07:29.486 --> 00:07:32.236
We needed to be dressed
professionally for that.

00:07:32.236 --> 00:07:32.726
&gt;&gt;Student: Are you nervous?

00:07:33.216 --> 00:07:34.026
Are you nervous?

00:07:34.246 --> 00:07:35.806
Are you nervous?

00:07:35.806 --> 00:07:36.006
Yeah.

00:07:36.336 --> 00:07:37.256
&gt;&gt;Student: Do the hand motion.

00:07:37.256 --> 00:07:38.976
&gt;&gt;Yvonne: [speaks Spanish] My
name is Yvonne [inaudible].

00:07:42.356 --> 00:07:43.516
&gt;&gt;Tiana: [speaks Spanish] My name is Tiana Seamore.

00:07:44.336 --> 00:07:49.376
&gt;&gt;Nidya: It's a tough world,
especially in the business world.

00:07:49.376 --> 00:07:51.366
It's predominated by white males.

00:07:51.906 --> 00:07:54.726
And it's tough to be a Latina,
and it's tough to be a woman,

00:07:55.266 --> 00:07:58.346
and it's tough to be from Oakland,
and it's really challenging.

00:07:59.026 --> 00:08:03.296
&gt;&gt;Veronica: And I am Veronica
Garcia, the Executive Director

00:08:03.296 --> 00:08:05.506
of Fremont SIFE, and
we are here today

00:08:05.506 --> 00:08:08.076
to show you how we are
sparking hope in our world.

00:08:08.706 --> 00:08:10.316
&gt;&gt;Veronica: Me, personally,
I wanted to succeed.

00:08:10.316 --> 00:08:11.736
I want to show everybody
I can do better

00:08:11.736 --> 00:08:12.736
than what they think I could do.

00:08:12.736 --> 00:08:15.466
And it's like with SIFE we have
the opportunity to show them,

00:08:15.466 --> 00:08:16.516
you know, we're not stupid.

00:08:16.886 --> 00:08:18.136
We have a lot of drive in us.

00:08:18.246 --> 00:08:20.126
You know, we could do
anything we put our minds to.

00:08:20.126 --> 00:08:23.686
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And the first
runner-up, second place goes

00:08:23.686 --> 00:08:25.716
to Golden West High School.

00:08:26.716 --> 00:08:28.896
&gt;&gt;Students: [cheering]

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.526
&gt;&gt;D'Andre: I was happy.

00:08:35.916 --> 00:08:39.226
'Cause I never been a part
of anything like this really.

00:08:39.336 --> 00:08:42.106
So after we won, I was excited.

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:45.156
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The next
day Williams learned

00:08:45.156 --> 00:08:48.666
that his cousin had been fatally
wounded in a drive-by shooting.

00:08:49.106 --> 00:08:51.336
&gt;&gt;D'Andre: Oakland's public
image is not exactly wrong.

00:08:51.866 --> 00:08:54.376
The City's problems have been
way over-covered by the media.

00:08:54.846 --> 00:08:55.616
Every time we turn around...

00:08:55.616 --> 00:08:58.506
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But five weeks later,
he traveled with his team to compete

00:08:58.626 --> 00:09:01.756
for the SIFE National
Championship in Kansas City.

00:09:02.116 --> 00:09:03.476
&gt;&gt;D'Andre: Yet, amidst this darkness

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:05.796
that surrounds us the
fire of hope is growing.

00:09:06.586 --> 00:09:08.356
&gt;&gt;Amy: I think the presentation part

00:09:08.356 --> 00:09:13.326
of it really helps build their
confidence, and makes them so proud

00:09:13.326 --> 00:09:16.096
of themselves that they don't
let these barriers that were

00:09:16.096 --> 00:09:17.806
in the way before get
in their way now.

00:09:18.216 --> 00:09:21.466
That keeps them safe when they go out
into the street, because they know

00:09:21.466 --> 00:09:25.336
that in their heart that they don't
have to appear to be someone else

00:09:25.496 --> 00:09:27.476
in order to have status
in their community.

00:09:27.476 --> 00:09:29.576
I don't think that's enough
to protect them from something

00:09:29.576 --> 00:09:32.826
like a stray bullet, which is
something that happens a lot

00:09:32.826 --> 00:09:36.466
in Oakland, but it's enough
to help them make good choices

00:09:36.466 --> 00:09:37.676
that could save their lives.

00:09:38.126 --> 00:09:40.336
&gt;&gt;Student: This way students
can represent their schools

00:09:40.336 --> 00:09:42.566
and class instead of
representing gangs.

00:09:43.256 --> 00:09:44.526
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Any comments?

00:09:44.826 --> 00:09:47.146
&gt;&gt;Yvonne: I feel great and confident.

00:09:47.466 --> 00:09:48.626
To me, we're the winners.

00:09:48.956 --> 00:09:51.056
And whatever happens.

00:09:51.056 --> 00:09:52.416
And I will always have
the confidence.

00:09:52.416 --> 00:09:54.826
&gt;&gt;Judge: The Champion team
from the USA is the team

00:09:57.826 --> 00:10:00.316
from the Fremont Business
Academy in Oakland, California.

00:10:00.316 --> 00:10:00.383
&gt;&gt;Students: [cheering] [applause]

00:10:08.383 --> 00:10:09.506
&gt;&gt;Narrator: After graduating
Veronica Garcia

00:10:09.846 --> 00:10:13.846
and Nidya Baez began the fall
semester at the University

00:10:13.976 --> 00:10:15.006
of California at Berkeley.

00:10:16.486 --> 00:10:20.946
And the Youth Empowerment School the
SIFE team created welcomed its first

00:10:21.086 --> 00:10:26.956
freshman class in September of 2003.

00:10:27.046 --> 00:10:28.676
