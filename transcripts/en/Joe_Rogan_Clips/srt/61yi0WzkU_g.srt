1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,990
Will happen,

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,400
the Joe Rogan experience and then I get
on that elliptical machine and now I'm

3
00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:08,430
doing the elliptical, you know,
for the universe like Flash Gordon,

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,680
he letting motherfuckers
know I'm saving the planet.

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,310
Ever watched the old Flash
Gordon from the 1950s nope.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,960
That was the first one I saw was the
cheap chitty one in the eighties uh,

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,740
I was on a plane,
not really recently.

8
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:22,740
It's like I guess more
like a couple of years ago.

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,110
And they had a one of those video catalogs
so you could just watch stuff. Yeah,

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,690
I think it was an international flight.
Yeah.

11
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,860
And it had a old TV shows and it had
flash Gordon and I watched a bunch of

12
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:39,180
episodes of flashcards.
Wild. It was weird.

13
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:40,800
It's weird to watch.
Yeah.

14
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,930
It's weird to watch what people thought
like space was going to be like in

15
00:00:43,931 --> 00:00:45,780
aliens. It's so strange. Yeah.

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,230
I mean I think Flash Gordon was
probably from the fifties right?

17
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,060
Those are comic book Lizard. Yes. Yeah.

18
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:56,150
It was originally a comic book CV get
pull up video of they need to remake that

19
00:00:56,371 --> 00:00:58,110
fan photos of the green room.
And the punchline.

20
00:00:58,111 --> 00:01:01,050
I was looking for that Hicks line.
Oh we've showed that before.

21
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,250
I wish they would remake Flash
Gordon and make it accommodate that.

22
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:09,430
Keep the soundtrack cause it's quaint.
Oh human rights. These huge queens.

23
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,980
Huge right now. Keep the exact same
soundtrack. Make Flash Gordon a comedy.

24
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:17,040
Jack Black. Get a, what are
you thinking of a Flash Gordon,

25
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:20,310
the movie now the movie that's,
that's totally move way, way, way.

26
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,770
There's the original
flash board with meaning.

27
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:27,150
The merciless may the most of them.
Cause I to Sun Bowl. I'd look at him.

28
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,140
How Wa how weird does he look? Look at
Flash. Like that's what they thought.

29
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:34,590
People are going to be wearing weird
neck collars in the future belt buckles.

30
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,240
Like it's such a strange look man.
It just a lightening bolt on your chest.

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,300
Pull up, look at the yellow bit so we
could watch a video because it's so,

32
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,900
it's so weird to watch cause it
looks like, what years did it say?

33
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:49,530
50 64 to 55 wow.
Ming the merciless.

34
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,150
So this is where he like,
it's so shitty.

35
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,100
Like the special effects were. So this is
not even the movie. This is the, I know,

36
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:05,130
but I mean I'm saying the claim jumpers,
Steve Holland does Flash Gordon, Irene,

37
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:10,130
chaplain Dale Harden. Look, she's
hot. She's hot in a real way. Yeah.

38
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,960
There was no faking it back
then. Doctors are, yeah,

39
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,360
same care. I've not seen this
though. So this was a whole TV show.

40
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,620
How many episodes do you think they made?
If I had to guess.

41
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,670
I bet they made 50 or something like that.
I look at that. She's Ah, that shirt.

42
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,230
She is hot tea. That side. Look at
that. It looks like a drill. Yeah. No,

43
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,160
she's holding a drill.
Women back then all have flat butts.

44
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,050
Unless they did gymnastics.
That's right.

45
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:42,051
Unless there's some freak of nature
accident and that is some sort of weird

46
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:44,220
deal.
Does stupid.

47
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,000
That's what Jack Hammer that you
know what the handheld Jackhammer.

48
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,010
It looks like that Tim
dam that there are gun.

49
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,990
That's what it looks like right
there. What does that, this thing,

50
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,920
this is a thing I do.
It's for massage. Oh Shit.

51
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,720
[inaudible]

52
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,480
May I? Yes. Hang on.

53
00:03:05,481 --> 00:03:08,660
Probably shouldn't do it right in front
of on a microphone like I did. Yeah.

54
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,320
It's great. It doesn't hurt.
Yeah. It's real good for
loosening up muscles on, Bro.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,760
That's what they had. Good to the, yeah.
Again, that's their weapon, but to me,

56
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,600
I'm gonna Punch you in the face real fast.
It's always weird seeing what,

57
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,590
what people thought the future was going
to be like once the future he hits.

58
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:24,680
Okay.
