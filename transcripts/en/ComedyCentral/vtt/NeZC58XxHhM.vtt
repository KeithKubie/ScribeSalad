00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:03.036
Yesterday, congressional
Republicans unveiled their plan

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.605
to replace Obamacare.

00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:06.573
It's called
the "American Health Care Act."

00:00:06.607 --> 00:00:09.142
It's basically just a wet sock
filled with ibuprofen

00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:12.179
-and a Post-it note that says
"Good luck." -(laughter)

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:15.148
But Jason Chaffetz,
the Utah Republican congressman

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:19.152
who looks like a Rescue Ranger
with a G.I. Joe doll haircut,

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:21.788
defended the proposal
on CNN this morning

00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:23.657
in a way that would make
Marie Antoinette proud.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.627
Americans have choices,

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.729
and they've got to make
a choice, and so maybe rather

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:30.430
than getting that new iPhone

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:32.065
that they just love,
and they want go to spend

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.066
hundreds of dollars on that,
maybe

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.601
they should invest
in their own health care.

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:37.137
They've got to make
those decisions themselves.

00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:39.673
-Yeah, (bleep) you, millennials!
-Yeah! -(laughter)

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:43.177
If you just forgo
that $749 iPhone 7,

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.548
you can literally pay for
two percent of an appendectomy.

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:49.683
-Oh! -HARDWICK: "Iconic image
of a woman deciding

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:52.319
between health care and that
sweet new iPhone she wanted."

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:54.254
-Oh, Jesus.
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:55.489
-It's the Dust Bowl photo lady.
-Yeah.

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:57.457
-She...
-Now, of course... What?

00:00:57.491 --> 00:01:00.194
-She has an iPhone 3. Just
saying. -HARDWICK: She has a...

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:02.396
Of course
as a member of Congress,

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.132
-this melted The Rock Popsicle
gets... -(laughter)

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.501
...sweet, sweet subsidized
government health care.

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:09.236
But not only that.
It turns out

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:10.637
Chaffetz's political
action committee pays

00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:12.339
for his Verizon bill.

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:15.275
Comedians, what's another
of his money-saving tips

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:17.377
for people without health care?
Beth.

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:19.780
You could save money on gas

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:21.682
for your commute
by dying in your sleep.

00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:23.250
(laughter)

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:26.119
(applause and cheering)

00:01:26.153 --> 00:01:28.522
So easy.

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:30.157
-HARDWICK: No more premiums.
-No. -Yeah.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.292
HARDWICK:
Points. Yes.

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:34.294
If you hold your breathe
long enough,

00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:36.296
God will take care
of everything else.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.698
-(laughter)
-HARDWICK: Yes, Randy.

00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:41.301
At least that's how I got
my iPhone. Wait. No?

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:43.504
-(laughter)
-Very good. Jay.

00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:45.706
One small penis-removal surgery
will save tons

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:48.475
-of money on Viagra.
-HARDWICK: Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:48.575
-RANDY: A very smart choice.
-(applause and cheering)
