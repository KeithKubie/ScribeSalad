00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
Hey everyone, hope you're having an amazing day, it's mark Wiens

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.910
I'm in Bali, Indonesia and one of the best places you can come for a night market of traditional

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:15.329
Balinese indonesian street food is called "Pasar Senggol" which is in Gianyar, so we just arrived this evening

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.680
They're just opening up. There's a lot of street food to choose from here, and we're gonna start eating. I'm hungry

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.660
There's an

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.500
amazing choice of Balinese food to choose from but there's no better way to start than with babi guling which is one of the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.860
Most famous of all Balinese dishes, it's the roasted pig and they have the entire pig sitting up front there

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.720
Yeah, I don't know if there's anything better than sitting with your your face to the to the snout

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.240
Okay, thank you

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Alright babi guling is served

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.910
Terima kasih

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.910
This is such a cool warung little stalls they have, they're all

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.790
Bar counter chefs counter seated they have they have all the food laid out, and you just sit down they have

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.479
Seats around the stall and I got a classic plate of babi guling complete with everything

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.579
There's the the roast pig you get a little portion of the skin and then some of the meat down there some of the sausage

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.099
another type of sausage and then some crunchy pork cracklings, and then some other sambal all over a

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.180
Little scoop of rice, okay, let's get started and dissect this plate. Oh, yeah, so you lift up look at that skin

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.350
It's so crispy. And

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.540
You can see you can just hear your fork that hardness, and you can just see it glistening and then under here

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.739
They have some of the chopped up pork and then some sambal mixed in here

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.339
Oh, and I think that's some lawar as well. I got coconut long bean salad

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
Hmm oh, yeah

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.910
Hmm. Oh the sambal in there the meat is really nice and tender and then I got some of that some of that relish

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.200
just that lawar you can taste the coconut in there you can taste the

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.140
the coconut and the long beans

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.560
Yeah

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.039
That's the bite you crave when you eat babi guling that crunchy skin, okay, let's try some of that sausage there

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.750
I know that dark one it's the blood sausage

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.360
But I'm not sure what the the white one is that definitely looks like a an intestine rich sausage

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.080
I think that might be egg sausage sort of has like a spongy egg spring to it.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.140
Oh

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.140
I really, love the pork cracklin here cuz they're so

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.049
So like airy they're like just bubbles of crispiness what truly makes babi guling so

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.820
Fabulous is the different mixture of all the ingredients, so you not only have the skin in the pork

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.949
But you also have all sorts of different

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.560
textural and flavorful

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.789
Excitements including the sambal, the lawar, the satay, the the pork crackling

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.479
All sorts of all sorts of different things go into a plate of babi guling

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.709
Okay time for that blood sausage

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.630
Oh, Wow!

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.739
It sort of just squeezes like a like a tub of toothpaste oh

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.149
Okay, I guess you can't cut that in half. You need to just eat it all in one bite

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.400
That's a little on the smooth like chocolaty side for me. How are you? Hello

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.379
Okay babi guling is complete. That was a delicious plate of food. That was a real street food version

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.310
It was it was very good

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.369
But it was a little it served a little bit cold so I think it would have been better if it was really like piping

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.799
Hot and a little fresher, but really hot

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.119
But still it was it was very tasty and that sambal was fantastic along with the crispy pork

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.409
You'll find quite a few snack little dessert stalls and they're pretty busy right now

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.969
But they have a bunch of desserts set up in the back and then they package everything into little little

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.059
Plastic little boxes, and then you can get them

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.400
I think every box is just one thousand rupiah's so we got a couple boxes to try. What's the name of this one?

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.819
"Klepon"

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.900
There's a there's a staple and you don't want to eat this staple okay, and these are little

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.380
Bite sized, Would you like one?

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.840
All right, and so you can see that there's coconut all around the outside of this, and it feels well

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.980
It feels very squishy in your fingers

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.929
It's really surprising you're not expecting that! As soon as you bite down

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.710
It's really really pillowy and soft, but as soon as you bite down

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.439
like a an explosion of

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.030
Sweet syrup

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.440
Comes into your mouth

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.679
Three dimensions to it the surf on the inside, which I think is palm sugar, the gooey rice cake and then

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.750
The fresh coconut on the outside, okay?

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.739
Make sure you you keep track of those staples so that you don't take a bite of a staple

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.930
Which would be a pretty bad idea

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.970
Put some coconut on top and you can see these are kind of like.. Oh wow they're kind of like dense

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:48.890
This is okay, you've got a little you've got a little packet here of palm sugar. Well. Thank you Made. A

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.040
little packet of palm sugar

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.500
So you put some on the top yeah?

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.050
As much as you want okay?

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.340
Depending how much of a sweet tooth you have you can add as much of the palm sugar

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.119
Syrup as much as you like how much do you want, Made? Oh?

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.320
That much or more? I love sweet one. Okay, this one is for you

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.080
Made you have that one, I'll..

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.300
You want more coconut? No. Okay, I'll add some more coconut

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:29.320
Well, that's like a that feels like kind of like a blob of extra cooked noodles that start to stick together

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:41.240
That kind of tastes like a very very well cooked dough or like boiled dough, kind of

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.360
They have quite a few stalls on this side

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.999
But then they also have a lot of street food stalls on the other side

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.820
So we're crossing over the street now to the other stalls

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.150
It's time for another plate of food

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:16.469
We have arrived at the next stall and this is a plate of food that looks absolutely incredible

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.960
And look at my my background

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.300
You've got some grilled chicken

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:26.279
They have some ayam tutu which is one of the most common one of the most famous Balinese dishes

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:31.140
It's a it's a chicken which is just for the plates of food that they are serving up as well as to the

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.629
testament of how busy this place is

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.740
This is a must eat that we had to stop here immediately

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.920
We just ordered the nasi campur

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.179
Which is gonna be a plate that includes a little bit of everything, a mix, campur means a mix

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.739
This is an impressive plate of food. I can't wait till mine comes

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.970
I'm just I'm just eyeing it in awe I'm beginning with a cup of iced tea. Oh

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:06.780
Good classic this is my drink of choice at Warungs just black tea with no

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:13.409
Sugar and just iced. It's very refreshing and then before your main plate of rice comes they serve you a soup

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.570
There's some meat in here. Oh here, it arrives

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.759
Oh, that's a beautiful plate of food. This is absolutely

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:27.380
Insanely beautiful, and I love how they've just piled everything on top of the rice

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.380
You've got that the scoop of rice on the bottom

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.859
And then they have some some of the grilled chickens some of the ayam tutu and

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:40.549
Then there's some lawar down there. There are some peanuts some roasted peanuts there, are there's half an egg. There's some cucumber

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:42.380
There's two different types of sambal

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.589
There's a like a red sauce sambal and then there's a sambal matah

00:08:45.589 --> 00:08:51.829
Which is the there's some shallots in there and chilies, and I think coconut oil that is five-star gourmet right there?

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.480
Oh, that's gorgeous

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.020
This is a plate of food that makes me happy before even taking my first bite

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.370
And you can kind of reach in with your fingers and grab a little bit you can add some peanuts

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:05.989
You can add some lawar and some of the chicken and just mix it with the rice, and then take your first bite

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.860
Wow

00:09:17.889 --> 00:09:19.609
Oh that is

00:09:19.609 --> 00:09:20.959
insane

00:09:20.959 --> 00:09:25.149
Oh the texture of that drumstick is unbelievably creamy

00:09:25.149 --> 00:09:29.618
Oh, that's so good and then mix with that sambal the shallots in there the chilies oh

00:09:30.619 --> 00:09:35.469
Man, I got some crunch from those salty peanuts. That's insane. Oh that is that is award-winning

00:09:41.899 --> 00:09:43.899
The texture of that chicken

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:48.070
Unbelievably good. I love it with both of the sambals. You've got that red. Sambal. Which is a little more

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:55.000
Sweet, and then the the shallots sambal which is just pure salty and kind of oily and just packed of flavor

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.929
It's so good, this is an amazing meal

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:11.820
Man I love it okay now moving unto the egg

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:31.310
Well the egg has a little bit of a bounce to it, this is such a properly good mixture of flavors and combinations

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:39.560
Okay next up. I'll try the soup here, and there's a banana trunk in here as well as some kind of meat

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:41.590
I think chicken bones

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:49.580
Yeah, that taste like chicken broth and there might be some turmeric in there to make it yellow as well

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.639
That's really got to to complement the whole meal

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:57.930
Wow that was

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:05.029
Incredibly good. That was one of the better single plates of food that I've had in Bali. I loved that mixture the flavors were delicious

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:13.220
Really fresh really vibrant and not to mention pretty that was, that was like gourmet

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.749
Placing and decoration

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:29.350
There are a lot of things to eat, but there's a lot of repetitions, so there's a lot of stalls selling the same dishes

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:35.180
So there's actually not not a huge huge variety, but there's there's still a lot to to try and sample.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.120
We stopped next for a dish called tipat cantok

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:53.459
And it looks very similar to me to gado-gado indonesian gado-gado

00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:56.279
And she she made the whole thing right before me

00:11:56.279 --> 00:12:01.559
I watched her make it she first added in to the big giant stone mortar and pestle

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.319
But the flat one she added some peanuts

00:12:04.839 --> 00:12:08.099
But it almost looks good kind of like peanut brittle and that she added in a couple

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:11.759
Chillies some garlic and that she mashed that up with the masher

00:12:11.759 --> 00:12:16.589
And then she added in some water to make a sauce consume that entire

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:24.359
Stone base was just covered in sauce and then she added in that ketupat which are rice cakes which are steamed in

00:12:26.019 --> 00:12:30.299
Palm leaves and then she chopped that up into the into the the

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.139
peanut sauce and then she added in a handful of

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:39.569
I think they're baby bean sprouts, and then finally she

00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:44.399
Added in some lime some topping with some crispy onions crispy shallots

00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:47.219
And then finally drizzled it in some I think that's kecap manis

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:52.889
Which is the sweet soy sauce so this is a very interesting dish. She made it all fresh and

00:12:53.529 --> 00:12:55.170
This is a it's pretty cool

00:12:55.170 --> 00:13:00.000
I'm digging in and you can see the big chunks of rice cake you can see oh, there's some cabbage in here, too

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.019
And if she just coated everything evenly in that sauce

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:13.099
Hmm yeah truly peanutty it has that, that real contrast

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.609
It's both salty and sweet, but nothing overpowering each other

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:23.179
You've got the rice cake which is really soft, and then you've got the slightly blanched bean sprouts and cabbage which

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:29.389
Give it a different texture as well. Oh, and I forgot to mention. They served in on the classic ajinomoto plate

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:39.770
It's kind of like a salad mixture, but then it's it's very dense it's very filling because of those those rice cakes in there

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:46.010
But I like I like the mix that she made. It's a little bit spicy you can taste the garlic in there and then

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.450
It really is both both sweet and salty at the same time with that nice peanut flavor

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:58.790
And I'm having another cup of iced tea

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.599
My beverage of choice oh man, this is one of those straws that when you when you suck it it closes

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.600
So it's kind of kind of got a drip kind of slowly

00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:17.889
Oh thank you, Ying

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.190
They're really nice

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:24.899
especially the

00:14:24.899 --> 00:14:30.949
Elderly auntie who made that she's really she's really an expert. How she I loved watching her make that I love watching

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.549
Things that are made like that when they especially with a mortar and pestle

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:37.820
And how they squish the ingredients and just pound everything out

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:44.330
But that was to me that was very similar in taste to gado-gado, but with a little bit of a different ingredient

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:51.170
Component makeup within the market you will find quite a few stalls serving snack which is called Serombotan

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.680
And it's a it's again. It's a mixture of many different

00:14:55.260 --> 00:15:01.189
Components, and she has all the different things laying out. There's some bean sprouts. There's some water spinach

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:04.159
I think some long beans there's some green banana slices

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:11.270
There's some soy beans and then some peanuts, and then she mixes everything into a paper cone, and then she added in some spicy

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.659
coconut plus some peanut sauce and some sambal

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:21.409
Terima kasih oh it's a spoon, oh terima kasih

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:29.599
It looks pretty good that it's actually all just vegetables and then just that that sauce different sauces and so I think you can just

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.940
kind of this is kind of like a

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:34.370
boiled vegetable snack

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.860
Oh

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:41.940
I

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.940
Really like that mm-hmm. That's

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:48.110
Delicious I was expecting it to be more, sweet, but it's not sweet at all

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:55.579
I thought it was gonna taste exactly like it looks, but it's actually better than it looks. It's really good. The vegetables are nice and

00:15:56.310 --> 00:16:03.889
Crisp, and then you've got the crunchy soybeans and crunchy nuts in there, and then what really comes through is that that coconut?

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.500
man that coconut is awesome and

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:08.910
the green banana in there

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:10.940
That's a that's a wonderful mixture

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:20.240
I really like it and you kind of got a scoop towards the bottom because in all that sauce starts to go to the bottom

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.110
Man I'm impressed by how good this one is

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.760
That's awesome and it's really really healthy as well

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:40.580
Just all vegetables and that coconut and peanut and on that note I think we're gonna wrap up this tour of Pasar Senggol

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:42.390
this is a

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:45.040
Great little market what I like about it. Is that it's very

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.180
Relaxed it's very laid-back

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:53.659
You can come here and just kind of stroll around and you can go from stall to stall and try you can get snacks both
