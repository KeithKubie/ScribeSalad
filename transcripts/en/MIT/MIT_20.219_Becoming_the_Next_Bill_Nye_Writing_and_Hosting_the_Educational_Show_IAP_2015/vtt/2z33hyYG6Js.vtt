00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.660
ELIZABETH CHOE: So I think the
idea of a workshop-based class,

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.030
a hands-on class, that's what's
becoming trendy in education.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.740
At least at MIT right now.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.640
It's bringing it back
to mind and hand.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.470
They won't work
if students don't

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.450
bring anything to workshop
or have anything ready.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.030
So that's why the first
two or three days of class

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.149
were very, very information
intense to bring them up

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:33.690
to the point where they had a
script that they could actually

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.620
read aloud at the table read.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.600
Or that they would have a
scene they could storyboard.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.790
How was it leading
the workshops?

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.590
Because I could kind of let
you guys take over for those.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.810
JOSHUA GUNN: Yeah, I mean
I think it was great.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.890
I mean, I think we
couldn't have done

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.540
what we did if they
hadn't come to the class

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.390
with a portion of a script
that they could storyboard.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.260
Or do some sort of
storyboard work on.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.720
I think maybe in the future
you might think about having--

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.210
well, I don't have.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.220
Setting it up so that
there's instruction

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.750
about say, storyboarding, and
examples and kind of models.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.660
Then have them do that
and then have them return

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.680
for the critique.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.760
As opposed to trying to compress
all of that into one class.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.770
But again, that
requires more time.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.490
GEORGE ZAIDAN: My only
workshop-- workshops

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.130
are great because it means that
you rely a lot more on stuff

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.770
that you sort of just know and
can talk off the cuff about

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.565
and don't have to prepare long
lectures, which is fantastic.

00:01:50.565 --> 00:01:51.940
ELIZABETH CHOE:
But that requires

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.367
that you actually are just
natively an expert in that.

00:01:54.367 --> 00:01:56.200
GEORGE ZAIDAN: But the
nice thing about that

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.750
is that you can reduce the
time you spend speaking

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.220
and increase the time that they
spend working and speaking.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.930
And I think the earlier that
you get the students talking

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.600
and doing things
things in the workshop,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.650
the more quickly they realize
that it's not a lecture.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.780
And that they're not going
to sit there and absorb.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.430
That they have to
actually do something.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.740
ELIZABETH CHOE: So you had
people reading their scripts

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.240
from the beginning
of your workshop.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.460
There was no easing into it.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.950
It was pretty much just
like all right, this

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.350
is the script that so and
so submitted last night

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.110
OK, come up and read it for us.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.280
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.740
And then they get over their
nerves and they just do it.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.190
And then you roll into it.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.010
The hard thing about doing
that is-- giving feedback

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.530
in a workshop is tough
because you can't just

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.840
be like great job.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.395
Go sit down.

00:02:48.395 --> 00:02:50.270
That was great that you
did it, but we're not

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.160
going to give you any
constructive criticism.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.862
You've got to say OK, here's
what I would do differently.

00:02:55.862 --> 00:02:57.320
But you have to do
it in such a way

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.070
that it's not ego destroying.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.210
And that applies for
any of the stuff.

00:03:06.004 --> 00:03:07.670
It's hard to do,
especially for hosting,

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.380
because there you're commenting
on their tone of voice,

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.417
their delivery style--

00:03:12.417 --> 00:03:13.750
ELIZABETH CHOE: Their existence.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.580
GEORGE ZAIDAN:
The way they talk.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.080
You know?

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.790
So it's a tricky thing to get.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.820
You sort of err on the side
of being a little bit softer

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.670
than you probably would be.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.390
JOSHUA GUNN: It's also-- sorry.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.680
It's also interesting
to get them--

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.840
I think just from my basic
pedagogical experience,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.440
because I did teach creative
writing for a while.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.500
It's nice to get
them-- to get students,

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.700
as you said, doing peer work
where they're critiquing

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.960
each other so there isn't just
this authority figure that

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.050
has all the answers.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.940
There's also this innate sense
that we all have, and students

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.600
have, of what's
working and what's not.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.370
Because they are
audience members too

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.362
and they have that
audience sensibility.

00:04:00.362 --> 00:04:02.570
ELIZABETH CHOE: Actually a
really important thing was

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.690
to establish that the medium
in which we are working had no

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.370
established best practices, and
that was something that I tried

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.130
to emphasize a lot
and say, you know,

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.329
I have very strong opinions on
what I think is good hosting

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.260
and what isn't.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.100
But at the end of
the day, you do

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.220
what you want as long as
you can justify it to me.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.200
You can take or leave
my advice on how

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.000
I think you should
edit this section,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.610
but if you want to stick
with what you have and you're

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.752
able to write out why--

00:04:32.752 --> 00:04:35.500
JOSHUA GUNN: You're
going to get an F.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.000
ELIZABETH CHOE: But
an A for effort.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.580
That's fine as long as I
see that they're consciously

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.980
processing their
own personal taste.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.610
What was the thing
you just said?

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.140
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I'm
saying that you

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.870
don't want to just be the
only person critiquing, which

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:55.720
is really important.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.530
CHRIS BOEBEL: It's
really, really important

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.988
and I think one of
the things about

00:04:57.988 --> 00:05:01.180
that too is trying to
make the classroom I

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.880
guess kind of a safe space where
people can be really honest.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.574
And it's like, you know what?

00:05:06.574 --> 00:05:08.740
Someone is probably going
to go at you and your work

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.660
at some point, but you
need to be OK with that.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.070
And if you feel that you need
to be honest with somebody

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.939
about their work, that's OK too.

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:19.730
As long as you're not
doing it on some kind

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.530
of illegitimate grounds.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.420
If it's a legitimate
critique, you

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.485
should feel OK about saying it.

00:05:26.485 --> 00:05:28.110
JOSHUA GUNN: Yeah,
that's a good point.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.220
I think too, it can sometimes
be helpful to just kind of lay

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.725
the ground rules of critique.

00:05:34.725 --> 00:05:35.600
Like what's personal.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.470
I mean, sometimes it's
not obvious to students

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.610
what's a personal attack.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.962
What's constructive
criticism of the work.

00:05:42.962 --> 00:05:44.420
CHRIS BOEBEL:
Sometimes people need

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.740
instruction on peer review.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.170
JOSHUA GUNN: Yeah, exactly.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.820
You can't expect that
people know the rules.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.320
ELIZABETH CHOE:
Luckily, just having

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.210
Jamie at every single
class was really helpful.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.930
I mean, it's hard.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.730
In an ideal world,
every class would

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.180
have a staff of
five people who are

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.830
all experts on different
facets of the industry.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.960
And then a dedicated
instructional designer

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.070
facilitating group
discussions every day.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.370
JOSHUA GUNN: Two
instructors per student.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.070
CHRIS BOEBEL: Let's
recommend that.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.580
ELIZABETH CHOE: Right.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.038
But you know, that's
what it takes.

00:06:14.038 --> 00:06:14.780
It really does.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.460
Because if Jamie
wasn't there, I don't

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.200
know how to facilitate
classroom discussion.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.000
She would be able to
interject and sort of coach

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.330
these things subliminally
without having

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.470
to establish guys, these
are the classroom rules.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.020
No picking on people.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.930
It was just all done
very organically.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.990
And that's actually very hard.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.420
This is such a cop-out
answer to be like,

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.600
it's important to foster
a good classroom space.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.180
Go do it.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.680
You know?

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.780
But I don't really know how to
give actionable items to people

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.350
who are trying to do
this in their schools.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:56.010
I think one thing
I tried to do was,

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.700
and this was off of
Jamie's suggestion,

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.680
was to do every single
assignment that I assigned

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.890
to the students.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:05.250
So on day one when they had
to record a selfie pitch,

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.780
I did it and I was like
this is not perfect.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.840
And the next day I
pointed out things

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.710
that I didn't like about it
or things that could have

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.950
been better about my own work.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.990
So I think having
something physical

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.310
to be able to critique,
to sort of show people

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.800
how to critique it, you know?

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.120
It's not even just show
people what's wrong,

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.470
but show people the active
critiquing is really important.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.980
Because if you don't have
the physical examples,

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.940
it's just like saying
lighting has to be done well.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.660
Well, if you don't show them
an example of a well-lit scene,

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.140
they're not going
to be able to do it.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.450
CHRIS BOEBEL: The things
you get from students

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.940
who aren't used to giving
that kind of critique

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.289
tend to be either oh, it was
good or I didn't like it.

00:07:54.289 --> 00:07:56.330
And neither one of those
is particularly helpful.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.038
JOSHUA GUNN: Yeah, or
in creative writing

00:07:58.038 --> 00:08:00.530
class students will be
like, this is really deep.

00:08:05.135 --> 00:08:06.010
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.460
But then to be able to be there
as an instructor and say, OK.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.464
Why do you think that?

00:08:10.464 --> 00:08:11.630
CHRIS BOEBEL: Yeah, exactly.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.850
Why is it good?

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:13.550
Why is it deep?

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:14.972
Why didn't you like it?

00:08:14.972 --> 00:08:16.680
ELIZABETH CHOE:
Questions that drive them

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.650
to give a more tangible answer.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:24.090
That's really important
in the live discussion.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.430
And it's important, I think,
to have it in real time.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.390
Which is why I
don't know how you

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:31.120
can scale this experience up.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.690
If you offer this
as an online class,

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:34.880
for instance, I guess you
could have forums where

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.880
students critique each other.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:41.510
But again, without the guidance
of someone who's practiced it.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:42.400
That limits you.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.180
And then someone
who responds like,

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.430
why do you think this was deep?

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.406
The next day, you sort
of lose that momentum.

00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:53.280
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I mean,
the really great thing

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.840
is when this sort of
stuff happens on set.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.490
Like when we were shooting the
episode about the exploding

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.632
wire and our student
host got to see you,

00:09:02.632 --> 00:09:04.090
me, and the director
of photography

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.590
get into a fight about why we
thought the framing was wrong.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.154
And I mean, it was
literally like,

00:09:08.154 --> 00:09:09.570
what do you think
of this framing?

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:10.700
I hate it.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:11.292
Why?

00:09:11.292 --> 00:09:13.500
Because it looks like an
episode of Home Improvement?

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.250
Like an actual episode
of Home Improvement

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:18.972
or the show that they were
parodying in Home Improvement?

00:09:18.972 --> 00:09:19.930
No, the crappy version.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:20.160
OK.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.701
Well, let's figure
out how to fix it.

00:09:21.701 --> 00:09:24.120
Like that's the kind of
discussion that happens on set.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.619
ELIZABETH CHOE: And that is so
much more helpful for someone

00:09:26.619 --> 00:09:31.260
to see than sometimes people
struggle with framing.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.030
Here are some tips.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:37.070
Try to put the people
in this framing.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.410
It might be more engaging.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:42.110
That's sort of how media
things are presented right now.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:44.140
But to see like
George and me fight,

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.449
is one, way more entertaining.

00:09:45.449 --> 00:09:46.615
JOSHUA GUNN: I'm sure it is.

00:09:46.615 --> 00:09:49.360
ELIZABETH CHOE: But two, I
think like she probably took

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.720
a lot more out of that than
watching a lecture series.
