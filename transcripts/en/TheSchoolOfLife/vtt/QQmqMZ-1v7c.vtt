00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.680
Arguments in relationships are typically so
regrettable and often so bitter, it’s natural

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.670
to hope we might – with greater maturity
– overcome them once and for all. But given

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.231
what human nature is like, it would be unwise
to make this our goal: the hope can’t be

00:00:17.231 --> 00:00:23.590
to eliminate arguments altogether, it should
be to try to find our way to a better kind

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.590
of argument. Arguments tend to start when
we are confronted – usually rather suddenly

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.329
– by what appears to us to be the radical
selfishness, intransigence or sheer nastiness

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:41.210
of the partner. It is extremely tempting to
react with equal force. We aren’t, after

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.730
all, a pushover. We have been hurt and must
hurt back. We will make them suffer as they

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.499
have made us suffer. There may be variations
in just how we opt to inflict the suffering.

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:58.300
Perhaps we’ll do a lot of shouting. Or slam
a door. Or maybe we’ll eke this one out

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.640
with a sulk. But the underlying principle
is the same: we have been hurt and we have

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.760
to punish. But at this point, we might ask
what we’re really seeking. After all, we

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.530
are not trying to administer abstract justice
or punish for the sake of it. This isn’t

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.420
a criminal court or the headmaster’s office.
What we’re truly seeking in a close relationship

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.870
is something much more touching: we want the
other person to love us properly and to be

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.130
kinder. That’s why we’re slamming the
door, calling them a fuckwit and have been

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.170
pretending they don’t exist since breakfast.
Surprisingly, almost the last thing we ever

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.820
do when we’ve been very hurt is to say that
we’ve been very hurt. It feels just too

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.170
humiliating to reveal our wound to the person
who inflicted it, to show ourselves as vulnerable

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.650
in front of the very individual who – it
seems – has unbearably abused our vulnerability.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.950
This is both hugely understandable and doesn’t
advance things in the least, because we’re

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:06.030
not in a relationship to be emotionally safe,
we’re there to find connection. An act of

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.420
retribution, while it may give us a momentary
impression of impregnability, never increases

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.569
our chances of obtaining the love and understanding
we’ve formed a couple in order to derive.

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.319
We might consider a different and slightly
paradoxical approach: we might, exactly at

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.019
the moment when we’ve been wounded by our
partner, instead of hitting back, make what

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:36.819
we could term A Dignified Avowal of Hurt and
Fear. Rather than get furious, we might attempt

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.870
to move register and get directly at what
is ailing us through a twofold admission.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.060
We might say, firstly: I’m so hurt that
someone I’ve put my emotional trust in should

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.040
say or do that to me. And secondly, (this
takes proper courage), we might add: I’m

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.980
so frightened that I should be emotionally
deeply exposed to someone who would appear

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.980
to hurt me like this. This should give the
partner pause for thought. One hasn’t insulted

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.159
them or hurt them back in the usual way – which
is what typically blocks their ears and sets

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:15.170
off a vicious cycle of attack and counterattack.
We are being dignified and honest. We aren’t

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.031
lashing out, but nor are we begging. We are
neither being very strong, nor very weak.

00:03:20.031 --> 00:03:25.310
We are neither punching nor crawling. We are
just standing still, admitting our genuine

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:33.029
sadness, fear and nakedness in a tone of marked
self-possession. Too often, arguments become

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:38.829
interminable and, to outsiders, slightly daft
because both people refuse to admit that they’re

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:44.329
sad not mean. It isn’t what time to leave
for the airport or whose turn it is to do

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:49.129
the dishes that’s created the argument.
It’s that both parties are, in different

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:55.029
ways, feeling unloved and misunderstood – but
are refusing to say this in quite so many

00:03:55.029 --> 00:04:01.069
words. In a wiser society, we’d study arguments
at school for at least four years (they’re

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.390
as complicated as algebra and more important)
and we’d all get a lot better at confessing

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.060
our wounds in a tone of self-possessed dignity.
We’d admit with calm that, though we’re

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.440
capable and strong in most areas of our lives,
here, right now, in the arena of the relationship,

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.410
we are hurt and scared – and yet are brave
and mature enough, as well committed enough

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:30.150
to love, to dare to tell the partner so in
the plainest, most undecorated and most heartfelt

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.920
words. We might save ourselves a lot of time.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:44.560
We believe in making the world a more emotionally intelligent place and to that end we have now also published some extraordinary books.
