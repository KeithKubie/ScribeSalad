[Captions by Y Translator]
In today's video,
we're going to show you

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.900
how to take a couple
of paint sticks,

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.300
and a dab of wood glue,
and turn it into a functional

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.402
returning boomerang.

00:00:06.402 --> 00:00:13.960
[Music]

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.800
Boomerangs are pretty cool,
originated in Australia.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.800
It's a stick with a curve in it

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.300
with some shavings
and carvings along the sides

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.400
that make it so if you throw it correctly,
it will actually wrap around

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.100
and return to you.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.520
This one's bought
as a souvenir in Australia,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.320
and today, we're going to be
learning how to make our own.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.100
They are going to look
quite like this.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.760
They're going to be
a different style,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.980
but they're going to be made
out of paint sticks.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.600
This whole project
will only cost like 20 cents

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.540
per boomerang that
you want to make.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.200
It's a really cool project,
surprisingly easy,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.400
it goes together quickly,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.100
and it's a lot of fun when
you finally get it to throw,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.000
and actually wrap around
and come back to you.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.520
Here's the basic idea:

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.700
By gluing to paint sticks
together in the middle,

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.900
and by sanding each
of the four arms

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.680
into a basic Wing shape,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.500
we create a functional boomerang
that will return when we

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.620
throw it properly.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.700
Now, paint sticks are available
at most places that sell paint,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.220
most hardware stores.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.700
These particular ones
are from Lowe's.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.692
You can get them
from Home Depot or Ace,

00:01:10.692 --> 00:01:11.600
or whatever you feel like.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.162
Whatever your local
hardware store is,

00:01:13.192 --> 00:01:15.100
they probably carry
something similar.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.300
I grabbed these ones.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.300
They actually just
let you take a couple

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.000
of them for free,
and so, we're going

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
to be gluing these together,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.800
and then shaping
them to turn them

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.300
into a working Boomerang.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.400
Before we do anything else
with them, we need to see

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.600
if our paint sticks have
any curvature to them.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.360
Sometimes, they will, sometimes,
they'll be perfectly straight.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.800
But if they do have some curve,
we want to know about it.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.300
So let's look right down
the line of the paint stick.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.600
This one is pretty straight.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.600
But I think it is curving
just a little bit.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.860
There's another test you can do,
which is to lay it on a flat surface,

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.800
and see if pressing
on one side makes

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.260
it rock back and forth.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.900
This one doesn't seem
to have much curve to it.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.360
I think it might have just
the very very slightest bit

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.700
curving this direction.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.080
So we'll leave that facing up.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.980
Let's see on this one.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.600
This one definitely has a curve.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.500
It's far more extreme
than the other one,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.722
but still pretty mild overall.

00:02:07.722 --> 00:02:09.402
That's right, setting it down.

00:02:10.872 --> 00:02:13.900
You can see that this one
does move a little bit

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.000
as we poke on the corners.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.700
If you flip it over, it's
not a perfectly level curve.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.300
This stick is slightly twisted,
but I think it will still work.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.900
So on both of these,
if there is any curve,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.400
it's curving up
in this direction.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.300
So right now,
they're both forming

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.780
a very very shallow bowl shape,

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.300
and we want to make sure
that we keep that as up.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.732
That's the side that
we'll call the top.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.860
It's the side that
it's curving up to.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.500
So like a hand that's open.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.700
Like if it's curling,
it's going to curl up

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.800
not down and backward.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.600
In this case,
it's easy to remember.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.800
There's lots
of paint on one side,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.800
and so we're going to call
that those the bottom.

00:02:51.482 --> 00:02:52.700
The plain sides are the top.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.500
So now, what we want to do
is find the exact centers

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.400
of these paint sticks.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.622
This particular kind of
paint stick is 12 inches long.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.180
Both of them 12 inches long.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.040
To line these both up,
we have the 6 inch mark on one stick,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.900
and the 6 inch mark on the other stick.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.100
So the 6 inch mark on this one
needs to line up with the center

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.400
on this stick.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.200
Similarly, the 6 inch mark here
needs to line up with the center of this one.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.000
By doing that,
we should end up

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.500
with our paint sticks perfectly
centered on each other.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.960
Now, what we're going to do is
add a little bit of wood glue,

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.200
and then clamp them down,
but not all the way.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.700
While it's slightly clamped,
we'll make sure everything is

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.862
nice and square with our square.

00:03:34.082 --> 00:03:36.500
So let's get a little dab
of wood glue on here.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.100
This is more glue
than I'm going to need.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.952
It's going to squeeze out
the sides quite a bit,

00:03:41.952 --> 00:03:42.800
we'll just clean it off.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.482
Now we want to line up
the marks with the centers.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.420
Now, we're going
to take a clamp.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.160
You could also probably use
a clothes pin for this,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.060
if you don't have any clamps, like I do.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:58.700
It just needs to hold it together.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.880
It doesn't even need
to hold it super tight.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.800
Just well enough.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.100
All right,

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.580
but now you can see
that while they are together,

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.000
they're not really square,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.500
and that's why we haven't
tightened this down too much.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.300
We now need to take our square,
and adjust these sticks.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.002
So they're actually
at 90 degree angles.

00:04:18.062 --> 00:04:20.300
Now, it's glued together,
being held together with the clamp.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.500
Now, let's let the glue dry,
and then we'll come back

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.400
to the next step.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.000
Our glue has had time to dry,
so we can take off the clamp,

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.300
and we can see
that the two pieces hold

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.622
themselves together quite well.

00:04:31.432 --> 00:04:35.380
Now, we need to shape each
of these sticks into sort of a wing,

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.800
and we're going to do the
same thing on all four arms.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.900
On a boomerang,
there's a leading edge

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.200
and a trailing edge, and it
has to do with what direction

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.300
the boomerang is spinning.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.000
I'm right-handed.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.500
This is intended to be
a right-handed Boomerang.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.500
So for me, when I throw it,
it's going to be thrown

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.360
like that.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.580
That means this will be
the leading edge,

00:04:53.642 --> 00:04:55.100
and this will be
the trailing edge.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.700
So this one, and this one,
and this one, and this one.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.760
Those will all be
the leading edge

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.540
as it spins through the air.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.760
I'm going to sand them
all about like this,

00:05:08.792 --> 00:05:11.000
and we're going to try and
stand it from about this line

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.400
till it takes off about half
of our paint stick's thickness.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.500
So we want to sand down
to about that line.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.400
The easiest way to do that is
to just grab some sandpaper,

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.100
and a block of wood,
and start sanding it down.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.940
Paint sticks are pretty soft
so it doesn't take too long.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.600
So this is how we want
to sand down all

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.800
of our trailing edges.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.800
The leading edge,
or the front of each of

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.000
our arms, we want to round off.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.900
We're not trying
to take off as much wood

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.380
as we are in the trailing edges,

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.420
but we want it to just be
a nice rounded shape,

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.800
and we're going
to do the same thing

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.600
on these edges.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.300
So, this corner, this corner,
and these corners, we just want

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.992
to be nice and rounded.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:59.120
[Music]

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.000
Trailing edge has
this nice taper coming down

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.200
to about half the thickness
of the paint stick,

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.800
and the leading edge
is rounded right around,

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.900
as well as this top edge.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.900
Here, I've just done a really
quick slightly enlarged view.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.000
This is approximately
what the cross section

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.800
should look like.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.400
This is the leading edge,
nice and rounded off.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.100
This is the trailing edge,
where you can see

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.700
that it just tapers down
to a smaller thickness,

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.200
and this is our basic wing
shape that we need to sand

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.840
into all four arms.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.200
We've got all four
of our arms sanded down

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.100
into our wing shape.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.000
So at this point,
I think we can take this out,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.400
and test if it's working.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.200
All right, time to test
this boomerang out.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.352
I've got my
appropriate headgear.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.300
We're here
in a big empty field.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.842
Got a proper accent.

00:06:45.482 --> 00:06:46.702
Time to throw a boomerang.

00:06:47.112 --> 00:06:49.300
I don't actually know
if that's a good Australian accent or not.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.220
That's not the point.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.540
Let's test this out.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.400
See if it works.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.960
Now, I have built
and tested these before,

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.300
and what I've found works best
with this style is throwing it

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.092
almost straight up and down.

00:07:00.612 --> 00:07:02.900
With traditional boomerangs,
you'll usually throw it

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.040
at more of an angle.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.600
With these ones,
what seems to work

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.880
best is throwing it
straight up and down,

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.400
and if you're looking forward,
then you throw it

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.820
a little bit off to the side,
and it should just wrap around.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:13.640
Let's try this out.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:19.900
[Music]

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.400
If I were any good at catching,
I would have caught that.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:43.900
[Music]

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:44.800
Hit the cameraman.

00:07:45.862 --> 00:07:46.582
Sorry, Mark.

00:07:46.582 --> 00:08:04.480
[Music]

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.100
When there's even
a little bit of wind,

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.040
it can affect it quite a bit
because it's so lightweight.

00:08:10.042 --> 00:08:13.620
[Music]

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.140
This is working pretty well.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.252
Let's see what happens
if we throw a little bit of color on it.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:32.200
[Music]

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.000
You can even hydrodip these
if you want a really exotic,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.700
cool paint job on them.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:56.980
[Music]

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.300
As you can see,
there's a little bit

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.400
of variety in how they fly.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.600
You really just need to practice
with the boomerang that you

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.140
make, to learn how it flies,
and how you need to throw it.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.100
And of course,
the wind is going to make

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.332
a lot of difference as I said.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.040
GoPro strapped to a Boomerang,
will it work?

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:41.180
[Music]

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.000
It was totally real.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.120
We didn't take that at all.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.912
Sometimes, you can even
throw two at once, like this.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.800
[Music]

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.980
That's how it's done.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.300
Roll the 20 takes
that they didn't work.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.000
It worked.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.300
The paint sticks
are ten cents each,

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.700
if you even have
to pay for them at all.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.900
As I said, some places
just give them away.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.200
A little bit of glue
and some sandpaper,

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.100
and you're done.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.200
Bringing the total cost
of one of these things up

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.600
to like 25 cents.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.100
They take maybe an hour
if you include how long

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.900
you have to let the glue dry,
and they are tons of fun.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.200
It's really cool to take one
of these out into a field,

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.900
and it takes some practice.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.600
But when you finally
get it to return

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.840
so you can just catch it,
it is beautiful.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.300
Hey, that one came back.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.600
Nice.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.502
One out of seven.

00:10:34.162 --> 00:10:35.500
Guys, we've got more
for you to see.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.400
That box at the top
will take you to our last video,

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.300
and you should check that out.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.900
The other box will show
you what YouTube thinks

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.100
you should be watching next,

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.400
and if you haven't subscribed yet,
hit this bomb to get in the club.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.600
That way, you'll never
miss out on the fun.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.000
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we will see you in the next one.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.260
Talk to you then.
