00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:09.132
The area surrounding the North Pole

00:00:09.132 --> 00:00:14.052
may seem like a frozen and desolate
environment where nothing ever changes.

00:00:14.052 --> 00:00:19.006
But it is actually a complex 
and finely balanced natural system,

00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:23.306
and its extreme location 
makes it vulnerable to feedback processes

00:00:23.306 --> 00:00:27.068
that can magnify even tiny changes
in the atmosphere.

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:32.282
In fact, scientists often describe 
the Arctic as the canary in the coal mine

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:36.260
when it comes to predicting the impact
of climate change.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.703
One major type of climate feedback
involves reflectivity.

00:00:39.703 --> 00:00:41.946
White surfaces, like snow and ice,

00:00:41.946 --> 00:00:46.027
are very effective at reflecting
the sun's energy back into space,

00:00:46.027 --> 00:00:51.109
while darker land and water surfaces
absorb much more incoming sunlight.

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:55.094
When the Arctic warms just a little,
some of the snow and ice melts,

00:00:55.094 --> 00:00:58.111
exposing the ground and ocean underneath.

00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:01.966
The increased heat absorbed by
these surfaces causes even more melting,

00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.605
and so on.

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:07.111
And although the current situation
in the Arctic follows the warming pattern,

00:01:07.111 --> 00:01:09.365
the opposite is also possible.

00:01:09.365 --> 00:01:12.607
A small drop in temperatures
would cause more freezing,

00:01:12.607 --> 00:01:15.942
increasing the amount 
of reflective snow and ice.

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:18.484
This would result in less sunlight 
being absorbed,

00:01:18.484 --> 00:01:22.757
and lead to a cycle of cooling,
as in previous ice ages.

00:01:22.757 --> 00:01:26.634
Arctic sea ice is also responsible
for another feedback mechanism

00:01:26.634 --> 00:01:28.271
through insulation.

00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:30.206
By forming a layer on the ocean's surface,

00:01:30.206 --> 00:01:33.446
the ice acts as a buffer between
the frigid arctic air

00:01:33.446 --> 00:01:36.432
and the relatively 
warmer water underneath.

00:01:36.432 --> 00:01:39.450
But when it thins, breaks, 
or melts in any spot,

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.642
heat escapes from the ocean,

00:01:41.642 --> 00:01:45.720
warming the atmosphere 
and causing more ice to melt in turn.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.961
Both of these are examples
of positive feedback loops,

00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:50.791
not because they do something good,

00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:54.905
but because the initial change 
is amplified in the same direction.

00:01:54.905 --> 00:01:57.250
A negative feedback loop,
on the other hand,

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.701
is when the initial change
leads to effects

00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:02.289
that work in the opposite direction.

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.276
Melting ice also causes 
a type of negative feedback

00:02:05.276 --> 00:02:08.367
by releasing moisture into the atmosphere.

00:02:08.367 --> 00:02:12.119
This increases the amount and thickness
of clouds present,

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:15.626
which can cool the atmosphere
by blocking more sunlight.

00:02:15.626 --> 00:02:18.077
But this negative feedback loop
is short-lived,

00:02:18.077 --> 00:02:20.441
due to the brief Arctic summers.

00:02:20.441 --> 00:02:22.824
For the rest of the year, 
when sunlight is scarce,

00:02:22.824 --> 00:02:24.649
the increased moisture and clouds

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:28.325
actually warm the surface
by trapping the Earth's heat,

00:02:28.325 --> 00:02:32.491
turning the feedback loop positive
for all but a couple of months.

00:02:32.491 --> 00:02:35.509
While negative feedback loops
encourage stability

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:38.049
by pushing a system towards equilibrium,

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:43.990
positive feedback loops destabilize it
by enabling larger and larger deviations.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.083
And the recently increased impact
of positive feedbacks

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:50.387
may have consequences 
far beyond the Arctic.

00:02:50.387 --> 00:02:51.706
On a warming planet,

00:02:51.706 --> 00:02:57.072
these feedbacks ensure that the North Pole
warms at a faster rate than the equator.

00:02:57.072 --> 00:03:00.058
The reduced temperature differences
between the two regions

00:03:00.058 --> 00:03:02.662
may lead to slower jet stream winds

00:03:02.662 --> 00:03:06.936
and less linear atmospheric circulation
in the middle latitudes,

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:09.374
where most of the world's 
population lives.

00:03:09.374 --> 00:03:12.301
Many scientists are concerned
that shifts in weather patterns

00:03:12.301 --> 00:03:14.959
will last longer and be more extreme,

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.912
with short term fluctuations becoming
persistent cold snaps,

00:03:18.912 --> 00:03:22.539
heat waves, droughts and floods.

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:25.883
So the Arctic sensitivity doesn't just
serve as an early warning alarm

00:03:25.883 --> 00:03:28.418
for climate change 
for the rest of the planet.

00:03:28.418 --> 00:03:32.593
Its feedback loops can affect us
in much more direct and immediate ways.

00:03:32.593 --> 00:03:34.654
As climate scientists often warn,

00:03:34.654 --> 00:03:38.447
what happens in the Arctic
doesn't always stay in the Arctic.
