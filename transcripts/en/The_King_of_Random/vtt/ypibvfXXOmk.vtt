00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.400
Just printed off a little list
of things I thought we could talk about.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.860
Today we're talking about the clickbait,
the collabs, what's happening on YouTube,

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.300
and the future of "The King of Random."

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.100
So hey guys.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.600
First of all,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.080
Happy Father's Day
to any fathers out there.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.480
I know by the time you're watching this,
it's no longer Father's Day,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.960
but today is Father's Day.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.100
I wasn't really planning to film a video,
but after all the drama

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.700
that I've seen in the comments
in the last couple of days,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.020
I thought it'd be good to just sit down
and have a heart-to-heart.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.440
I'm here with my wife,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.020
- one of our little babies here.
- Hi!

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.120
Say, hello world.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.600
Eight weeks yesterday.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.960
Uh, he's four of four.
We have four boys now,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.000
and the other three are
at the grandparents.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.820
So this is our chance to talk to you.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.600
Now I don't have a lot of time
to edit this video.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.480
So it's almost gonna be
like a live stream, very minimal editing.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.400
There's not gonna be any frills, flares,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.140
any fancy transitions
or anything like that.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.680
It's just you and me, a heart-to-heart,
getting out everything on the table.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.300
So remember guys,
everything is an experiment.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.900
In this last week, you know,
I went down to L.A.,

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.900
I collaborated with a lot
of different YouTubers.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.300
Um, some I knew really well,
some I didn't know very well at all.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.420
And it all for fun, it was an experiment.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.300
And I learned a lot
by watching your reactions.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.400
I learned a lot about you

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.620
and hopefully you learned a lot
about you as well.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.200
I hope the other thing that sticks out

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.800
is everything on my channel
is family-friendly content.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.400
Uh, some of the people
that were on the channel

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.600
you may not like or resonate with.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.800
Remember, they're on a journey
of their own as well.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.360
You know, it's been eye opening for me

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.900
on where to take this channel
in the future,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.200
what kind of standards
you guys respect and uphold,

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.300
and I've taken that to heart,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.500
and I will make changes
and future decisions accordingly.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.760
So let's talk about clickbaiting,

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.200
some of you had accused me
on becoming a clickbaiter.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.200
Let's talk about what that means.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.000
So... [chuckles]

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.060
To actually clickbait,
like real genuine clickbait,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.800
is when you put up an advertisement
or a thumbnail or a description,

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.200
that has absolutely nothing to do
with the video, at all.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.400
Just absolutely unrelated
whatsoever, you know.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.800
That's clickbait.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.400
Now if you take a thumbnail,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.000
and you dress it up a little bit
and you make it look more attractive.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.300
And if you change the title to be enticing,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.800
and make you want to click,

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.000
that's called marketing!

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.400
That's called selling, guys.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.800
- I mean--
- Which is what you want,

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.460
because you want to click on something
that you have a desire to click on.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.740
I mean, if you're going to buy a house

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.540
and somebody painted the house
to make it look nicer,

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.200
would you accuse them of clickbaiting?

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.100
Because they're like, enticing you
to buy this house, making it better--

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.900
Making it seem better than it actually is?

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.000
Uh that's just-- that's good
old fashioned marketing guys,

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.180
and I've learned that
by watching other channels

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.800
I mean, doing the collaborations in L.A.,
there's a lot of creators

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.320
who put a lot of work
into their thumbnails...

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.400
that make them more clickable.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.380
And that's what I'm going for.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.900
I'm not going for clickbaiting,
I'm making my thumbnails more clickable.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.200
So I hope you can appreciate that.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.900
Because that's an added expense,
it's added time,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.500
and it's something
I'm trying to do for you.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.000
You always find good content in my videos
and you'll always find the thumbnails

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.400
and the titles related
to the content in the video.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.400
Unless you're gonna sign up
for YouTube Red,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.860
or you're going to, like, privately fund
The King of Random foundation

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.900
or something of that nature, um,
you're getting these videos for free.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.900
And there's no such thing as free.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.200
Somebody's paying for them

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.000
and that's the businesses
who are advertising with Google.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.100
That's how you're paying so...

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.600
But ultimately, too, our service to you is
to create good quality content for free.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.500
- That's our purpose.
- That's right.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.300
So click-- click on those videos.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.100
I guess that's all we have to say,
click on the videos, click on the videos!

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.900
I mean, your numbers,
your responses to the videos tell us

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.420
if we're doing better or worse.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.400
If we put time and work
into our thumbnails

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.500
and you click more on them,
then obviously,

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.100
that's working,
we're gonna do more of it.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.600
It's not clickbait, it's just marketing.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.640
And the more you guys
actually click on these videos,

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.220
the more support it gives to us,
to have a team

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.900
- to bring more content to you.
- Exactly.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.200
So it's really a win-win.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.460
And that brings up another point here,

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.760
I want to talk about AdBlockers.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.264
Some of you are very proud
about using AdBlockers.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.400
But you know when you do that,
it cuts the revenue stream.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.120
And if the money doesn't come in
to pay for all these systems

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.700
to create these videos,
the videos are going to stop.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.320
And there's nothing really keeping us
from stopping,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.500
except that we think
that you still want the content.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.100
So if you want it, we keep making it.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.100
If you don't want it, we stop making it.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.020
So...

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.060
Where do we go from here?
What's the next step?

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.060
So yeah, let's jump into it.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.700
Let's just get everything out
on the table.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.700
Who's The King of Random?
Where did it come from? Where is it going?

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.600
So a little about myself,
I'm Grant Thompson.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.780
I'm now known as The King of Random.
But way back in the day,

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.600
I was born in Calgary, Canada in Alberta.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.980
I grew up there, uh,
lived a few years in Calgary

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.900
and then we moved south of the city
to a little small town

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.200
that didn't even have street lights
or even a McDonalds.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.900
And in that small town environment,
I started going to school,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.700
but I actually started having
a really hard time in school.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.800
I felt like I got bullied,
I got called names.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.840
And a lot of people--

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.100
Actually a couple people in particular,
went out of their way, every day,

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.200
to tell me what a loser,
and what a geek I was.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.000
Um, the hard thing about that situation is

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.600
I didn't feel like I had any place
or group I belonged to.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.800
I wasn't a jock, I wasn't a nerd,
I wasn't anything.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.400
I was by just myself,
which was really frustrating.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.840
Uh, I would--
I wouldn't get picked on teams.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.900
I'd always be the last one
to be picked on teams

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.300
even though I thought
I had some kind of athletic ability.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.060
There was just some stigma
of not wanting to be with me.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.800
So, I think that kinda hurt my feelings.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.200
Now during that time of confusion,

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.820
my dad did something for me
that probably changed my life at age 14.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.700
He bought me a ticket
to go fly in an ultra light glider.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.000
And that was my first experience getting
into an airplane, flying above the city.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.100
What that did for me is
it changed my perspective,

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.780
because this huge city
that was intimidating to me

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.580
was now so small.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.000
Uh you know,
the people and the cars look like ants.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.700
And I could now really see in context

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.000
where that city fit in
to at least a bigger part of the world.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.400
That's when I knew
that I could make decisions

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.600
that would change me life,
I wasn't stuck in one place.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.800
So what I started doing was

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.800
I started going after everything
that made me feel better about myself.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:15.800
Everything available.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.400
I went and got my drivers license,

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.900
'cause that made me
feel better about myself.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.740
And then I got--
What's the next license after that?

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.800
I started driving buses, school buses,

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.400
and started doing trips
and tours for school kids.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.300
Then I got my license
to drive motorcoaches,

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.740
the big 55 passenger buses,
and I started driving rock bands

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.340
on tour around Canada,
which was very cool. [chuckles]

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.700
Then I took two years
of my life and I went

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.300
and served a mission in England,

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.600
where I supported myself
on money that I'd saved up

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.300
and I took two years
to go tell people about my beliefs.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.900
And that was really strengthening,
because I was knocking on doors,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.900
talking to people,
sharing, uh, very personal information.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.900
And that taught me a lot of work ethic
and it got me into a lot of routines

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.300
that when I returned back,
I was ready to go.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.800
Now I knew that whatever I was gonna do 
was going to take a lot of money.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.900
And rather than going
to college or university at the time,

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.300
I wanted to make sure...

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.420
I had a purpose for what
I was going to learn before I learned it.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.660
Um, I took a lot of time
to contemplate what I was interested in,

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.160
but I wasn't finding any colleges
or universities that met those needs

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.700
and I didn't really have a purpose to find.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.900
So while I was waiting
I got a job on the oil rigs

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.800
as a roughneck up in northern Canada,

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.660
where it was -60°C
and we worked outdoors 12 hours a day.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.660
- If you could believe that. So--
- Wow. Sounds cold.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.600
Pretty crazy and we would
literally work 14 days straight

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.940
and then I have a couple days off.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.960
I actually lived in my car,
because I could save more money that way.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.500
They'd give us money for hotel and foods

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.400
and I actually just slept in my car
so I could save money faster.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.100
Long story short, I saved up enough money
to buy a small airplane.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.360
And I felt, at the time,
inspired to become an airline pilot.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.800
So I figured the best way to do that,
was talk to people who had become pilots.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.560
And after listening
to a number of stories,

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.100
I decided to buy my own airplane,
build the flight time myself.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.200
And that eventually carried me
over to Hawaii,

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.700
where I got a job as a cargo pilot
for about a year,

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.800
flying from Honolulu
to all the inter-islands around Hawaii.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.040
And once I got enough flight time,

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.400
I got hired by a commercial airliner
back in the mainlands.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.760
So I moved back to the mainland

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.700
and worked 11 years
as a commercial airline pilot.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.100
I bought my first house.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.500
That's where I met my wife.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.800
- And, uh, we--
- Where I bought my first house.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.700
She bought her house right beside me.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.060
And we kept both of them,

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.980
and we fixed them up, we rented
them out and we kept buying houses,

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:14.880
fixing them up, renting them out,

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.300
until we had 11 houses,

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.680
fixed up and rented out.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.280
So we got a business in real estate,

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.840
and the money that was coming in
was actually paying for our living expenses,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.560
and so we started to have a little
bit more freedom with our time.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:27.900
I was still working on the airlines,

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.540
but we built a business in real estate.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:30.240
[Baby noise]

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.560
Now when the housing market
started to crash, we sold everything,

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.080
and we put that money into investments,

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.920
and started living off of the interest.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.340
And the cool thing about that scenario,
is now we had that time freedom,

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.800
that everybody wants to have.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.000
And it was a challenging time for me because...

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.140
now I had the opportunity to say, "What
have I always wanted to do with my life?"

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.180
And kind of live the dream of "if
money were not an object" or an issue,

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.440
what would you do with your time?

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.480
And I remember talking about this
with my wife, and what we ended up, uh,

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.820
what I ended up coming with- was

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.500
I would love to just do things that
I love and make videos about it.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.420
[chuckles] So...funny enough,

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.200
you know that's kind of what
got us into what we're doing, so...

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.400
If you could do anything you wanted
and money weren't a factor, what would you do?

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.460
For me, at the time, it was making videos.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.180
We've also had four kids and
we've now been married for 10 years,

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.620
but about 5 years ago,

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.760
we sold all of our houses we used
that money to invest in investments.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.080
And for the first time in my life,
I had a little bit of free time,

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.180
where I could scale back my hours at
the airlines and I had sometime to work,

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.720
to tinker to figure out how things work.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.960
Now, that was also around 2008-2009.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.840
When everyone was talking about a Great Depression,

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.940
and falling back into the old ways where, you know,

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.760
maybe there's gonna be an
apocalypse, people falling off the grid,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.260
you know banking systems crashing, who knows?

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.660
One thing I learned from reading books about history,

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.600
is that some of the wealthiest people got their wealth,

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.320
during the biggest crisises,

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.500
and it all has to do with
opportunity meaning preparedness.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.280
So, although I had a great career as an airline pilot,

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.340
I felt really insecure about my knowledge,

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.600
because I live in this time where we
have lights, we have electricity, we have...

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.040
drinkable water,

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.560
we have toilets that we can just flush,

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.160
and I didn't know about how
any of those things worked.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.540
Where does it all come from?

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.000
And if you were to go back 200 years in history,

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.240
when there were no electric light bulbs

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.320
and you could be the person to...

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.920
to revolutionize the economy to
bring light to people's homes,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.500
would you be able to sufficiently
explain how that work,

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.480
do you know how it works enough,

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.280
to where you could be that person
who invents that industry,

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.440
can you generate electricity?

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.160
And for me, I thought, I... I...
can't explain how that works,

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.420
and yet we live in this...

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.900
this great time of technological
advantages where everything's available,

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.700
and i'ts on then internet, it's on
the Wikipedia, it's on YouTube.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:34.680
So...

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.160
so what I decided to do was
devote my life to learning,

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.020
I wanted to learn how to weld,
I wanted to learn how to make circuit boards,

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.540
I wanted to learn how to be
Tony Stark, I wanted to learn...

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.900
how light bulbs work and be able to
explain how everything works around me.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.260
The problem, I was finding is that as I was
going around to universities and colleges

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.120
looking for programs that taught this,

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.980
I couldn't find anything that would meet those needs.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.180
So what I decided to do instead,
was try to a course of online study,

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.540
the school of Grant Thompson,

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.560
pick something that I'm interested
and learned as much as I can about it,

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.440
until I can recreate it at
home using household materials.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.200
And in all my years in college,

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:12.140
I'd never seen anybody work as hard at
studying as Grant did during that time.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.060
It's very... very focused study and it was very exciting.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.860
Because every morning I would jump
outta bed to go learn something new.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.600
I was getting old televisions and hacking
them apart, I was ripping apart circuit boards,

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.440
do you remember when I was down there
de-sauteing all the components from...

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.720
circuit boards and then getting on Wikipedia
to find out what these things were,

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.520
you know, capacitors and triodes and
diodes...

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.320
- M-hmm.
- and transistor and resisters.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.560
Yeah, our house became a factory
of all these gadgets taken apart.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.000
- [chuckles]
- Microwave-ovens and homemade rocket fuel...

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.820
that time we almost burned down the basement?

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.720
Yeah, of the house we were renting.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.340
Yeah! [both laughs]

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.480
We actually used one of those
chemical fire extinguishers

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.500
and it took 2 days to clean up the mess.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.300
- Yeah!
- So...

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.860
those things happened.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.060
I saw, if there's going to be another Great Depression,

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:54.780
the best thing that we could do, is get prepared

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.740
with knowledge.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.540
So I wanted to start studying how
things worked, I want to learn...

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.980
how did our economy get to where it's at
and we lost all that for some reason,

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.900
could we rebuild it using common 
materials around the house,

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.080
basically. So thus was born
"The King of Random."

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.840
So to make a really long story short,

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.260
what ended up happening is, as I was
tinkering with things and making discoveries,

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.780
I was learning about things that...

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.520
- that aren't taught anywhere else.
- Mm-hmm.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.720
Really, I was learning about how to
generate electricity, how to make motors,

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.280
how to play with high voltage

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.900
and, uh, how to make rocket fuel
and things of this nature.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.400
And every time I go to somebody's house

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.140
and just talk about these things I was learning,

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.800
they would look at me like, "Who are you?
Where did you come from?"

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.320
Like, "Why do you know this stuff? That is so random!"

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.260
And one friend in particular, every time
I'd come over and he'd listen to this stuff,

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.600
he'd be like, "You know what?
You are like the king of random!"

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.740
Yeah, it seemed to be just a random different project

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.580
every time he would come visit us.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.580
- Yeah.
- You know, it's periodic every few weeks

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.300
or whatever, but it was just always something different.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.080
- I mean, really intense.
- I mean, we're like dripping water through...

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.380
pop cans to generate electricity,
we were making Tesla coils,

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.180
we were making salt water capacitors,
a lot of really crazy stuff.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:01.220
Yeah, what was that one that was like
creating rain and ozone and the smell of rain.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.580
Yeah, I had a spark gap that would
actually make our house smell like ozone.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.160
- Which is the smell that comes after a thunderstorm.
- I love that smell. [laughs]

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.560
- Yeah.
- That name kind of stuck "The King of Random,"

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.260
the king of random projects,
the king of random experiments, so...

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.600
about this time I was thinking if so many
people are finding value out of this,

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.160
what if I started a
YouTube channel to kind of give back?

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.040
I was learning so much information from
the internet from Wikipedia and from YouTube.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.140
The problem I was having, is that
the format's people would upload in,

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.700
we're so difficult to follow,

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.160
15-20 minutes of somebody with their handy-cam

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.960
very shaky footage,
very hard to distill the information,

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.900
[baby noise] and half the time information
was wrong... that was a good pooper.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.060
- Yeah! [laughs]
- Nice job bud, get out there, get out there.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.620
Our little man's doing a job right now.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.940
[laughs] Brief intermission,
we got to do a diaper change.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:41.740
[laughs]

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.540
So because I was coming into all this new
knowledge that wasn't really shared.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.460
I decided what I was going to do,
is become the man I was going to step up

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.820
and bring content to YouTube in a
very condensed, concise formula,

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.880
of how to do things that aren't usually
done and make discoveries, inventions,

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.680
and bring them to the world
in a package, where I've done all the prototyping

00:12:59.000 --> 00:12:59.980
and experimenting.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:05.000
Also one of the gifts I've noticed,
as the wife of this incredible man,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.460
is that he's got a gift
to be able to take a lot of information

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:12.560
and distill it, if you will or condense it
down into the most important things

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.020
they're really easy to
understand and very shareable.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.220
And so that's kind of something
he's always been really good at...

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.620
- as well. 
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hm.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.720
And I had a lot of fun
with it, um, because...

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.220
it was really reverse engineering society

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.560
and my goal was to be able to
know how to do everything...

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:32.140
that happens in society to be
able to purify water to keep, uh,

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.900
a roof over my family's head to be able to start fires

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.140
without matches.
What? Because if those aren't available,

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.180
um, I mean heat is one of the most
essential things you need access to you,

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:44.380
so you find a lot of my experiments have
to do with starting fire without matches.

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.820
So this started my journey on YouTube

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:49.360
and you got to remember I'm working as
a full-time airline pilot and I have two kids...

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.120
at the same time. We're living a basement
apartment because we sold all of our properties

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.460
and we've got our money in investments
so that I can actually be taking the time...

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.400
to do this
tinkering at home.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.120
You know the other thing I that I remember,
we would have late-night conversations

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.360
about where YouTube could go because
even before we posted our first video,

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.440
we'd have conversations like this could lead to...

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.540
you'd becoming known,

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.560
uh, you know it could lead to fame,
it could lead to going to television shows,

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.900
it could lead to you know a lot of big
opportunities, do we really want that?

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.500
Um, you know, because I'm kind of a private
person, I want to protect my family,

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:22.560
I want to give them a good life and so
coming out on the Internet [baby noise]

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.280
and sharing these things,

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.720
these things was very risky for me.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.880
So when I started presenting my videos,

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.920
- you notice there are only my hands in the
videos you never saw my face.
- Mmm-hm.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.760
It was very anonymous,

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.540
in some ways, and it came out of nowhere,

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.480
there's no history, there's no story,
you don't know anything about me

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.540
or why I started posting those videos,

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:39.680
until today.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:43.540
In contrary to what you might
think Grant is a very private person,

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.300
hence the reason he just had his
hands in a lot of the videos,

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.860
because he didn't want to be seen
on camera and so as he's...

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:50.740
grown and worked through those things

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.240
- you guys have also kind of seen
that evolution on "The King of Random."
- Mm-hmm.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.040
Yeah and YouTube itself has
been it's very own journey,

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.720
there's been a lot of things that happen
since we started posting on YouTube,

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.980
there's been a whole 'nother series of experiences.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.780
The thing you got to realize, is when you
start posting videos on YouTube,

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.960
even if they're
excellent excellent videos...

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:09.480
nobody's going to watch them.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.180
Because there's so much content on YouTube,

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.860
there needs to be some way to stand out so I was...

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.000
I was putting a lot of time into making videos

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.000
and getting 100, 200 views.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.500
So I had to get creative and find
other ways to market myself,

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:24.720
I started writing articles for websites,
I started posting, uh, weekly...

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.460
how-to step by steps on different, uh, websites

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.300
that would eventually feature me on the front page

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.020
and that would
drive a little more traffic.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.740
For the year-and-a-half of posting videos on YouTube,

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.040
they hardly got watched at all, I mean,
for the first almost a year-and-a-half,

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.540
we gained only 50,000 subscribers

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.840
by posting a high quality
video every single week.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:46.060
And when we hit that 50,000 we were so excited,
I bought Grant a bouquet of lighters,

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.680
- because what else do you get "The King of Random?"

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.300
- A bouquet of barbecue lighters,
- [laughs]

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.500
which actually was like the perfect gift
for me, that was amazing.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.680
Now, as an airline pilot, I could just pick up
extra shifts and make, you know,

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.080
a fair amount of money.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.680
So to be taking time away from
that and making videos instead,

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.620
where I'd make like five dollars after
putting a hundred hours into a video,

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.220
didn't really make much sense at all.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.840
And I can tell you, I was a really rough time posting

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.620
every week for a year and when I post every week?

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.800
you understand there's like 12 hours a day

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.040
going into these videos sometimes more.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:16.880
- Yeah.
- I mean, to the point where

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.260
it is like affecting our family relationship.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.980
Yeah, and at the time Grant was
flying nights, so he'd go out do a flight,

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.420
sleep 2 or 3 or 4 hours at a hotel,

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.160
fly back and then work all day...

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.100
at home.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.940
And so I'd start getting bags under my eyes,

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.740
my eyes would turn purple, my eyes will be bloodshot.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.900
And if I ever did have a video with my eyes in it,

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.400
a lot of people make, uh, jokes
about me being high or being stoned,

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.600
uh, really what it was a sleep deprivation,

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.100
because I was burning the candle at both ends.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.940
And being a dad and a husband.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.840
That's true, I mean we're bouncing a lot,

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.000
plus our real-estate business and everything else,

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:47.940
on top of that.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.660
So that was pretty crazy...

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.109
but once the channel popped,

00:16:51.109 --> 00:16:54.320
you know, we hit 100,000 subscribers
and then we put out some...

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.980
summer life hack videos and those
started trending and doing really well.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.380
And our channel started
getting recognized and growing...

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.380
to the point where I could really cut back my hours

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.160
at the airline it's quite a bit.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.620
Start taking days off and sleeping at home.

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:09.000
Yeah, and it's not necessarily that I was
taking days off, it just put more work

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.680
- into...
- Days off from the airlines.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.140
Yeah, more work into creating the videos

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.560
and catching up a little bit on my sleep because...

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.140
I wasn't working the night shift as well.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.120
The thing you gotta realize, every one of
those projects I was putting out,

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.500
were basically like inventions, I was taking
something, I was playing with it,

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.940
modifying it, doing a lot of back-end prototyping.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:30.940
And I was filming all these videos myself
and I cannot tell you how much work...

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:32.460
went into making these videos.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.880
Doing the scripts, doing the
filming, doing the editing doing the...

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.180
voiceovers, the musics, um,

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.280
and that's just getting the video done.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.320
Then it's uploading and it's doing
the metadata and the SEO

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.180
and managing the comments and doing the annotations

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.860
and watching the views and trying
to understand the algorithm.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
It's overwhelming, just listening to you and
I remember when you were doing all this...

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.340
and that
was overwhelming.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.520
It's so much that goes into making these videos,

00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:00.000
but I was very proud of the content it was
all very new interesting concepts.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.280
- It was all passion projects too.
-Yeah.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.380
But the thing was very validating, is...

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.080
this work got recognized,

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:09.360
it was getting appreciated it started
skyrocketing in numbers,

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.760
uh, the views would be popping some
videos that I was discouraged.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.220
You know only had a couple hundred thousand views,

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.000
you know sometimes it would pop and in a month later,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.420
it would have 10 million views.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.360
So that was super validating to me,
when that started happening

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.540
and I'm very driven by success,
so when things start working out,

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.700
I'm very motivated to push even harder

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.640
to keep that up and to keep it going.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.480
The problem was...

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.800
after about four years of
doing this and I was extremely tired,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.860
you know burning the candle
and pushing hard, hard, hard.

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.600
Um, I was still putting out high quality content,

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.240
but the comments started to change.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.840
I didn't feel like people were really
appreciating what I was doing anymore,

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.000
the expectation was...

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:45.820
you know,

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.340
"Your contents all great, why
don't you put out every day?"

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.820
"Why are you only putting out every week?" or "Every two weeks?"

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:52.320
"Why are you doing quick clips?"

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.720
"You know why don't you just give us the
whole video?"

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.500
Uh, you know wha--

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.580
"Where are all your awesome ideas?"

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:01.000
Um, you know, and this is funny
thing is even from day one,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.540
people were like, "You used to be so awesome,

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.940
why aren't you doing awesome projects now?"

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.140
And then I put out a project that
was like more awesome

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.580
than anything that's ever been...

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.500
- And nobody would watch it, or
it would get lower views.
- Yeah.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.700
Or, or the other thing would happen is like, you know,

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.560
a few months later, people would look back and say

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.500
"Well, why don't you do
projects like that anymore?" [scoffs]

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.660
You know, it's like...

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:21.440
whatever I make today, gets appreciated
like six months or a year from now,

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.480
it doesn't get appreciated in the moment.
So ever since day one, I've been told,

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:28.100
you know, "you're out of ideas, your channel is dying"...
[both laughing] You know,

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.780
"your content used to be so much better"...

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.280
Um, so I've been hearing this for like six years.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.140
But, at about, I'd say, about the
four-and-a-half year point,

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.480
I'm starting to feel really low, I was burned out,

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.140
you know, I had a family, I'm getting kids,
they're getting old enough to do things with

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.680
and I'm on the computer every single day editing,

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:45.760
I'm prototyping, I'm tinkering, like there's...

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.860
every minute of every day goes
into making these videos.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.580
And I'm starting to feel pulled
away from my family, because...

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.300
this is my priority, my family is my priority.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.420
And I feel like making YouTube videos,

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.180
is a stark contrast between
spending time with my family

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.660
and it's really hard to find middle ground,

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.100
when you're working with the YouTube
algorithm and watch time

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.380
and people who are trying to keep up,

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.320
um, you know, with the channel and you know, keep things going.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.880
Eventually hit a point, where the
comments were so bad,

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.580
you know telling me, that I wasn't doing enough

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.760
and I looked at the situation I said you know, "I

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.340
started making YouTube videos for you to
share the knowledge that I was gaining."

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.160
You know, I didn't need YouTube,
I didn't start making YouTube videos

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.800
because we needed the money,

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.380
in fact, YouTube was some of the worst
money we've ever made in our lives.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.020
- Especially,
- Yep. True story.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.840
working as an airline pilot and a real
estate business we made far...

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.100
greater amounts of money than
making YouTube videos.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.260
I just... remember reading books about people like Tesla,

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.400
who did so many great things with their lives

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.860
and they were so wrapped up in their work,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.020
but then they had so little to show for it?

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.900
Now I have a lot of respect for
those people but I didn't want to be

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.420
one of those people myself so...

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.760
everything that I learned, I would have
to stop and I'd have to turn into a video,

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:50.880
that I could share with you,

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.040
so you could follow along
and have that same knowledge.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.100
Now the unfortunate part about that is,

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.220
I feel like it's really held me back
in my personal progression,

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.000
because, basically, for the last six years,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.860
I've had to stop everything that I've been interested in

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.740
to produce the videos for YouTube.

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.060
- Mmm-hm.
- So it's really limited my creativity,

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.340
it's, it's limited my free time,
I don't have much time to tinker,

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.480
because... 8 to 12 hours a day making
videos doesn't leave time for anything else,

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.300
especially when you're
balancing a family.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.800
So that's when I hit my crisis

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:18.820
on YouTube.
- Mm-hmm.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.100
That's when I decided to stop making YouTube videos,

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.220
it was about a year and a half ago.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:26.300
Mm-hmm. And he took the day off
and we were spending the day...

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.420
learning and reading together as a family and...

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:30.820
Grant got an idea...

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:35.560
And he thought, "Well, if I'm going to do this
idea I might as well take my video camera,"

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.000
so he... what was that project again?

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.780
It was just filling up a balloon with liquid nitrogen.

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.140
Yeah and seeing what
would happen.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:43.920
And so he took his camera,

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.000
filled up the balloon with liquid nitrogen

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.120
it was pretty awesome, the kids kind of watched and...

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:52.080
You know, it was a little family activity, made a little video of it, put it up on YouTube and it went...

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.500
- went crazy.
- Yeah, it did like 5 million views

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:55.800
- in the first couple weeks.
- Yeah,

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.180
by the way, that was his first day off

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.520
- and he made a video.
- [laughs]

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:03.080
And the funny thing is at the time
my videos that I was pouring my soul into...

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.760
putting a 120 hours of production into,

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:07.780
we're getting about 400,000 views.

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.700
- So this video that I filmed in 7
minutes and edited in 45 minutes,
- Mmm-hm.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.700
made 5 million views, it just made me stop
and think like rethink my priorities

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.240
and rethink my direction.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:18.660
Because the...

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:21.980
schedule before was now
unsustainable with our family life,

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:25.480
to put that much time and
energy into each project video.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.840
- Yeah
- Which is why we

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.740
decided... you know, it's time to
maybe slow down or quit.

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:30.780
Yeah.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.360
There's also a lot of other things

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.480
that were happening during making these
is that I never told you about like,

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.160
- a real battle I had with an issue called sciatica?
- Mm-hmm

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.740
That basically came from sitting,

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.020
for five years.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.600
- Yeah. Maybe even more.
- 18...

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.200
- 12 to 18 hours a day.
- And you think I'm sitting

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.640
- I'm sitting in the cockpit of an airplane,
you know, eight,eight hours a day.
- Yeah, that's true.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.840
And then, I'm sitting in the chair on the computer

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.100
and since it's just me doing everything I'm literally...

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.820
sitting, sitting, sitting all
day every single day

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.360
Not really any time to exercise I'm
just doing all I can to keep up with...

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.320
putting out these videos as fast as I can.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.460
I developed sciatica that was
so bad, I couldn't even walk.

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.040
- For about 3-4 months.
- Yeah it was so bad,

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.440
I couldn't walk, you know, I would
have to stop and bend over

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.420
and it looked, it looks so funny if I was ever outside.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.640
You didn't even know that though

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:17.080
- I kept putting out videos every single
week and I was in excruciating pain.
- Mmm-hm.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.300
Um, and I just kind of, there's a lot of
things that I've never told you,

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.180
because I don't want to focus on anything negative,

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.000
- I just want to stay
positive and to show you the good.
- Mmm-hm.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.360
There's been a lot of battles in the
background to keep things going at the pace...

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.140
that we were doing it.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.780
There was a period of about a year-and-a-half,

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.100
where I was working so hard on making videos
and there was like a crushing weight

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.680
on my chest so heavy,

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:39.040
not, not physical, but
metaphorical,

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.520
you know I felt this pressure, I couldn't even breathe,

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.600
- like I had trouble breathing.
- Mmm-hm.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.160
Because I was trying to keep up with
the algorithm and keep up with posting,

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.080
keep up with the comments,
trying to make you guys happy,

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.960
that it was like, affecting my health

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.780
and it was pretty serious.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.780
A few other frustrations,

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:55.780
do you know how much time it takes to come up with

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.920
an original idea or a modified idea or
something that nobody's ever done before?

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:03.260
And... get this thing all packaged, shiny, presented

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:06.120
and then the next day, have
somebody to come by and take that idea

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.580
and put it on their channel and claim it
like they did it themselves.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.420
Like, you know how frustrating it is,

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.100
to work so hard to develop something, I mean,

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:16.720
sacrificing time, family, sleep,
to develop something beautiful

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.780
and then have somebody else just come and take it and
copy it.

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:23.040
And if those channels are big enough
or if it's put on network television,

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.940
all the sudden becomes ambiguous
as to what that source was

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.940
and so there's not really any credit so...

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:31.500
I can't tell you how many times ideas
that I've worked on for years.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.500
Were very, very quickly taken

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:34.780
and made ambiguous.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.020
Very, very frustrating, I mean, I'm satisfied,
in the fact that I'm learning these things,

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:40.660
but it would be nice to give credit where credit's due

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.440
and one thing I've always tried to do my channel,

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.860
is always credit back to my source of inspiration.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:48.300
If somebody's inspired me, I always
credit back to them in the description

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.480
or wherever I can.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.660
And even now, if I get ideas from somebody,

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.960
I'll try and bring them on the video, if I can,

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.600
or shout them out, or give you a
chance to go check them out.

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:59.060
Because I feel like giving back
is a really great way to go.

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.080
So looking at everything in perspective,

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.880
you know, having to make some super hard decisions, I mean,

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:04.900
some of my favorite projects:

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.680
were taking the microwave
and turning it into an arc welder.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.820
You know, some of those in-depth
technical projects I really enjoyed,

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.020
the problem was...

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:14.320
nobody else really wanted to watch them.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.140
So I'd spent six months,
prototyping this microwave welder

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.560
and then I put it out there and nobody would watch it.

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:23.100
And yet I'd put out another video that
took me, one or two days to make

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.820
- and it would get a million views.
- Or less. Mmm-hm.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.040
So that, I had to make some decisions, I mean,

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.460
I know some of you guys in the comments are like,

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:29.920
"Why don't you go back to your old projects?"

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.620
and honestly, the answer is: "That's why."
I mean, the people are speaking:

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:34.940
"What are you
gonna watch?"

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.780
If I worked really hard on some of these old

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.180
uh, type king of random
projects that you claim to love

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:41.820
and it got ten million views,

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:44.320
I would make only
those kinds of projects.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.960
I mean, that's what I love,
that's what I'm passionate about.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:49.720
But when... when nobody's watching,
that I can't pay the bills, it's not sustainable.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.520
I-I've gotta do something else, that's a, a nice balance,

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.460
create content that I'm still proud of,

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.220
uh, do experiments I'm proud of,
but it can't be the workload...

00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:58.900
of something that's not going appreciated.

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.540
Now, I love creators like,
The Hacksmith and Colin Furze,

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.080
I think they're amazing, they're great channels,

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.140
- they're they're blowing up
their contents doing great.
- Mmm-hm.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.680
But if you also dig back into the numbers,

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.520
they're not being appreciated for the
kind of content they're doing either.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.760
I mean, they're working really hard,
they're coming up with ingenious ideas.

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.800
They're putting it out there and every now
and then, they get some nice big spikes,

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.540
but on average, like people just
don't resonate to that content

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:23.960
or the content is so hard to make,

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.720
you can only put it out every two
or three weeks or every month.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.180
And when you're doing that on the YouTube algorithm,

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.860
there's just not enough sustainability
to really make it worth it.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.780
I mean, unless you're bringing
in, uh, brand sponsorships but...

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.120
it takes a long time to get on the radar
for those kind of sponsorships.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.400
And they're not easy to do, especially when you're doing,

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.480
you know, mad science experiments,
it's hard to get through the legal department.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.160
A lot of that stuff's
difficult to get approved.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.160
I tried setting up a Patreon account once,

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.180
to try and get funding for the
kind of thing that we are doing

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.100
and got very little support, it's very discouraging.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.460
I think, because people were
looking at the numbers of the...

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.700
on the side of the channel,
the numbers of subscribers

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.640
and basically kicking back saying,

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:01.960
"You're too big for that."

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.780
So I had to shut down the Patreon
account, because it just wasn't worth it.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.440
So the only other options, really
are just to make more content,

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.900
get more sponsorships or
try and sell some kind of merchandise.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.943
So, the good news is, we found a
new way to make videos,

00:27:12.943 --> 00:27:14.840
I could do my daily experiments,

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.060
um, I started bringing on a guy to help film and help edit

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.880
and because we were doing frequent posting,

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.240
you know, there luckily there was, uh, enough revenue,

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.860
that we could support another
family on that income.

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.520
- It was really nice to have the help...
- Mmm-hm.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.180
to do that.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.780
Now what got really interesting, is in December,

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:34.080
- we tried this experiment where
we tried posting daily videos...
- Right.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:38.060
and that pushed us to the max, because
we were literally all, all day and all night

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:41.360
- and up till 4:00 in the morning working
on videos to post every day.
- Yeah.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.500
But that made such a huge difference with our channel,

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.760
we gained 800,000 subscribers in a month,

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:50.360
the revenues shot through the roof and
it seemed like everything was life changing.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.760
- And this was just Grant and one
other guy doing that.
- Right.

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.240
which was an incredible workload for both of them.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.860
So this is when I realized, if we could
keep this up, if this was sustainable,

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.120
you know, you guys are asking,

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.720
"What's the creative process?"
"How to get from point A to point B?"

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:04.860
"Do you ever make mistakes?"

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:09.380
Um, and also giving requests like, "Can you
do this project for that project?"

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.100
This format met that need

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.100
and we were able
to do it on a daily basis.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.380
So once I saw that it was sustainable,
that the money could come in,

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.700
I decided to systematize what we were doing,

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:22.140
- hire a team and go to work.
- Mmm-hm.

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:24.920
So I took basically, three weeks off in January,

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.280
to figure out what I was doing
put it into a system,

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:29.180
I hired two more editors,

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:33.860
I taught them the system and we developed
this, uh, machine that we can now film,

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.000
put videos into the machine and
produce on a daily basis.

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:38.920
Now the problem with doing that is...

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.020
there's still no time for research,
development, and prototyping,

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.880
because all of our work is into production.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.300
And if I stop,

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.360
work on production, to do research and
development,

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.240
there aren't videos and if there aren't videos,

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:52.920
there's no income to pay for all
those editors and the people helping.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.220
So there's this really weird balance here,
that I want you guys to understand,

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:58.880
some of the comments say, "We liked your videos better

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.600
when you post once a week or even once a month."

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.260
But if I post once a month,

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.620
there's not even gonna be enough
money for me to make videos,

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:06.580
so "The King of Random" is dead.

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.860
Okay? If I posted once a week, I can support myself,

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:13.340
but now I'm trapped back in that position,
where I have no time for anything else.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.900
If I post daily, then now I'm in a
position where I can have a team

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.920
helping me to produce high-quality daily content

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.340
and the only thing that we need now,

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.320
is the re-infusion of the DIY,

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.820
and we're almost to that point. I'll tell
you about that in a second.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.960
But think about this we have to
film videos,

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:31.320
that are a little bit easier to film,

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:36.320
because... I don't have projects lined up it
takes time to develop ideas, new ideas,

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:38.460
especially ideas you know are
just going to be stolen

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.040
- and re-purposed anyway.
- [laughs]

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.740
So right now, we're in this transition period,

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.460
where a lot of the projects that
I'm doing, are a little bit easier,

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.400
because they're just experiments.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.500
I know some of the people are kicking
back about experiments right now,

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.600
because we want to see the old DIY
projects, we want to see old projects.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:57.140
Um, well I hope I've given some
context into how much work it has taken,

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:58.800
to make those DIY projects.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.220
Only to find out that they
don't get really watched as much

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:04.880
and then people take the ideas
and claim the credit for them anyway.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.680
So I don't really have a lot of motivation,

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.900
to do those types of project, I'm not rewarded for that.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.240
However, I think there's a way we
can still make it work,

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:13.860
now that we've built this production machine,

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:15.680
we've got people on board,

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:18.480
you're helping support multiple families now.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.440
A lot of different people are depending on this,

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.320
so we need to post daily videos
If we don't post daily videos,

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.560
- people are going to lose their jobs, okay?
- Mmm-hm.

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:27.220
And "The King of Random" is going to shut down.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:31.060
But now that we've got this thing built, instead
of being the one tinkering, prototyping,

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.060
and working on things every day,
my next step now I'm on a hunt,

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.900
- for the next "King of Random"
or "The King of Random" sidekick.
- Mmm-hm

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.820
Basically, somebody that I can bring
on board, I can give them instructions.

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:43.480
And every day is going to be
plasma cutting, working with, uh, wood,

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:47.320
and you know, welding, and building desktop
weapons, and trying experiments and...

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:51.040
creative prototyping all these things
and getting to the point where...

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:52.700
we can bring those to the table film them

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.460
andput out high quality content on a very regular basis.

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:59.300
With that DIY aspect
It's just taking time to get there, because,

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:03.200
you got to remember, I've only started these
systems in February we're only a couple months

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:06.000
down the road and I think we've
made some extreme progress.
- Mmm-hm.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.580
- You know?
- Yeah, and this is kind of a combination

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:11.299
of what it all comes back to from where it started.

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:14.400
Is just time in the shop for Grant to tinker
and this is where...

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.720
we're kind of looking for somebody
that has a mind that wants to push...

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.860
science, and projects...

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:22.800
and prototyping to the boundaries.

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:25.260
So where we're kind of at is an all-or-nothing situation,

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:27.860
because I can tinker in the shop
and I can come up with new...

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:31.420
"King of Random" ideas all day long,
I love doing that, that's my element.

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:35.380
Grant will never run out of ideas,
because he's always spinning with ideas,

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:38.240
the problem is the time commitment
to make the videos.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.140
And that's, that's the real problem,
because to actually make the videos,

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.420
take so much time, there's no time left to tinker.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.440
I mean when's the last time I actually
sat down my shop and just tinkered...

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:47.860
- for days on end.
- Yeah,

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:51.840
it's been a while and, and Grant could
spend days on end, just tinkering and tinkering,

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:52.900
- Yeah.
- but he's also got this...

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.120
incredible work ethic.

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.000
You know, as you've seen in the story,

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.280
he had sleep in his car, just to save money,

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:03.100
- to get to the purpose
of what he was aiming towards...
- Mmm-hm.

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.260
at any time in his life, that's always what he does.

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:09.420
As he... uses his resources to create...

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:13.120
the very best and most purposeful way
to get to the end result.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.500
So, you know, when we were living in a...

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.740
small basement apartment and
you know, saving lots of money.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:24.660
He had lots of free time to tinker and play,
and prototype with all these things that he loved.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.440
And then started making videos
and then that became kind of the...

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.680
the project is making the videos
out of all these things.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:35.320
And now we're going back, to how do
we get more of that time to tinker.

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.800
That's right, and this is the frustration I've
had with making videos from the beginning,

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:40.080
I feel held back...

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.720
- by making videos. I feel like the last year...
- Mmm-hm.

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:45.600
I've done nothing, but make videos I spent every day...

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.460
working on systems and ways
to bring you content on a daily basis.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.720
Because, I know there are
people out there that really need that.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:53.600
- Mmm-hm.
- You know, this is bigger than just me,

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:57.100
so I, I'm with this dilemma, now where I could
shut down "The King of Random" we could...

00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.900
we could be fine, I could be happy,
I could be a great dad for my kids,

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.940
I could play with everything I want, but
none of you are ever going to know about it

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.740
- Right. 
- On the other hand,

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:08.520
I can try and find some way, where I can
get that freedom back to tinker and play,

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:11.340
and have a system in place,
to develop that content,

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:13.660
to where you can have it
on a consistent basis as well.

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:14.240
- Mmm-hm.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.620
And I'm always up for a challenge,
so I'm looking for a way,

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:18.660
to make the best of both worlds work.

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:23.420
So please, bear with me, this is a transition
process, it's never really been done before,

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.360
there's nobody out there doing it because it's extremely,

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.000
- extremely difficult.
- And very time-intensive,

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.780
and a lot of focus,
and really purposeful energy

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:36.940
- goes into creating something like
this and it does take time.
- Yeah.

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.420
And there's no other platform in the world right now,

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:42.520
that has the resources that we have,
the subscriber base that you are,

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:44.700
the ideas that surround us,

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:48.340
and you know, the the funding from sponsorships and...

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:50.140
Google Adsense to make all this happen.

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:54.020
So we are literally blazing new trails, we're
pushing new boundaries and sometimes...

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.960
when we push new boundaries,
they're going to break, we make mistakes.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.080
I'm an experimenter, I experiment
with you guys to see how you react.

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:02.300
Some of these recent collaborations...

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.580
- It's an experiment.
- It's an experiment, yeah, so...

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.160
don't judge the whole channel by a couple of videos,

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.460
- where you see somebody that
you may or may not like.
- Mmm-hm.

00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:12.800
Um, it's all part of an experiment,
it's all growing to a greater good,

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:16.340
and if you're worried about the kind of
content on the channel, just know that...

00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:20.400
I'm trying to live out my passions, in a way,
that you can experience them with me.

00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:23.400
And remember, that this whole process is evolutionary.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:27.580
You know for Grant but also for the
way that YouTube has progressed,

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:30.980
the way that life has progressed and
the way we can share that with you.

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.560
- That's right.
- So...
- I mean...

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.140
here are really the options:

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.920
you want to leave so many negative
comments and thumbs down my video,

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.080
I lose motivation, I stop making videos.

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:42.940
If I take a week or two off to prototype
tinker, and bring back those old projects,

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.740
my revenues drop, to the point,
where it's not sustainable for me,

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.020
I stopped making videos.

00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:50.240
It's a really delicate balance to be able to...

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.300
make a living off of doing something
that you love,

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:57.020
but also be able to employ other
people produce on a regular schedule,

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:00.580
it would be extremely easy
for me, just to quit, to give up, to stop

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:03.260
and to... relieve the burden.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.480
I mean, I've been carrying this burden
for seven years making videos

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:08.760
for YouTube and not really knowing why.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.280
I'm just doing it, because I know there are
people out there benefiting and sharing

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:14.020
and I want to share
the joy of what we're doing.

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:18.700
But if people are taking the joy out of it,
it really affects my motivation to continue.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.400
So you just have to trust me. We are...

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.020
putting systems into place we've
got a machine working now

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.220
and we're jump-starting that machine,
we're getting it working, we're working on the bugs,

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.580
we're moving it, to becoming a well-oiled machine

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:33.140
and we're almost at the point now where
we can start bringing back the DIY

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.640
and those projects that are time consuming.

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.480
Because that is where the passion comes from

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.500
and that is where Grant's heart is
and always has been.

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:41.840
- Yeah.
- It's just that, he's very, you know,

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.680
he takes to heart what you guys say
and what you guys think,

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:45.860
and what you guys want, because...

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:50.400
from his passion that he shared with you
he loves the feedback that he gets from you.

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:53.960
You know, good and bad he takes it to
heart and he kind of adjusts...

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:57.040
based on what you guys want,
because part of his passion,

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.500
is sharing it and sharing the joy that he
finds in the projects that he's doing.

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:01.980
If you keep watching the videos,

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:06.060
you enable me to build a team of
people who can get you that content,

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.180
that I'm passionate about.

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:10.540
Because it's never going to stop,
I mean, we've got content every time.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:13.680
You know, we have our weekly
date night and we talk about things,

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:16.840
you know, for hours on our date night and
every night we talk about things...

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:20.440
and Grant's use off, you know 5, 10, 20 ideas,

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.680
- [baby noise]
- just about every day,
every night, every week.

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:26.760
and I'm, I'm blown away at the
amount of ideas

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:30.500
that he could produce, that he wants
to produce, that he wants to play with

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.400
and tinker with in his shop and develop into videos.

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.380
But again it
goes back to the issue

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:39.600
of how much time do we have to do that when
we're producing on a certain schedule.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:43.060
And I'm a dad, guys, I'm a dad and
a husband, first and foremost,

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:45.200
and I don't want my family to grow up

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.780
and leave home and never have
known their dad,

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:50.940
- who was sitting right there at home the whole time.
- On the computer.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:53.940
Yeah, you just have to understand how many sacrifices

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.040
are being made to produce these videos.

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:57.460
So much is going into it

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:01.440
and it might be easy to say, "Well, don't
spend as much time making the videos."

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.600
But if you don't do that,

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.840
you don't get surfaced on YouTube, you
don't get the Adsense revenues that you need,

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.520
- [baby noise]
- which means the whole thing falls apart

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:09.700
and you don't make any videos.

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.300
So we are trying to do the best of everything,

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.360
we're trying to produce the
content that you love, that we love,

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:17.700
that the internet loves, that YouTube supports,

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:21.220
and that can... employ a number of different families.

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:23.240
And it is happening, it is happening,

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:27.080
my mind is always spinning and the more
that I can get away from the video production,

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:28.580
the more creative that I can be,

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:31.300
in bringing more ideas to you. So,

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.220
the hunt for "The King of Random" sidekick is on,

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:35.600
because I need, I need a protege, I need a prototype.

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.360
Somebody whose mind works,

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:40.980
the way Grant does in a lot of
ways, that can tinker, that has a really good...

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:45.080
understanding of the laws of science and
somebody that likes to push the boundaries.

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:46.720
Yep, I need a full-time me,

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:49.340
that can just spend all day, every day
on the shop working on things.

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:52.020
And then develop the ideas
and get them more film ready,

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.360
I need a team
that can produce that,

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:56.560
and then I need free time to spend with my family,

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.940
and make sure that my kids develop properly as well,

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.120
and don't grow up without a dad.

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:01.580
[clap] Happy Father's Day!

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:03.580
Here's where we'd like to go, guys I...

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:07.160
am bringing on a sidekick I'm going to
bring on a full-time carbon copy of myself,

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.160
who can spend all day prototyping, tinkering,

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:12.460
and getting those awesome "King of Random"
projects back in the pipeline.

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:15.560
I've got a production team who can
take the content that we film

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.560
and put out daily videos.

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.900
That's the goal:
daily videos and experiments.

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:23.980
And... I want to get to a point, where I can
be removed from the system enough,

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:25.800
to where I can have more creativity,

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.360
more vision, more time to
tinker, and really feel fulfilled...

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.380
in following my passions

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:32.980
and my desires
and spending time with my family as well.

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:33.980
And like I said before,

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:35.980
Grant is full of ideas

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:38.540
and they just seem to come in a
never-ending stream

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:41.340
and that's part of the passion that
we want to share with you is...

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:43.180
the exploration of these ideas.

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.880
And I especially get my ideas,
when I'm removed from the system,

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.380
because when I'm
tied to producing

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:51.160
or daily schedule and you got to realize
putting out a video takes the entire day, because...

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:54.060
we're following up on comments and we're
watching the reactions,

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:56.740
we're seeing as the thumbnails are
working well, do we need to change the titles?

00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.820
and my mind is tied to that I'm not thinking of new ideas.

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.380
So the best thing for all of us really is...

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:05.540
please keep supporting us, by
watching every video we put out,

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:07.160
- maybe watch it twice.
- [laughs]

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.580
- And...
- If you love it.

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:09.980
- [chuckle]
- And by doing that,

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.820
you'll be enabling this system

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:15.460
that will support the content
creation of new projects, new DIY's,

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:18.300
there's nobody positioned as effectively as we are,

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:20.120
to give you what you're asking for.

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:24.600
So just work with me, work with us, and allow me...

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:28.620
to get to a place where I can have
the freedom, the vision, the ability...

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:33.000
to bring on more people and
infuse more content back to you.

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:35.700
Yeah and this is a
very artistic process too and...

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.000
we need that time for creativity,

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.700
because we've got the content, we just
need to be able to have the time space,

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:44.080
- to give it to you
in a way that you love.
-  That's it

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.900
And we do love you guys,

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.180
we love meeting you in person and

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:49.740
one thing that I've done this
year that I've never done before,

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:50.920
was come out on camera.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.580
That's why, I'm in all my videos now,
that's why I'm going to live events,

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.580
- [baby noise]
- that's why I'm hanging out with creators

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:58.420
and spending time with people,
this is all very new for me. Because...

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.460
as Janae said, I'm very private person,
I'm very introverted.

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:05.380
So for me, to come out this is a new
pushing the boundaries, pushing the bubble.

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.280
- It's a new experiment.
- It's a new experiment, for me.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.340
Really, it is a new experiment!

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:12.480
And part of the evolution of Grant and "The King of
Random" in our life process together.

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:16.320
That's it. So we appreciate you guys, if
you want "The King of Random" to continue,

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.800
it really is up to you. I'm going to do my best...

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:21.940
to stick to my standards, to be true to myself,

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.020
to be true to you,

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:26.340
and I really want to give you the
experiences that you're asking for. So...

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:29.760
if you want to see certain projects
done on my channel, then upvote

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:33.480
those project ideas in the comments,
so that I see them, because the ones that I see,

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:37.040
are the ones that I'm doing.
And so I don't really want to get kickback...

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.240
from people saying, "All you do is these."

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.600
Because that's what you're asking for you guys,

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:42.600
if you want something different,
ask for something different,

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.660
I'm doing the best I can to meet those needs,
we're all here on a dream together,

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:48.440
we're going to the same
place, it's all good, it's all positive,

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:52.240
and it's really all up to you. Keep
supporting us, we'll keep supporting you.

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.640
- Thanks for watching!
- Thanks for watching.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:55.460
[laughs]

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:58.160
We call good?

00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:58.760
