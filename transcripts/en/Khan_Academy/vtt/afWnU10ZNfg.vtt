00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:02.611
- [Voiceover] I have three different scenarios here

00:00:02.611 --> 00:00:05.397
of a cell being immersed in a solution,

00:00:05.397 --> 00:00:07.593
and the cell is this magenta circle,

00:00:07.593 --> 00:00:09.444
that's the cellular membrane.

00:00:09.444 --> 00:00:11.087
I have the water molecules depicted

00:00:11.087 --> 00:00:14.072
by these blue circles, and then, I have the solute

00:00:14.072 --> 00:00:17.295
inside of the solution, inside of the water solution

00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:18.891
that we depict with these yellow circles.

00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:21.422
I've clearly exaggerated the size of the water molecules

00:00:21.422 --> 00:00:25.384
and the solute particles relative to the size of the cell,

00:00:25.384 --> 00:00:26.836
but I did that so that we can visualize

00:00:26.836 --> 00:00:28.584
what's actually going on.

00:00:28.584 --> 00:00:30.595
We're going to assume that the cellular membrane,

00:00:30.595 --> 00:00:34.405
this phospholipid bilayer, is semipermeable,

00:00:34.405 --> 00:00:37.391
that it will allow water molecules to pass in and out,

00:00:37.391 --> 00:00:39.453
so a water molecule could go from the inside

00:00:39.453 --> 00:00:42.330
to the outside, or from the outside to the inside,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.025
but we're gonna assume that it does not allow

00:00:44.025 --> 00:00:46.099
the passage of the solute particles,

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:47.795
so that's why it's semipermeable.

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:50.244
It's permeable to certain things,

00:00:50.244 --> 00:00:52.488
or we could say, selectively permeable.

00:00:52.488 --> 00:00:55.049
Now, what do we think is going to happen?

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:57.212
Well, the first thing that you might observe is

00:00:57.212 --> 00:01:00.666
we have a lower concentration of solute on the outside

00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.730
than we have on the inside,

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.095
so at any given moment of time, you will have

00:01:05.095 --> 00:01:07.319
some water molecules moving in just the right direction

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:11.894
to go from the outside to the inside, and you will also have

00:01:11.894 --> 00:01:13.923
some water molecules that might be in just the right place

00:01:13.923 --> 00:01:16.452
to go from the inside to the outside,

00:01:16.452 --> 00:01:18.058
but what's more likely to happen,

00:01:18.058 --> 00:01:19.464
and what's going to happen more

00:01:19.464 --> 00:01:21.546
over a certain period of time?

00:01:21.546 --> 00:01:23.113
The water molecules that are on the outside,

00:01:23.113 --> 00:01:25.287
and we talk about this in the osmosis video,

00:01:25.287 --> 00:01:27.985
they're going to be less obstructed by solute particles.

00:01:28.662 --> 00:01:31.373
If this one happens to be moving in that direction,

00:01:31.373 --> 00:01:33.872
well, it's gonna make its way to the membrane,

00:01:33.872 --> 00:01:36.157
and then, maybe get through the membrane,

00:01:36.157 --> 00:01:39.265
while something, maybe, if this water molecule

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.460
was moving in this direction, well, gee,

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.603
it's gonna be obstructed now, maybe this is bouncing back,

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.320
and it's gonna ricochet off of it,

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.184
so the water molecules on the inside are more obstructed.

00:01:48.184 --> 00:01:51.366
They're less likely to be able to fully interact

00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:53.154
with the membrane or move in the right direction.

00:01:53.154 --> 00:01:55.791
They're being obstructed by these solute particles.

00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:57.013
Even though you're going to have

00:01:57.013 --> 00:01:58.902
water molecules going back and forth,

00:01:59.874 --> 00:02:01.920
in a given period of time, you have a higher probability

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.196
of more going in, than going out,

00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:06.523
so you're going to have a net inflow.

00:02:06.523 --> 00:02:08.376
Net inflow

00:02:10.217 --> 00:02:14.307
of H2O, of water molecules.

00:02:14.307 --> 00:02:17.132
Now, a situation like this, where we're talking about a cell

00:02:17.132 --> 00:02:19.122
and it's in a solution that has a

00:02:19.122 --> 00:02:20.799
lower concentration of solute,

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.870
it's important that we're talking about a solute

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.704
that is not allowed to go to the membrane,

00:02:25.704 --> 00:02:27.868
the membrane is not permeable to that solute.

00:02:27.868 --> 00:02:30.644
We call this type of situation, this type of solution

00:02:30.644 --> 00:02:32.226
that the cell is immersed in,

00:02:32.226 --> 00:02:34.867
we call this a hypotonic solution.

00:02:38.193 --> 00:02:39.980
Hypotonic solution.

00:02:40.495 --> 00:02:42.358
Anytime we're talking about hypotonic,

00:02:42.358 --> 00:02:44.673
or as we'll see, isotonic and hypertonic,

00:02:46.112 --> 00:02:49.040
we're talking about relative concentrations of solute

00:02:50.945 --> 00:02:53.628
that cannot get through some type of a membrane.

00:02:53.628 --> 00:02:55.894
The word hypo, you might've seen it in other things.

00:02:55.894 --> 00:02:58.840
It's a prefix that means less of something, so in this case,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.875
we have a lower concentration of solute in the solution

00:03:02.875 --> 00:03:05.241
than we have inside of the cell, and because of that,

00:03:05.241 --> 00:03:06.914
you're going to have osmosis,

00:03:09.704 --> 00:03:12.088
you're gonna have water molecules going from the outside,

00:03:12.088 --> 00:03:14.591
I should say, to the inside.

00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:17.364
That's actually going to put pressure on the cell.

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:20.331
The cell itself might expand, or it could even,

00:03:20.331 --> 00:03:21.633
if there's enough pressure,

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:24.873
it might even explode.

00:03:25.245 --> 00:03:27.186
Now, let's go to the next scenario.

00:03:27.186 --> 00:03:29.869
In this scenario, we have roughly

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:32.830
equal concentrations of solute on the outside

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.923
and on the inside, at least, I tried to draw them that way.

00:03:35.923 --> 00:03:38.530
In this situation, the probability of a water molecule,

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.966
in a given period of time,

00:03:39.966 --> 00:03:41.886
going from the outside to the inside,

00:03:41.886 --> 00:03:45.086
or from the inside to the outside, is going to be the same,

00:03:45.086 --> 00:03:47.972
so you're not going to have any net inflow or net outflow.

00:03:47.972 --> 00:03:49.220
You're always gonna have water molecules

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.470
going back and forth, but there's not gonna be

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.371
any net inflow or outflow.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.825
Let's see, let me write no net,

00:03:55.825 --> 00:03:58.815
no net flow.

00:03:59.686 --> 00:04:01.269
In this type of solution, where you have

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.113
the same concentration of solute in the solution,

00:04:04.113 --> 00:04:08.787
as you do inside the cell, we would call this an isotonic.

00:04:08.787 --> 00:04:10.906
This is an isotonic solution.

00:04:11.347 --> 00:04:15.105
Isotonic solution.

00:04:15.792 --> 00:04:19.134
The prefix, iso, refers to things that are the same.

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:21.633
It has the same concentration of solute,

00:04:21.633 --> 00:04:22.872
and so you have no net inflow.

00:04:22.872 --> 00:04:26.185
Hypotonic solution, you have water molecules

00:04:26.185 --> 00:04:28.346
going into the cell, the cell expanding,

00:04:28.346 --> 00:04:29.791
kind of like a filling balloon.

00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:33.030
Isotonic solution, no net flow.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.813
Of course, you could imagine in this last scenario,

00:04:35.813 --> 00:04:38.863
I have a higher concentration of solute on the outside

00:04:38.863 --> 00:04:40.527
than I have on the inside.

00:04:40.527 --> 00:04:42.022
We can guess what's going to happen.

00:04:42.022 --> 00:04:43.719
First, what would I call this?

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:46.501
Well, I have more of something in the solution,

00:04:46.501 --> 00:04:48.788
so I would use the prefix hyper.

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:52.355
I have more of it, more, hypertonic.

00:04:52.355 --> 00:04:55.539
This is a hypertonic solution.

00:04:56.522 --> 00:05:00.287
Once again, the solute can't go across the membrane,

00:05:00.287 --> 00:05:01.943
but the water molecules can,

00:05:01.943 --> 00:05:03.635
and you're gonna have water molecules

00:05:05.822 --> 00:05:07.491
going from the outside to the inside,

00:05:07.491 --> 00:05:09.501
and from the inside to the outside,

00:05:09.501 --> 00:05:13.138
but the probability that the ones on the inside

00:05:13.138 --> 00:05:15.790
are gonna be less obstructed to go out,

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.055
than the ones on the outside to go in,

00:05:18.055 --> 00:05:19.965
so you're going to have a net outflow.

00:05:19.965 --> 00:05:21.133
You have a higher probability of things

00:05:21.133 --> 00:05:24.069
going from the inside to the outside,

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.188
than you do from things going from the outside to the inside

00:05:27.188 --> 00:05:29.392
because they're gonna be more obstructed,

00:05:29.392 --> 00:05:32.143
so they're gonna be held back, I guess, in different ways.

00:05:32.143 --> 00:05:34.593
In this situation, you're gonna have the water

00:05:34.593 --> 00:05:38.213
escape the cell, and the cell actually might shrivel up.

00:05:39.398 --> 00:05:41.331
Since it's gonna lose that pressure from the water,

00:05:41.331 --> 00:05:44.398
the cell itself might shrivel up in some way.

00:05:44.398 --> 00:05:46.795
You could actually see this in actual living systems.

00:05:46.795 --> 00:05:48.583
If you were to put a red blood cell

00:05:48.583 --> 00:05:51.092
into a hypotonic solution,

00:05:51.092 --> 00:05:52.900
the water's gonna rush into it,

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.329
and it's gonna blow up.

00:05:55.329 --> 00:05:58.152
It's going to expand, so it's gonna look like a

00:05:58.152 --> 00:06:01.160
overinflated red blood cell, and an isotonic solution

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.542
is gonna look the way that we're used

00:06:02.542 --> 00:06:04.206
to seeing a red blood cell,

00:06:04.206 --> 00:06:06.879
actually, having kind of that little divot

00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:09.568
in the middle area, while over here,

00:06:09.568 --> 00:06:11.073
it's all going to expand.

00:06:11.073 --> 00:06:12.487
Then, in the hypertonic solution,

00:06:12.487 --> 00:06:15.106
the water's going to escape the red blood cell,

00:06:15.106 --> 00:06:18.592
then you would actually see it kind of shrivel up,

00:06:18.592 --> 00:06:21.196
shrivel up a little bit like this because

00:06:23.866 --> 00:06:28.167
we have a net outflow of water molecules.
