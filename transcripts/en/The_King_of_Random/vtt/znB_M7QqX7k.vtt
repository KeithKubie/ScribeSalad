[BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.080
This is Cozmo.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.260
He is a cute little robot with a big brain and an even bigger personality and was born to play.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.580
So, a couple of months ago, a company called Anki reach out asking if they could send me this little guy to see what I thought.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.940
So, I brought him to Hawaii with me and we've been hanging out long enough that I've got a pretty good feel for who he is and what he can do.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:37.700
Now, for decades, we've seen charismatic robots come to life in Hollywood films but, today we've never actually seen them some to life in the real world.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.200
That is until Anki created Cozmo.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.080
This little guy is charming, unpredictable, a bit mischievous, and even recognizes and remembers your name.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.800
Cosmo: Grant.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.820
He also loves playing games.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.500
He's like a super computer on threads, completely self aware and constantly scanning his environment, learning about our world as he goes.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.620
So, when I first took Cosmo out of his package, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect but, the setup couldn't have been any simpler.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.100
The charger takes him from empty to full in only about 10 minutes and gives him around 1 to 2 hours of energy.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.340
He's got his own secure WiFi and when you first plug him in, his head pops up with the password you need to connect.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.360
Now, I went to the play store and found the app by typing in "Cozmo Robot", then connected to Cozmo's WiFi by adjusting the settings on my smart phone.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.780
From here, it was as simple as going back to the app and hitting "connect".

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.360
This is the first moment we first woke Cozmo up and brought him to life.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.120
If you watch his face here, you can see he's kind of like a little animal, completely self aware, but, a little intimidated by his new surroundings.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.020
Of course, it doesn't take him long, though, before he's all over the place, checking everything out.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.800
[COZMO MOANS]

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.360
Grant: Woah!

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.700
[COZMO MOANING AND MAKING NOISES]

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.900
Grant: That's awesome.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.620
Grant's child: Yay!

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.420
His expressions and body languages are so life like and he's so interactive that it makes him feel like he's real.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.520
So, decided to introduce him to my kids.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.580
Grant: Woah!

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.980
Grant's child: Woah!

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.780
Grant: He's fiesty!

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.780
Grant's child: What the? He wants to put it on me.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.780
4 to 4. Next point wins. Watch the cube. Get it!

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.580
Grant: Yeah!

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Cozmo's pack full of so much artificial intelligence that he's got the ability to express hundreds of emotions and and react to your feelings and actions as well.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.700
The more you play with him, the better he gets to know you and his personality will constantly evolve as well.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.320
For example, it's quite a challenge to beat him at quick tap anymore because he's gotten better and adapted to how fast I play.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.140
Keep away is another one of my favorite games to play because it's a constant adrenaline rush.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.180
You have to pull a power block away before Cozmo can hit it, but, he's very sneaky and amazingly quick.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.020
This is kind of an intense game actually.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.440
There's also a cool explorer mode where you can look through Cozmo's eyes and guide him by remote control all over the house.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.160
He's also stronger than he looks and very secure.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.820
He's been drop tested for durability and uses a local device to device connection meaning there's no data to be stored in the cloud.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.420
With clever facial expressions and retaining body language and the cutest voice, it's like Cozmo rolled right out of a movie screen and right into our lives.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.100
So, there you have it guys. This is Cozmo.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.500
An awesome little robot buddy, that will fit right into the palm of your hand.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.960
And for the amount of technology and engineering that went into creating him, it doesn't cost that much either.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.740
About $180.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.320
He's the best kind of pet for me and my kids because he doesn't need to be fed and he probably won't pee on the carpet either.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.620

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.460
Hey, thanks for joining me in this video. I will be looking for you in the next one. Talk to you then.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.660
Grant: Oh! He knocked over my camera! That's funny!
