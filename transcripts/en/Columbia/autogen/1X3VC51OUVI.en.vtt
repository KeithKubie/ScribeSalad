to fundamentally alter our energy system
so it seems to me that we're talking

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:03.330
so it seems to me that we're talking
 

00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:05.440
so it seems to me that we're talking
about something here which is

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:05.450
about something here which is
 

00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:08.480
about something here which is
extraordinarily time-sensitive but also

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:08.490
extraordinarily time-sensitive but also

extraordinarily time-sensitive but also
extraordinarily complex were aiming to

extraordinarily complex were aiming to
 

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:17.810
extraordinarily complex were aiming to
address a quality of life issue that

00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:17.820
address a quality of life issue that
 

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:21.350
address a quality of life issue that
will be of importance for well over half

00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:21.360
will be of importance for well over half
 

00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:24.740
will be of importance for well over half
the planet very soon which is the well

we are addressing a environmental

00:51:31.559 --> 00:51:31.569
we are addressing a environmental
 

00:51:31.569 --> 00:51:34.500
we are addressing a environmental
security issue of profound significance

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:34.510
security issue of profound significance
 

00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:38.099
security issue of profound significance
and I think we're also addressing

00:51:38.099 --> 00:51:38.109
and I think we're also addressing
 

00:51:38.109 --> 00:51:41.309
and I think we're also addressing
indirectly a national security and a

00:51:41.309 --> 00:51:41.319
indirectly a national security and a
 

00:51:41.319 --> 00:51:43.740
indirectly a national security and a
global security issue and that is how

00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:43.750
global security issue and that is how
 

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:46.319
global security issue and that is how
does a world economy that's already

00:51:46.319 --> 00:51:46.329
does a world economy that's already
 

00:51:46.329 --> 00:51:49.230
does a world economy that's already
pressing very hard against the natural

00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:49.240
pressing very hard against the natural
 

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:52.230
pressing very hard against the natural
resource base and in my view has already

00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240
resource base and in my view has already
 

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:56.339
resource base and in my view has already
lifted the real price of oil by a factor

00:51:56.339 --> 00:51:56.349
lifted the real price of oil by a factor
 

00:51:56.349 --> 00:51:59.609
lifted the real price of oil by a factor
of roughly three during the past ten

00:51:59.609 --> 00:51:59.619
of roughly three during the past ten
 

00:51:59.619 --> 00:52:01.410
of roughly three during the past ten
years and I think it's likely to stay

00:52:01.410 --> 00:52:01.420
years and I think it's likely to stay
 

00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:04.290
years and I think it's likely to stay
high and continue to rise how do we face

00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:04.300
high and continue to rise how do we face
 

00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:06.960
high and continue to rise how do we face
these challenges there's also a national

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:06.970
these challenges there's also a national
 

00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:09.299
these challenges there's also a national
technological challenge which is the

00:52:09.299 --> 00:52:09.309
technological challenge which is the
 

00:52:09.309 --> 00:52:13.680
technological challenge which is the
very real point that we're in some

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:13.690
very real point that we're in some
 

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:18.299
very real point that we're in some

the kind of new leadership that can

the kind of new leadership that can
allow our national industry also to play

00:52:35.849 --> 00:52:35.859
allow our national industry also to play
 

00:52:35.859 --> 00:52:38.579
allow our national industry also to play
a very significant competitive role in

00:52:38.579 --> 00:52:38.589
a very significant competitive role in
 

00:52:38.589 --> 00:52:41.370
a very significant competitive role in

the world in the years ahead and time is

the world in the years ahead and time is
very sensitive on that as well because

very sensitive on that as well because

very sensitive on that as well because
our national economy in my view is in

our national economy in my view is in
 

00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:51.059
our national economy in my view is in
crisis not just a financial crisis but a

crisis not just a financial crisis but a

crisis not just a financial crisis but a
technological challenge let's say that

technological challenge let's say that
 

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.470

going to learn what customers really

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:29.490
going to learn what customers really
 

01:17:29.490 --> 01:17:32.390

at three o'clock in the afternoon what
do we need to do to make sure that our

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:35.650
grid is stable enough at that point to
 

01:19:35.650 --> 01:19:38.190
grid is stable enough at that point to

that the OnStar is developing so I'm
optimistic that those hurdles are very

01:19:56.250 --> 01:19:56.260
optimistic that those hurdles are very
 

01:19:56.260 --> 01:19:59.360
optimistic that those hurdles are very

grid is developed will alleviate that
problem so I don't see that as a

01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:08.680
problem so I don't see that as a
 

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:11.010

so we believe when one compiles

01:37:48.879 --> 01:37:48.889
so we believe when one compiles
 

01:37:48.889 --> 01:37:51.729
so we believe when one compiles
ultimately the value proposition which

01:37:51.729 --> 01:37:51.739
ultimately the value proposition which
 

01:37:51.739 --> 01:37:54.219
ultimately the value proposition which
includes perhaps all the OnStar and

01:37:54.219 --> 01:37:54.229
includes perhaps all the OnStar and
 

01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:56.859

think there's going to be some very

01:38:01.899 --> 01:38:01.909
think there's going to be some very
 

01:38:01.909 --> 01:38:03.549

or two on the launch regions but
 

01:38:05.869 --> 01:38:07.390
or two on the launch regions but
ultimately I think you'll find that this

01:38:07.390 --> 01:38:07.400
ultimately I think you'll find that this
 

01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:09.009
ultimately I think you'll find that this
car may be the equivalent of less than a

01:38:09.009 --> 01:38:09.019

think about and now I'm going to throw

01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:19.130
think about and now I'm going to throw
 

01:38:19.130 --> 01:38:21.160
think about and now I'm going to throw
out a question to all of you and then

01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:21.170
out a question to all of you and then
 

01:38:21.170 --> 01:38:22.899
out a question to all of you and then
ask for some questions from the audience

obviously as art said where we all rely

01:38:39.399 --> 01:38:39.409
obviously as art said where we all rely
 

01:38:39.409 --> 01:38:41.049
obviously as art said where we all rely
on electric transportation more than

01:38:41.049 --> 01:38:41.059
on electric transportation more than
 

01:38:41.059 --> 01:38:43.120

many cities through the subway but what

01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:43.130
many cities through the subway but what
 

01:38:43.130 --> 01:38:45.149
many cities through the subway but what
has that what else has to happen here

01:38:45.149 --> 01:38:45.159

about fleets i think that that is a

01:38:55.479 --> 01:38:55.489
about fleets i think that that is a
 

01:38:55.489 --> 01:39:00.279
about fleets i think that that is a

or you could burn it and make
 

01:47:20.590 --> 01:47:22.830
or you could burn it and make
electricity for a battery or you could

turn it into hydrogen which we go far
this done and in that case you go

01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:27.280
this done and in that case you go
 

01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:28.980
this done and in that case you go
farthest with the hydrogen and the fuel

01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:28.990
farthest with the hydrogen and the fuel
 

01:47:28.990 --> 01:47:31.590
farthest with the hydrogen and the fuel
so the good news is we have a lot of

certainly a different challenge but I

01:52:40.479 --> 01:52:40.489
certainly a different challenge but I
 

01:52:40.489 --> 01:52:43.090
certainly a different challenge but I
harken back to the challenge in the

the story when we first were questioned

01:52:52.810 --> 01:52:52.820
the story when we first were questioned
 

01:52:52.820 --> 01:52:54.520
the story when we first were questioned
and queried about our ability to make

batteries General Motors and I bodily

01:52:56.380 --> 01:52:56.390
batteries General Motors and I bodily
 

01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:57.700
batteries General Motors and I bodily
told them the story did you know that

01:52:57.700 --> 01:52:57.710
told them the story did you know that
 

01:52:57.710 --> 01:53:00.030
told them the story did you know that
General Motors had batteries on the moon

01:53:00.030 --> 01:53:00.040
General Motors had batteries on the moon
 

01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:03.459
General Motors had batteries on the moon
because General Motors was the battery

01:53:03.459 --> 01:53:03.469
because General Motors was the battery
 

01:53:03.469 --> 01:53:06.399

01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:17.830
software for Apollo 15 16 and 17 it just
so happens that Apollo 17 the lunar

01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:17.840
so happens that Apollo 17 the lunar
 

01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:21.070
so happens that Apollo 17 the lunar
rover went 22 miles I don't know if it's

01:53:21.070 --> 01:53:21.080
rover went 22 miles I don't know if it's
 

01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:23.620
rover went 22 miles I don't know if it's
real world miles or lunar miles but 22

01:53:23.620 --> 01:53:23.630
real world miles or lunar miles but 22
 

01:53:23.630 --> 01:53:26.709
real world miles or lunar miles but 22
miles and unfortunately the program was

01:53:26.709 --> 01:53:26.719
miles and unfortunately the program was
 

01:53:26.719 --> 01:53:28.149
miles and unfortunately the program was
scrapped due to no recharging

01:53:28.149 --> 01:53:28.159
scrapped due to no recharging
 

01:53:28.159 --> 01:53:32.229
