00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:05.340
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: As Frank will discuss
in a few moments, we are no longer passive

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.910
consumers of mass media or spectators. Now,
thanks to Google+, we hope, Twitter, and YouTube,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.269
we are media. Storytelling is no longer linear
and we are frequently asked to participate.

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:24.390
This new narrative is still nascent, but continues
to gain momentum. "The Art of Immersion" examines

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.859
the blurred lines between author and audience,
story and game, entertainment and marketing,

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.989
and fiction and reality--what we call "deep
media." Just so you guys know this might run

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:36.530
a couple of times through this talk.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.300
It's actually our freight elevator. So, if
you hear that just sort of go with it. Following

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.970
Frank's talk of "The Art of Immersion," he'll
be joined by some transmedia pioneers for

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.749
a conversation about the changing nature of
storytelling, collaborative production, and

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:57.570
how these immersive experiences actually come
to fruition. So please join me in welcoming

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.570
Frank.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.800
[applause]

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:19.890
&gt;&gt;Frank: Thank you. OK. Hi. So, I'm gonna
talk a little bit about grammar today, but

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.380
don't worry. It doesn't have anything to do
with linguistics. I'm going to talk about

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:32.000
the grammar of storytelling--how it's evolving,
why it's evolving, and why that matters to

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
us.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.230
So, as Janine pointed out, I wrote this book
about how the internet was changing storytelling

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:47.390
essentially. And the thing about storytelling
is that it's always been mediated by technology,

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.960
by whatever technology is at hand. And as
I was working on the book, I realized early

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.450
on that every medium has its own grammar.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.370
Cinema, for example. We take for granted the
grammar of cinema because we're used to watching

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.250
movies. People have been watching movies now
for a hundred years or more. But all of the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.710
parts of that grammar, cross-cuts, fades,
point of view shots, even a close-up, they

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.910
all had to be invented.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:27.170
They weren't there at the beginning. And so
the motion picture camera was invented around

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:37.280
1890. And for a long time, for a number of
years, the typical shot was what's called

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.800
the proscenium arch shot, which is to say
as if the camera were set in amid the audience,

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:54.270
looking up at the action taking place on stage.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.750
All of these other shots and the cutting and
so forth, all that happened gradually over

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:09.120
a period of years. It wasn't really consolidated
until about 1915. And in fact, it was 1910

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.720
before they even came up with the idea of
movie stars. So, what essentially happened

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.760
was we had a 20-year period from the invention
of the camera to the idea of putting stars

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.330
in front of it.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:32.000
And another five years after that, before
the grammar really coalesced. And 12 more,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.470
of course, 'till we got sound. So, as it happens,
it's been about 20 years now since the birth

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:45.849
of the web. And we're still figuring that
out, too. What I realized when I was working

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:51.060
on the book was that every new medium seems
to take about 20 or 30 years for people to

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.020
figure out what to do with it.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:01.330
And in the meantime, we have I've come to
call the "horseless carriage" phase. Transitional,

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:08.380
obviously, when we don't really understand
the possibilities of the new technology. As

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.849
with the proscenium arch shot, we just continue
doing what we've done in the past.

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:21.590
But it's not just a question of seeing the
new in terms of the old. It's also defining

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:30.080
the new in terms of what it's lacking rather
than what it can become. So, I think that's

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.759
what's happened with the internet. A lot of
internet critics are basically saying, "Where's

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.020
the horse?"

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.779
"Social media devalues friendship. Where is
the horse?" “Google makes me stupid. Where's

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:51.530
the horse?" "Bloggers don't have proper journalism
credentials. Where is the horse?" Well, the

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.150
horse is gone and it's not coming back. So,
what do we have instead?

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:06.039
We have essentially a medium that consists
of all media that is video, audio, print,

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:15.789
any combination of the above. And that can
be used in a way that's inherently non-linear,

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:22.849
that is also inherently participatory. It
encourages people to jump in to act. As a

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:25.479
result, it's often game-like.

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:34.460
It has the capability of being immersive.
And it blurs boundaries relentlessly. The

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:41.789
boundary between author and audience, between
fiction and reality, between story and game,

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:48.210
between entertainment and marketing. In the
process of all this, it really changes the

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.210
way we think.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:55.869
For example, I'm gonna talk for a moment about
nonlinearity and what that does. So, nonlinear

00:05:55.869 --> 00:06:01.180
storytelling is not new, of course. In the
20th Century, it was pretty much the province

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:07.650
of the avant garde. You had James Joyce. You
had Jorge Luis Borges. You had Akira Kurosawa,

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.879
Jean Luc Godard.

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:19.090
Godard’s, in a debate at Cannes in the mid-'60s,
was famously asked if he didn't think a story

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:24.389
should have a beginning, a middle, and an
end, to which he replies, "Certainly, but

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:32.469
not necessarily in that order." This kind
of nonlinear storytelling was self-conscious.

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:35.490
It was intellectual and arty.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:40.180
It was essentially calling attention to the
illusion that is narrative, which is kind

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:48.499
of a no-no in certainly classical, Hollywood
cinema and fiction in general. But then something

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:54.589
strange started to happen. By the mid-'90s,
nonlinearity had been absorbed by the culture

00:06:54.589 --> 00:07:01.229
to the point that Quentin Tarantino could
release "Pulp Fiction", a movie that to most

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:04.860
video executives at the time was utterly unwatchable.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:13.369
And to a new generation of viewers, it was
an entirely natural way to tell a story. Nonlinearity

00:07:13.369 --> 00:07:18.840
was going mainstream. Within a few years,
you had Christopher Nolan's "Memento." You

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.789
had David Lynch making "Mulholland Drive."
I talked to Lynch when I was working on the

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:28.899
book because I wanted to ask him about this
whole question of nonlinearity, where it's

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:32.099
coming from, why it's become popular.

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:39.689
And what he said really suggested to me "television."
And when you think about it, television is

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:44.610
an extremely nonlinear experience. We're trained
not to think of it this way. We're trained

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:51.629
to think of discrete elements. We watch the
TV show, there's a break, we watch the news,

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:53.949
we watch some ads, we go back to the show.

00:07:53.949 --> 00:08:02.550
But in fact, this is an extremely disjointed
and nonlinear experience. And then of course,

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:10.469
you have the web coming in, a technology,
a medium, that's essentially based on, because

00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:15.099
of hyperlinks, it's essentially based on the
whole idea of nonlinearity.

00:08:15.099 --> 00:08:23.349
In 2005, Alissa Quart, a film critic writing
in film comment, coined the term "hyperlink

00:08:23.349 --> 00:08:34.219
cinema." And a few months after that, Roger
Ebert in a review of "Syriana" wrote, used

00:08:34.219 --> 00:08:39.789
the same term. And he wanted to give credit
to Alissa Quart, but unfortunately as he pointed

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:44.270
out, irony of ironies, "I've lost the link."

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:45.870
[laughter]

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:51.410
So, there's one more thing about the horse's
carriage analogy. Not only does it lack a

00:08:51.410 --> 00:09:00.480
horse, but it's still a carriage. People are
trying to construct at this point, with the

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.420
internet, the equivalent of a purpose-built
motor car. That's kind of where we are with

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.810
storytelling right now.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:13.180
We know the parameters. We know that it encourages
nonlinearity. It has to be participatory in

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:18.500
some way. All of these things. But that doesn't
tell us how to use these things. It doesn't

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:26.350
tell you the grammar. We still have to create
that. And this book that I've written it's

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:30.280
really a meta-narrative about the search for
this new grammar.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:38.810
For me, it's then really an extraordinary
journey. And it began with three stories that

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:43.529
I did for Wired over a period of a couple
of years before I actually started the book

00:09:43.529 --> 00:09:50.810
and before I had even the idea for the book.
The first one was a piece on 3D, for which

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:54.680
I interviewed James Cameron in the fall of
2006.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:10:00.980
At that point "Avatar" had not yet been green
lit. He had it in development. He had it in

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:08.810
development for some time. He was in Montreal
on a sound stage where they were making "Journey

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:15.480
to the Center of the Earth" in 3D, which was
the first feature film to use the 3D camera

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.360
system that he and Vince Pace had invented.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:25.459
So, I went up there and it turned out he had
a lot of free time, which was great. And so,

00:10:25.459 --> 00:10:32.780
we talked about "Avatar” a fair amount.
And in particular, he talked about that kind

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:40.709
of science fiction story as one that was ideal
for creating a "fractal-like complexity,"

00:10:40.709 --> 00:10:41.810
as he put it.

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:47.470
So, the casual viewer could just see the movie,
but for the real fan, he could jump in another

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:54.220
order of magnitude and the pattern would still
hold up. Really, you could have stories of

00:10:54.220 --> 00:11:01.670
almost infinite levels of depth, immersive
entertainment. Just like Star Wars has become.

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:07.140
Of course, Star Wars was the movie that inspired
Cameron to become a director in the first

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:14.819
place. About a year after that, I did a story
on "Year Zero," the alternate reality game.

00:11:14.819 --> 00:11:20.670
It was really a piece on the whole idea of
alternate reality games and we picked that

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:24.460
as the one to focus on.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:32.190
It was an incredibly immersive experience
based on the Nine Inch Nails album called

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:38.770
Year Zero. Trent Reznor had made this album
and he had a problem. He essentially created

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:43.680
a concept album, but at a time when nobody
buys albums anymore and certainly they don't

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:48.009
buy albums that come with liner notes and
the like.

00:11:48.009 --> 00:11:56.230
So, his problem was what are you supposed
to do? How do you even convey to people that

00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:02.769
this is a concept album, much less what the
concept is? And in his case, it was a completely

00:12:02.769 --> 00:12:12.949
fascinating story about America as a theocratic
police state 15 years in the future.

00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:19.939
So, he engaged Susan Bonds, who's the CEO
of 42 Entertainment, who is here by the way.

00:12:19.939 --> 00:12:25.420
She's going to join us in a few minutes. And
Alex Lieu, who works with her. And the result

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:31.640
was a game that played out over a period of
many months and to about two and a half million

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.640
people.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:39.339
Alternate reality games like this really do
blur the line. They blur the line between

00:12:39.339 --> 00:12:44.699
story and game. You have, essentially, a series
of riddles and puzzles and treasure hunts,

00:12:44.699 --> 00:12:51.550
that unlike a story, which the players then
tell to each other online. So in a sense,

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.160
they become the owners of it.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:13:00.110
And at the same time, they blur the line between
fiction and reality. You have real events

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:07.110
taking place in a fictional world, except
that it can't be fictional because we're in

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:15.699
it. And it's not on-screen or on stage. It's
happening all around us. Finally, it blurs

00:13:15.699 --> 00:13:18.620
the line between marketing and entertainment.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:25.850
It's fun, but it also builds a lot of excitement
about whatever it is that it's connected to,

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:32.721
whether it's Year Zero or subsequently, 42
did one for The Dark Knight. And in fact,

00:13:32.721 --> 00:13:40.279
one of the first alternate reality games was
commissioned by Microsoft for the release

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:41.360
of Halo 2.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:47.689
That was called "I Love Bees." And the person
who did that, Chris DiCesare is also gonna

00:13:47.689 --> 00:13:55.770
join us in a few minutes. He was at Microsoft
Games Studio at the time and he told me when

00:13:55.770 --> 00:14:00.699
I was interviewing him for the book that he
thought he might get fired over this.

00:14:00.699 --> 00:14:06.290
He was spending a million dollars in an unproven
medium for a marketing effort that he couldn't

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:12.350
even admit existed. And yet, its success was
supposed to be measured in the amount of publicity

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:18.290
it drew. So, actually he didn't get fired,
but he did end up at Google some time later.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:23.639
[audience chuckles]
So, we'll hear from him. And finally, I did

00:14:23.639 --> 00:14:30.120
a story about a year after that about Hollywood
getting into the whole idea of web video.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:38.889
This was as a result of the writer's strike
largely. Film and television writers obviously

00:14:38.889 --> 00:14:43.410
doing the strike, they couldn't write for
film or television, but they could write for

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:44.410
the web.

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:51.079
So, a lot of them did. And I came across a
lot of people, or several people, who had

00:14:51.079 --> 00:14:56.740
started off as TV writers and they'd gone
into video games, working for Activision,

00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:03.730
working for electronic arts, which of course
is a huge studio in Playa Vista. And they

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:07.100
were wondering how you could really combine
the two.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:12.509
That's what their motivation was in doing
this. And at the same time, there was another

00:15:12.509 --> 00:15:19.230
question, which was, how do you pay for these
things? They didn't have a big enough audience

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:27.810
really to be supported by conventional commercials.
And the infrastructure for that wasn't even

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:30.709
in place at that point anyway.

00:15:30.709 --> 00:15:37.180
So, what happened was you had a lot of product
placement. You had what has come to be known

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:44.160
as "branded entertainment," where brands and
storytellers got together and did something.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:53.430
So we have a couple of people here also who
are experts in that in one form or another.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:58.879
Paul Woolmington from Naked Communications,
a branding agency that's based in London,

00:15:58.879 --> 00:16:04.410
has a big office here and many other places
in the world. And Ted Hope, who's one of the

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:09.709
leading indie producers in the US, indie film
producers. He's produced such films as "21

00:16:09.709 --> 00:16:16.949
Grams," "The Laramie Project," "American Splendor,"
and the list goes on.

00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:24.769
So, the final question I want to get back
to is, why does all this matter? Why is storytelling

00:16:24.769 --> 00:16:31.660
so important? Why is it so basic to us? I
think it's because stories put information

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:39.050
in a framework. They're essentially processing
mechanisms. They create a signal within the

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:40.569
noise.

00:16:40.569 --> 00:16:48.449
And that's how we process information. We
can--. We're capable of following instructions.

00:16:48.449 --> 00:16:56.089
We can use a recipe. We can go through a checklist.
We can follow a set of instructions, but we're

00:16:56.089 --> 00:17:03.279
not really that good at it because we're not
particularly methodical creatures.

00:17:03.279 --> 00:17:09.520
Instruction sets are essentially lists, and
lists are very hard to learn. Stories are

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:14.320
easy to learn because they're easy to grab
on to. They're a way to store memories, which

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:22.200
is why I think that it's fair to say that
stories are to humans as algorithms are to

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.240
machines.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:30.340
So, that's where we stand. It's 2011. We think
we live on internet time, but that's really

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:36.210
just things coming at us. It doesn't have
anything to do with our ability to process

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:43.910
it. And the truth is we're still groping towards
something new. It's really an essential and

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:48.370
completely exciting phase, I think.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:54.190
But we might as well be trying to make movies
in 1911. You know, people were feeling pretty

00:17:54.190 --> 00:18:04.570
good about it back then, too. Nickelodeon
is so 1908. It figured out movie stars. They'd

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:12.280
mastered the jump cut and the fade. But spoken
dialogue was still years away and color, it

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:17.040
was hard to even imagine what color would
look like.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:23.510
So, who's going to figure this one out? Who's
going to take the next step; construct a new

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:30.180
grammar of storytelling for us now? When we
know that, I think we'll know how this meta-story

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:39.210
is going to end. Thank you.

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:49.750
[applause]
[freight elevator sounds] [Frank Rose chuckles]

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:58.360
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: So, as we smoothly transition
into this next part of the [chuckles]--. I'm

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.780
Paul Woolmington of Naked Communications.
And Frank has eloquently introduced all of

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:06.520
us, so I'm not gonna do all those boring introductions.
[freight elevator sounds in background]

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:12.960
I feel like a giant lorry's about to crash
through the--. Anyway, Janine asked if I would

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:18.820
very informally moderate and all assist the
conversation. And I think the rule number

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:25.390
one is to really just keep out of the way
and let the conversation flow. So, I just

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.750
wanted to maybe kick off.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.170
And we'll try and leave a little time for
obviously audience participation and I'm sure

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:36.490
you've got some questions which might elaborate
on Frank's early point. So, I just wanted

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:42.610
to kick off with Susan. Susan, it occurred
to me that you have been doing this, trying

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:50.990
to figure this out for longer than most from
what Frank was saying.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:57.190
Any observations from you where we stand today?
Because we were just, even the discourse we

00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:01.140
had a little earlier, you were saying like,
Twitter didn't exist but a few years ago and

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:07.081
you were doing some of these amazing transmedia,
whatever you wanna call it, narratives way

00:20:07.081 --> 00:20:08.081
before that.

00:20:08.081 --> 00:20:16.020
But just any observations from when you first
started producing amazing nonlinear stories

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.080
to where it stands today?

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:23.260
&gt;&gt;Susan Bonds: Well, absolutely. So, I think
it is really this kind of strange juxtaposition

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:28.290
of the fact that storytelling is as old as
anything that we can remember. And it's at

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:31.120
a central part of our life and it's something
that people don't have to teach us.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:36.680
We all know how to tell a story. I'm sure
you guys can tell a good story here. So, it's

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:43.990
like something that's really part of who we
are and combining that with the fact that

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:50.590
not only is technology moving at a rapid pace,
but also the way we interact as a society,

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:54.710
the way we interact in our social groups,
the way we interact with each other, the fact

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:59.670
that we're now all connected, which is something
I don't have to explain to this room.

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:05.500
So, I think that we tried to approach it from
the viewpoint of wherever we are, it's an

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:11.510
opportunity. It's an opportunity to tell a
story that connects people. And the fact that

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:17.380
we are so connected actually is an opportunity
in itself. The one thing that was true ten

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:22.520
years ago, and is true today, is that the
web gives you instant feedback.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:27.810
So, as a creative storyteller, you have to
deal with that. And when you let people into

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:32.650
your world and into your story, you then have
to deal with their expectations. So, I think

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:37.400
overall, if you look over the past decade,
people's expectations have grown significantly.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:42.150
[audience member's phone alarm beeps]
And now, what used to be surprising and novel

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:48.440
is expected. And if you don't do that, then
bad mark on you. So, it's interesting to see

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:54.080
how things have evolved and I don't know if
you guys probably felt like I did when you

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.970
saw the social network. It's like, that was
2004? [laughs lightly]

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:03.990
Oh, my God. It's like the world has changed
so fast and again, what happens here at Google

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:10.141
it's like keeping up with it is in one sense
it's challenging, but in the other sense it's

00:22:10.141 --> 00:22:15.390
natural. This is a natural evolution. That's
why anybody can do it. It's because it's just

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:16.390
the way things are going.

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:17.590
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Chris, do you?

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:22.280
&gt;&gt;Chris Di Cesare: The thing that I think
is interesting is just as time has gone on,

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:32.560
how brands have learned how they have to accept
the consumer participation dialogue in the

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.670
process.

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:40.340
And I worked a lot on YouTube. One of the
stories that I remember--and this is a little

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:46.290
different than storytelling but it goes back
to that--I remember that whole Diet Coke Mentos

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:55.330
spots, when those videos first appeared and
they, how the brands dealt with that so differently.

00:22:55.330 --> 00:23:01.310
Like, Mentos just shipped boxes of Mentos
to the guys behind it, where Diet Coke was

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:06.600
like, "OK, we gotta stop this. We have this.
[Ted Hope and Paul Woolmington laugh] They're

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:11.790
fucking with our brand over here. We can't
have that." So, and I think brands now, they

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:16.230
have to figure out how to have them participate
in that process. It's just an evolution.

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:19.950
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: It was an interesting
inflection point, wasn't it? That classic

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:27.050
people going white-knuckles in the Coke board
room. And Mentos on the opposite were like,

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:29.150
they were going, "Yay! We're the little guys."

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:30.190
&gt;&gt;Chris Di Cesare: Exactly.

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:35.860
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: And the Coke guys going,
"Oh my God, what exploding Coke." I'm gonna

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:40.100
quote from Frank's book, a lovely little quote
that I actually used in presentation, I was

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:44.480
telling him. "In a command and control world,
we know who is telling the story, it's the

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.480
author.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:49.580
But digital media and this new era has created
an authorship crisis. Once the audience is

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:54.530
free to step into the fiction and start directing
events, the entire edifice of the 20th Century

00:23:54.530 --> 00:24:00.790
mass media begins to crumble." But I-I- Ted,
you've been deeply involved and obviously

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:04.420
working with writers and incredible directors
and actors.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:11.290
I just wondered, what excites you about this
blurred line between audience and author?

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:17.910
Any comments? Any thoughts about how that
inflection point has changed your world, or

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:18.910
might?

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:24.550
&gt;&gt;Ted Hope: Quite a few. It's interesting,
I think, that the brands are actually far

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:31.080
more progressive than the artists or authors
are. In terms of what's attracted me to whether

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:39.670
it's transmedia, deep media, storytelling,
part of it is trying to confront the superabundance

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:43.170
of stories, of content that's out there.

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:51.450
Friends of mine who worked in the film festival
submission world clocked it at around, they

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:55.210
thought that around about 45 thousand titles
are generated a year.

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:56.210
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Wow.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:00.620
&gt;&gt;Ted Hope: Forty-five thousand titles and
the US market currently is thought to be able

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:08.190
to consume about 600 theatrical titles a year,
of which 125 are studios. Which means that

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:15.450
the available market share for the world supply
is 1% a year of the world's supply.

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:21.670
And that's this year. Next year, there's still
another 44,400 films that weren't seen. So,

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:28.760
it's down to 0.55%. And then you look at how
fast the past is digitized on top of that.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:34.110
You could live,you could say today, "I wanna
live in 1968," and do that more fully than

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:38.821
you could in 1968 and just see content from
that.

00:25:38.821 --> 00:25:39.821
[Paul Woolmington laughs]

00:25:39.821 --> 00:25:48.480
As a filmmaker and as an artist, how do I
get my films seen? And to think that the feature

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:55.360
film form, even quality storytelling, even
corporately-backed quality storytelling is

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:59.650
enough to get traction with the global audience
is foolish.

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:07.000
The one advantage I have to somebody like
Kurosawa, a far better storyteller than I,

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.810
is that I'm not dead.

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:11.240
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: You've got one advantage.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:17.000
&gt;&gt;Ted Hope: That's it. I can make my stories
penetrate deeper in many different ways, but

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.350
when I start talking to the directors and
writers that I work with and I say, "You know?

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:27.130
This bit of the script, I don't actually think
we should provide that plot point. I think

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:31.720
we should keep it a little open-ended here
and not try to spell this out so that later

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.150
we can have an opening to go back to."

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:37.360
They kinda look at me and, "who goes back

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.740
[Paul Woolmington laughs]

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:45.040
to do that?" "What are you talking about?"
"Well, maybe it's gonna be someone in the

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:52.290
audience, that goes --." And it just stops.
And it's so hard to try to start to get people

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:57.880
to start to look at like, how do we start
making these films be a two-way street where

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.100
there's a place that people can participate?

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:07.140
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Frank, I mean, I'd love
to bring you back in at this point on that;

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:15.110
the blurred line between author and audience.
I mean, at what point will there be an inflection

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:20.840
point on the demise of the mass media 'cause
obviously we've got a lot of Googlers here?

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:34.290
&gt;&gt;Frank Rose: Right. I think that if anything,
the people who are doing the kind of thing

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:44.610
that I'm talking about often err on the side
of abdicating the storytelling. And the people,

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:53.900
as you were saying, Ted, who are more used
to doing a much more traditional form of storytelling

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.690
take it the opposite way.

00:27:56.690 --> 00:28:03.590
I think that the only reason that people become
interested in a story in the first place is

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:12.030
because it's a great story, whether it's Star
Wars, whether it's Avatar, whether it's Harry

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:19.510
Potter. The question, the trick really becomes
how do you balance that and how do you leave

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:22.130
out things that you were saying, Ted.

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:28.930
How do you leave openings for the audience
to come in? I had this conversation with Damon

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:32.900
Lindelof and Carlton Cuse when I was interviewing
them for the book. They were the show runners,

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:41.420
of course, of Lost. And what they said was
that they felt that the show gave the illusion

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:45.920
of interactivity, but in fact wasn't really.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:53.700
But in a way that wasn't entirely true because
what happened with that story, I mean, number

00:28:53.700 --> 00:29:02.080
one, that was an extremely controlled bit
of storytelling. It went on for six years.

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:11.330
It was an extremely selective release of information.
And it was so complicated that essentially

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:13.610
what happened was the audience had to get
together online just to figure out what the

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:14.610
story was.

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:15.610
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Yeah.

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:22.450
&gt;&gt;Frank Rose: So, you had things like Lostpedia,
which was specifically founded by, started

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:28.560
by some guy who, in Anchorage, Alaska, who
had watched the entire first season in a couple

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.760
of nights before the second season started.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:38.860
And then he watched the first show of the
second season and he had a complete WTF moment.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:39.860
[laughter]

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:51.150
And so, he went online to find out what was
going on and he didn't find anything except

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:58.760
a few discussion threads. And so, he decided
to start a wiki on it. And he was familiar

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:06.630
enough with the Wikipedia software that he
had it up and running in about six hours.

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:13.530
And now it's in 19 or 20 languages. There
are thousands of articles. It's extraordinary.

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:21.730
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Yeah. No, that's great.
Chris, I was gonna bring you in at this point

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:27.110
a bit more that having worked obviously at
Microsoft, having been a marketeer, having

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:32.150
I guess also participated in creating something
with Susan back along.

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:37.870
I was just wondering what do you think that
computer and video games, why that had such

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:43.020
a disruptive influence on the overall entertainment
industry? 'Cause obviously, we still talk

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:46.270
about Hollywood--and of course everyone knows
the statistic--

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:54.270
Hollywood gets the lion's share of the ink,
but gaming has long since passed it in terms

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:59.190
of gross revenues. And how is that obviously
changing the way we do things?

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:06.140
&gt;&gt;Chris Di Cesare: I think video games are
just the evolution of our time. I mean, first

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:11.720
and foremost it just puts you at the center
of the experience. So, being able to live

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:17.700
that role provides that degree of immersiveness
that I think everyone's striving towards.

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:22.090
I mean, I think that's touched on in the book.
Like, everyone wants go deeper, get closer

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:26.820
to the characters and so forth. And it's one
of these things where I think people in video

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:31.430
games admire the storytellers in Hollywood
and the Hollywood guys kinda go, "Oh, I wanna

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:33.730
be more, kinda closer to the game."

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:38.710
And they both battle it out to figure out
which way it's going. I think in gaming in

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:45.870
general, just as technology is advanced, you're
able to add. the characters have had more

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:51.530
dimension to them so that, like a category
unto itself, like a shooter, right? In the

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:54.580
past, all the shooters were the same, just
blow things up.

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:59.580
But now, you're able to tell more richer,
deeper stories. And I think that was the thing

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:05.681
like on Halo, the property I was involved
with. It was similar to Star Wars in a way

00:32:05.681 --> 00:32:10.960
where they didn't think of themselves as creating
a game. They were thinking of creating a universe,

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.010
first and foremost, that people could play
in.

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:17.880
And I think now as technology has advanced,
you can see that get closer to the characters.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:24.030
And you see it happen when a video game can
now sell, have bestselling books and so forth.

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:26.030
They wanna get closer to it.

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:29.990
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Susan, just to pick up
on that because obviously a lot the activities

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:37.100
you've created have a lot of play. I mean,
clearly there's players inherent in everything

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.630
that you're doing, but how do,

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:46.050
do you codify this? Do you think about these
spurs, these behavioral spurs? Or, is it sort

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:50.720
of? Tell us a little bit about the creative
process that you go through. I mean, are there

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:56.190
any examples you can give, or whether you
have methodologies that you use at these different

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:57.190
inflection points?

00:32:57.190 --> 00:33:03.200
&gt;&gt;Susan Bonds: Well, so just to echo what
Chris is saying, I think when you watch a

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:08.390
story and you see the knight save the village
or get the girl, it's like, "Well, I wanna

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:11.920
be that person. I wanna be the hero of the
story."

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:15.880
I mean, we all remember The Matrix when Neo
got the package and he ripped it open and

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:21.300
there's a phone and it says, "Follow the white
rabbit." And you're like, "I wanna do that."

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:25.540
And that was one of our goals was just to
essentially create that moment, that Matrix

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:29.360
moment, where the phone rings, you're given
instructions and then you're off.

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:34.710
You have no idea where you're going. So, as
part of the Year Zero project that Frank was

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:43.100
mentioning, we had created a world that was
obviously being sent back in pieces, 15 years

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:48.410
from the future. And the players were deciphering
it and putting it together. What's the vision

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:49.410
of this world?

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:54.300
In a way, it was like narrative archeology.
We're getting these shards, these little bits

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:59.900
of glimpses of digital media that are reflective
of the society of the day. Well, what were

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:04.510
those people like? What are the issues they're
dealing with? And as part of that, we wanted

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:10.520
to transfer that somehow a sense of urgency
to today.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:16.510
So, one of the things that we did is that
we introduced the idea that in the future,

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:21.860
you were gonna lose things that were very
basic to you. And that one of the ways that

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:27.970
people were fighting back was through art.
And one of the messages was the fact that

00:34:27.970 --> 00:34:32.860
you have a voice and you don't have to necessarily
agree with me, but you just need to speak

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:33.860
up.

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:39.280
And this was something that people could hold
on to that had relevance for them. So, I think

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:45.800
that in the video game genre, you can be the
hero, but if you can somehow make it relevant

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:52.399
to the point where you now see the world through
the game layer, or the alternate reality or

00:34:52.399 --> 00:34:55.659
whatever it is that you put over it, then
you have a win because you're really giving

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:59.710
people a different point of reference which
they have a very personal connection to.

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:04.540
It's like, "Well, I'm the hero of this story
and it's making me think about this." And

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:11.000
so, I think that's a good example of how if
you create that personal moment, I do agree

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.120
that there has to be a balance between a story
that you're, I would say this, a world that

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:20.490
you're creating that's fully realized in detail
that people can play.

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:24.970
And then you give them a path through that
or give them the tools to really add value

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:26.200
to the world.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.150
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Yeah, Ted?

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:36.170
&gt;&gt;Ted Hope: It's curious. The films that I've
done are independent films, which probably

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:44.890
the best way to describe it is really in personal
tales, real life, raw emotion. And as I've

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:51.770
wanted to explore a different way of telling
stories, I've moved more into some genre topics

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:56.250
of superheroes and horror, mostly because
it's in sci-fi.

00:35:56.250 --> 00:36:03.030
It allows you more free reign, but I've continued
to try to strive to try to figure out how

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:11.750
you can expand beyond a feature film narrative
within a more traditional story. And a lot

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:17.440
of the films that I've made have had unsympathetic
characters at their center, that I've always

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:24.190
been drawn to how films create empathy, how
you can start to understand somebody who you

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:30.140
normally wouldn't ever want to be in contact
with in other situations.

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:37.720
And as I start to push the writers and directors
that I work with to really try to consider

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:45.770
a multi-platform mode of storytelling, we
often will say, "OK, do these supporting characters.

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:53.990
Can we do a Rosencrantz and Guildenstern device
and focus a little bit on a supporting character?"

00:36:53.990 --> 00:37:00.190
We had a film this year that won Best Director
at the Sundance Film Festival called "Martha

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:07.410
Marcy May Marlene." And it's a story of a
young woman who had been abducted into a cult.

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:13.650
And as the movie opens, she escapes and reunites
with her sister who she was estranged from,

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:17.170
but her mind's been blown and she's suspecting
the cult's coming to get her.

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:21.500
And well, you'll have to go see the movie
when it comes out this fall.

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.500
[laughter]

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:27.720
But before we ever did that, I kept pushing
the filmmakers to try to write five short

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:34.460
pieces about the different members of the
cult. I got one done. But we made a short

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:35.460
film.

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:41.350
And kinda it's curious when you think of the
different levels of audiences. Some audiences

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:47.110
want to drill down really deep and really
engage. For me, as a producer, my audiences

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:51.550
frequently start with the financiers. And
then the actors. And then the distributors.

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:53.180
How do I reach them?

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:58.780
And so, this short was made for the audience
of the film festivals in some ways. We made

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:04.310
this short film with some of the characters
we cast in the feature film in the same story

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:10.640
world that we later made the feature in. And
it went to Sundance. It went to the New York

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:11.640
Film Festival.

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:17.380
It won a prize in Cannes. And that's exactly
the path that the feature now is going because

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:24.330
it introduced, it was the discovery mechanism
for that audience of how they came to discover

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:32.300
this filmmaker and this story. And I think
that trying to come up with ways that we do

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:40.210
it in a non-genre context where it isn't the
glimpse of a futuristic world, or the threat,

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:43.580
or things that run on more gaming principles.

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:52.560
How do we encourage engagement across platform
without necessarily using game mechanics is

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:58.570
another place where there's gonna be a lot
of growth and a lot of soul searching in some

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:00.870
ways of trying to figure out. So, if you can
figure that part out, Susan.

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:01.870
[laughter]

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:02.870
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Susan?

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:07.930
&gt;&gt;Susan Bonds: Wow. So, I think of, I understand
what you're saying about telling personal

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:12.580
stories and certainly about unsympathetic
characters, but we've always tried to, and

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:19.070
this isn't a game theory, this is a storytelling
principle, it's like, "We'll figure out something

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:22.070
that resonates with everyone."

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:27.950
For example, when I was working with Chris
and we were talking about Halo, it was more

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:32.320
than just--. Well, first of all they had built
this fully-realized world. So if it's how

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:38.140
to make it personal to us. And the idea came
up about telling a War of the Worlds story

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:42.990
because we've all thought of that moment of
what if something unexpected happens?

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:47.320
What do you do? How do you handle it? Obviously,
that was the whole beauty of War of the Worlds

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:52.930
is it felt like it was really happening. So,
how do we take that and modernize it? And--

00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:56.210
&gt;&gt;Ted Hope: But I would actually say that
the whole beauty, and I think this is something

00:39:56.210 --> 00:40:00.690
that Frank hits in his book, is actually that
it was a trick, which made it a story that

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:07.470
we could pass on. So, my son knows of War
of the Worlds as a prank. And that's so exciting

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:10.430
to him that somebody could've pranked the
nation.

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:11.820
&gt;&gt;Susan Bonds: Pranked the nation.

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:12.820
[laughter]

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:15.840
I think Google could prank the nation. I'm
waiting for that.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:19.830
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Chris Di Cesare: But the thing is, I think,

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:26.320
like a lot of it is the--. So, in the ARGs
or in the War of the Worlds premise as a whole,

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:34.640
what's interesting is that you have this umbrella
story, but the real thing that drives it is

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:40.880
not the story itself I find, but the stories
from the participants and their engagement,

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.270
their involvement in the actual process.

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:48.970
Like, for the I Love Bees thing, people, they
didn't talk about like what was the story

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:52.380
that they talked about like War of the Worlds.
It was more like, "Well, there's this guy

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:58.350
who's battling a hurricane in order to get
to a pay phone in order to pick up the phone

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:00.900
'cause the story had to go on."

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:06.760
These human stories became what drove it because
it was a unique way of telling stories.

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:10.300
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Frank, any thoughts on
that?

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:16.210
&gt;&gt;Frank Rose: I think that, I mean, one of
the things I was really fascinated by when

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:19.071
I was working on the book was I did a series
of interviews with Howard Roffman, who's in

00:41:19.071 --> 00:41:24.770
charge of the Star Wars Expanded Universe
at Lucas Film.

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:32.980
And essentially, although we didn't exactly
talk about it in these terms, what we got

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:38.690
into was a whole idea of story worlds. I mean,
that's a phrase that's become a bit more popularized

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:45.530
now. But what he was saying was that George
Lucas, when he was first making the films,

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:55.260
when he started making the films, he created
this, what Lucas called an "immaculate reality."

00:41:55.260 --> 00:42:02.370
He realized every detail. And he didn't do
that, Howard pointed out, because he thought

00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:08.080
you could spin stories off of it, spin more
stories off of it. He did it because that's

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:12.950
what you have to do in order to make something
seem real when the whole thing is made-up,

00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:19.640
when there is no Planet Tatooine, there are
no moisture farmers--

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.750
&gt;&gt;Susan Bonds: What?

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:22.750
[laughter]

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:25.260
&gt;&gt;Frank Rose: I'm sorry.

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:26.260
[laughter]

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:33.400
We'll talk later. But ultimately what happened
was that because the world that he created

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:41.090
was so incredibly rich in detail, it meant
that there were all of these sort of handholds

00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:44.820
that you could grab onto and use to spin more
stories off of.

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.770
I was just fascinated by that. I always thought
that was a great--.

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:55.630
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Frank and I played this
game a little while ago, a month or so ago,

00:42:55.630 --> 00:43:03.270
and I just wanted to bring Ted in on this
one. OK. In a storytelling duel, who in your

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:09.330
opinion would win, Dickens, Lucas, Spielberg,
or J.J. Abrams?

00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:10.680
[Ted laughs]

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.630
Or you can add who you think could--.

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:24.690
&gt;&gt;Ted Hope: It's, I think in the same sort
of way, the folks who make the biggest myths,

00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:32.520
whether it's the Grimm Brothers, Greek mythology,
the Bible, any of those things that allow

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:38.150
people to take for themselves and spin again,
works really well.

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:43.850
So, the folks that were a little less hung
up on their own authorship, I think, actually

00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:51.840
probably wins because they generate more stories,
whether they're the pen or not would be my

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:59.560
argument. So, maybe not those folks at all.
Folks who had maybe a slight lesser output

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:05.500
themselves, but allowed other people to take
those tales and run with it.

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:12.830
And I think it's, part of the problem is that
we still hold up these big storytelling Gods

00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:21.000
and link their name. And yet, in terms of
the filmmakers, for the most part, you could

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.410
argue that what Lucas later,

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:28.760
ultimately what Lucas has created, extends
well beyond the features in a much stronger

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:38.380
way. But the dominance of the feature film
form as a prime financial vehicle, I think,

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:44.570
has limited people's ability to launch new
characters, to not launch new worlds.

00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:54.550
And as we start to, as filmmakers loosen up
and can see themselves more as a brand that

00:44:54.550 --> 00:45:01.530
can speak in different formats across different
genres in different time lengths. They can

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:08.360
put out all of these little pieces. And to
me, the beauty of a story that you start today,

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:15.490
but I don't actually plan to finish or actually
make my main component of it for 15 years

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:19.470
from now, that to me is a great challenge
and a great glory.

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:24.800
That's the duel that I'd love to challenge
those great masters to 'cause they were stuck

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:29.440
in a dominant form. And I think that right
now, we're at the point where that's really

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:34.750
breaking down. In terms of film, the dominance
of the feature film, I think, has ended.

00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:40.840
We haven't seen the results of it, but we're
right there. That's what has occurred over

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:41.840
the last couple years.

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.291
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: An observation to pick
up on what you were saying is, inherent in

00:45:43.291 --> 00:45:53.220
what you were saying, is we have this muscle
memory that's built into all of ourselves.

00:45:53.220 --> 00:46:00.530
And we have this sense of control. Part of
that is this sense of ownership and/or control.

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:06.760
But how do we release this muscle memory?
Is it just gonna happen through the participation

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:13.940
of audiences? Through the loosening of social
media 'cause people are gonna change the way

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:19.340
their behavior acts? Is it gonna happen from
ground up, so to speak?

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:25.530
I mean, is that what we're seeing? I mean,
Susan, what are your thoughts on the muscle

00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:29.040
memory issue 'cause you've probably come up
against it many times,how to break through.

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:34.060
&gt;&gt;Susan Bonds: Definitely. I mean, I love
movies. I'll just have to tell you that. I

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:38.100
mean, I think when we were growing up, it's
like we all have had that experience where

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:39.630
we lost ourself in a world.

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:45.650
And I think one of the things that all the
people certainly on that list have is this.

00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:52.780
We've all left their media daydreaming in
those worlds because they were so fully realized.

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:56.100
We could actually put ourselves in it. So,
I actually think, and someone has said this

00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:58.920
before, that I think it's the meeting in the
middle.

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:06.430
We still need great storytellers and I think
YouTube has probably proven without a shadow

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:08.390
of a doubt that we're not all great storytellers.

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:09.390
[laughter]

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:10.390
Can I say that authoritatively?

00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:12.050
&gt;&gt;Chris Di Cesare: You can say that.

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:13.050
&gt;&gt;Susan Bonds: OK.

00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:14.050
&gt;&gt;Chris Di Cesare: There's a few.

00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:20.200
&gt;&gt;Susan Bonds: So, we need this creative force
coming and bringing these fully realized worlds

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:27.230
to us. But I also agree adamantly with Ted,
which is, if these creative forces can loosen

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:33.650
up a little bit, there's ways to let people
into your world that really can add value.

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:39.610
And so, I think Ted mentioned that War of
the Worlds told over pay phones was a trick,

00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:43.460
but that's how we got everybody's attention.
That how we got above the noise. 'Cause sometimes,

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:47.280
you can have a great idea, but you still gotta
get people to know about it.

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:52.200
&gt;&gt;Ted Hope: But my point was the pleasure
was that it was a trick. That people love

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:58.970
that in terms of like, that moment that they
guy had in Anchorage, Alaska, a place where

00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:02.410
you don't get to go out and certain things
are still legal, [Frank Rose laughs] so you

00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:07.230
have other things that help lead you to that
kind of WTF moment. [Susan Bonds laughs]

00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:08.470
&gt;&gt;Frank Rose: Right.

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:15.470
&gt;&gt;Ted Hope: We've reached a point, I think,
in our muscle memory of how we receive stories.

00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:19.310
My ten-year old looks at Dr. Who and says,
"Oh, I understand the code." [panel members

00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:25.000
laugh heartily] And I'm like, "What?" It’s
like, "I understand the story code." He's

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.000
like--

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.360
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: How old is he?

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.910
&gt;&gt;Ted Hope: Yeah, like, that was like, how
I understood OK, you don't watch whatever

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:37.171
the children series was. And you're going
to have to start watching Torchwood once you

00:48:37.171 --> 00:48:38.920
get two digits? [Paul Woolmington laughs]
It's like, you're breaking it down too fast.

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:47.930
But that fact that we still do tell stories
as we did a hundred years ago in the movies,

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:50.369
in the beginning, middle, and an end.

00:48:50.369 --> 00:48:55.880
We recognize it when we see the hand gun in
the first act. It will go off in the third.

00:48:55.880 --> 00:49:00.260
And we understand that's way too programmed
and we no longer want that from that entertainment.

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:06.800
We need to have engineer the WTF moments when
someone says, "Oh my God. It's someone who's

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:09.080
insane who's directing this." How great is
that?

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:10.080
&gt;&gt;Frank Rose: Right.

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.080
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Chris?

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:12.610
&gt;&gt;Chris Di Cesare: I'm sorry, Frank.

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:19.930
&gt;&gt;Frank Rose: Yeah, I think that if I can
go back to Lost again, another thing that

00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:27.850
I had in this discussion with Damon and Carleton
was that they said that when fans come up

00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:35.320
to them and wanted to talk about the show,
they basically got two reactions.

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:43.780
And one was they wanted to be reassured that
the producers knew where the story was going.

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:49.190
That it was actually going to go somewhere.
And the other was that they wanted to have

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:55.130
some sense that they, the fans, could actually
influence the story. And as Damon and Carlton

00:49:55.130 --> 00:50:01.430
said, these two impulses are actually kind
of contradictory except that they're not entirely

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:02.430
contradictory.

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:12.670
The conversation bore out essentially. What
came out was that because television is such

00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:17.960
an iterative process, a TV series, unlike
a movie where obviously the whole thing is

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:22.930
made before anyone sees it. But with the television
shows, especially one that lasts over a period

00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:29.800
of years, there is a chance for the audience
to provide feedback if the producers are listening.

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:35.300
And certainly in the case of Lost, Damon and
Carlton were listening. And the example they

00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:44.640
gave me was these two low-lifes, Nikki and
Paulo, who appeared in I think it was the

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:47.850
middle of Season Three. And that was before
they had managed to set an end date for the

00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:48.850
series.

00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:54.650
So, the producers had no idea how long the
show was gonna have to go on and how long

00:50:54.650 --> 00:51:01.510
they were gonna have to spin this out. And
so, they introduced these characters and the

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:06.040
audience viewers just went, "Wait a minute.
We've been watching this show for two and

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:09.560
a half years and suddenly two new survivors
show up?"

00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:14.040
Number one. And number two, "We don't like
these people at all. They're slimy and get

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:15.240
them out of here."

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:16.240
&gt;&gt;Susan Bonds: Rejected.

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:21.220
&gt;&gt;Frank Rose: Right. So, the fans rejected,
the audience rejected the new characters.

00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:31.590
And what Carlton said was they listened to
this. They heard this. And they said, "OK,

00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:35.520
you want us to get rid of these people. All
right. We'll not only kill them, we'll fucking

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:39.510
bury them alive." And that's what they did
in the show.

00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:40.510
[laughter]

00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:45.040
&gt;&gt;Chris Di Cesare: It's funny. One thing around
that in terms of participation, like sometimes

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:51.130
you can let the people driving the experience
can listen too closely and that can screw

00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:52.520
you up, too.

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:53.520
&gt;&gt;Frank: Right.

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:59.880
&gt;&gt;Chris Di Cesare: Like, the first ARG, The
Beast was this program that we did where you

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:06.520
end up like the vocal minority. Of course,
it's going to give you more feedback then

00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:12.470
you'll ever wanna deal with. And then you
start chasing after the pleas that point zero

00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:20.009
zero one percent of the audience and then
you end up alienating everyone else.

00:52:20.009 --> 00:52:24.531
So, I think that's one of the biggest challenges
in this participatory way. As, how do you

00:52:24.531 --> 00:52:30.600
balance with the audience, even the guy who
doesn't speak up? But they probably outnumber

00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:32.010
the people that do.

00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:37.450
&gt;&gt;Frank Rose: Right. Exactly. And another
example of this is Dickens, who of course

00:52:37.450 --> 00:52:47.800
wrote all of his novels as serials. They came
out monthly. And he had barely finished writing

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:57.120
one series of chapters before he had to start
on the next one. And so, that was a very iterative

00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:58.210
process as well.

00:52:58.210 --> 00:53:05.350
And he listened very carefully to his readership.
He didn't always do what they wanted him to

00:53:05.350 --> 00:53:15.310
do. In "The Old Curiosity Shop," when it became
apparent little Nell was not really going

00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:22.010
to make it much longer, people went nuts.
And there were practically riots on the street.

00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:29.040
There was a ship that landed in New York from
England. This was a time when information

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:33.950
traveled a little more slowly than it does
now. And it was met on the docks by a crowd

00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:37.160
of people saying, "Is little Nell dead?"

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:38.160
[laughter]

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:45.840
And so, in that case, obviously, Dickens did
not listen to his readership. He knew what

00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:51.610
would make a good story. And he knew that
as much as his readers said they didn’t

00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:57.359
want little Nell to die, secretly they did.
[panel members chuckle] And, but there were

00:53:57.359 --> 00:54:02.930
other stories where at times when the story
wasn't going as well, like "Martin Chuzzlewit"

00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:08.800
for example, when he did listen very carefully
to the audience, to the readers.

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:16.859
And so, I think that's part of it. You have
to know when to listen and when not to.

00:54:16.859 --> 00:54:23.070
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: I have to weave marketing
in here a little bit because obviously it's

00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:30.280
interesting. My observation is that there's
a dearth of good work coming out of the marketing

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:36.330
industry around, you know, liberating themselves
out of the way they've always done things.

00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:42.900
Why do we think that is? Is it again back
to the same old adage that you've got the

00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:50.760
same people with the same sort of muscle memory
producing the work? And what is it gonna take

00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:52.160
to break out of that?

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:56.380
Is it gonna require just different types of
teams? And again, I know you've touched on

00:54:56.380 --> 00:55:00.650
this a little bit, Susan, but you obviously
must work in a very creative environment but

00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:05.619
with really interesting multidisciplined--.
And I was also taken with what Chris was saying

00:55:05.619 --> 00:55:10.660
was 'cause also this level and the attention
to detail and the sort of detail that you

00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:17.080
need to go through is unlike the sort of detail
that we tend to look at when you're producing

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:18.080
marketing campaigns.

00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:23.590
And so, it's this different way of actually
building this whole ecosystem of, and also

00:55:23.590 --> 00:55:27.951
having that flexibility to respond to things
and not quite knowing where you're gonna need

00:55:27.951 --> 00:55:33.369
to go. But you've got the people and the resources,
or you're gonna jump on it, which again, is

00:55:33.369 --> 00:55:38.500
simply marketeers and more traditional storytellers
often aren't flexible. So, that's quite a

00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:41.420
long question, but it was weave in the whole
marketing thing.

00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:46.840
&gt;&gt;Susan Bonds: Well, coincidentally, where
we started was how can we do something to

00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:52.260
get the attention of the marketing adverse?
We now have the ability to program our lives.

00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:58.640
When we were first start talking about content
to come out on the web in the '90s, we were

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:02.359
like, "Oh, we'll just make programs and put
them online and at 8 o'clock on Tuesday people

00:56:02.359 --> 00:56:06.020
will show up." Well, people don't show up
because the internet is theirs, right?

00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:12.280
And you can do whatever you want with it.
Your phone is yours. Your tablet. It's like,

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:19.160
I can program my life. I can TiVo. I can whatever.
So, I think that if you look at the discontinuity

00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:26.210
or the sea change that's happened, I think
taking too long to embrace it is going to

00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:27.920
be fatal, right?

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:34.900
So, one thing is to recognize that the sea
has changed. So that's number one. And then

00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:40.761
number two is like, I think what we have seen
with the marriage of entertainment and marketing

00:56:40.761 --> 00:56:46.720
is that if you can take what is the great
attributes of the core property and you can

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:47.720
extend that out.

00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:53.020
And it's now possible to do. There's no better
marketing in the world. It's like, "Let's

00:56:53.020 --> 00:57:00.480
let people experience what your world or story
is." And that requires a tremendous different

00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:03.880
type of set-up than a traditional ad agency.

00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:07.220
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Well, and it's something
we're working on at Naked actually. It's I

00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:12.270
think psychology as long since understood
since Freud was out and cognitive behavioral

00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:19.920
psychology is in. And yet, a lot of marketing
still follows this theory of Freud theory,

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:25.781
which is keep asking the question "why?" and
we're gonna reflect as opposed to--.

00:57:25.781 --> 00:57:33.280
And I think what it's doing and essentially
it's one of the marketing golden rules was

00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:38.710
AIDA, Awareness drives Interest drives Desire
drives Action. But actually, the whole thing

00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:43.880
has now been flipped on its head. And if you
follow cognitive behavioral strategy or psychology

00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:46.730
and you say, "It's all about actions.

00:57:46.730 --> 00:57:53.260
It's all about these actions which actually
drive interest, desire, and then probably

00:57:53.260 --> 00:58:00.869
awareness." In that fashion. So, I think that's
also having a huge impact on the way in which--.

00:58:00.869 --> 00:58:07.540
And of course the digital age is social media
or digital is the perfect place for action,

00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:12.990
but it's how do we then take that action into
the traditional media and things like that?

00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:18.490
&gt;&gt;Ted Hope: I think what really starts to
change is where we really start to place the

00:58:18.490 --> 00:58:25.160
value on the communities that we create around
our stories. You know, much in the way Chris

00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:30.470
was saying with Bees and everything. People
wanted to hear the stories other people told.

00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:36.609
That's what kept bringing them back was the
social component. And when we do that, we

00:58:36.609 --> 00:58:42.741
get a little bit more distance from being
on-point, on-message. I have, a couple times,

00:58:42.741 --> 00:58:48.119
been able to get the marketing departments
in the film industry it's a real problem because

00:58:48.119 --> 00:58:50.869
no one wants to give up any piece of their
budget.

00:58:50.869 --> 00:58:59.120
On "Adventureland," a movie I did a couple
years back, we were able to get the marketing

00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:03.690
department of Miramax to give us money to
shoot additional content. We were in an amusement

00:59:03.690 --> 00:59:07.109
park. We had young actors who were booked
for the run of the show.

00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:13.840
And I got like two funnier guy directors to
come aboard and just well, invent stuff. And

00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:17.770
we made training videos for the amusement
park from the period.

00:59:17.770 --> 00:59:19.930
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Brilliant.

00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:29.020
&gt;&gt;Ted Hope: And we made a documentary. One
of the characters ran around hitting everyone

00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:33.080
in the balls and we did an anthropological
look at the different ways it's done and all

00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:36.820
of that. And we deliver this stuff that was
very funny.

00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:39.450
[laughter]
Miramax looked at it and they said, "This

00:59:39.450 --> 00:59:44.020
is not on-message. This is not on-point. We
don't know what to do." And I think that--

00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:45.020
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Yeah.

00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:49.490
&gt;&gt;Ted Hope: as we start to recognize the community,
we also recognize I'm not on-message all the

00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:51.800
time. I don't need it. I still like to go
back to that world. I relate to that character,

00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:55.660
not the one that was punching in the balls.

00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:56.660
The other, the Jesse Eisenberg one I related
more to. But, and it gives us that reason.

00:59:56.660 --> 01:00:02.420
If we put the value, if we say, "We built
this huge two and a half million people for

01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:09.270
Batman, we're not gonna let them go. We're
gonna keep them there and feed them more things."

01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:12.200
&gt;&gt;Susan Bonds: And actually, it was actually
11 million people who participated in The

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:16.640
Dark Knight because people wanna live in Gotham
City. And there were six decades of dreaming

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:17.640
about it.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:21.450
But I do think what you're saying is incredibly
important, which is the internet has provided

01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:26.430
us a tool to be very targeted. So like, I
watched Lost because I wanted Jack and Kate

01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:28.470
to get together, obviously.

01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:29.470
[laughter]

01:00:29.470 --> 01:00:33.810
Which I was able to clearly influence the
writers to make happen. But I mean, like other

01:00:33.810 --> 01:00:38.220
people are watching for completely different
reasons. And so, I think it gives you the

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:42.910
ability to say, "OK, well you're watching
for this reason, you for that one." We can

01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:47.359
give content to you that's not a trillion
dollars and we can make you feel like, "Oh,

01:00:47.359 --> 01:00:52.640
yeah. They're validating why I think this
material is cool. This world is cool."

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:57.240
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: So, I'm gonna ask the
panel one more question and then you guys

01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:01.080
please think of some really smart questions
'cause I'll then open it. Janine , are we

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.080
good on time?

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.080
&gt;&gt;Janine: Yeah.

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:06.950
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Yeah, great. I just wanted
to ask each of you, who's inspiring you at

01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:12.410
the moment? Or, what's inspiring you? Maybe
not just who, but what's inspiring you in

01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:17.540
what you're doing and how you're thinking
about new things, new books to write, Frank,

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:20.740
or work you're doing at Google, Chris.

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:25.700
And I'd just love to--. Maybe I'll start with
Frank 'cause you've got a furtive mind and

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:29.980
you're interviewing people. Is it who or is
it what?

01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:41.390
&gt;&gt;Frank Rose: Sure. I mean, this is sort of
odd, but I find that there's a whole generation

01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:47.390
for which the stuff that we're talking about
and trying to sort out just comes entirely

01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:55.550
naturally. And a few weeks ago, I had brunch
with this guy who was down from Boston who

01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:57.330
had just graduated from BU.

01:01:57.330 --> 01:02:07.770
His name is Nate Goldman. And he had done
a, he had spent two years as an undergrad,

01:02:07.770 --> 01:02:16.570
putting together for no credit or anything
this War of the Worlds type zombie experience

01:02:16.570 --> 01:02:20.970
[panel members chuckle]that took place over
a variety of different media. Primarily, his

01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:22.240
college radio station.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:29.180
Also he got people to dress up in the streets
and all kinds of stuff. And to him, this was

01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:37.490
just utterly natural. This was just how you
would do something like that. He did it without

01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:45.240
any particular resources, except for access
to the radio station. He had never heard of

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:52.790
transmedia or Henry Jenkins or my book or
anything until after it was over.

01:02:52.790 --> 01:02:56.960
[more chuckling]
And I thought that was brilliant.

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:58.220
[laughter]

01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:06.950
I thought this is, in a way, in my wildest
dreams I'm John the Baptist.

01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:07.950
[laughter]

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:09.440
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Chris.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:16.750
&gt;&gt;Chris Di Cesare: One thing, I guess who
I'm really impressed by. One thing on YouTube

01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:25.349
that I'm like, amazed by is that where the
top partners on YouTube, these guys who create

01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:32.040
these web series are amazing to me because
not only do they have to create the content,

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:33.040
they have to market the content.

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:38.700
They have to basically become this A-B-C,
but they're sitting in their bedroom creating

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:42.870
all this. [Paul Woolmington chuckles] And
some of them now are making big bucks. I mean,

01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:48.330
so just this and it's the same thing, they
probably have no idea when they started that

01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:52.130
that was they were gonna become a network
unto themselves.

01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:57.260
But people now that know that they not only
create the content, but how to foster and

01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:59.960
grow a community, I'm just amazed by.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.410
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Susan.

01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:08.490
&gt;&gt;Susan Bonds: So, just to echo what these
guys are saying, I think for me, what is inspiring

01:04:08.490 --> 01:04:15.500
to me is actually seeing people go after these
sacred silos and saying, "Well, I'm not going

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:23.589
to do it like that. I'm going to do it differently."
And I mean, I look at, I think they do quality

01:04:23.589 --> 01:04:27.820
programming at HBO, but they're also thinking
about what is it people really want.

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:33.140
And they're launching things that give people
access to content that is counterintuitive.

01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:37.310
You're like, "Well, if we give them access
to next week's episode this week, then who's

01:04:37.310 --> 01:04:41.820
gonna come back and watch it next week?" But
in fact, they're just feeding the frenzy because

01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:46.480
people feel like, "Oh. We are somehow participating
in all this quality entertainment that's coming

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:47.480
out."

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:51.369
But I think the thing I'm really looking for
is what we're saying, which is someone who

01:04:51.369 --> 01:04:57.340
is not in any way, no one foot, toe, finger,
whatever, stuck to the notion of traditional

01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.180
media models. They're just like, 'Well, we're
just gonna do it like this." And then everyone's

01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:03.940
gonna look and go, "Oh yeah. We were stuck
over here so we couldn't see that, but now

01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:06.369
that we see it, we can all go for that."

01:05:06.369 --> 01:05:15.660
&gt;&gt;Ted Hope: There's a lot of great work that's
being done out there that inspires me on a

01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:23.839
daily basis. The thing that I struggle with
most and what I'm always looking for is the

01:05:23.839 --> 01:05:29.190
folks who are willing to slow down to try
to tell a big story that in the independent

01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:34.109
world, people write this script and then they
think they can make a movie right away.

01:05:34.109 --> 01:05:39.619
I've been working for about three years with
a filmmaker named Lance Wiler, who is in some

01:05:39.619 --> 01:05:42.560
ways the most famous filmmaker that nobody
knows. But we've been doing a transmedia build,

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:50.390
working a long time on the script to make
sure that the story element of it truly holds

01:05:50.390 --> 01:06:01.359
up and has enough openings in it at the same
time that it can last for a much bigger world.

01:06:01.359 --> 01:06:07.390
And along the way, he's been willing to do
what he calls a lot of "story R&amp;D," things

01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:17.330
that he, whether they're events or installations
or films or apps. Putting things out into

01:06:17.330 --> 01:06:24.830
the community, letting people play with it.
Some of this, Frank touches in his book, emergent

01:06:24.830 --> 01:06:33.730
storytelling, emergent game play, really not
needing to succeed in making a masterwork

01:06:33.730 --> 01:06:38.270
of art at an early stage, but willing to let,
let's see how people play with it and try

01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:39.730
to adapt that.

01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:45.630
But really the part that for all of this tons
of visionary whatever he did at age 15, it

01:06:45.630 --> 01:06:54.560
didn't come my way in pill form. I really
wish that I had gotten hold of, but the thing

01:06:54.560 --> 01:07:01.700
that's really most impressive to me is the
willingness to, like, I don't have to produce

01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:02.780
it overnight. I don't need to be proclaimed
a genius.

01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:09.140
I don't need to win the Sundance Film Festival
and get picked up. I can actually try to manage

01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:18.589
something. I'm gonna engage a lot of people
and I'm gonna depend on the crowd for us to

01:07:18.589 --> 01:07:20.869
try to get it right. That to me is very inspiring.

01:07:20.869 --> 01:07:22.740
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Yeah. No, that's great.
My only comment would be to celebrate the

01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:27.130
brilliant misfits that sort of--. That's what
we try and say at Naked is we're always trying

01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:31.450
to hire the brilliant misfits. Clearly, everyone
wants brilliant people, but--

01:07:31.450 --> 01:07:33.230
&gt;&gt;Ted Hope: Good listing.

01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:34.230
[laughter]

01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:38.619
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Yeah, but anyway. That's
a nice segue because I know that there's,

01:07:38.619 --> 01:07:42.550
I think, some friends of Google in the audience
and certainly I think there's a number of

01:07:42.550 --> 01:07:44.960
people from, I think, brilliant misfits in
the audience 'cause I've had the pleasure

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:51.160
of working with the Creative Lab and some
of the amazing people are working there.

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:59.021
So, I'd love to throw it open to the audience
to obviously ask anyone any questions. I think

01:07:59.021 --> 01:08:03.910
there are microphones here, or we're a relatively
small audience, so just shout your question

01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:09.940
out if you've got any. Please.

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:57.940
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: I was talking
that I work with Lance and I've worked with

01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:01.259
him on a couple of projects and he definitely
gives up authorship and he starts small, which

01:09:01.259 --> 01:09:02.259
is fantastic.

01:09:02.259 --> 01:09:03.259
So, he's always tweaking things as he's going
through a process. I work for OgilvyEntertainment

01:09:03.259 --> 01:09:04.259
on trying to harness social media and gaming
for social change. And a wall I come up against

01:09:04.259 --> 01:09:05.259
daily is that social change isn't really exciting
to audiences at their core.

01:09:05.259 --> 01:09:06.259
What's exciting to people is conflict. But
obviously, I'm working with big brands and

01:09:06.259 --> 01:09:07.259
brands don't want to be associated with conflict.
So, what do you think about that?

01:09:07.259 --> 01:09:08.259
&gt;&gt;Susan Bonds: Well, I think that's--. I mean,
obviously lots of people are always coming

01:09:08.259 --> 01:09:11.949
to us saying, "How can we use this for good?"
And going back to where we were able to see

01:09:11.949 --> 01:09:16.480
in Year Zero, was you can't tell people what
to care about, but you can set up a construct

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:19.199
through which they see the world through different
eyes.

01:09:19.199 --> 01:09:24.159
But you're really at a conflict yourself,
because you just pointed it out. 'Cause great

01:09:24.159 --> 01:09:29.969
storytelling has conflict. So, you can't really
put someone else in someone else's shoes unless

01:09:29.969 --> 01:09:35.449
you create that drama. So, I mean, I believe
in that entertainment, like we've seen it.

01:09:35.449 --> 01:09:39.559
There's a million examples we can point to,
films that made us think differently about

01:09:39.559 --> 01:09:44.200
the world or an issue or a situation. So,
I think that this media is as well. You have

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:49.989
to stick true to good quality storytelling.
You have to put people in the world in the

01:09:49.989 --> 01:09:50.989
situation in the story.

01:09:50.989 --> 01:09:55.179
And you can't just expect them because it's
for good. You can't tell them what to care

01:09:55.179 --> 01:09:57.809
about. We can't tell you people what to care
about either. You know what I'm saying? It's

01:09:57.809 --> 01:10:02.170
like, "No, we're just gonna think for ourselves."
So what you can do is bring them into a world

01:10:02.170 --> 01:10:18.980
of story where they experience it personally
and it changes the way they see the world.

01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:32.610
That's my two cents.

01:10:32.610 --> 01:10:46.710
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Question in the back.

01:10:46.710 --> 01:10:55.050
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: [ inaudible; off
the microphone ] just to go back to what he

01:10:55.050 --> 01:11:11.289
was talking about this idea of building stories
to go through the times, starting small and

01:11:11.289 --> 01:11:17.679
taking longer to create, which obviously sounds
fantastic.

01:11:17.679 --> 01:11:28.489
But who's investing in those types of projects?
Who has this sort of vision to be able to

01:11:28.489 --> 01:11:39.110
back those types of eyes and are allowed to
get on with their craft but over like a two,

01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:43.440
three, or even perhaps a four year period?

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:47.749
&gt;&gt;Ted Hope: Yeah, I wish I knew that answer.

01:11:47.749 --> 01:11:48.749
[laughter]

01:11:48.749 --> 01:11:52.409
&gt;&gt;Susan Bonds: Did you get their telephone
number?

01:11:52.409 --> 01:11:55.777
&gt;&gt;Ted Hope: It's hard. Particularly in the
tech world, there's always ways to raise funds

01:11:55.777 --> 01:11:56.777
for experiment and innovation. And it's a
lot harder in the content business for that.

01:11:56.777 --> 01:11:57.777
I think that part of the problem we're also
relying on a financial model that is, again,

01:11:57.777 --> 01:11:58.777
based on generally the feature film dominance
or ad-based television.

01:11:58.777 --> 01:11:59.777
So, how do we start to move to something else?
'Cause certainly if I can bring a community

01:11:59.777 --> 01:12:00.777
together that stays together over a long period
of time and all I'm doing is selling them

01:12:00.777 --> 01:12:01.777
a ticket, or a download, to a movie, I'm not
a very good businessperson. If I can find

01:12:01.777 --> 01:12:02.777
people's liked interests I should be able
to drive a fair amount of different forms

01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:03.777
of commerce through that community.

01:12:03.777 --> 01:12:04.777
I think that part of the problem is we're
probably still all looking at old revenue

01:12:04.777 --> 01:12:05.777
models for it as opposed to something that's
more of a new revenue model. If we're bringing

01:12:05.777 --> 01:12:06.777
people together and they're responding to
the things that we like, they're revealing

01:12:06.777 --> 01:12:07.777
a great deal of data that's useful to a lot
of different people, too.

01:12:07.777 --> 01:12:08.777
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Chris.

01:12:08.777 --> 01:12:09.777
&gt;&gt;Susan Bonds: I actually think, too, that
this is an opportunity because you don't have

01:12:09.777 --> 01:12:10.777
to open a movie on opening weekend to get
your world out there. You can do things on

01:12:10.777 --> 01:12:13.269
much smaller platforms and start building
an audience.

01:12:13.269 --> 01:12:20.079
And that is a huge way in for a lot of people
that didn't have a way in before. So, I think

01:12:20.079 --> 01:12:21.079
it's a big opportunity.

01:12:21.079 --> 01:12:28.070
&gt;&gt;Ted Hope: I mean, if you look at Marvel
and DC, basically comics were a great inexpensive

01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:33.030
way for character generation and testing.
Had they had the business plans that they

01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:39.540
would become the big entertainment entities
that they are today, I don't know if anyone

01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:41.000
would've believed them.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.380
Like, "This is what we're going to do, is
publish on cheap pulp paper for 40 years and

01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:50.880
then we're going to make a hundred million
dollar celluloid things."

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:51.880
[laughter]

01:12:51.880 --> 01:13:02.280
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Stan Lee, yeah. An interesting
observation I think is that--and I hate to

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:07.989
plug another book--but there's a book by a
friend called Peter Sims and it's "Small Bets."

01:13:07.989 --> 01:13:12.599
And have a read of it. And I think it's just
interesting him talking a lot about small

01:13:12.599 --> 01:13:13.599
bets.

01:13:13.599 --> 01:13:20.320
We have this tendency in Hollywood and in
marketing and what's the big idea, you know?

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:25.059
Everyone's looking for this big idea. And
actually, the greatest successes of today

01:13:25.059 --> 01:13:29.600
were these iterative successes where they
place small bets and they made mistakes and

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:30.829
learnt by their mistakes.

01:13:30.829 --> 01:13:36.829
And that's the theory behind the book and
it's just this notion of how you experiment.

01:13:36.829 --> 01:13:41.920
You were talking a little bit about the loosening
yourself up into that experimentation mode,

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:47.499
but I think we're gonna see so many more amazing
business plans come out of small bets and

01:13:47.499 --> 01:13:51.190
being able to lose, but lose small but learn
from it.

01:13:51.190 --> 01:13:52.750
I think that's interesting.

01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:57.260
&gt;&gt;Chris Di Cesare: Yeah, just to add on that,
I just think that that's the beauty of the

01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:02.961
web in the fact that costs are coming down.
And I think it's where people can produce

01:14:02.961 --> 01:14:08.559
their own short stories or films and tell
their own stories in a way that you could

01:14:08.559 --> 01:14:09.559
never--.

01:14:09.559 --> 01:14:14.389
The barriers of entry are just so different.
And if you can find an audience then it goes

01:14:14.389 --> 01:14:20.770
from there. So, it's about if you get the
momentum behind you, I think they sky's the

01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:21.770
limit.

01:14:21.770 --> 01:14:22.770
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Well, are there any other
burning questions? Any other burning questions?

01:14:22.770 --> 01:14:23.770
Yes.

01:14:23.770 --> 01:14:24.770
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: I was wondering
what your views are on the anonymity of authorship

01:14:24.770 --> 01:14:50.739
on the internet. And for instance, there's
recently the guy that was supposedly like

01:14:50.739 --> 01:14:52.469
a lesbian somewhere and he was actually some
married guy in Sweden and how we're being

01:14:52.469 --> 01:14:58.099
tricked into things, that what we should do
about that and how we can get around the deficiency?

01:14:58.099 --> 01:14:59.099
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Anyone want to take that?
Frank?

01:14:59.099 --> 01:15:00.099
[laughter]

01:15:00.099 --> 01:15:01.750
&gt;&gt;Frank Rose: I would just like to point out
that on the internet, everybody knows you're

01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:02.750
a dog.

01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:03.750
[laughter]

01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:11.869
As with the purported lesbian who, it comes
out soon enough. I don't know. I think that's

01:15:11.869 --> 01:15:19.289
another example of the kind of blur that I
was talking about. It's obviously impossible

01:15:19.289 --> 01:15:24.789
to make sure that everybody is exactly who
they say they are.

01:15:24.789 --> 01:15:28.320
And I suppose in some way, that's part of
its charms.

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:33.090
&gt;&gt;Susan Bonds: Well, I definitely have an
answer for that in terms of creative content,

01:15:33.090 --> 01:15:39.429
which is don't perpetrate a hoax because people
will find you out. And I think that what you

01:15:39.429 --> 01:15:43.810
end up being and like what we've always tried
to do is provide a clever way to invite people

01:15:43.810 --> 01:15:46.800
into the story that's buzz generating and
cool.

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:53.060
So then they go, "Oh, well I saw that and
I did that." But once people are like, trying

01:15:53.060 --> 01:16:00.429
to debunk you, the internet has infinite resources.
They will figure it out and as in this case--

01:16:00.429 --> 01:16:01.429
&gt;&gt;Chris Di Cesare: Yeah.

01:16:01.429 --> 01:16:04.630
&gt;&gt;Susan Bonds: they'll figure it out. So,
don't start that way because you will get

01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:09.690
figured. Like, did everyone see the movie
Catfish? I mean, like other than being also

01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:13.489
sad, but I mean, it's also like you will get
found out.

01:16:13.489 --> 01:16:16.329
So, don't throw down the gauntlet because
somebody will pick it up.

01:16:16.329 --> 01:16:18.630
&gt;&gt;Ted Hope: Or program the hoax into it at
all times. Like, that’s the point that should

01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:19.630
be exposed.

01:16:19.630 --> 01:16:20.989
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: The reveal.

01:16:20.989 --> 01:16:30.670
&gt;&gt;Susan Bonds: I don't think you can program
the hoax into it the whole time, but that's

01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:33.199
not in this day and time. Not since Google.
[laughter]

01:16:33.199 --> 01:16:37.949
&gt;&gt;Ted Hope: No, but the fact that it's going
to be discovered is part of the--.

01:16:37.949 --> 01:16:42.520
&gt;&gt;Paul Woolmington: Well, on that moment,
just as the discussion was just about to get

01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:48.630
heated. Susan and Ted were about to--. Anyway,
I'd like to first and foremost, thank Frank.

01:16:48.630 --> 01:16:54.659
Well, firstly, thank Google for hosting this
event. Mega thanks to Janine and the team

01:16:54.659 --> 01:17:00.829
at Creative Labs and everyone for coming out
on a hot, steamy day to be in a nice, air-conditioned

01:17:00.829 --> 01:17:05.749
lovely catered venue. I thank Frank, "The
Art of Immersion." I think everyone's got

01:17:05.749 --> 01:17:07.170
a free copy of the book.

01:17:07.170 --> 01:17:11.900
Amazing book. I've read it twice now and I'm
giving it away to all my friends and I think

01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:19.530
it's gonna run and run. Thanks Frank, Chris,
Susan, and Ted for being great panelists and

01:17:19.530 --> 01:17:26.150
for just stimulating the debate. Thank you
everyone.

01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:27.060
[applause]
