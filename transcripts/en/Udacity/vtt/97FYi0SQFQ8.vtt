00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.708
So I mentioned earlier, it's this kind of thing that can really make

00:00:02.708 --> 00:00:05.300
you want to tear your hair out. As you can see, I've been in

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.910
lots of these situations. Okay, so we're facing a challenging situation, in that

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.550
we've got to do some scraping from a site that's really making us work

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.670
for it. Let's talk about a best practice for screen scraping. So the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.040
first thing we want to do here is as I mentioned is, look

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.060
at how the browser itself makes requests. And with the developer tools, we

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.530
have quite a few ways in which we can do that. We can also

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.680
look at the wire traffic if we really needed to

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.030
using something like wire sharp. Then we want to emulate that

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.990
in our code. Now if everything blows up, we're going to

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.980
need to take a look at our HTTP traffic in some

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.210
way. And then just return to one and work through

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.950
this again until we get it right. If we follow this

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.060
process, we have a pretty effective strategy, for dealing with any

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.080
problems we have making requests from sites we'd like to scrape.
