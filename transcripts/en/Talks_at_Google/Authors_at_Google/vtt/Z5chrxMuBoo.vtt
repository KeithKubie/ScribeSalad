00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.488
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:00.488 --> 00:00:01.654
ASWATH DOMODARAN: Thank you.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.750
Thank you very much.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.390
I just posted, a
couple of days ago,

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.750
on where-- I actually am very
lucky at the intersection

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.870
of three different businesses.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.120
I'm a teacher first.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.960
I love to write,
and I'm in finance.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.360
And the way I described
it, I'm in three businesses

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.010
that are all the begging to be
disrupted, three really big,

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.270
badly-run businesses,
all of which

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.390
need to be taken
to the cleaners.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.160
So I've made it my
objective at this point

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.990
in my life to disrupt the
businesses that I'm in.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.920
And this is one of those
acts of disruption.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.950
Because I think,
for too long, we've

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.082
thought about teaching as being
classrooms in universities,

00:00:47.082 --> 00:00:48.790
but I don't see that
restriction anymore.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.700
So what I'd like to
talk about is actually

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.940
what I've been
teaching for 30 years.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.390
To give you some background,
I came to NYU in 1986.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.420
And when I first came to NYU,
they gave me a class to teach.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.130
It was called Security Analysis.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.610
And for those of you who know
the history of that class,

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.650
it was a class than Ben
Graham talked at Columbia

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.210
in the 1950s, that you know
who, he who shall not be named,

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.150
took.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.965
And it's a class with a
long and hoary traditions.

00:01:14.965 --> 00:01:16.340
So they handed it
to me and said,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.160
you've got to teach this class.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.500
I took one look at the
class and said, no way.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.020
This is the most boring
piece or collection

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.150
of topics I can think,
because by the 1980s,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.875
it was showing its age.

00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:28.750
So I went to head of
the department and said,

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.510
I'd like to teach
a Valuation class.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.880
And he said, don't do it.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.850
There isn't enough
stuff in valuation

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.550
to actually teach a class.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.300
And you know what?

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.770
In 1986, there wasn't
enough stuff in Valuation.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.230
There were no
books in valuation.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.600
In fact, when I did my
MBA, which is way, way, way

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.600
back in time-- 1979 through
'81-- two years of the program,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.964
we spent about an hour and a
half collectively on valuation.

00:01:53.964 --> 00:01:54.880
So I thought about it.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.420
And I said, I'd really
to teach the class.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.830
And I considered two options.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.700
One is to go the official
route in the university, which

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.880
is to ask officially for
the class to be OKed.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.420
And if you've ever been in
an academic setting, as most

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.360
of you have how, you
know how difficult

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.670
it is to get things done
officially at a university.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.240
A committee will be formed to
report to another subcommittee.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.320
And by the time they get back
to you, you'll ready to retire.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.460
So I discovered early
on in my academic life,

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.030
that if you want to get
something done, its best

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.155
to do it subversively.

00:02:24.155 --> 00:02:25.030
So here's what I did.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.427
I said, OK, I'll teach the
Security Analysis class.

00:02:28.427 --> 00:02:31.010
And I went into the classroom,
and I taught a Valuation class.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.690
They have absolutely no idea
what I do in the classroom.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.340
I mean, I could be teaching
Cooking, for all they know.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.470
So you know how long it
took them to find out?

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.600
In 2008, I got a call
from the dean's office.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.450
This is 22 years after I've
been teaching this class.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.920
We've heard you're
teaching a Valuation class.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.890
And I said, yes.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.710
I've been doing it for 22 years.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.580
They said, we should
call it Valuation.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.040
I said, welcome to reality.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.540
So if you look at
the NYU schedule,

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.700
you won't see
Valuation until 2008.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.470
But that's because I've
hijacked like six other classes

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.080
in previous iterations and made
them all Valuation classes.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.385
I'm fascinated by Valuation.

00:03:06.385 --> 00:03:10.170
But I'll tell you upfront
what I think about valuation.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.940
I think valuation is simple.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.980
Fundamentally, anybody
can do valuation.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.190
I think we choose
to make it complex.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.870
Whose we?

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.560
The people who
practice valuation.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.060
Why?

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.000
Because that's how
you make a living.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.560
You've got to cover things
up with layers of complexity,

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.867
keep people away.

00:03:27.867 --> 00:03:29.200
So I want to get back to basics.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.632
Obviously, in 40
minutes, I'm not

00:03:30.632 --> 00:03:32.340
going to cover the
details of valuations.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.580
But I want to kind of hit some
points that I think sometimes

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.990
get missed, especially
when people look

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.900
at valuation from the outside.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.470
So here's the first
message I want to deliver.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.080
Valuation is not accounting.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.330
And the reason I say that
is, most people, if you say,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.450
valuation, think numbers,
think accounting statements,

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.430
think income balance sheets.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.730
Valuation is not accounting.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.840
And it's actually a task I face
every year I teach this class.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.010
In fact many of the
MBAs that I teach

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.420
come into my class in the first
year in the spring semester.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.700
When they come in
the spring semester,

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.060
they've taken one
class in accounting.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.790
And if you've looked at how
MBA programs have evolved,

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.300
MBA programs are
very diverse now.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.820
I get museum directors.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.910
I get basketball players.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.390
So to them, the only sense
of finance they've had

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.599
is the Accounting class.

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.140
And part of my job
is to get them out

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.980
of the accounting mindset.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.210
So let me start
off by explaining

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.940
the way I see the difference
between accountants

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.870
look at the world and how
finance looks at the world.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.250
Accounting is backward-looking--
nothing bad about that.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.870
So nothing I say should
be viewed as bad.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.760
It's their job to
record what's happened.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.927
So if you look at a balance
sheet-- and most of you,

00:04:48.927 --> 00:04:50.676
if you open up a 10-K
or an annual report,

00:04:50.676 --> 00:04:51.740
will see a balance sheet.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.160
This is a classic
accounting balance sheet.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.400
So let me look at the breakdown
of how accountants break down

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.330
a company.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.870
On the asset side,
they break assets

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.750
down into current
assets-- basically,

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.220
inventory, accounts receivable,
cash; fixed assets--

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.660
land, building, equipment.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.000
Accountants are big on
tangible fixed assets.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.830
For some reason,
if they can see it,

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.830
they're much more
comfortable with it.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.280
Then you have financial assets--
investments in other companies.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.880
And then you have what
accountants euphemistically

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.610
like to call intangible assets.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.960
Now, if I went around
this room and asked people

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.810
to name intangible
assets, you'd see

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.250
lots of things come to
the surface-- brand name

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.232
technology.

00:05:32.232 --> 00:05:34.190
But if you look at an
accounting balance sheet,

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.280
you know what the most
common intangible asset is?

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.755
AUDIENCE: Goodwill.

00:05:36.755 --> 00:05:37.879
ASWATH DOMODARAN: Goodwill.

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:39.690
And let's be completely
clear about this.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:45.200
Goodwill is the most
useless asset known to man.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.817
And here's why-- for
goodwill to manifest itself

00:05:47.817 --> 00:05:49.400
in an accounting
balance sheet, do you

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.920
know what a company has to do?

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.025
It has to acquire
another company.

00:05:54.025 --> 00:05:55.660
So if you're the
greatest company

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.920
in the face of the Earth
and you've grown entirely

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.220
with internal investments,
there will be no goodwill

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.480
on your balance sheet-- period.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.910
The minute you do an
acquisition, goodwill pops up.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.820
And here's why it pops up.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:09.750
You acquire a company.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.490
It as a book value
of $4 billion.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.240
So what do the accountants
say, until just

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.050
before you acquired it?

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.870
It's worth $4 billion.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:16.786
It's worth $4 billion.

00:06:16.786 --> 00:06:18.170
You offer $10 billion.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.009
The accountant has a $6 billion
problem to explain away, right.

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:23.050
So you know what he does?

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.650
He calls it goodwill.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.080
He puts it on the balance sheet.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.120
And he has to do it because
the balance sheet has this very

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.740
unpleasant requirement.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.940
It has to balance.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.510
Goodwill is a plug variable.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.530
The problem with Goodwill
is it sounds good.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.290
And when something
sounds good, people

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.542
feel the urge to pay for it.

00:06:42.542 --> 00:06:44.500
So every week, I get
emails from people saying,

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.480
I'm valuing this company.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.740
It has $5 billion in goodwill.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:47.948
How much should I pay for it?

00:06:47.948 --> 00:06:50.690
And my response is,
it's a plug variable.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.905
What the heck are you doing
paying for a plug variable?

00:06:53.905 --> 00:06:55.530
On the other side of
the balance sheet,

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:56.830
again, accountants
get carried away.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.788
You have Current Liabilities,
Accounts Payable,

00:06:58.788 --> 00:07:04.026
Supplier Credit, Deferred
Taxes, so all kinds of stuff.

00:07:04.026 --> 00:07:05.650
Then you've got
long-term liabilities--

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.600
bank loans, corporate bonds.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.302
And then you have an item that's
called Shareholders' Equity.

00:07:11.302 --> 00:07:12.800
If you get a
chance, take Google,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.550
look at the balance sheet.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.383
There will be a
Shareholders' Equity number.

00:07:15.383 --> 00:07:16.190
Take any company.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.773
There's a Shareholders'
Equity number.

00:07:17.773 --> 00:07:19.940
You know what goes into it?

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:25.165
Everything that's happened to
this company over its lifetime.

00:07:25.165 --> 00:07:25.790
Think about it.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.873
When you look at the
Shareholders' Equity for Coca

00:07:27.873 --> 00:07:31.890
Cola, in that number is the
original public offering

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:34.290
that Coca Cola made-- which
was what, 100 years ago--

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.280
and everything that's
happened since.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.859
The Shareholders' Equity is
a reflection of the past.

00:07:40.859 --> 00:07:42.400
So here's what I'm
going to do first.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.250
I'm going to
replace it with what

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:49.060
I prefer to look at a company
as-- a financial balance sheet.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.740
And at some level, a
financial balance sheet

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.000
is far simpler than an
accounting balance sheet.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.797
At another level,
it's far more complex.

00:07:55.797 --> 00:07:57.630
Look at the asset side
of the balance sheet,

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:02.060
there are only two items--
Assets in Place and Growth

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:02.560
Assets.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.410
Let's take the
easier half of that.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.010
Assets in Place are
investments you've already

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.100
made as a company.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.200
That's pretty straightforward,
so value of investments

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.140
you've already made.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.223
Pick any company you want.

00:08:16.223 --> 00:08:19.120
Think of the investments
they've already made.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.145
Growth Assets is
a little messier.

00:08:21.145 --> 00:08:23.730
It's a value I'm
attaching to investments

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:26.950
I expect you to make, next year,
two years out, five years out,

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:28.320
10 years out, forever.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.400
I'm giving you
credit for investment

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.005
you haven't even
thought about yet.

00:08:32.005 --> 00:08:34.039
That's pretty scary, right?

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.110
An accountant can never do that.

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.370
But I play by no
rules, so if I feel

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:41.150
that you have great
investments in the future,

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:44.760
I can give you a large value.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.022
Let's look at a contrast.

00:08:46.022 --> 00:08:47.230
You look at Proctor &amp; Gamble.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.480
Where's most of the value
for the company coming from?

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.957
Investments they've already
made or Growth Assets.

00:08:53.957 --> 00:08:55.540
Most of the stuff
they've already done

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:56.581
is already on the ground.

00:08:56.581 --> 00:08:59.100
What else are they going to do?

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.300
But if you look at
LinkedIn and you

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.040
can pick any young
growth company--

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.165
and I'm not going to pick
them in terms of quality.

00:09:05.165 --> 00:09:07.870
Just think of any
young growth company.

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.556
On a good day, may be
LinkedIn's assets in place

00:09:10.556 --> 00:09:12.930
are worth $1 billion, because
they made about $10 million

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:16.430
in operating income last year.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.620
You're paying $40
billion for the company.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.070
The extra $39
billion is for what?

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.080
Expectations,
perceptions, hopes.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.847
Nothing wrong with it.

00:09:25.847 --> 00:09:27.930
But that's the first stop
when you're an investor.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.060
You've got to stop and
do a reality check.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.520
What are you buying, when
you buy this company?

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.165
Because the way you
assess the company

00:09:34.165 --> 00:09:37.197
is going to be very different,
if it's Procter &amp; Gamble, as

00:09:37.197 --> 00:09:38.030
opposed to LinkedIn.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.200
If you're Proctor &amp;
Gamble, you should

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.880
be very focused on
earnings reports

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.630
and say, how much did
they make last year.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:47.020
If you're LinkedIn, who cares
what they made last year.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.460
That's why, when I see investors
freak out over earnings

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.741
reports from young companies--
and there are lots of them.

00:09:54.741 --> 00:09:55.990
Take any social media company.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:57.540
Look at how they freak out.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.980
Earnings per share were
$0.02 below expectations.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.380
I don't care, because
the value of your company

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.160
is not coming from
what you did last year.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.652
It's coming from what I think
you can do in the future.

00:10:09.652 --> 00:10:11.610
So when look at an earnings
report for Twitter,

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.526
I'm not looking at what
did they do last year.

00:10:13.526 --> 00:10:16.420
I'm looking for clues as to
is their growth potentially

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:17.320
increasing or not.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.790
Are they doing the right
things to create value

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.150
from their growth assets?

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.850
Most of the tools
we have in finance

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.370
were developed for
mature companies--

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:31.130
PE Ratios, Return on Invested
Capital, things you're

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.080
taught in Business school.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.580
But if you have
a growth company,

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.840
you try to asses them
using those tools.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.350
It's like using a
hammer to do surgery.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.092
Think about it.

00:10:41.092 --> 00:10:42.550
That's going to be
bloody, and it's

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.970
going to come to a bad end.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:47.690
It doesn't work.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.210
So one interesting
thing you can do

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:51.751
when you sit with a businesses
is take the accounting balance

00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:54.610
sheet and contrast with the
financial balance sheet.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:56.532
The younger a
company, the less you

00:10:56.532 --> 00:10:58.490
will learn by looking at
the accounting balance

00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:59.698
sheet, a for a simple reason.

00:10:59.698 --> 00:11:02.550
If you haven't been around
long, the accountant

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.299
has nothing to record.

00:11:04.299 --> 00:11:06.590
So if you look at a Twitter
balance sheet or a LinkedIn

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.500
balance sheet, there
isn't much there yet.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.990
Doesn't make them
a bad companies.

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.770
It just makes the different.

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.670
And on the other side
of the balance sheet,

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.705
you've got only two
items-- debt and equity.

00:11:18.705 --> 00:11:20.130
There are only two ways
you can fund a business.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.410
You can borrow the money,
or use your own money.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.070
You can slice this and dice
this as much as you want.

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:27.510
You can call them
bonds and stocks.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:30.890
But every business has
to have that choice.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:31.580
And guess what?

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.105
You tell me where the bulk
of your value comes from.

00:11:34.105 --> 00:11:36.480
I'll tell you whether you
should be funding your business

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.130
with debt or equity.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.110
And think why.

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:40.880
Let's say, you're a
young growth business.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:41.380
How young?

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.090
You're an idea business.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:48.060
You're Snapchat-- no
revenues yet, no earnings

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.840
yet, plenty of potential.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.535
How should you
fund your business?

00:11:51.535 --> 00:11:53.160
What's the problem
with borrowing money

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.360
to fund an idea of business?

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.064
Have you tried paying
interest with ideas?

00:11:57.064 --> 00:11:58.730
Go to the banker and
say, you know what.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:01.110
I have a lot of ideas.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.280
You can't make interest
payments with ideas.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.660
If you're an idea business,
this is Corporate Finance 101.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.900
Don't go looking for trouble.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:14.000
You have to raise equity.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.584
So that's the first message
I wanted to deliver.

00:12:16.584 --> 00:12:17.500
Here's the second one.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.485
I often see Valuation classed
structured around spreadsheets.

00:12:24.485 --> 00:12:27.580
In fact, some of you might have
sat in one of these classes

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.890
by Training the Street.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:29.640
I like those guys.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.160
They come in with spreadsheets.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.640
They teach you how
to be an Excel ninja.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.720
You can write macros
on top of macros.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:40.360
You can do those
shortcuts and turn columns

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.150
into yellow, green,
blue, et cetera.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.810
And at the end of two days,
you are a master at Excel.

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:49.340
And you think, this is
what valuation is about,

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.000
at the end of the process.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.250
in fact, the way I
like to describe this

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.140
is to step back and
think about what

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:56.920
drives the value of a company.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.620
If I'm asked to value
a company, there

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:02.095
are four basic questions
to which I need answers.

00:13:02.095 --> 00:13:02.970
Here's the first one.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.136
You've already made those
investments in the ground.

00:13:05.136 --> 00:13:07.610
What are the cash flows you're
getting from those existing

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:08.402
investments?

00:13:08.402 --> 00:13:10.610
Could be very small if you're
a young growth company.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:11.905
But that's my starting point.

00:13:11.905 --> 00:13:14.030
That's why I look at the
last financial statements,

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:17.780
to get a measure of what
your existing cash flows are.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.160
The second question I'm going
to ask you is, what is the value

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.500
that I see you creating
with future growth.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.297
Notice how I phrased
the question.

00:13:25.297 --> 00:13:27.130
I didn't ask you, what's
your future growth.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:30.950
Growth, by itself, can be worth
a lot, can be worth nothing,

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.990
or can destroy value.

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:35.909
Grow can be good,
bad, or neutral,

00:13:35.909 --> 00:13:37.450
because you've got
to pay for growth.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.010
So I'm going to ask,
what's the value

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.260
you create from future growth.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.776
Much more difficult
to answer then,

00:13:42.776 --> 00:13:44.650
what are your cash flows
for existing assets?

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:46.100
But I need that answer.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.130
Third, I'm going to ask, how
risky are these cash flows.

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:51.200
Notice, I didn't
throw in any terms

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.030
to kind of buzz words
you throw in there.

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.990
What's a beta?

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.980
Those are tools.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.060
Don't mistake tools
for end games.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.170
I need a measure of risk.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:01.680
And I need to bring
it into the value.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.261
And finally, I'm going to ask,
when will your business be

00:14:04.261 --> 00:14:06.010
a mature business,
because I've got to put

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.180
some closure on this process.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:12.030
I cannot keep estimating
cash flows forever.

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.550
So those are the four questions
around which the valuation

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:17.470
swivels, which then
brings me to the way I

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:18.917
think about valuation.

00:14:18.917 --> 00:14:20.500
When I start my
Valuation class, which

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.999
doesn't start until
Monday, there'll

00:14:21.999 --> 00:14:24.730
be 200 people who
walk into the class.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.550
And the first question
I ask them is--

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:29.690
are your numbers people?

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:31.710
Are you story people?

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.330
Think about it for a moment.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.780
I bet, given where I am, that
there are more numbers people

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.950
in this room than story people.

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:44.060
And the reason I say that
is, when I look at investing,

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.020
you have two camps.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.800
You have the numbers people, who
love to grind through numbers.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.020
It's all about the numbers.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.140
And it's the story people
who like to be creative.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.070
They like story telling.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.920
The VC business is a
storytelling business.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.520
I know, they throw numbers in,
like the Target Rate of Return.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.880
But it's an after thought.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.510
It's a negotiating tool.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:03.730
It's a story game.

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:06.100
And the problem right
now is, the story people

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:09.190
think that the numbers
people are all geeks.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:12.430
And the numbers people think
that the story people are all

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:14.100
crazy.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:15.990
And they can't
talk to each other.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:18.800
In fact, sometimes,
it's almost funny

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.270
to sometimes watch two story
people and two numbers people

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:23.910
trying to talk about things.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:27.010
And they're talking
right past each other.

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.860
And here's the challenge
I see myself having.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.650
When I come into that class
and say, how many story people.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:33.650
How many numbers people?

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.730
I ask them actually,
in a very simple way,

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:37.840
to see which one you
are, if you're not sure.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:43.370
I ask them-- how many of you
enjoyed History in high school?

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.130
You have 20 people--
I loved that class.

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:47.510
Those are the story people.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.510
So how many of you preferred
Algebra to History?

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:51.230
That's the numbers
people right there.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:54.520
And my end game for
my Valuation class

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.530
is to have numbers people with
imagination and story people

00:15:58.530 --> 00:15:59.360
with discipline.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.026
That's the way to
think about valuation.

00:16:01.026 --> 00:16:02.460
If you're a story
person, I'm not

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.600
going to stop you
from telling stories.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.830
Stories actually
much more effective

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:09.370
at selling business
than numbers are.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.360
And it's been true for
as long as human beings

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.700
have been on the Earth.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.510
So if you tell a story,
what I want to also bring in

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.940
is enough numbers to
discipline yourself.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.110
Because if you don't
have the numbers,

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:24.920
it's very easy to veer
away into fantasy land.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.327
If you're a numbers person
you have no imagination,

00:16:27.327 --> 00:16:29.660
you're not going to be able
to do valuation because it's

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.420
all about the numbers.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.220
If you do a good evaluation,
it should sing a tune.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.040
It should tell me a story.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.440
That's what I'm looking for.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.340
Behind the numbers,
what is the story

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.380
you're telling about a company?

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.040
So when you look
at the two groups,

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.601
each believes they're
the chosen people.

00:16:45.601 --> 00:16:47.600
The numbers people say,
we're the chosen people.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.810
We have spreadsheets.

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:49.530
We have numbers.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.645
We're on the right
side of history.

00:16:51.645 --> 00:16:54.100
And the story people think,
oh, you should listen to us.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.335
We have the great-- we
are the creative people.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:03.640
And I think they're both
right, and they're both wrong.

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.960
There's something to be
gained from the other side.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.640
And to me, that is the key
in doing valuation right.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.440
You've got to work with
both sides of your brain.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.050
I don't even know whether it is
mythology or not, that there's

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:16.520
a left brain and right brain.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:17.520
But let's face it.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.819
Some of us prefer to
work with numbers,

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:22.397
and we have to force ourselves
to think about stories.

00:17:22.397 --> 00:17:23.980
And some of us prefer
to tell stories,

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.510
and we have to force ourselves
to think about numbers.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:29.330
Think about your weaker
side and work on it,

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:32.750
because that's what's going to
give you power in valuation.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:38.330
So when I do a valuation-- and
I use a Discounted Cash Flow

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:39.000
valuation.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.180
It's a tool.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.690
So when you hear DCF
being used as a curse

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:45.670
word-- and venture capitalists
have used this on me.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:46.530
You're doing a DCF.

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:49.480
And the way they say it, the
contempt oozes out of them.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.680
You can't value this
company using a DCF.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.150
I think they're completely
misunderstanding

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:57.199
what a Discounted Cash
Flow valuation is.

00:17:57.199 --> 00:17:58.740
Because ultimately,
what am I saying?

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.090
The value of your business
is the present value

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:05.760
of your expected cash flows
from running this business.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.370
That's been true for as long
as business has been around.

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:13.090
We can debate as to whether we
can estimate these cash flows.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:14.620
But don't tell me,
cash flows don't

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.190
matter, that it doesn't matter
whether your company ever

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:18.010
makes money.

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:19.396
We heard that in
the Dot-com era,

00:18:19.396 --> 00:18:21.370
and look at how well that ended.

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:23.720
It does matter
how much you make.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.340
So when I think about a
Discounted Cash Flow valuation,

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.410
a Discounted Cash
Flow valuation, to me,

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:31.090
is just a tool to bring
in answers to those four

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:31.860
questions.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.070
My cash flows and existing
essence feed into my base here.

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:38.660
My value from growth gets fed
in through the growth rate I use

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:41.140
and how much I'm setting
aside to get that growth.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.440
My risk is built in
through the discount rate.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.110
And I bring it to
closure, by assuming

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:47.540
that at some point in
time, things settle down.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.290
And I can estimate the
value of everything

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:53.460
that happens after that with
this big number at the end.

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.140
But the DCF is not the end game.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.690
It's just a tool to convert
your story into a number.

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.470
So let me use a
very simple example

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.021
to kind illustrate this.

00:19:03.021 --> 00:19:05.520
I want to pick somebody who's
never done a valuation before.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.820
And we're going to do
some Valuation 101.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.910
Anybody who's never
done a valuation before?

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:12.071
OK, you can be my Guinea pig.

00:19:12.071 --> 00:19:13.570
I can't move too
far away, because I

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:14.720
have to be on the camera.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.970
But this is an empty envelope.

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:18.909
I'm not David Copperfield,
no magic tricks.

00:19:18.909 --> 00:19:20.200
So here's what I'm going to do.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.976
I'm going to put a $20 bill.

00:19:21.976 --> 00:19:26.430
It's a little crumpled, but
it's legal tender still.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.671
How much should you
pay for this envelope?

00:19:28.671 --> 00:19:29.547
Don't think too long.

00:19:29.547 --> 00:19:30.837
That's what gets us in trouble.

00:19:30.837 --> 00:19:31.590
AUDIENCE: $20.

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:33.340
ASWATH DOMODARAN: First
rule in valuation,

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.390
if you pay $20 for an envelope
with $20, you get nothing.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:37.182
So let's try again.

00:19:37.182 --> 00:19:38.931
How much should you
pay for this envelope?

00:19:38.931 --> 00:19:39.596
AUDIENCE: $10.

00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:41.062
ASWATH DOMODARAN: Go $1.

00:19:41.062 --> 00:19:42.520
You never know what
disease I have.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.502
I might not be able
to read numbers.

00:19:45.502 --> 00:19:49.236
First rule in valuation-- if
you know the value of something,

00:19:49.236 --> 00:19:51.197
don't throw it on the table.

00:19:51.197 --> 00:19:52.530
You know the value of a company.

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:54.260
Don't offer that value up front.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.470
Because then what do you
have left for yourself?

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:58.690
Put it in your back
pocket, start really low,

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:01.810
and then build up.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:04.450
But this is such a
transparent asset value,

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:06.680
that if I put it up
for a bidding war,

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.370
my guess is, by the
end of the bidding,

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:11.320
you'd probably get
pretty close to $20.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.900
Now I'm going to
make it interesting.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.260
What is this going card say?

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.010
AUDIENCE: Control.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:19.402
ASWATH DOMODARAN: Control--
I'm going to put control

00:20:19.402 --> 00:20:20.927
into this envelope.

00:20:20.927 --> 00:20:22.843
How much should you pay
for this envelope now?

00:20:22.843 --> 00:20:24.534
It's got control in it.

00:20:27.097 --> 00:20:27.680
You know what?

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.020
I tried this in
investment bank last week.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.520
In investment banks,
you're trained.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:36.554
If you put a control into a
company, there's a 20% premium.

00:20:36.554 --> 00:20:37.970
I don't know where
that came from.

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:39.370
The guy offered me $24.

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:41.270
I sold it.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:42.780
He thought it was a game.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.470
I said, no, no, no, no,
this is a real transaction.

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:46.490
Pay me the $24.

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:47.490
So guess what he'd done?

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:51.050
He paid $4 for a
three by five card

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:54.180
that I stole from NYU, that
cost me absolutely nothing.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.700
This is a money machine.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.140
Now that I know you like
to pay for three by five

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.490
cards with nice sounding
words, I can say, try more.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:03.230
What does it say?

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.830
AUDIENCE: Synergy.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:05.310
ASWATH DOMODARAN:
Synergy-- that's a big one.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:06.290
I'll throw that in there.

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:07.498
That will probably go to $26.

00:21:10.139 --> 00:21:10.930
What does this say?

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:11.810
AUDIENCE: Brand name.

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:14.290
ASWATH DOMODARAN: Brand
name-- oh, that's a big one.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:16.460
That's $32 right now.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.809
And if that doesn't work,
I have my two trump cards.

00:21:18.809 --> 00:21:19.600
What does this say?

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.016
AUDIENCE: Strategic
consideration.

00:21:21.016 --> 00:21:22.675
ASWATH DOMODARAN:
Strategic-- that

00:21:22.675 --> 00:21:23.800
is the most dangerous word.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.510
When I hear the word, strategic,
I'm running out of the door.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:27.830
Because you know what it means?

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:30.190
The numbers don't fly,
but I really, really,

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.320
really want to do this.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.859
A strategic deal is
a really stupid deal.

00:21:35.859 --> 00:21:37.150
But you really want to do this.

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:41.270
A strategic buyer is a synonym
for a stupid buyer-- a buyer

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:42.880
who makes up his
mind to buy something

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.171
and then shows up at the table.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.100
And if nothing else works
here is the trump card

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.080
that always works.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:51.570
What does this say?

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:52.270
AUDIENCE: China.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.600
ASWATH DOMODARAN: China.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.780
Just mention the word.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.510
It's amazing how
common sense will

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.767
leave through the other door.

00:21:59.767 --> 00:22:01.100
Take a look at earnings reports.

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.770
Every company that reports
it, even the most horrible,

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:07.730
at the end they would
say, but there's China.

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:10.180
Nothing about China,
but there's China.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:11.470
That alone doesn't it.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:12.200
They said, China.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.767
OK, we'll forget
all of the facts.

00:22:13.767 --> 00:22:15.850
The fact that you've lost
billions doesn't matter.

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:18.520
You have China.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:22.405
I call these weapons
of mass distraction.

00:22:22.405 --> 00:22:26.146
You know they come out
because the numbers don't fly.

00:22:26.146 --> 00:22:28.020
In fact, I have a
very simple test.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.970
When I read an
analyst's report, I

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:31.920
count the number of times
these words show up.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.480
I have a list of a dozen.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.290
And the more times
these words show up,

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:38.380
the less substance
there is to that report,

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:41.460
because this it's
what you use when

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:45.439
you can't come up with a real
reason for doing something.

00:22:45.439 --> 00:22:46.730
So here's my first proposition.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:48.270
It's called the It Proposition.

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:51.570
If it does not affect the cash
flows and it does not affect

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:53.440
risk, it cannot affect values.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.770
And what's it?

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:56.919
Whatever it is controls synergy.

00:22:56.919 --> 00:22:58.710
I'm not saying, control
doesn't have value.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:00.554
But if you tell me
control has value,

00:23:00.554 --> 00:23:01.970
tell me what it's
going to change.

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:04.200
Maybe by controlling
this company,

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.340
you're going to
run it differently,

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:10.190
generating different cash
flows, maybe by synergy, saying,

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:11.640
my revenues will grow faster.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.000
Let's talk about specifics.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.910
You can't let buzzwords
drive decisions.

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:18.930
Because if you let
buzzwords drive decisions,

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:20.970
you're going to
make bad decisions.

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:24.180
And worse, you're not going
to plan to deliver those,

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.610
because there's
nothing behind them.

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:30.610
The second proposition, I
call the Duh proposition.

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:34.490
I've named it after a subset
of emails I get every week.

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:36.776
And usually this is
how the emails will go.

00:23:36.776 --> 00:23:38.860
I'm valuing a
money-losing company.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:42.490
I expect it to
lose money forever.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:46.169
Which valuation model will work
best in valuing this company.

00:23:46.169 --> 00:23:47.710
I feel like walking
up to the person,

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:50.070
slapping them around the
face, saying, wake up.

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:51.170
You're valuing a
money-losing company.

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:52.600
You expect to lose
money forever.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.516
You're thinking about
paying for this company.

00:23:54.516 --> 00:23:57.560
What's wrong with you?

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:01.060
Which brings me to the third
and final proposition--

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.700
next week, when my class starts,
I let people pick companies.

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.290
In fact, I insist that
they pick companies.

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:07.320
They have to value those
companies over the next 14

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.670
or 15 weeks, over the semester.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.378
They can pick whatever
company they want.

00:24:10.378 --> 00:24:11.525
They can pick Lukoil.

00:24:11.525 --> 00:24:12.400
They can pick Google.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.490
They can pick Amazon.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:18.450
And sometime in the
first or the second week,

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:20.450
a subset of people-- not
everybody in the class,

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:22.760
thank god-- but 10 of
them will show up saying,

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:23.930
I have to change my company.

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:25.150
I say, it's a little early.

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:26.310
Why are you panicking?

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:30.110
They say, well, I worked out
the cash flows for my company.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:31.346
And they're negative.

00:24:31.346 --> 00:24:32.845
And you said in the
Duh proposition,

00:24:32.845 --> 00:24:36.300
if the cash flows are negative,
you can't value a company.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.720
And I say, that's
not what I said.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.345
If the cash flows
are negative forever,

00:24:39.345 --> 00:24:41.130
you can't value the company.

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:43.190
But if your cash flows
are negative in year

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.940
one, year two, year three,
it's not the end of the world.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.300
In fact, there are a
subset of companies,

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.290
when you value the company, you
should get negative cash flows

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:52.077
up front.

00:24:52.077 --> 00:24:54.410
What types of companies will
you get negative cash flows

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:54.913
up front?

00:24:54.913 --> 00:24:55.306
AUDIENCE: Growth companies.

00:24:55.306 --> 00:24:58.100
ASWATH DOMODARAN: Young growth
companies-- and here's why.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.500
To grow, what do you have to do?

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.458
You've got to put money
back into the business.

00:25:01.458 --> 00:25:03.020
There is no magic
bullet that you

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:05.230
can use to grow at 80% a year.

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.800
So if I'm valuing
a Tesla, I should

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.490
expect to see negative
cash flows up front.

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:11.990
Why?

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:13.739
Because you've got to
build those assembly

00:25:13.739 --> 00:25:16.770
plants to deliver those
10 times more cars

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:19.700
I expect you to sell
five years from now.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.560
But if you have negative
cash flows upfront,

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.320
you've got to have
disproportionately

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.942
large positive cash
flows in the future.

00:25:25.942 --> 00:25:28.150
You see why they have to be
disproportionately large?

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:30.176
You use $1 billion in year one.

00:25:30.176 --> 00:25:33.847
You've got to make up for it
with $10 billion in year 10.

00:25:33.847 --> 00:25:35.430
So with young growth
companies, that's

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:37.013
exactly what you
should expect to see.

00:25:37.013 --> 00:25:38.950
You should see negative
cash flows up front,

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:41.490
because that's what you
need to grow the company.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:45.080
And as a company matures,
Nirvana shows up.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.330
Cash flows turn positive.

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:48.320
You get the big values.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.360
But that's OK.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:54.000
So here one way to think about
the search for valuation.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.080
You sit down to value a company.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:00.170
You pull up the financials--
annual report, 10-K, 10-Q.

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:02.190
That will give you
a sense all of what

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:03.470
this company did last year.

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:05.736
And if you have
a mature company,

00:26:05.736 --> 00:26:06.860
that might be all you need.

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.760
Because they're so
set in their path,

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.760
that you can pretty much value
the company using last year's

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.310
financials.

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:17.172
But if you have a company that's
in transition and market that's

00:26:17.172 --> 00:26:18.880
changing, you have to
collect information

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.620
about how the
market is evolving,

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.255
who the competitors are.

00:26:22.255 --> 00:26:23.630
When you think
about risk, you're

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:24.520
going to look at the past.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.978
You're going to
look at the future.

00:26:25.978 --> 00:26:28.370
You're going to be looking at
every piece of information.

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:32.240
And my only suggestion if
you value new businesses--

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.190
don't do a blind Google search.

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:35.720
You know what mean?

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:36.820
So if you say--

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.560
For instance, I
have to value Uber.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.700
If I type in Uber in
Google, you know what I get?

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.530
Everything ever
said about Google

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:45.190
on the face of the Earth.

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:47.150
When you search, you
want focused searches.

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:50.179
In other words, you first figure
out what you're looking for.

00:26:50.179 --> 00:26:51.470
And then you go looking for it.

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:54.480
In fact, what I do is, I
open up an Excel spreadsheet

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.730
with the inputs I need.

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:57.937
And with each one, I
say, this is the number

00:26:57.937 --> 00:26:59.020
I'm looking for right now.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:00.690
I'm not going to
get distracted, even

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:03.270
if I find something interesting
about something else,

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:04.220
for the moment.

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:05.950
I'm going to stay
focused on-- so

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:08.530
if I'm looking at the
risk in a company, that's

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:09.470
all I'm looking for.

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:11.550
Are there any clues
I can get by looking

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:13.550
at the company, the market,
and the competitors,

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:14.974
about that risk?

00:27:14.974 --> 00:27:16.390
And at the end of
the process, I'm

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:17.680
keeping my eyes on the prize.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:22.030
This is not about
getting more information.

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:25.640
It's about taking data and
converting into information.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.220
We live in a world where
we have too much date.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.850
That's the reality we face.

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:31.980
Our job is to take the
data and compress it

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:35.220
into information that actually
shows up in our valuations.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.520
So here's a simple
example of a valuation

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.966
of a very boring company.

00:27:40.966 --> 00:27:43.425
We all know what 3M does, right?

00:27:43.425 --> 00:27:46.804
Incredibly sophisticated
stuff like the Post-It note,

00:27:46.804 --> 00:27:47.470
but don't laugh.

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:50.460
It's an incredibly
profitable product.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.250
It's a company with
a long history.

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:55.610
And this is a valuation
I did of 3M in what

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:57.796
I call the days of innocence.

00:27:57.796 --> 00:27:59.920
Those are the days when
they were developed markets

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.950
on one side and emerging
markets on the other.

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:05.880
And never the twain
shall meet-- pre-2008.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.950
So it's a mature
company, in what

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:09.350
I thought was a mature market.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.500
In hindsight, I was
hopelessly wrong.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.780
But my point is, in valuing
3M, I had to make estimates.

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.160
But those estimates
were easy to make.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:17.660
Why?

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.618
Because there was a lot
of history I could use.

00:28:19.618 --> 00:28:21.260
I knew what their
business model was.

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:24.650
I didn't have to figure out what
they would do in the future.

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:26.560
So it's a valuation
that was centered.

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:30.774
There was uncertainty, but the
uncertainty was much smaller.

00:28:30.774 --> 00:28:32.190
The way to think
about it-- if you

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:34.450
think about narrative and
numbers, in the case of 3M,

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:36.350
the story is almost done.

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:37.250
You're in chapter 33.

00:28:39.537 --> 00:28:41.620
There's not much room for
you to change the story.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.490
You can't go back and
rewrite the story.

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:48.370
So this is a valuation that you
could do almost on autopilot.

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:50.170
And this is the kind
of company that you're

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:55.284
taught to value in a
Valuation class in school.

00:28:55.284 --> 00:28:56.950
And I have some really
bad news for you.

00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:00.489
If this is the kind of
company you can value,

00:29:00.489 --> 00:29:02.280
anybody can value these
companies. in fact,

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.740
I'm not even sure
you need a body.

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:07.670
In fact, how many of you
have an Apple device?

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:09.650
Or is that not
allowed in Google?

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:12.350
If you have an Apple device,
go to the iTunes store and type

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:14.010
in uValue.

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:16.380
It's an app that I co-developed
with a friend of mine,

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.619
Anand Sundaram at Dartmouth,
that does valuation.

00:29:18.619 --> 00:29:19.410
So you download it.

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:21.160
You plug-in the numbers.

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.460
If your flight is
30 minutes delayed,

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:24.520
you have nothing to do.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.220
You're one of those
freakish people

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:27.600
who likes to work with numbers.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.660
You put in nine numbers.

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:29.520
You value a company.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.900
You move on.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.591
And I wrote it because I wanted
to disrupt this valuation

00:29:33.591 --> 00:29:34.090
business.

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:37.580
Because so much of what
you pay for in valuation is

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:40.820
a banker feeding in numbers
into something like that

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:43.421
and then spending 25 days
making it look like he did

00:29:43.421 --> 00:29:45.170
a lot of other stuff
and then charging you

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:46.545
millions of dollars
for something

00:29:46.545 --> 00:29:48.500
he has no business
charging you millions for.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.860
So if you're valuing 3M
or companies like that,

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.320
you don't need an appraiser.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.990
You don't need a banker.

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:59.110
Anybody should be able
to value those companies.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:02.583
But let's talk about more
interesting companies.

00:30:02.583 --> 00:30:06.920
This is a valuation I did
of Apple in March of 2013.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:10.800
I've actually valued Apple
every three months forever.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.751
But since 2010, I've been
public about my valuations.

00:30:13.751 --> 00:30:16.250
What I mean by that is, on my
blog-- which is a Google blog,

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:21.210
so that a good think about it--
I post my valuation of Apple,

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:23.720
because I don't
believe in hype--

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:27.690
The way I describe it is,
I'd rather be transparently

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:31.190
wrong than opaquely right.

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:34.060
And in this business, people
want to be opaquely right.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.590
What I mean by
that is, they will

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:38.490
say things that are so
difficult for you to construe,

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:43.280
that no matter what happens,
they can say, I told you so.

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.775
And it drives me crazy.

00:30:44.775 --> 00:30:47.400
So what I do is, I say, this is
what I think the value of Apple

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.139
is.

00:30:49.139 --> 00:30:50.680
And of course, I'm
going to be wrong.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.870
But at least you can
see where I went wrong.

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:57.625
So this is a valuation I
did of Apple in March, 2013.

00:30:57.625 --> 00:30:59.750
Because every time a new
earnings report comes out,

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:01.550
I re-value the company.

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:03.940
So I'm due for one very soon,
because Apple's earnings

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:07.150
reports just came out last week.

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:09.770
What I'm trying to
illustrate here though is,

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:12.940
in traditional valuation,
here's how you value a company.

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:14.654
You making best case.

00:31:14.654 --> 00:31:16.070
Basically, not
even best case, you

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:18.600
make your expected
value estimates

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.114
for things like cash
flows and growth and risk.

00:31:22.114 --> 00:31:22.780
point estimates.

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.113
So I ask you what the growth is.

00:31:24.113 --> 00:31:25.564
You give me a number.

00:31:25.564 --> 00:31:26.730
You ask me what the risk is.

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:27.640
You give me a number.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.660
But the reality, if
you think about it,

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:31.250
is, you face uncertainty.

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:32.980
You have a distribution
in your head,

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:34.646
and I'm forcing you
to give me a number.

00:31:34.646 --> 00:31:37.420
And part of you is saying,
it's 8%, but it could be 3%.

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.900
It could be 11%.

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:42.740
And 25 years ago, I can
see why you were stuck.

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:44.810
You had to do that,
because we did not

00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:48.400
have the tools to actually
bring in uncertainty.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.580
I actually have Crystal
Ball attached to my Excel.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.080
If any of you use
Crystal Ball, it's

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.710
a simulation add-on to Excel.

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:56.330
And what it allows
you to do is enter

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:58.560
a distribution for
your assumptions,

00:31:58.560 --> 00:31:59.730
rather than a single number.

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:01.650
So if I'm writing a
company like Apple,

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:05.240
rather than give one number,
I can give you a distribution.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.950
So rather than say, revenue
growth is 6%, I can say,

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:10.774
it's uniformly distributed
between 3% and 9%.

00:32:10.774 --> 00:32:12.190
And the more
uncertainty you feel,

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:14.210
the wider the distribution
is going to be.

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:16.100
And if any of you have
done a simulation,

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:16.933
here's what happens.

00:32:16.933 --> 00:32:19.560
The computer goes and picks
one outcome of each simulation

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.740
and does a valuation.

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:25.720
Crystal Ball's default
is 100,000 simulations.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:31.265
This is what my simulated value
for Apple was in March of 2013.

00:32:31.265 --> 00:32:32.210
What is that?

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:33.510
How does that help me?

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:35.650
The stock price was $450.

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:37.900
In my base case valuation,
I got about $580.

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.900
So I could give you the
base case value and say,

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:41.209
I think Apple is undervalued.

00:32:41.209 --> 00:32:43.250
But your defense will be,
but you could be wrong.

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:45.350
Of course, I could be wrong.

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:49.350
But what the distribution shows
you is how wrong I can be.

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:52.520
And if I'm a decision-maker,
I'd much rather base it

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.051
on a richer set of information.

00:32:54.051 --> 00:32:56.050
Because here's what I can
tell you about Apple--

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:58.420
I can give you an expected
value, like I did before.

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:02.230
I can also tell you, if you
pay $450, what the chance you

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:03.840
are wrong upfront is.

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.060
I can give you an
ex ante probability.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:08.520
There's a 21% chance
you could be wrong.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:11.750
All I have to do is count the
number of values below $450.

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:13.450
And I put up a distribution.

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:19.950
And in March of 2013, based
on my valuation, I said,

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:23.190
I know I can be hopelessly
wrong on my inputs.

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:25.680
But based on the
outcomes, it looks

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:29.770
like there's a 90% chance-- you
see where the 90% comes from?

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:33.020
The 10th percentile
is about $450.

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.720
The stock is trading at $450.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:36.920
Investing is a game of odds.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.300
And it looks to me,
based on my assessments,

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.010
that the odds are in my favor.

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:42.510
And of course, this
is an investment

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:44.930
that's worked out hopelessly
well, in some cases.

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:47.350
Hopelessly, well because
the stock is now what? $840,

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:49.610
with the seven to one split.

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:51.870
Not everything
works out that well.

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:57.300
But what I'm trying to say is,
don't let uncertainty stop you.

00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:59.790
And especially in the
technology business,

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:02.652
I find this defense
to be very troubling.

00:34:02.652 --> 00:34:04.860
You ask people, why are you
not valuing this company?

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.926
Because there's too
much uncertainty.

00:34:06.926 --> 00:34:09.230
What does that mean?

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:11.699
Your estimates could be
wrong, but that doesn't mean

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:14.070
you can't make an estimate.

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:17.150
Saying that this too much
uncertainty to do a valuation

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:18.820
and then investing
in the company,

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:22.620
to me, is the
height of insanity.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:25.469
And lots of venture capitalists
go through that cycle

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:27.530
over and over again.

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:29.379
They say, I don't want
to value the company,

00:34:29.379 --> 00:34:31.139
but I'll invest in the company.

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:33.580
You can't tell me one
thing and do the other.

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:35.120
So if you cannot
value the company,

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:37.540
at least do the logical thing
and never invest in those

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:38.239
companies.

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:40.405
But if you want to invest
in young growth companies,

00:34:40.405 --> 00:34:43.750
you have to get your
hands around those numbers

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:46.939
and make your best estimates.

00:34:46.939 --> 00:34:48.480
Now, of course, with
a young startup,

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.760
all these questions become
more difficult to answer.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.800
In you're the founder
of a young startup,

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.380
let me ask you
the four questions

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.449
to which I need answers.

00:34:56.449 --> 00:34:59.124
And you're going to see why
life is so much more difficult.

00:34:59.124 --> 00:35:00.790
First question-- what
are you cash flows

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:01.570
from existing assets?

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:02.528
You're a young startup.

00:35:02.528 --> 00:35:04.010
What the answer to the question?

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:04.856
What assets?

00:35:04.856 --> 00:35:05.480
I have nothing.

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.438
I'm sitting on a chair.

00:35:06.438 --> 00:35:07.670
I don't even own it.

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:09.479
OK, that was easy.

00:35:09.479 --> 00:35:11.270
Then I ask you, how
much value do you think

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:12.650
future growth will bring in?

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:14.392
You say, a lot.

00:35:14.392 --> 00:35:16.140
I say, can you be a
little more specific?

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:18.460
Not really-- I don't even
have a business model yet.

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.290
I say, how risky are you?

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:22.062
Very.

00:35:22.062 --> 00:35:24.020
But you can't give me
past prices and earnings,

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:25.552
because you haven't been around.

00:35:25.552 --> 00:35:27.260
I say, when will you
be a mature company?

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:28.810
And you fall on the
ground laughing.

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:31.250
You might not even make
it through tomorrow.

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:34.220
Every question becomes
like pulling teeth.

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:38.560
And that's why, with young
startups, people give up.

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.580
My suggestion is,
rather than give up,

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:42.074
make your best estimates.

00:35:42.074 --> 00:35:44.240
Don't put the weight of the
world on your shoulders,

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.364
saying, I have to be right.

00:35:45.364 --> 00:35:48.590
You cannot be right, but you
can still make estimates.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:51.080
For the last four
years, every time

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:54.760
you've had a big IPO come
up, the week before the IPO,

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.700
I've tried to value the IPO.

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.550
The reason I do it the
week before the IPO

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:02.010
is, if you wait until
the IPO is priced,

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:04.110
that number starts gnawing
away at your brain.

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:05.735
So when you do a
valuation, your number

00:36:05.735 --> 00:36:07.490
starts to wander
toward that number.

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:10.540
So this is actually a valuation
I did of Twitter, the week

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:12.970
before their IPO.

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:15.920
So what triggered this
was, I was on CNBC.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.810
So once in awhile, I
end up in that insanity.

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:22.890
And I was actually-- we
were talking about Twitter.

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:25.400
And there's an analyst there
who was very optimistic

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.230
about Twitter.

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:28.470
So I said, why do you think
Twitter is worth so much?

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:31.250
He thought it was about
$65 or $70 per share.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:34.500
He said, because the online
advertising business is huge.

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.280
So I said, how big is the
online advertising business?

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.330
He said, I don't
know, but it's huge.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:42.470
This is exactly what
gets us into trouble.

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:45.600
People don't want to
talk-- it's like China.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.770
Online, it's huge.

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:49.929
And because it's huge, I
can pay whatever I want.

00:36:49.929 --> 00:36:50.970
So I said, you know what?

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:53.344
If I want to value Twitter,
that's where I need to start.

00:36:53.344 --> 00:36:56.860
I need to figure out how
big this business is.

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.780
Doesn't take a whole lot of
research to figure this out.

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:03.120
But the entire online
advertising business in 2013

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.730
was about $120 billion.

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:07.270
That's the whole global
online advertising business.

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:11.034
The biggest player,
by far, is Google.

00:37:11.034 --> 00:37:12.950
And if you look at the
breakdown, you can see,

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:15.951
Google is about 33% of the
global online advertising.

00:37:15.951 --> 00:37:17.700
The next biggest is
Facebook, and then you

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:19.430
have a splintered business.

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:22.660
So that's the
business right now.

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.530
I do know that
online advertising

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:29.520
is becoming a larger and larger
portion of overall advertising.

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.580
Print media is
going out of style.

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:34.870
So here's what I had to do
first, to value Twitter.

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:37.490
I had to figure out how big
this market was going to be.

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:40.319
Because before I talk about
what the revenues for Twitter

00:37:40.319 --> 00:37:41.860
are going to be, I
need to figure out

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:43.980
what they're aiming for.

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.870
So I make some assumptions.

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:48.010
I assume that the
overall advertising

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:50.010
market is about $550 billion.

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:53.470
So about 20% of all advertising
is online right now.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:56.530
But the overall advertising
market can growing about 3%

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:58.420
a year, because it's an
expense to companies.

00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:00.250
They can't grow at 10% a year.

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:02.390
But online advertising
would increase

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:07.550
as a percentage of that to
become about 40% of the market.

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:08.870
That gave me my endgame.

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:12.707
It give me my online advertising
market a decade from now.

00:38:12.707 --> 00:38:13.707
It's about $200 billion.

00:38:13.707 --> 00:38:15.200
AUDIENCE: How did
you figure 40%?

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:17.090
ASWATH DOMODARAN: I made it up.

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:18.990
And I made it up on
the following basis--

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:24.170
I looked at how quickly
existing advertising media

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:26.430
revenues are dropping.

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:29.100
Print advertising is
falling through the floor.

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:31.760
But TV advertising has actually
been surprisingly robust.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.120
So there are certain
kinds of advertising

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.290
where I think you're going
to see other advertising.

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:39.030
Billboard advertising
is not going to go away.

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:41.640
Because if you're driving,
it's tough to have online ads.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.205
Maybe you'll figure
something out.

00:38:43.205 --> 00:38:45.620
But you'll have a
lot of accidents.

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:47.920
So I made that assumption.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.812
Clearly, that's where
you and I can have

00:38:49.812 --> 00:38:51.020
different values for Twitter.

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:53.500
But at least we're
talking about substance.

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.290
So if you made a
stand saying, I think

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:58.310
it's going to be 60%
of the market, OK.

00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:00.940
So you have to go marshal
the ammunition for that.

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:02.366
So I use 40%.

00:39:02.366 --> 00:39:03.740
And then I had to
make a judgment

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:07.426
as to what percentage of that
market Twitter would capture.

00:39:07.426 --> 00:39:09.490
That's tough.

00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:11.500
You've all seen how
Twitter ads work, right?

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.570
It's that sponsored Tweet
that shows up-- pisses me off,

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:15.720
no end.

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.750
I've never clicked
on a sponsored Tweet.

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:20.390
I hope nobody ever does.

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:23.190
But that's the way they make
their advertising revenues.

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:25.140
And that's their strength
and their weakness.

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:27.040
Their strength is
140 characters.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.680
Their weakness is
140 characters.

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.550
That's a strength, because
it makes it nice, compact.

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:36.210
The weakness is, it can't
be your primary advertising.

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:39.410
So the way I see it is,
even if Twitter succeeds,

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:42.660
it'll never be
Google or a Facebook.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:43.880
It'll be a lesser player.

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:46.680
And that led me to use a
market share of about 6%

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:49.144
for Twitter, which is
still about $12 billion.

00:39:49.144 --> 00:39:51.560
Here's a company with a half
a billion dollars in revenues

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:52.147
right now.

00:39:52.147 --> 00:39:53.730
And over the next
decade, I'm assuming

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:56.170
it's going to go
24-fold to $12 billion.

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:58.215
So that gave me half the game.

00:39:58.215 --> 00:40:00.090
I then have to figure
out how much money they

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:04.330
will make once they're
past this growth phase.

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:06.290
And there are two
big targets here.

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:08.390
One is Google, and
the other is Facebook.

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:10.470
Both are immensely profitable.

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:13.480
Google's margins are
about 22% of revenues.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.990
Facebook's are about 30%.

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:17.850
And Facebook's
margins are dropping,

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:19.130
each year that you watch them.

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:21.296
Because as they get bigger,
it's tougher and tougher

00:40:21.296 --> 00:40:24.880
to maintain-- these
are immense margins.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.010
But I thought I was being
optimistic, when I used

00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:28.890
a 25% end margin for Twitter.

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:31.660
I said, that's what
you're shooting for.

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:33.620
So I've got my
revenues in year 10.

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:36.580
I've got my margins in year 10.

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:39.890
I also had to bring in that
final piece, which is, this

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:41.860
isn't going to happen by magic.

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:45.050
You're not going to go from
half a billion in revenues

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:46.794
to $12 billion, without
doing something.

00:40:46.794 --> 00:40:48.210
So I had to estimate
how much they

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:50.170
would have to put back
into the business,

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:52.204
in acquisitions, new technology.

00:40:52.204 --> 00:40:53.620
That's a reinvestment
I'm getting.

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:56.000
And I'm computing it based on
how much their revenues are

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:56.950
changing each year.

00:40:56.950 --> 00:41:00.020
Those three pieces
give me my cash flows.

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:01.675
The small revenues
become big revenues.

00:41:01.675 --> 00:41:03.440
The losses become profits.

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.290
The reinvestment
gives them the engine

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:07.630
to drive the revenue growth.

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:09.889
That's what I spent
the bulk of my time on.

00:41:09.889 --> 00:41:12.055
Most people who do this
kind of cash flow valuation,

00:41:12.055 --> 00:41:15.060
there are two parts to DCF,
Discounted Cash Flow valuation.

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:17.380
There's the D and the CF.

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:19.400
The D is the discount rate.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.640
Here's my problem with
the way DCFs are done.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.840
80% of the time that
most analysts spend

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:29.408
is on the D. They'll finesse
it to the nth decimal point.

00:41:29.408 --> 00:41:30.892
20% is on cash flow.

00:41:30.892 --> 00:41:31.850
I'll make a confession.

00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:35.500
The Twitter valuation,
97% of the time

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.090
that I spent was on the cash
flow, and towards the end,

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:39.666
said, I need a discount rate.

00:41:39.666 --> 00:41:41.040
And for the discount
rate, what I

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:45.219
effectively used a
discount rate of about 11%.

00:41:45.219 --> 00:41:46.760
And I didn't think
about it too much.

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:53.021
11% puts you in the 95th
percentile of US companies.

00:41:53.021 --> 00:41:55.704
So I'm basically saying,
they're a really risky company.

00:41:55.704 --> 00:41:57.120
I could finish
this a little more.

00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.130
But I really don't care.

00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:59.560
This is really the small stuff.

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:02.240
My bigger assumption is
what my revenues will be,

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.340
what my margins will be.

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:05.745
This is not where I'm
going to screw up.

00:42:05.745 --> 00:42:08.120
And I always have to factor
in that with a young company,

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.994
there's a chance that
they would not make it.

00:42:09.994 --> 00:42:12.197
In the case of Twitter,
I assume that there

00:42:12.197 --> 00:42:14.030
was zero chance that
they would not make it,

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:15.530
because they have
access to capital.

00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:17.072
It's not that they
won't screw up.

00:42:17.072 --> 00:42:19.530
But they seem to have access
to people who keep giving them

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:21.040
money, even if they screw up.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:24.370
And that's a nice skill to have.

00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:26.940
Those are the things that fed
into my valuation of Twitter.

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:31.390
And in the week before the IPO,
the value that I put was $18.

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:35.490
And if you remember your
history, it was priced at $26.

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:38.300
And on the offering
day, it didn't

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:41.770
even open for about two hours.

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:44.977
And when it did open,
it opened at $46.

00:42:44.977 --> 00:42:46.560
And I got a call
from somebody saying,

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:47.694
how do you explain the $46.

00:42:47.694 --> 00:42:48.860
And I said, I don't have to.

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:49.980
I didn't pay it.

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:51.920
I've never felt
the urge to explain

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:53.370
what some other person pays.

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:55.555
AUDIENCE: What was
your final valuation?

00:42:55.555 --> 00:42:56.940
ASWATH DOMODARAN: $18 per share?

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.700
Yeah.

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:01.380
So I get calls saying, how do
you explain Uber's $41 billion.

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.160
Ask somebody who
paid the $41 billion.

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.440
I didn't do it.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.190
I just take Uber once in awhile.

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:10.170
But I'm not big $41
billion to my driver.

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:12.550
So I don't feel the urge
to try to explain it.

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:15.540
In fact, that's one final
thing I want to say.

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:18.830
Much of what you see passing
for valuation out there's

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:19.899
is really pricing.

00:43:19.899 --> 00:43:21.690
If you have no idea
what I'm talking about,

00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:25.480
let me give you a couple
of very simple tests.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.362
How many of you own a
house or an apartment?

00:43:28.362 --> 00:43:29.820
What, Google doesn't
pay you enough

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.750
to buy your own apartment?

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:35.670
Time to raise your salary, so
I'll make sure that happens.

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:36.770
You know how this works.

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:37.490
What do you do?

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:38.660
You hire a realtor.

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:40.972
The realtor shows you a house.

00:43:40.972 --> 00:43:42.430
I'm thinking of
moving to La Jolla,

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:44.950
especially after two
winters like-- I'm done.

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:46.706
28 winter in New
York, I'm out of here.

00:43:46.706 --> 00:43:47.830
My wife is from California.

00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:48.460
I'm going back.

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:49.767
I went to UCLA.

00:43:49.767 --> 00:43:50.850
I can't take this anymore.

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:52.930
So I talked to my wife.

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:56.257
And the minute I said it,
she's checking out houses.

00:43:56.257 --> 00:43:57.340
Hey, this is a good thing.

00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:00.555
And she picks the most
expensive part of California

00:44:00.555 --> 00:44:01.990
to look-- La Jolla.

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:04.757
This is a slum in La Jolla.

00:44:04.757 --> 00:44:05.840
It's less than $1 million.

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.060
That shows it's one of the
cheapest houses probably

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:09.482
in La Jolla.

00:44:09.482 --> 00:44:10.440
But here's my question.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:14.251
How did the realtor come up with
that $995,000 for the house?

00:44:14.251 --> 00:44:16.750
How does a realtor come up with
the number for an apartment.

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:18.930
What does he or she do?

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:20.390
She looks at other apartments.

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:23.355
Or he looks at other units
that sold in the neighborhood,

00:44:23.355 --> 00:44:25.480
adjusts for the fact that
you have an extra bedroom

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.320
or a bigger lot.

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.700
It's pricing There's
no valuation going on.

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:32.556
You think, those
unsophisticated realtors.

00:44:32.556 --> 00:44:34.380
Let me show you a second.

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:36.150
You've seen an equity
research report?

00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:39.850
If you haven't, save yourself
the trouble, because here's

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:41.170
what the analyst will do.

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:42.610
There will be a company name.

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:45.970
There will be a multiple, which
is like a standardized price,

00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:48.537
like a price per square
foot, a price earnings ratio.

00:44:48.537 --> 00:44:50.870
There will be 15 other companies
that the analyst claims

00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:52.270
are just like your company.

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:54.710
In what universe, I don't know.

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:57.170
I've seen Google Equity
Research reports.

00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:59.263
These 15 companies
are just like Google.

00:44:59.263 --> 00:44:59.970
Oh, really?

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:01.090
That's amazing.

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:03.230
How do you find those?

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:06.390
I would argue that the realtor
was on much firmer ground,

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:08.770
looking at apartments
around the neighborhood,

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:11.060
than an Equity Research
Analyst trying to find

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:12.450
15 companies like Google.

00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:14.700
But that's exactly what
the Equity Research Analyst

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:18.440
is doing-- pricing
your company, based

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:22.520
on what comparable companies
traded, though there's

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.724
nothing comparable about them.

00:45:24.724 --> 00:45:26.890
You're saying, those
unsophisticated Equity Research

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:28.820
Analysts.

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:30.850
You sometimes see
a discounted-- this

00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:32.700
looks like one of
those discounted--

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:36.170
if you pay a banker, this is
what you get-- cash flows.

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:38.670
The next time you see a
valuation from a banker,

00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:41.430
zero in on the biggest number
in the Discounted Cash Flow

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.930
valuation.

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:46.697
It's always the end number, the
value at the end of your file.

00:45:46.697 --> 00:45:48.530
Take a look at where
that number comes from.

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:51.950
And I'll wager, in nine out
of 10 banking valuations,

00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:56.590
that number comes from applying
a multiple to year five number.

00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:57.690
What do I mean by that?

00:45:57.690 --> 00:45:59.200
In this case, here's what I did.

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:03.180
I took the operating income in
year five and multiplied by 10.

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:03.920
Why 10?

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.760
Because that's what other
companies trade at right now.

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.410
I can tell you all
kinds of stories,

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:08.850
but this is a pricing as well.

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:11.580
I'm just hiding it in year five.

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:15.350
I call these pricing in drag.

00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:17.011
The drag component
is the cash flows.

00:46:17.011 --> 00:46:18.760
While you're distracted
by the cash flows,

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.020
you slip in 10 times.

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:23.530
That's what's
driving this number.

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:27.300
Most of what passes for
valuation out there is pricing.

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:29.830
You're saying, so what.

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:31.940
It's a very different game.

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:33.255
What sets prices?

00:46:33.255 --> 00:46:36.740
It's demand and supply,
mood and moment.

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:37.780
What's sets value?

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:39.280
Cash flows, growth, and risk.

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.270
Could the two give
you different answers?

00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:43.310
Absolutely.

00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:46.640
If you are trader-- not
a traitor, but a trader--

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.240
you care about prices.

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.940
What's CNBC?

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:52.080
CNBC is an instrument for trade.

00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.990
You are trading the stock.

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:56.234
All you care about
is what moves prices.

00:46:56.234 --> 00:46:58.400
So the only question I'm
asking is, what's the mood.

00:46:58.400 --> 00:46:59.280
What's the momentum?

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.770
Where's it going?

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:04.490
So if you ask me to explain why
people are paying $41 billion

00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:05.800
for Uber, you know why?

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:08.020
Because they think they
can sell for $75 billion.

00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:09.830
That's basically
it-- that they think

00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:12.410
that they can take it in
a public offering for $75

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:13.800
billion.

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:14.660
Are they right?

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:18.900
If the momentum continues,
they could very well be right.

00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:22.360
Does that mean that Uber
has a value of $75 billion?

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:24.900
That's a very
different question.

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:27.970
Sometimes price and
value can diverge.

00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:31.090
And if they diverge,
they can give you

00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:33.520
very different numbers.

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.890
The social media space
is a pricing space.

00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:40.580
In fact, if you ask me why
social media companies trade

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:42.900
at what they do, I have
a very simple answer.

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:46.350
It's not because how much
they made in revenues.

00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:48.100
It's not because how
much money they make.

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:51.026
Thank god for that, because
most of them make no money.

00:47:51.026 --> 00:47:51.900
So here's what I did.

00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:54.275
I decided to let the data tell
me what drove the pricing.

00:47:54.275 --> 00:47:56.450
And here's what I did
to answer the question.

00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:57.967
I took every social
media company.

00:47:57.967 --> 00:48:00.300
It's easy to get the public
information, what the market

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:01.140
value is.

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:03.140
And then I collected all
the information I could

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:05.223
about these companies--
what they had in revenues,

00:48:05.223 --> 00:48:06.540
what they had in earnings.

00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:07.998
What I was trying
to figure out is,

00:48:07.998 --> 00:48:09.860
how is the market
pricing these companies.

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:13.430
What is it using to
come up with the prices?

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:15.290
And I drew on statistics
to answer that.

00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:18.170
All I did was a correlation
between the market cap

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:21.240
and different variables, to
see which one had the highest

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:23.020
correlation with the market.

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:25.880
So what is it that makes some
social media companies valuable

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:27.109
and the others not?

00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:28.900
And you could look
across the correlations.

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:32.050
And by far-- look
at the correlation.

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:35.510
The most critical
variable in explaining

00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:38.220
the market value of a
social media company

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:40.517
is the number of users.

00:48:40.517 --> 00:48:43.100
I'll give you a very simple way
to value social media company.

00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:44.480
Here again, you
can save yourself

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.360
the trouble of hiring a banker.

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.490
You tell me how
many users you have.

00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:51.470
If you go back to
the previous page,

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:55.080
the market is paying
about $100 per user.

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.130
You tell me how
many users you have.

00:48:57.130 --> 00:48:59.736
I'll tell you what your value
is going to be in the company.

00:48:59.736 --> 00:49:01.765
So how many users
does Twitter have?

00:49:01.765 --> 00:49:03.410
250 million.

00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:06.250
250 million times
100 is $25 billion.

00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:06.760
We're done.

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:09.750
Who cares about cash
flows, growth, and risk?

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:13.392
Facebook is 175 billion
users, million users.

00:49:13.392 --> 00:49:14.947
They wish they had 175 billion.

00:49:14.947 --> 00:49:16.280
What planets are you going onto?

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:22.970
1.75 billion users-- you
multiply that by 100.

00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:26.150
You get $175 billion.

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:28.850
And remember last year when
Facebook bought WhatsApp?

00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:31.400
How many of you have
WhatsApp on your phones?

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:33.580
How many of you pay
for your WhatsApp?

00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:35.764
That settles my case,
like one in five people.

00:49:35.764 --> 00:49:37.680
In fact, last year, when
they bought WhatsApp,

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:40.130
the paid $20 billion for
the company. $19 billion

00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:41.470
seems to have rounded up to 21.

00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:43.275
Don't ask me how
those things happen.

00:49:43.275 --> 00:49:46.440
It's just a couple
of billions anyway.

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:49.110
I got a call again, saying,
how do you-- for some reason,

00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:52.380
people think I have to
explain what other people do.

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:55.229
How do you explain
what Facebook just did?

00:49:55.229 --> 00:49:56.770
And I said, you're
missing the point.

00:49:56.770 --> 00:49:59.350
Facebook is not buying WhatsApp
for the earnings, the cash

00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:00.830
flows and the revenues.

00:50:00.830 --> 00:50:01.677
What are they doing?

00:50:01.677 --> 00:50:02.510
AUDIENCE: The users.

00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:05.030
ASWATH DOMODARAN: How many
users did WhatsApp have?

00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.952
Like 400 million.

00:50:05.952 --> 00:50:08.410
Even if you allow for the fact
that about 80 or 100 million

00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:10.130
of those are already
Facebook users,

00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:12.550
you're buying 300
million new users.

00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:15.410
if the market is
paying $100 per user.

00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:18.600
300 million times
100 is 30 billion.

00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:21.810
You're getting a bargain.

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:22.380
Don't laugh.

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:26.180
This game is going
crazy right now.

00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:28.042
People are buying
users, because that's

00:50:28.042 --> 00:50:29.250
what the market is rewarding.

00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:30.860
You're saying, what's
wrong with that.

00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:32.930
Markets are fickle.

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:34.900
Today, they like users.

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:36.040
Tomorrow, they might not.

00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:38.290
Remember, they liked website
visitors for a long time?

00:50:38.290 --> 00:50:39.498
But they said, you know what?

00:50:39.498 --> 00:50:41.610
I can't pay dividends
with website visitors.

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:44.560
It's kind of tough to say, I'll
take three visitors, please.

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:45.487
Send them to my house.

00:50:45.487 --> 00:50:46.320
They'll work around.

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:48.380
I paid a lot of
money for your stock.

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:51.002
At some point, they're
going to ask for substance.

00:50:51.002 --> 00:50:52.960
And the way I describe
social media companies--

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:56.020
it's like having a
gigantic store with nothing

00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:58.590
on the shelves and
lots of foot traffic.

00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:00.360
That's you're buying.

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:01.360
What are you hoping for?

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:03.540
That if you put something
on the shelves, maybe

00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:04.790
they'll stop and buy it.

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:06.650
It's not an unreal exercise.

00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:09.430
Call it a field of dreams.

00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:14.519
Remember, Kevin Costner, "if
we build it, he will come,"

00:51:14.519 --> 00:51:15.060
Shoeless Joe.

00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:16.000
It's the same thing.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.369
If we have the
users, it will come.

00:51:18.369 --> 00:51:19.660
How it will come, I don't know.

00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:21.820
But it will come.

00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:23.640
But that's what
pricing is about.

00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:25.940
It's not about what you
and I think matters.

00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:29.730
It's what the market
is building in, which

00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:33.630
brings me to my last point.

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:35.410
And I hate to be the
one to break this.

00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:39.630
This is a game where luck
is the dominant paradigm.

00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:41.670
When I say, this, I'm
talking about investing--

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:44.180
venture capital investing,
regular investing.

00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:46.781
We like to think it's
skill and hard work.

00:51:46.781 --> 00:51:47.280
It's luck.

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:50.490
If you're lucky, you can
do a horribly sloppy things

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:52.550
and be incredibly rich.

00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:56.180
If you're not, it doesn't
matter how well you do things.

00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:57.800
You're still going
to lose money.

00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:01.470
If you're lucky, all
else is forgiven.

00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:03.470
And all too often,
when people make money,

00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:04.940
they like to claim it's skill.

00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:07.190
For a while, the hedge fund
managers were saying this.

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:08.090
We're skillful guys.

00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:10.500
We're the smartest
people in the room.

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.970
Says who?

00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:15.170
When people talk about smart
money, I always cringe.

00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:16.840
There is no smart money.

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:20.320
There's less stupid money
and more stupid money.

00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:23.520
But there's really
not smart money.

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:26.430
And in fact, the best
evidence that there

00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:30.090
is no smart money in hedge funds
is what's happened collectively

00:52:30.090 --> 00:52:31.969
to the hedge fund business.

00:52:31.969 --> 00:52:33.510
You know how hedge
funds work, right?

00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:36.390
First, they take 2% of
your money up front.

00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:38.940
Then they take 20% of
whatever your upside is.

00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:42.040
It's a horrendously bad set up.

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:43.540
But you do it because
you're greedy.

00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:45.540
You think they can deliver
more than the market.

00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:49.360
Collectively, hedge funds
deliver about one percentage

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:51.180
point less than
what you could make

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:54.460
by putting your money in
an S&amp;P 500 Index fund.

00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:56.520
It's a strange business.

00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:59.490
I can't think of-- the analogy
would be starting a plumbing

00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:01.562
business called Floods R Us.

00:53:01.562 --> 00:53:02.520
And here's what you do.

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:03.728
There's a leak in your house.

00:53:03.728 --> 00:53:05.490
You call me, and
I leave a flood.

00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:07.520
You would never call me back.

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:10.260
That's what we do collectively
with these hedge funds.

00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:12.484
We pay them tons of
money to do what?

00:53:12.484 --> 00:53:14.900
Earn less than what we could
have made by not paying them.

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:18.810
You figure it out,
because I certainly can't.

00:53:18.810 --> 00:53:22.132
So here's my final
point about valuation.

00:53:22.132 --> 00:53:24.090
It's one of my favorite
movies of all the time,

00:53:24.090 --> 00:53:26.430
"The Wizard of Oz."

00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:27.730
Remember the story?

00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:29.820
Dorothy gets sucked
out of Kansas.

00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:31.329
She gets dumped in Oz.

00:53:31.329 --> 00:53:32.620
She wants to go back to Kansas.

00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:33.550
Don't ask me why.

00:53:33.550 --> 00:53:35.120
I'd have stayed in Oz.

00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:37.370
So of course, the move starts
with, I need to go back.

00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:40.210
And of course, she's
given the classic advice.

00:53:40.210 --> 00:53:41.700
Go meet the Wizard of Oz.

00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:42.769
He has all the answers.

00:53:42.769 --> 00:53:45.060
The entire movie is about
her going on the yellow brick

00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:47.420
road and this motley
crew of characters

00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:51.150
she collects-- the Scarecrow
who needs this and then

00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:52.890
Tin Man, the Lion.

00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:55.710
And they all get to Oz,
expecting the wizard

00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:59.636
to be this all powerful
person, who grants--

00:53:59.636 --> 00:54:00.760
They walk into the chamber.

00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:02.960
They each tell the
wizard what they want.

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:06.095
And the wizard has this deep
voice, until the curtain drops.

00:54:06.095 --> 00:54:08.470
And you realize it's a small
guy behind the curtain who's

00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:11.840
been pulling-- there's
really no Wizard of Oz.

00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:14.060
But it turns out
that they all got

00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:17.110
what they needed, during
the course of the journey.

00:54:17.110 --> 00:54:19.470
You say, what's this got
to do with valuation?

00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:23.110
I firmly believe that you
learn valuation by doing.

00:54:23.110 --> 00:54:25.680
You really want to
learn valuation.

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.560
Here's what you need to do.

00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:28.575
Value a company.

00:54:28.575 --> 00:54:31.094
The first time you do it, it
will be like pulling teeth.

00:54:31.094 --> 00:54:32.760
Then value another
company, as different

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:34.176
from the first
company as you get.

00:54:34.176 --> 00:54:36.500
So next week, I'm
putting up a valuation.

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:40.300
It's a crowd valuation of Uber
post that I did on my website.

00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:43.120
At each stage, I ask you
to decide what Uber is.

00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:45.860
Is it a car-service company
or a transportation company?

00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:49.490
Is it a local networking benefit
or a global networking benefit?

00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:51.320
I can tell you my story.

00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:54.220
And at the end of the process,
say, based on your story,

00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:56.200
this is Uber's value.

00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:58.200
And the value for
Uber ranges anywhere

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:01.350
from $800 million
to $95 billion,

00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:03.690
depending on the story you tell.

00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:05.350
When we get big
differences in value,

00:55:05.350 --> 00:55:06.680
it's not because the
numbers are different.

00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:08.730
It's because we have
different narratives.

00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:10.750
Not all of these narratives
are equally likely.

00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:12.791
And that's really the
question you've got to ask.

00:55:12.791 --> 00:55:16.460
It's, what is the right
narrative for my company?

00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:18.915
I promised I would
not talk about Google.

00:55:18.915 --> 00:55:20.540
But I will leave you
with this thought.

00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:23.760
If you're thinking about Google
as a company going forward,

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:25.860
as an investor, here's
the question I'm asking.

00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:28.290
What is the narrative I'm
telling about this company?

00:55:28.290 --> 00:55:30.250
What do I see this
company doing?

00:55:30.250 --> 00:55:33.530
Because that's what's going to
drive the valuation of Google,

00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:36.140
not the fact that because
of exchange rate movements,

00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:37.730
you did not deliver the growth.

00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:38.440
Who cares?

00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:40.630
In the larger scheme
of things, those things

00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:41.920
don't change your narrative.

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:44.720
If investors react to
it, let them react to it.

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:47.950
This is about telling
a story and delivering

00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:50.554
the kinds of decisions
that back up that story.

00:55:50.554 --> 00:55:51.220
That's about it.

00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:52.410
Thank you very
much for listening.

00:55:52.410 --> 00:55:53.490
If you have any
questions, I have

00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:55.440
a couple of minutes to
answer the questions.

00:55:55.440 --> 00:56:01.228
Yes. [APPLAUSE]

00:56:01.228 --> 00:56:02.722
AUDIENCE: I was wondering.

00:56:02.722 --> 00:56:08.698
You had these graphs
with distributions

00:56:08.698 --> 00:56:10.690
on what your valuations are.

00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:15.670
Have you done an analysis of how
accurate the distribution is,

00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:16.670
compared to--

00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:19.180
ASWATH DOMODARAN:
How would you do it?

00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:20.810
It's like nailing
Jello to a wall.

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:22.140
And here's what I mean by that.

00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:24.040
It's a very noisy process.

00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.150
This is a distribution
at a point in time.

00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:28.990
If I move forward a month
and I redo the distribution,

00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:31.060
the entire distribution
will shift.

00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:33.060
It's really not about the
distribution of value.

00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:35.970
It's about value versus price.

00:56:35.970 --> 00:56:38.170
So what you can look
at is, if you're

00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:41.760
right about values, the
price moving towards a value.

00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:43.760
In the case of Apple, it
turned out that it did.

00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:45.960
But it's a sample of one.

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:48.890
So it's almost an
article of faith.

00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:52.450
If you're an investor, you
believe that ultimately price

00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:53.330
moves towards value.

00:56:53.330 --> 00:56:54.990
There's no guarantee
that it will.

00:56:54.990 --> 00:56:56.214
So if you do your job.

00:56:56.214 --> 00:56:57.380
You collect the information.

00:56:57.380 --> 00:56:58.310
You make your best judgment.

00:56:58.310 --> 00:57:00.020
You estimate a value
in a distribution,

00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:02.634
and you decide, based
on it, to buy something.

00:57:02.634 --> 00:57:04.050
What you're checking
to see is not

00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:05.680
whether the value
gets delivered,

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:08.710
but whether the price
moves towards the value.

00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:09.940
And I believe it does.

00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:11.231
And that's why I stick with it.

00:57:11.231 --> 00:57:13.460
But it's a fact-based process.

00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:17.170
If it doesn't work,
you need to let it go.

00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:17.670
Yes?

00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:19.530
AUDIENCE: Was it ever
proven that price

00:57:19.530 --> 00:57:22.260
moves over the value?

00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:27.740
ASWATH DOMODARAN: Again,
ultimately, there's

00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:30.690
a reality here,
which is businesses--

00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:32.830
perception is fine.

00:57:32.830 --> 00:57:35.420
If you're valuing a Picasso,
or pricing a Picasso,

00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:36.970
it's all perception.

00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:39.420
If tomorrow we all woke up
and said, the guy can't paint.

00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:42.640
He's got a nose in
the wrong place.

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:45.310
But a business can't
be all perception.

00:57:45.310 --> 00:57:47.597
So price can deviate from
value for extended periods.

00:57:47.597 --> 00:57:49.680
It's not a question of
whether it moves the value.

00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:51.640
It's when it does.

00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:53.140
And that's really the debate.

00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:56.380
There are some people who say,
it takes so long to happen,

00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:58.684
that there's no point
even waiting for it.

00:57:58.684 --> 00:57:59.600
Those are the traders.

00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:01.310
They say, well look, I'm going
to make money in the next.

00:58:01.310 --> 00:58:02.940
If your time horizon
is six months,

00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:05.500
don't even waste your
time thinking about value.

00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:07.500
You have to play
the pricing game.

00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:10.140
So it's almost a given, when
you play the investor game,

00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:13.062
that you have a
longer time, or else.

00:58:13.062 --> 00:58:13.562
Yes.

00:58:13.562 --> 00:58:17.466
AUDIENCE: So a Google,
a lot of times,

00:58:17.466 --> 00:58:21.370
our valuation is first, because
we're making an acquisition.

00:58:21.370 --> 00:58:24.298
How do you mix in
the cost of bringing

00:58:24.298 --> 00:58:25.762
this whole team on board.

00:58:25.762 --> 00:58:27.912
And how to you incorporate
that into the valuation?

00:58:27.912 --> 00:58:29.870
ASWATH DOMODARAN: Well,
I think, at the right--

00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:32.460
I'll tell you what I think
about acquisitions in general,

00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:33.820
rather than speak about Google.

00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:36.700
At the right price, I
don't care who you buy.

00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:39.144
At the wrong price, I
don't care who you buy.

00:58:39.144 --> 00:58:40.560
Basically, at the
right price, you

00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:42.332
can buy the worst
possible target.

00:58:42.332 --> 00:58:43.790
And you're going
to come out ahead.

00:58:43.790 --> 00:58:46.086
At the wrong price, you
can do everything right,

00:58:46.086 --> 00:58:47.210
but you're already screwed.

00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:51.870
In acquisitions,
the problem I see

00:58:51.870 --> 00:58:55.080
is that we spend too much time
on finding the right target

00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:57.330
and doing all that neat
stuff where we fit stuff,

00:58:57.330 --> 00:59:01.799
and too little time asking,
what are we paying for that.

00:59:01.799 --> 00:59:02.340
You're right.

00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:05.257
After the acquisition, there's
all that post-acquisition work

00:59:05.257 --> 00:59:06.840
you have to do, to
deliver, especially

00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:09.048
if you're talking about
synergy, because that's often

00:59:09.048 --> 00:59:13.060
what drives your acquisitions
or whatever additional value

00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:13.810
it creates.

00:59:13.810 --> 00:59:16.190
So that requires that
you take the strengths

00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:19.190
of the company you've acquired
and add it onto your strengths,

00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.960
to deliver it.

00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:20.759
That requires work.

00:59:20.759 --> 00:59:22.300
And that's, I think,
the bottom line.

00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:24.210
It's not going to
happen magically.

00:59:24.210 --> 00:59:27.210
And that's why I prefer that it
be done before the acquisition,

00:59:27.210 --> 00:59:29.300
that you start
putting plans down

00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:31.670
of what you're going to
do, before the acquisition,

00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:34.430
rather than wait after the
fact, and say, oh my god.

00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:35.970
This is not going to work.

00:59:35.970 --> 00:59:38.030
So if you've got an
acquisition process.

00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:39.500
It's got to be disciplined.

00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:42.000
And it will work only if
you're willing to walk away

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.170
from the table, even
if it was the best

00:59:44.170 --> 00:59:47.564
target you've ever found,
but the price is too high.

00:59:47.564 --> 00:59:49.730
If you're never willing to
walk away from the table,

00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:53.090
you are going to overpay,
over and over again.

00:59:53.090 --> 00:59:55.640
And in too many big
companies, the problem I see

00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:59.570
is that the company decides
it's going to do an acquisition

00:59:59.570 --> 01:00:01.752
and then goes to the
bargaining table.

01:00:01.752 --> 01:00:04.070
You're in terrible
position to bargain,

01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:06.180
if you've already decided
you're going to do this.

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.763
Last question, then
I'm going to stop.

01:00:07.763 --> 01:00:10.822
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

01:00:10.822 --> 01:00:12.542
ASWATH DOMODARAN: Go ahead.

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:14.935
AUDIENCE: So I was curious.

01:00:14.935 --> 01:00:20.250
What is your take on an
individual investor, people

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:23.650
like us, who have
full-time jobs?

01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:27.576
And a lot of us are not MBAs
and not students of valuations.

01:00:27.576 --> 01:00:30.480
And the traditional,
conventional advice

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:32.430
is to buy at index point.

01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:33.680
I was just curious.

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.060
Do you endorse that?

01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:37.494
Or for someone who's
interested in learning,

01:00:37.494 --> 01:00:38.410
what do you recommend?

01:00:38.410 --> 01:00:40.284
ASWATH DOMODARAN: Well,
investing takes work.

01:00:40.284 --> 01:00:42.270
And if you don't have
the time for that work,

01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:44.010
it's probably best
not to put yourself

01:00:44.010 --> 01:00:46.000
at risk by doing
something because you

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.860
heard somebody say it.

01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:51.795
So my suggestion is, go with the
low-time-intensive investment

01:00:51.795 --> 01:00:52.295
strategy.

01:00:52.295 --> 01:00:54.570
It doesn't always have
to be an index fund.

01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:55.070
It

01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:58.280
Has to be some kind of--
you've got to spread your bets

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.540
and don't overreach.

01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:03.217
You don't get rich by investing.

01:01:03.217 --> 01:01:05.050
You get rich by doing
whatever you're doing.

01:01:05.050 --> 01:01:07.560
And investing is about
preserving what you

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.910
made elsewhere and growing it.

01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:12.021
It's when you get
greedy about trying

01:01:12.021 --> 01:01:13.645
to make that killing
on your investment

01:01:13.645 --> 01:01:15.700
that you tend to overreach.

01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:16.700
So I have to stop there.

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:18.560
Unfortunately, I
have a 4:18 train.

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.270
I wish this were not true.

01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:21.990
I'd have normally
stayed until 5 o'clock.

01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:25.910
So thank you very much
for listening. [APPLAUSE]
