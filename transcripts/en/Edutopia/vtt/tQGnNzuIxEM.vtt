00:00:09.326 --> 00:00:10.306
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Childhood obesity

00:00:10.456 --> 00:00:13.396
and related health problems have
been rising at an alarming rate

00:00:13.396 --> 00:00:17.336
across the country due in part to
the food choices kids have at school.

00:00:17.476 --> 00:00:22.366
&gt;&gt;Bonnie: You see things like frozen
pizza, fries, things that have a lot

00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.386
of preservatives, things
that have been processed.

00:00:25.286 --> 00:00:27.506
We don't do any of that.

00:00:27.816 --> 00:00:30.366
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In some schools, like
the Martin Luther King Middle School

00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:34.026
in Berkeley, California,
parents, teachers, administrators,

00:00:34.336 --> 00:00:38.026
and food-service providers are
demanding better-quality food

00:00:38.026 --> 00:00:38.826
for their children.

00:00:38.936 --> 00:00:42.556
&gt;&gt;Bonnie: The Berkeley Unified
school-lunch program started years

00:00:42.556 --> 00:00:47.586
ago with a number of families
who were really concerned

00:00:47.586 --> 00:00:51.246
about what was happening in
the public-school cafeterias.

00:00:51.696 --> 00:00:53.166
&gt;&gt;Narrator: 39 percent of students

00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.856
in the Berkeley Unified
School District receive free

00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:56.656
or reduced lunch.

00:00:57.296 --> 00:01:00.886
Including overhead, the food program
spends an average of 4 dollars

00:01:00.886 --> 00:01:04.206
and 50 cents per lunch, well
above the national average

00:01:04.206 --> 00:01:06.176
of 2 dollars and 91 cents.

00:01:06.736 --> 00:01:10.176
The program is able to make up the
difference and thrive with grants.

00:01:10.406 --> 00:01:12.546
&gt;&gt;Bonnie: There are a lot of people
and there are a lot of organizations

00:01:12.546 --> 00:01:15.146
that are invested in
children eating healthy.

00:01:15.256 --> 00:01:18.706
We applied for grants for
equipment, ovens, stoves,

00:01:19.136 --> 00:01:20.716
retherms, all sorts of things.

00:01:21.316 --> 00:01:22.046
The money is there.

00:01:22.046 --> 00:01:27.896
&gt;&gt;This is soy, and if you have the
right mixture, the right blends

00:01:27.976 --> 00:01:31.856
of seasonings and sauce,
everything, they love it.

00:01:31.856 --> 00:01:34.856
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Martin Luther King Middle
School also runs the nationally

00:01:35.076 --> 00:01:37.126
recognized Edible Schoolyard program,

00:01:37.776 --> 00:01:40.256
where students get
hands-on experience

00:01:40.256 --> 00:01:42.746
in their organic garden
and kitchen classroom.

00:01:43.076 --> 00:01:45.506
&gt;&gt;Now, where do you
think this came from?

00:01:45.506 --> 00:01:45.686
&gt;&gt;All: Garden.

00:01:45.786 --> 00:01:46.696
&gt;&gt;Right out there.

00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:49.216
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In this
integrated learning environment,

00:01:49.396 --> 00:01:53.466
teachers incorporate gardening
and food preparation into lessons

00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:55.236
in science, mathematics...

00:01:55.236 --> 00:01:57.646
&gt;&gt;Woman: If it calls for
one-and-a-half cups of cooked pumpkin

00:01:57.876 --> 00:01:59.686
and we're doubling the recipe,
then how much do we need?

00:02:00.216 --> 00:02:00.476
&gt;&gt;Three.

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:03.046
&gt;&gt;Narrator: ...history,
ecology, and culture.

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:05.406
&gt;&gt;See, just making it
hot, just toasting it,

00:02:05.636 --> 00:02:06.606
gives it a different flavor.

00:02:06.846 --> 00:02:08.326
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students
learn about the connection

00:02:08.326 --> 00:02:11.596
between their everyday food choices
and the health of the community,

00:02:11.596 --> 00:02:14.586
the environment, and themselves.

00:02:14.846 --> 00:02:18.746
&gt;&gt;Alice: This is a delicious
revolution that we're talking about.

00:02:18.816 --> 00:02:20.866
This isn't hard to do.

00:02:20.976 --> 00:02:25.626
If they grow it, they cook
it, they want to eat it.

00:02:26.066 --> 00:02:27.706
&gt;&gt;Bonnie: Our kids who participate

00:02:27.786 --> 00:02:32.896
in the garden cooking classes eat
three times more vegetables and fruit

00:02:32.996 --> 00:02:36.886
than kids who do not, and so the
proof is in the pudding, as they say.

00:02:36.986 --> 00:02:37.236
&gt;&gt;Beautiful!

00:02:37.236 --> 00:02:39.286
Now we're going to bring
it right over here.

00:02:39.666 --> 00:02:41.886
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Along with
lots of veggies and fruits,

00:02:41.986 --> 00:02:45.816
King Middle serves up kid favorites
like pizza and mac and cheese.

00:02:46.346 --> 00:02:48.976
But here, there is a nutritious
twist on foods kids love.

00:02:49.286 --> 00:02:51.706
&gt;&gt;Bonnie: We make our
macaroni and cheese here fresh.

00:02:51.876 --> 00:02:54.526
We boil 300 pounds
of pasta to do that.

00:02:54.766 --> 00:03:00.836
We make a low-fat cheese sauce with
fresh cheese and Organic Valley milk.

00:03:01.216 --> 00:03:03.166
It's completely healthy.

00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:04.146
It is not processed.

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:04.816
It is sustainable.

00:03:04.866 --> 00:03:05.566
It is local.

00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:09.716
It's something that anybody can do,
and the kids absolutely love it.

00:03:10.296 --> 00:03:12.936
&gt;&gt;Caleb: I think that King is setting
a good example for other schools

00:03:13.136 --> 00:03:14.996
to have a more healthier lifestyle.

00:03:16.966 --> 00:03:18.966
Like, the healthy food
actually can taste good.

00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:22.546
I mean, I really enjoy the food here.

00:03:22.546 --> 00:03:26.076
&gt;&gt;Bonnie: To replicate this
program, it takes a community

00:03:26.076 --> 00:03:30.766
that demands real food that is
healthy, nutritious, and sustainable

00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:33.236
in their communities, and they have
to stand up for it and they have

00:03:33.236 --> 00:03:34.756
to stand up and make a
lot of noise about it.

00:03:35.046 --> 00:03:41.226
