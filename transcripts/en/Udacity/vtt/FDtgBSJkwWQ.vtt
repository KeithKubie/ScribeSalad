00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.083
For the first inequality, we can just subtract 1 from both sides, and we get x

00:00:04.094 --> 00:00:08.250
is less than or equal to 8. The second inequality is a little harder. First we

00:00:08.262 --> 00:00:12.240
add 2 to both sides, then we divide by a negative 1. Remember, when I divide

00:00:12.252 --> 00:00:16.347
here, I need to reverse my inequality sign. So I get x is greater than or equal

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.360
to 5. For compound inequalities though, this doesn't necessarily mean the

00:00:21.372 --> 00:00:26.120
answer. We want to figure out which numbers satisfy this condition, and this

00:00:26.132 --> 00:00:29.335
condition. Let's see if we can figure that out next.
