00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 align:start position:0%
they're trying to remake the film but
 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
they're trying to remake the film but
there's<00:01:51.090><c> a</c><00:01:51.150><c> tone</c><00:01:51.540><c> in</c><00:01:51.930><c> it</c><00:01:52.200><c> that's</c><00:01:52.410><c> a</c><00:01:52.530><c> little</c><00:01:52.680><c> bit</c>

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 align:start position:0%
there's a tone in it that's a little bit
 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.370 align:start position:0%
there's a tone in it that's a little bit
off<00:01:53.070><c> it's</c><00:01:53.640><c> a</c><00:01:53.790><c> little</c><00:01:54.030><c> more</c><00:01:54.210><c> fun</c><00:01:54.630><c> and</c><00:01:54.930><c> silly</c>

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
off it's a little more fun and silly
 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.930 align:start position:0%
off it's a little more fun and silly
than<00:01:55.770><c> the</c><00:01:55.860><c> original</c><00:01:56.340><c> which</c><00:01:56.490><c> was</c><00:01:56.670><c> a</c><00:01:56.700><c> lot</c><00:01:56.910><c> more</c>

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
than the original which was a lot more
 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.969 align:start position:0%
than the original which was a lot more
serious<00:01:57.810><c> and</c><00:01:58.020><c> a</c><00:01:58.080><c> little</c><00:01:58.229><c> bit</c><00:01:58.350><c> more</c><00:01:58.500><c> dreadful</c>

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 align:start position:0%
serious and a little bit more dreadful
 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.890 align:start position:0%
serious and a little bit more dreadful
so<00:01:59.220><c> this</c><00:01:59.369><c> film</c><00:01:59.580><c> sometimes</c><00:01:59.880><c> comes</c><00:02:00.360><c> off</c><00:02:00.600><c> that</c>

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 align:start position:0%
so this film sometimes comes off that
 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
so this film sometimes comes off that
way<00:02:01.080><c> it</c><00:02:01.200><c> comes</c><00:02:01.380><c> off</c><00:02:01.560><c> a</c><00:02:01.590><c> little</c><00:02:01.920><c> cheesy</c>

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 align:start position:0%
way it comes off a little cheesy
 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
way it comes off a little cheesy
sometimes<00:02:02.880><c> but</c><00:02:03.210><c> they're</c><00:02:03.330><c> still</c><00:02:03.600><c> trying</c><00:02:03.869><c> to</c>

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 align:start position:0%
sometimes but they're still trying to
 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes but they're still trying to

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 align:start position:0%
depict the same intense thing to the
 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.969 align:start position:0%
depict the same intense thing to the

the real problem of this movie is the
 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.740 align:start position:0%
the real problem of this movie is the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 align:start position:0%
tone I think that it's trying to depict
 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
tone I think that it's trying to depict
really<00:02:28.710><c> intense</c><00:02:29.190><c> serious</c><00:02:29.850><c> events</c><00:02:30.270><c> that</c><00:02:30.720><c> would</c>

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 align:start position:0%
really intense serious events that would
 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.230 align:start position:0%
really intense serious events that would
traumatize<00:02:31.200><c> your</c><00:02:31.980><c> average</c><00:02:32.310><c> person</c><00:02:32.610><c> but</c><00:02:33.090><c> the</c>

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
traumatize your average person but the
 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.830 align:start position:0%
traumatize your average person but the
tone<00:02:33.510><c> of</c><00:02:33.540><c> the</c><00:02:33.810><c> film</c><00:02:33.840><c> is</c><00:02:34.440><c> kind</c><00:02:34.920><c> of</c><00:02:35.070><c> fun</c><00:02:35.670><c> like</c><00:02:36.480><c> and</c>

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
tone of the film is kind of fun like and
 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.420 align:start position:0%
tone of the film is kind of fun like and
so<00:02:37.050><c> it</c><00:02:37.320><c> doesn't</c><00:02:37.620><c> really</c><00:02:37.710><c> it</c><00:02:38.040><c> doesn't</c><00:02:38.190><c> really</c>

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't really it doesn't really
 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.190 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't really it doesn't really
mesh<00:02:38.700><c> well</c><00:02:39.030><c> and</c><00:02:39.330><c> so</c><00:02:39.510><c> when</c><00:02:39.630><c> these</c><00:02:39.720><c> really</c><00:02:40.050><c> bad</c>

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
mesh well and so when these really bad
 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.900 align:start position:0%
mesh well and so when these really bad
things<00:02:40.500><c> are</c><00:02:40.650><c> happening</c><00:02:40.790><c> sometimes</c><00:02:41.790><c> the</c>

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 align:start position:0%
things are happening sometimes the
 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.310 align:start position:0%
things are happening sometimes the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
audience was actually laughing a little
 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.570 align:start position:0%
audience was actually laughing a little

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 align:start position:0%
bit and I think it's because the
 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
bit and I think it's because the
