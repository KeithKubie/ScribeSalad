00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:02.429
they called themselves

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.650
the autocrat the aristocrat

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.870
the acrobat and the scribe

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.880
we actually don't know too much about them

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.330
the name of the scribe we do know, and she was
Helen Augusta Whittier

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.599
and she grew up in Lowell Massachusetts

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.409
she and a group of her friends

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:25.479
set out one day in July of 1891

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:32.059
from Rose Warf in Boston and from there
they were met by a

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:33.740
a man they called

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.090
William the Swedish lobstermen

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.720
and he took them out to Great Brewster Island
where they set up housekeeping

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.060
so the album itself is really a wonderful
celebration and commemoration of this trip

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.120
just you open it up and you feel is if
you can hear the fog horn and smell the sea

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.940
and it's very very evocative.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.360
Now, this volume came to our attention through

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.580
John Stilgoe who's a professor at Harvard in 
the department of visual and environmental

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.310
studies.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.750
Doctor Stilgoe was interested in the volume
because he's very interested in the built

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.930
and natural environment of the seashore and
how people interacted with those environments

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:20.850
and

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.400
particularly many of his students were interested
in how women interacted with the built

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:32.110
and natural environment along the coast and
this was a perfect example of that.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.490
There's a wonderful passage in the book here
 where they're coming back from a walk

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.420
'turning to descend this steep bluff

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.159
we see before us our own beloved Brewster
stretching out a friendly arm towards the 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:45.830
narrows

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.700
to bear aloft a torch for the incoming ships
when night envelopes all in darkness.'

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.820
I don't know, it makes me think that when we
go on vacations we should be doing something

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.000
like this. I go to an island in Maine in the
summer and 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.060
every summer I think

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.540
well I should be encapsulating this too and
making little drawings and photographs

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.239
and I think 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.859
historians in the future will be much the
poorer if we don't.
