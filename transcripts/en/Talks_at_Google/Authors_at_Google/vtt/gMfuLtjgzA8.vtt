00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.140
MALE SPEAKER:
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.620
Six days ago, astronaut
Mark Whatrey--

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.370
ANDY WEIR: Watney.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.420
MALE SPEAKER: --became
one of the first men

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.920
to walk on the surface of Mars.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.390
Now he may be the
first man to die there.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.870
Will he?

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.040
Andy Weir's brilliant
debut novel, "The Martian,"

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.920
is a gripping story of
survival against all odds.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.480
The astronaut is stranded
millions of miles

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.310
from the nearest human
being with no way

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.450
to even signal Earth
that he is alive.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.450
And even if you he
could get word out,

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.600
his food would be gone years
before a rescue mission could

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.230
arrive.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.940
Andy Weir, he's our neighbor
here in Mountain View,

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.450
a longtime programmer.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.880
He got his first job at 15 years
of age at Sandia National Labs.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.030
He wrote code for Warcraft II.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.010
And he's now working
at MobileIron,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.129
where he's working
on Android codes.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.250
And actually, we talked a little
bit how he likes the platform,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.110
and he didn't have
too many complaints.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.370
I guess this is kudos to you
guys from the Android group.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:23.080
I am pleased to present
the book, "The Martian."

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.920
Andy will be talking
to us today about it

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.140
and showing some of the
technical details that

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.460
went into the book.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.960
And please give a warm welcome.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.487
ANDY WEIR: So, like he
said, I'm Andy Weir.

00:01:40.487 --> 00:01:41.570
And I wrote "The Martian."

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.177
I'm going to be talking
to you about that today.

00:01:45.177 --> 00:01:47.260
When they told me that I'd
be doing a Google Talk,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.910
they said, you're
going to want to make

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.820
about 40 minutes of content.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.910
I don't think I'm going to
make 40 minutes of content.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.850
But I'll just say what I have
to say until I'm out of stuff

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.570
to say, and then
I'll take questions.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.500
So you just got the
summary of the book.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.320
But I'm going to do a reading.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.490
I'm going to start us
off with a reading.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.820
And then I'm going to
start talking about some

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.520
of the technical stuff that
went into making the book.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.000
The reading's going to
be about 10 minutes.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.410
And it's just the first chapter.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.620
So it's about four
or five pages.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.035
Also, the reading will
include profanities.

00:02:20.035 --> 00:02:21.670
I hope nobody's
bothered by that.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.560
I don't see any
children out there.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.630
So I'm just going
to jump right in.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.680
Log entry, Sol 6.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.150
I'm pretty much fucked.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.570
That's my considered opinion.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.094
Fucked.

00:02:33.094 --> 00:02:35.760
Six days into what should be the
greatest two months of my life,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.380
and it's turned
into a nightmare.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.530
I don't even know
who'll read this.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.196
I guess someone will
find it eventually,

00:02:40.196 --> 00:02:41.420
maybe 100 years from now.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.506
For the record, I
didn't die on Sol 6.

00:02:43.506 --> 00:02:45.380
Certainly the rest of
the crew thought I did.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.374
And I can't blame them.

00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:48.540
Maybe there'll be a day of
national mourning for me.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.290
And my Wikipedia page
will say Mark Watney

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.650
is the only human being
to have died on Mars.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.870
And it'll be right, probably.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.170
Because I'll surely die here.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.780
Just not on Sol 6 when
everyone thinks I did.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.330
Let's see.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.570
Where do I begin?

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.037
The Ares program-- mankind
reaching out to Mars

00:03:02.037 --> 00:03:04.370
to send people to another
planet for the very first time

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.972
and expand the horizons of
humanity, blah, blah, blah.

00:03:06.972 --> 00:03:09.180
The Ares 1 crew did their
thing and came back heroes.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.580
They got the parades and
fame and love of the world.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.999
Ares 2 did the same thing in
a different location on Mars.

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:16.040
They got a firm handshake
and a hot cup of coffee

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.300
when they got home.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.030
Ares 3?

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.230
Well, that's my mission.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.370
Well, not mine, per se.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.620
Commander Lewis was in charge.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.160
I was just one of her crew.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.642
Actually, I was the very lowest
ranked member of the crew.

00:03:25.642 --> 00:03:27.350
I would only be in
command of the mission

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.860
if I were the only
remaining person.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.776
Hey, what do you know?

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:31.400
I'm in command.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.900
I wonder if this
log'll be recovered

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.749
before the rest of the
crew die of old age.

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:36.540
I presume they got back
to Earth all right.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.460
Guys, if you're reading
this, it wasn't your fault.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.660
You did what you had to do.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.630
In your position, I would
have done the same thing.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.340
I don't blame you.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.423
And I'm glad you survived.

00:03:45.782 --> 00:03:47.740
I guess I should explain
how Mars missions work

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.580
for any laymen who
may be reading this.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.121
We got to Earth orbit the normal
way through an ordinary ship

00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:52.914
to "Hermes."

00:03:52.914 --> 00:03:54.330
All the Ares
missions use "Hermes"

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.480
to get to and from Mars.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.754
It's really big and it cost a
lot, so NASA only built one.

00:03:58.754 --> 00:04:01.170
Once we got to "Hermes," four
additional unmanned missions

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.520
brought us fuel and supplies
while we prepared for our trip.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.520
Once everything was a
"go," we set out for Mars,

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.594
but not very fast.

00:04:06.594 --> 00:04:08.260
Gone are the days of
heavy chemical fuel

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.320
burns and trans-Mars
injection orbits.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.792
"Hermes" is powered
by ion engines.

00:04:11.792 --> 00:04:13.500
They throw argon out
the back of the ship

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.930
really fast to get a tiny
amount of acceleration.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.079
The thing is it doesn't
take much reactant mass.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.940
So a little argon and a
nuclear reactor to power things

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.261
let us accelerate constantly
the whole way there.

00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:24.760
You'd be amazed how
fast you can get

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.762
going with a tiny
acceleration over a long time.

00:04:27.762 --> 00:04:29.970
I could regale you with
tales of how we had great fun

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.132
on the trip, but I won't.

00:04:31.132 --> 00:04:32.840
I don't feel like
re-living it right now.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.080
Suffice it to say we
got to Mars 124 days

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.970
later without
strangling each other.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.560
From there we took the
MDV, Mars Descent Vehicle,

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.560
to the surface.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.980
The MDV is basically a big
can with some light thrusters

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.100
and parachutes attached.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.320
Its sole purpose is to get
six humans from Mars orbit

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.199
to the surface without
killing any of them.

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.490
And now we come to the real
trick of Mars exploration--

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.370
having all your shit
there in advance.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.850
A total of 14 unmanned
missions deposited everything

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.392
we would need for
surface operations.

00:04:56.392 --> 00:04:58.183
They tried their best
to land on the supply

00:04:58.183 --> 00:05:00.819
vessels in the same general area
and did a reasonably good job.

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:02.610
Supplies aren't nearly
so fragile as humans

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.170
and can hit the
ground really hard,

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.829
but they tend to
bounce around a lot.

00:05:05.829 --> 00:05:07.370
Naturally they didn't
send us to Mars

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.160
until they confirmed that
all the supplies had made it

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.368
to the surface and their
containers weren't breached.

00:05:11.368 --> 00:05:13.330
Start to finish,
including supply missions,

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.520
a Mars mission takes
about three years.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.890
In fact, there were Ares 3
supplies en route to Mars

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.441
while the Ares 2 crew
were on their way home.

00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:22.940
The most important piece of the
advance supplies, of course,

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.314
was the MAV, the
Mars Ascent Vehicle.

00:05:25.314 --> 00:05:26.980
That's how we would
get back to "Hermes"

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.720
after surface operations
were complete.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.070
The MAV was soft landed
as opposed to the balloon

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.705
bounce fest the
other supplies had.

00:05:32.705 --> 00:05:35.080
Of course, it was in constant
communication with Houston,

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.910
and if there had been
any problems with it,

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.770
we would have passed by Mars and
gone home without ever landing.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.070
The MAV is pretty cool.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.930
It turns out through a neat
set of chemical reactions

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.388
with the Martian atmosphere,
for every kilogram of hydrogen

00:05:45.388 --> 00:05:48.074
you bring to Mars, you can
make 13 kilograms of fuel.

00:05:48.074 --> 00:05:49.240
It's a slow process, though.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.050
It takes 24 months
to fill the tank.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.290
That's why they sent it
long before we got there.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.706
You can imagine
how disappointed I

00:05:54.706 --> 00:05:57.352
was when I discovered
the MAV was gone.

00:05:57.352 --> 00:05:59.560
It was a ridiculous sequence
of events that led to me

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.851
almost dying, and an even
more ridiculous sequence that

00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:02.770
led to me surviving.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.144
The mission is
designed to handle

00:06:04.144 --> 00:06:06.539
sandstorm gusts
of up to 150 KPH.

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:08.080
So Houston got
understandably nervous

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.670
when we got whacked
with 175 KPH winds.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.420
We all got in our
flight suits and huddled

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.711
in the middle of the Hab just
in case it lost pressure.

00:06:14.711 --> 00:06:16.180
But they Hab wasn't the problem.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.289
The MAV is a spaceship.

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:18.580
It has a lot of delicate parts.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.496
It can put up with storms
to a certain extent,

00:06:20.496 --> 00:06:22.340
but it can't just get
sand blasted forever.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.131
After an hour and a
half of sustained wind,

00:06:24.131 --> 00:06:25.340
NASA gave the order to abort.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.547
Nobody wanted to stop a
month-long mission after only

00:06:27.547 --> 00:06:29.680
six days, but if the MAV
took any more punishment,

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.350
we'd have all gotten
stranded down there.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.960
We had to go out in the storm
to get from the Hab to the MAV.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.251
And that was going to be risky.

00:06:36.251 --> 00:06:37.590
But what choice did we have?

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.290
Everyone made it but me.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.520
Our main communications
dish, which relayed signals

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.680
from the Hab to "Hermes,"
acted like a parachute getting

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.940
torn from its foundation and
carried with the torrent.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.770
Along the way, it crashed
through the reception antenna

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:48.299
array.

00:06:48.299 --> 00:06:49.840
Then one of those
long, thin antennae

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.270
slammed into me end first.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.540
It tore through my suit like
a bullet through butter.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.494
And I felt the worst pain in my
life as it ripped open my side.

00:06:56.494 --> 00:06:58.410
I vaguely remember having
the wind knocked out

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.910
of me-- pulled out
of me, really--

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.785
and my ears popping
painfully is the pressure

00:07:01.785 --> 00:07:02.630
in my suit escaped.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.546
The last thing I remember
was seeing Johanssen

00:07:04.546 --> 00:07:06.680
hopelessly reaching
out toward me.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.520
I awoke to an oxygen
alarm in my suit,

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.270
a steady obnoxious
beeping that aroused me

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.660
from a deep and profound
desire to just fucking die.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:15.560
The storm had abated.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.800
I was face down, almost
totally buried in sand.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.210
As I groggily came
to, I wondered

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.119
why I wasn't more dead.

00:07:21.119 --> 00:07:22.660
The antenna had
enough force to punch

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.020
through the suit
and my side, but it

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.310
had been stopped by my pelvis.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.976
So there was only one
hole in the suit--

00:07:26.976 --> 00:07:29.430
and a hole in me, of course.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.900
I'd been knocked
back quite a ways

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.108
and rolled down a steep hill.

00:07:32.108 --> 00:07:33.490
Somehow I landed
face down, which

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.620
forced the antenna into a
strongly oblique angle that

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.453
put a lot of torque on
the hole in the suit.

00:07:37.453 --> 00:07:38.610
It made a weak seal.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.110
Then the copious
blood from my wound

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:41.230
trickled down toward the hole.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.200
As the blood reached the site
of the breach, the water in it

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.700
quickly evaporated from the
air flow and low pressure,

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.374
leaving a gunky residue behind.

00:07:47.374 --> 00:07:49.790
More blood came in behind it
and was also reduced to gunk.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.450
Eventually it sealed
the gaps around the hole

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.824
and reduced the
leak to something

00:07:52.824 --> 00:07:54.680
the suit could counteract.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.374
The suit did its job admirably.

00:07:56.374 --> 00:07:58.165
Sensing the drop in
pressure, it constantly

00:07:58.165 --> 00:08:00.584
flooded itself with air from
my nitrogen tank to equalize.

00:08:00.584 --> 00:08:02.250
Once the leak became
manageable, it only

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.040
had to trickle new air in
slowly to relieve the air lost.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.989
After a while, the CO2, carbon
dioxide, absorbers in the suit

00:08:07.989 --> 00:08:10.280
were expended That's really
the limiting factor to life

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.530
support-- not the amount of
oxygen you bring with you,

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.340
but the amount of
CO2 you can remove.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.620
In the Hab, I have the
oxygenator, a large piece

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.284
of equipment that breaks apart
CO2 to give the oxygen back.

00:08:20.284 --> 00:08:21.950
But the space suits
have to be portable.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.790
So they use a simple
chemical absorption

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.580
process with expendable filters.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.304
I'd been asleep long enough
that my filters were useless.

00:08:28.304 --> 00:08:30.720
The suit saw this problem and
moved into an emergency mode

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.309
the engineers call
"bloodletting."

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:33.929
Having no way to
separate the CO2,

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:36.470
the suit deliberately vented
air into the Martian atmosphere,

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:37.940
then back-filled with nitrogen.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.340
Between the breach
and the bloodletting,

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.659
it quickly ran out of nitrogen.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:42.846
All it had left
was my oxygen tank.

00:08:42.846 --> 00:08:44.970
So it did the only thing
it could to keep me alive.

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.678
It started back-filling
with pure oxygen.

00:08:46.678 --> 00:08:49.084
I now risked dying
from oxygen toxicity

00:08:49.084 --> 00:08:50.750
as the excessively
high amount of oxygen

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.250
threatened to burn up my nervous
system, lungs, and eyes--

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.791
an ironic death for someone with
a leaky space suit, too much

00:08:55.791 --> 00:08:56.571
oxygen.

00:08:56.571 --> 00:08:59.070
Every step of the way would
have had beeping alarms, alerts,

00:08:59.070 --> 00:08:59.630
and warnings.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.055
But it was a high oxygen
morning that woke me.

00:09:02.055 --> 00:09:04.680
The sheer volume of training for
a space mission is astounding.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.200
I'd spent a week back on Earth
practicing emergency spacesuit

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:07.700
drills.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:08.622
I knew what to do.

00:09:08.622 --> 00:09:10.330
Carefully reaching
the side of my helmet,

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:11.220
I got the breach kit.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.490
It's nothing more than a funnel
with a valve at the small end

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.780
and an unbelievably sticky
resin on the white end.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.284
The idea is you have
the valve open and stick

00:09:18.284 --> 00:09:19.450
the white end over the hole.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:20.710
The air can escape
through the valve

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.900
so it doesn't interfere with
the resin making a good seal.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.920
Then you close the valve,
and you've sealed the breach.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.990
The tricky part was getting
the antenna out of the way.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.290
I pulled it out as
fast as I could,

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.581
wincing as the sudden pressure
drop dizzied me and made

00:09:30.581 --> 00:09:32.649
the wound in my side
scream in agony.

00:09:32.649 --> 00:09:34.690
I got the breach kit over
the hole and sealed it.

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:35.320
It held.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.960
The suit back-filled the missing
air with yet more oxygen.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.100
Checking my arm readouts, I saw
the suit was now at 85% oxygen.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.690
For reference, Earth's
atmosphere is about 21%.

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:46.690
I'd be OK so long as I didn't
spend too much time like that.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:48.470
I stumbled up the
hill back to the Hab.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:49.810
As I crested the
rise, I saw something

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:51.351
that made me very
happy and something

00:09:51.351 --> 00:09:52.270
that made me very sad.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:53.310
The Hab was intact.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:53.900
Yay!

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.005
And the MAV was gone.

00:09:55.005 --> 00:09:55.505
Boo!

00:09:58.729 --> 00:10:00.520
Right at that moment,
I knew I was screwed.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.200
But I didn't want to just
die out on the surface.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.500
I limped back to the Hab
and fumbled my way out

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.560
into an airlock.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.552
As soon as it equalized,
I threw off my helmet.

00:10:07.552 --> 00:10:09.135
Once inside the Hab,
I doffed the suit

00:10:09.135 --> 00:10:10.922
and got my first good
look at the injury.

00:10:10.922 --> 00:10:11.880
It would need stitches.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.504
Fortunately, all of
us had been trained

00:10:13.504 --> 00:10:16.000
in basic medical
procedures and the Hab

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.819
had excellent medical supplies.

00:10:17.819 --> 00:10:20.110
A quick shot of a local
anesthetic, irrigate the wound,

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:21.440
nine stitches, and I was done.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.440
I'd be taking antibiotics
for a couple of weeks,

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.774
but other than that I'd be fine.

00:10:24.774 --> 00:10:26.523
I knew it was hopeless,
but I tried firing

00:10:26.523 --> 00:10:27.720
up the communications array.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.704
No signal, of course.

00:10:28.704 --> 00:10:30.870
The primary satellite dish
had broken off, remember?

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.260
And it took the reception
antennae with it.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.660
The Hab had secondary and
tertiary communication systems,

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.118
but they were both
just for talking

00:10:37.118 --> 00:10:39.630
to the MAV, which would use
it's much more powerful systems

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:40.505
to relay to "Hermes."

00:10:40.505 --> 00:10:43.420
The thing is, that only works
if the MAV is still around.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.870
I had no way to
talk to "Hermes."

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.610
In time, I could locate
the dish on the surface,

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:48.420
but it would take weeks for
me to rig up any repairs

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:49.544
and that would be too late.

00:10:49.544 --> 00:10:52.134
In an abort, "Hermes" would
leave within 24 hours.

00:10:52.134 --> 00:10:54.300
The orbital dynamics made
the trip safer and shorter

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.260
the earlier you left.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.566
So why wait?

00:10:56.566 --> 00:10:58.190
Checking out my suit,
I saw the antenna

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.910
had plowed through my
biomonitor computer.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.421
When on an EVA, all
the crew's suits

00:11:01.421 --> 00:11:03.420
are networked so we can
see each other's status.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.550
The rest of the crew would have
seen the pressure in my suit

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:07.216
drop to nearly zero
followed immediately

00:11:07.216 --> 00:11:09.090
by my biosigns going flat.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.477
Add to that, watching me
tumble down a hill with a spear

00:11:11.477 --> 00:11:13.060
threw me in the
middle of a sandstorm?

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.460
Yeah, they thought I was dead.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.192
How could they not?

00:11:16.192 --> 00:11:17.900
They may have even
had a brief discussion

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.270
about recovering my body,
but regulations were clear.

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.737
In the event a crewman dies
on Mars, he stays on Mars.

00:11:22.737 --> 00:11:25.320
Leaving his body behind reduces
weight for the MAV on the trip

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:25.690
back.

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:27.815
That means more disposable
fuel and a larger margin

00:11:27.815 --> 00:11:29.320
of error for the return thrust.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.640
No point in giving that
up for sentimentality.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.930
So that's the situation.

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:33.840
I'm stranded on Mars.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.650
I have no way to communicate
with "Hermes" or Earth.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:36.840
Everyone thinks I'm dead.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.860
I'm in a Hab designed
to last 31 days.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.789
If the oxygenator breaks
down, I'll suffocate.

00:11:40.789 --> 00:11:43.080
If the water reclaimer breaks
down, I'll die of thirst.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.060
If the Hab breaches, I'll
just kind of explode.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:46.560
If none of those
things happen, I'll

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.518
eventually run out of
food and starve to death.

00:11:48.518 --> 00:11:49.743
So yeah, I'm fucked.

00:11:49.743 --> 00:11:50.689
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:50.689 --> 00:11:56.370
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:57.780
So that's chapter one.

00:11:59.895 --> 00:12:01.770
Of the things that was
really important to me

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.395
in writing this was
I wanted everything

00:12:03.395 --> 00:12:05.960
to be as scientifically
accurate as possible.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.510
So for starters,
all the technology

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.690
mentioned in the book is real.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.360
It takes place in
a slight future,

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.530
so some of the technology is
much more efficient or much

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.200
more effective than the
versions of it we have now.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.970
But it all actually exists.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.600
And what I'm going
to talk to you today

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.225
about-- being a Google
crowd, I thought

00:12:24.225 --> 00:12:26.225
you might be interested
in some software I wrote

00:12:26.225 --> 00:12:29.880
to make one part of it
as accurate as possible.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.890
It has to do with the way that
"Hermes" got from Earth to Mars

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:34.200
and back.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.124
"Hermes" is an ion engine ship.

00:12:36.124 --> 00:12:38.540
And for those of you who don't
know what ion engines are--

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.640
I mean, I described it
briefly in the chapter--

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.864
but basically, instead
of a chemical propellant

00:12:43.864 --> 00:12:45.530
going out the back
of the ship providing

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.340
a large amount of impulse,
it's a very small amount

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.450
of acceleration caused
by magnetic fields

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:52.370
throwing ions out
the back of the ship.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:54.600
Now the benefit to
this is that you

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.190
can have much, much,
much less reactant mass.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.970
And I believe-- and this is
just my own subjective opinion--

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:03.476
we have to improve on the
technology that we have

00:13:03.476 --> 00:13:04.600
and just keep working that.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.975
I think that's
the only way we'll

00:13:05.975 --> 00:13:09.920
be able to send humans long
distances out into space.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.520
The amount of
chemical propellant

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.830
you would need to send
something big enough

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:17.890
to support humans for
several months out to Mars

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:19.780
would just be huge, huge.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.700
I mean, you'd be putting
millions and millions

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.670
of kilograms of just fuel
into space to do this.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.690
So you need to
minimize how much you

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.930
launch from Earth to
make that efficient.

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:32.810
So that means for "Hermes,"
I decided, oh, OK,

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:35.400
so it's got a slow constant
acceleration from ion engines.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.780
It's got a nuclear
reactor aboard

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.470
to create the energy necessary
to throw the particles.

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:44.990
And so that means I needed to
figure out how it gets there.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:47.500
And it turns out for a point
acceleration, when you just

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.230
say, oh, I want to go on
a transfer orbit from here

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.020
to here.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.730
And then there'll be
a point thrust here,

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.320
and then another
point thrust here

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.710
to match Mars, boom,
that's how we do it.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:57.690
It's very simple.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:59.850
Well, I mean, for
a dork like me who

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:02.260
likes orbital dynamics,
that's very simple.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.520
With a constantly accelerating
ship, that's very hard.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.230
I could not wrap my
head around the math.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:08.590
I couldn't find
anybody who could

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:09.964
wrap their heads
around the math.

00:14:09.964 --> 00:14:12.080
And what I found out by
doing further research

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.900
is NASA does this by
computer simulation.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:15.900
So that's what I did.

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:21.452
I wrote this program
called Orbits.

00:14:21.452 --> 00:14:22.910
I don't how well
that's showing up.

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:23.701
Let me take a look.

00:14:23.701 --> 00:14:24.950
Are you able to see?

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:26.100
Yeah, you can kind of see.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.770
It's a little darker
than I'd like.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:33.070
But this-- well, I've got
a mouse-- this circle here,

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.180
this red circle, is Mars' orbit.

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.240
The blue circle
is Earth's orbit.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.270
And the gray line is
the course of the ship.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:44.940
So the way this works is I can
mess around with the vector

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.940
that the ship is presenting
with respect to the sun.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.290
So in other words, if I were
to point it directly away

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:55.060
from the sun, then I can
show where that vector's

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.747
going to be anywhere
along the trip.

00:14:56.747 --> 00:14:58.830
You see how it's always
pointed away from the sun?

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.640
The red vector that's
following the mouse?

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.980
That's how this works.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.260
And so I can do
something like this.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.280
I can point it-- well,
directly toward the sun

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.530
leads to your immediate death.

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:11.052
But point it, say,
perpendicular to the sun,

00:15:11.052 --> 00:15:12.510
you can see it's
just always trying

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.210
to go perpendicular to the sun.

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.140
So what I wanted
to do here is, say,

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.750
this is the start
point of Earth.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.794
And as you see, if
I move along, it

00:15:19.794 --> 00:15:21.210
shows me where
Earth and Mars will

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:24.150
be as they're going
along in their orbits

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:28.170
from my chosen launch window.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:31.180
And then the idea is
to try to find a way

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:38.940
to make this get to Mars
with course changes and stuff

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.690
and work that out.

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:45.210
This would not be
a successful trip.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:48.230
But after all a whole bunch of
work and just fiddling around

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:52.930
with it, I managed to figure out
this path that actually starts

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:56.380
here, then intercepts
Mars, and then

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.630
doesn't do any thrusting
or anything for a while.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:00.290
It's just at Mars.

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:02.460
And then comes back to Earth.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.980
I also set up this
app to animate.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:08.860
So I can just press Space,
and you can watch it happen.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.770
There it goes to
Mars, hangs out there

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.420
for their planned
31-day mission,

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:17.040
and then comes back
to Earth like that.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] a year.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:21.310
ANDY WEIR: It takes a
little bit more than a year.

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.351
I don't know if you can
read it up in the corner.

00:16:23.351 --> 00:16:27.680
Mission day 396 is
when it completes.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.230
Now, then, as I
mentioned in the book,

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:35.390
they had to abort after only six
days on Mars due to the storm.

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.510
And I mentioned,
the orbital dynamics

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.680
make it cheaper the
earlier you leave.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.560
And this is why.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.440
Because if you
leave earlier, you

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.140
can take a slightly
different course

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.080
and get back to Earth earlier.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.180
And that's, of course,
what anybody would want.

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:52.940
Any NASA mission
designer worth their salt

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.920
would want to do
something like this.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.910
Another thing I did
was-- it came up

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.720
a lot in the story-- I
wanted the transmission

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.820
times to be accurate.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.970
So when later on in the story
they're talking to the ship,

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:09.420
they're talking to Mars,
Mars is talking to Earth,

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.010
all these entities
are communicating,

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:13.839
and I wanted to know what the
transmission time would be.

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:16.849
So I set it up so that
wherever the ship is--

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:20.040
I can just move the
mouse around and wherever

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.030
I'm pointing on that-- it'll
tell you what mission day it is

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:24.869
and what the current
distances are

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:26.663
between Earth and Mars,
Earth and "Hermes,"

00:17:26.663 --> 00:17:27.579
and "Hermes" and Mars.

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:30.890
Those are those three numbers up
top, and the light transmission

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.850
time between them
so that I could

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:36.090
have that be accurate
in the story, too.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:38.790
So I'm going to give a
little bit of a spoiler here.

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:42.640
The final path that "Hermes"
ends up taking is this.

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:46.750
And so--

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:48.333
AUDIENCE: It looks
like the other one.

00:17:50.546 --> 00:17:52.420
ANDY WEIR: So I am giving
a bit of a spoiler,

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.920
but basically they have
to go back to Mars.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:59.420
And so I'll describe what
happens as it's happening.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:00.120
Here they go.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.300
They're going to Mars.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.480
After six Sols,
they have to abort.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.220
So they're headed back to Earth.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.490
They need to go back to Mars.

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:10.910
Boom, sling shot off of
Earth, back around the sun.

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:13.124
And now they need to
do a flyby of Mars.

00:18:13.124 --> 00:18:14.790
So they're not going
into orbit, they're

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:16.710
just-- doink-- doing a flyby.

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:19.065
And then we got to
get back to Earth.

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:29.450
So that was a lot of
work to figure that out.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.620
And this is all done
within this simulation,

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.790
this ship "Hermes," has a
total constant acceleration

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:37.340
of the two millimeters
per second per second.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:38.010
That's it.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.680
That's all it gets.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.850
So yeah, after five
seconds of doing that,

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:46.960
it would be moving one
centimeter per second.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.560
So that's the software I wrote
that I wanted to show off.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:56.611
I thought the Google crowd would
like to see how that works.

00:18:56.611 --> 00:18:57.860
And that's about it, actually.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.080
That's all I really
had to show you.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.410
I was going to do the reading.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:02.800
What are we at here?

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.985
Oh, 20 minutes in.

00:19:06.692 --> 00:19:07.900
AUDIENCE: I really like that.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.630
So that's great.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:13.550
And it seems beyond
what you had to do.

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:16.130
Are the orbits elliptical?

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.230
And could they be skewed?

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.710
ANDY WEIR: Those are the
actual orbits of Earth and Mars

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:22.090
correctly oriented.

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:23.756
And the launch window--
I won't tell you

00:19:23.756 --> 00:19:26.510
the date because I may have a
contest someday to have people

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:30.430
figure out the launch date from
the information in the book--

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:32.940
but it is based on
a real-world date.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:38.120
And to be thorough,
the book tells you

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.570
what day everything is on.

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:41.560
So it's like, log entry, Sol 6.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.250
Log entry, Sol 27.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:44.760
Log entry, Sol 412.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:45.770
Whatever.

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:48.360
So it's actually very
time specific, just

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.210
the narrative style it has.

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:53.590
And so I made sure that I knew
the actual real-world date

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:56.600
for each-- on any given
day in the book, what

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.790
the real-world date is so that
I could mention things like, oh,

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:01.040
by the way, today's Christmas.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.940
And it is.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.250
There were sometimes
I had to keep myself

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:07.040
from over clever-ing things.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.440
There was one kind of major
plot point that happened.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.370
And I'm looking
at my spreadsheet.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:13.920
And I'm like, oh, this happens
to be on Valentine's Day.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.960
I should mention that.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.930
But it would just seem
stupid to the reader.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:18.590
It would be like out of nowhere
someone's like, by the way,

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:20.020
it's Valentine's Day.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.950
It's like, no, that's just dumb.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.840
The trickiest part in this
was I did all sorts of math.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.570
I checked all my physics,
math, science, everything.

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:32.257
And the hard part was not
bragging to the reader.

00:20:32.257 --> 00:20:34.590
It was not showing my work
and trying to go, look at me.

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:35.445
I'm so cool.

00:20:35.445 --> 00:20:37.320
I just needed to keep
the story moving along.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.611
And I wanted it to be accurate.

00:20:38.611 --> 00:20:39.120
That's all.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.870
AUDIENCE: So I read the
book about a year ago.

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:43.789
What I enjoyed the
most about it were

00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:45.080
two things about the character.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.230
One was how resourceful he is.

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:50.790
He always figures out how
to get out of his situation.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.620
The other was his attitude.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:53.700
He's cut off.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:54.700
He has so many setbacks.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.033
And he always keeps his head up.

00:20:56.033 --> 00:20:57.600
I was wondering,
was there anything

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.750
that inspired you to make
a character like that?

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.374
Or was there any kind
of message you're

00:21:01.374 --> 00:21:03.710
trying to send to make
somebody so resourceful and so

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:06.710
optimistic in such
a bad situation?

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:09.440
ANDY WEIR: Well, I
mean, I tried to make

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.610
it a pretty upbeat book.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:12.806
It could've been really
dark and depressing, right?

00:21:12.806 --> 00:21:14.180
It's like the guys
trapped alone.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.840
He could be just having
this crippling psychological

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.560
problems of loneliness
and all these other things

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.930
that most people would face.

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:23.050
I figure I can buy
my way out of that

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.510
by saying he's an astronaut.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:26.190
Astronauts are a cut above.

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:28.350
And so he doesn't
sink into depression.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:30.320
He just goes into
problem-solving mode.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.790
And I made him this really
flippant, smart-ass personality

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:36.140
because I had to
tell a whole story.

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:40.430
If I'd done just
blank narration, just

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:43.550
omniscient narration even,
it would have just seemed

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:47.190
like a technical manual or a
really dry sequence of events.

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.550
I needed something in
the narration itself

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:51.600
that would keep the
user interested.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.655
And so having it told by a
self-effacing smart-ass seemed

00:21:54.655 --> 00:21:55.679
liked a good idea.

00:21:55.679 --> 00:21:57.720
AUDIENCE: So I'm thinking
about buying this book.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.110
ANDY WEIR: $10 right over there.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:00.290
AUDIENCE: How do you
think I should buy it?

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:00.956
ANDY WEIR: I think you should
buy one for all your friends.

00:22:00.956 --> 00:22:02.530
AUDIENCE: It's $10
right over there,

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:05.090
but there's also a lot
of digital distribution

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:06.070
around these days.

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:09.010
Do you have thoughts as
an author about that?

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:10.420
And what works best for you?

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:12.250
What do you like as a reader?

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:15.307
And what do you think about
ebooks in general as an author?

00:22:15.307 --> 00:22:17.640
ANDY WEIR: Well, ebooks are
how I got into the industry,

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.590
so I'm extremely grateful.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:21.800
I think they're great.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.900
And as for buying a
physical book or an ebook,

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.780
that's a matter of
personal choice.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.930
I still read physical
books, but that's

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.620
just because I'm
kind of a Luddite.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.470
Eventually, I will
get a proper e-reader.

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:36.080
And then I'll probably be
hooked on that from then on.

00:22:38.654 --> 00:22:40.570
For those of you who
don't know, "The Martian"

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:42.240
was originally
just a serial story

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.080
that I was posting
to my website just

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.830
as a hobby doing
in my spare time.

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.430
And then I finished
and some people

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:51.970
said, hey, I don't like
reading this on web pages.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:54.387
Can you put it up
in an ebook format?

00:22:54.387 --> 00:22:55.220
And so I'm like, OK.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.759
So I made an EPUB
and MOBI version.

00:22:56.759 --> 00:22:58.800
And I posted them on the
website and said, there.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:22:59.000
There you go.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.640
Free download,
knock yourself out.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.880
And then some people
were like, well,

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.480
I'm not really
technically savvy.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.300
And I don't know how to
get an ebook downloaded

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.280
from the internet
onto my Kindle.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.380
Is there a way you can
just put it up on Kindle?

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:13.760
And so I looked into it.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.824
And anybody can post
their stuff onto Kindle.

00:23:16.824 --> 00:23:18.990
Which is important-- remember
that-- because anybody

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:20.720
who wants to be a
writer, you just can.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.036
You can just write your
story, post it on Kindle.

00:23:24.036 --> 00:23:25.410
All they do is
they check to make

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:28.870
sure there's nothing illegal or
really, really evil about what

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:30.180
you're posting.

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:34.100
And so I posted it up on Kindle.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.720
But Amazon is not a charity.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.970
They're in this to make money.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:39.520
They have a minimum
price that you're

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.780
allowed to charge,
which is $0.99,

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:43.490
or at least it was at the time.

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:46.080
And so I said, OK, I'll
set the price at $0.99.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.867
I'm not allowed to charge less.

00:23:47.867 --> 00:23:49.450
And I told everybody,
hey, here it is.

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:51.590
It's $0.99 because I can't
charge less than that.

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:52.470
Just look at it this way.

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:54.344
If you want to pay $1
to have it conveniently

00:23:54.344 --> 00:23:57.720
delivered to your Kindle,
that's what you're paying for.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:01.690
I got $0.30 or something
out of that per copy.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:03.940
I mean, I was not doing
this for the money.

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:07.100
And then that's when
I learned how deep

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:11.550
Amazon's reach into the
readership market is.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:15.440
Many, many, many more people--
many multiples more people--

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.560
bought it from Amazon than
downloaded it for free

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:19.120
from my site.

00:24:21.954 --> 00:24:22.870
AUDIENCE: Such a deal.

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:23.828
ANDY WEIR: Such a deal.

00:24:23.828 --> 00:24:25.690
I'm like, OK.

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:28.420
And that caused
it to start making

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.960
its way up the top
sellers charts.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.120
And then once it got into
the top 10 on sci-fi,

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.411
then it started to really sell.

00:24:34.411 --> 00:24:36.840
Because of course, people
are like, I want a sci-fi.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.080
What's in the top 10?

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.610
So once you break
into that list,

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:43.312
your sales go really well.

00:24:43.312 --> 00:24:44.770
And it sold well
enough that it got

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:48.600
the attention of a guy
named Julian Pavia at Random

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.310
House, who was an editor there.

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:51.919
And he said, I like this book.

00:24:51.919 --> 00:24:54.460
I think I want to talk to this
reader and offer a print deal.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:56.668
But first I'm going to run
it by a colleague of mine,

00:24:56.668 --> 00:24:58.919
a guy named David Fugate,
who is a literary agent.

00:24:58.919 --> 00:25:00.710
He said, hey, why don't
you read this book,

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:01.920
tell me what you
think, and do you

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.711
think I should offer
this guy a print deal?

00:25:03.711 --> 00:25:06.480
David read it and said,
I think it's good.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.230
I think you should
offer him a print deal.

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:09.010
Now hang on a second.

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:10.385
I'm going to go
become his agent.

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.002
So he did.

00:25:14.002 --> 00:25:15.460
And then he turned
around and said,

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:18.350
so Julian, let's talk money.

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.030
So that was pretty cool.

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:23.390
So my whole experience
with publishing

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:26.430
has been completely backwards.

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:30.360
I wrote what I intended
to be just a free thing

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.020
and then got forced
to charge for it.

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:33.870
And then an agent came
knocking at my door.

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:36.510
And then a publisher came
offering me a contract.

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:38.850
And I did nothing to
promote it ever, by the way.

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:40.700
All I ever did was just post it.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:43.350
I didn't even try
to go to forums

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:45.780
or do events or anything
to get people to read it.

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.820
It just spread by word of mouth.

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:52.110
So the long-ass winded
answer to your question

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:58.690
is I'm a big fan of digital
books because that made me.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:01.780
Sorry, one last addendum--
and it can make anyone.

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.480
That's what I think
is awesome, is

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.045
it's become a pure meritocracy.

00:26:05.045 --> 00:26:07.460
It used to be sort of
an old-boy network.

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:10.700
You had to know somebody to get
into the publishing industry

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:11.200
at all.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.770
Or you had to dedicate your
life to doing scutt work

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:16.520
and working your way
up through journalism

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.395
until someone would take
you seriously enough

00:26:18.395 --> 00:26:21.430
even to consider reading your
book at a publishing house.

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:23.890
But now you can post it yourself
with no intervening steps

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:26.970
and, if it's good,
people will buy it.

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:32.330
AUDIENCE: So your ion drive,
is the reaction mass just small

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:35.890
enough so that you don't
account for the change

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:37.680
in how much acceleration
it can give?

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.940
ANDY WEIR: I cheated.

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.265
The answer is it
wouldn't quite be.

00:26:41.265 --> 00:26:42.140
It wouldn't quite be.

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.056
And the simulation could
have accounted for it

00:26:44.056 --> 00:26:46.190
since it's doing
incremental-- every step,

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:48.850
I think I had it do it
in one-hour segments

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:50.900
to run the simulation forward.

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.900
And so I could have
accounted for the mass loss.

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:54.120
It is very small.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:57.620
It's on the order of-- I
can't remember exactly-- it

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.510
was on the order of 10% of
the ship's mass, though.

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.190
Normally if you
were going to do--

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:05.885
to get to Mars using
a Hohmann transfer,

00:27:05.885 --> 00:27:09.240
it would take five
kilometers per second delta

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.520
V, which would be
for a ship like this

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.270
that I later defined as
being 110,000 kilograms,

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:17.610
would be millions and
millions of kilograms of fuel.

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:21.010
I mean, the vast majority of
the starting mass would be fuel.

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:24.180
And so once I checked
the specific impulse

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.020
of ion engines,
it's so much better

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:29.580
than I just said, eh,
I'll approximate it out.

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:31.580
AUDIENCE: In talking about
how to read the book,

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:33.705
I wanted to put in a plug
for the audio book, which

00:27:33.705 --> 00:27:35.044
I listened to.

00:27:35.044 --> 00:27:36.460
It's a great way
to experience it.

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.860
I think you got a really
wonderful narrator.

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.170
ANDY WEIR: Yeah, the
narrator's name is RC Bray.

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:42.590
And he's a veteran narrator.

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:46.120
He's done over 100
books, I think.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.780
And he's got a
really good voice.

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:50.182
And he puts a lot
of feeling into it.

00:27:50.182 --> 00:27:51.640
And since this is
first-person, you

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.660
can kind of feel, OK, this
is Mark's voice, basically.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.820
AUDIENCE: The one thing I wanted
to ask about that was there

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.105
are a couple of technical
terms that he, let's say,

00:28:00.105 --> 00:28:01.180
mispronounces that--

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:02.140
ANDY WEIR: Yep, yep.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.800
AUDIENCE: --kind of take you
out of the story for a moment.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:03.970
ANDY WEIR: What?

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:05.820
You don't know about
the ASC2 standard?

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.903
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the ASC2
standard is the best one.

00:28:07.903 --> 00:28:09.885
ANDY WEIR: ASC2.

00:28:09.885 --> 00:28:12.880
Yep.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.560
AUDIENCE: But you get past that.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.643
ANDY WEIR: Well, so what
I wanted to do, actually,

00:28:16.643 --> 00:28:21.280
was make my own mapping
standard for letters to numbers.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.420
And I was going to call it ASC.

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.710
And then I'd make an improved
version and call it ASC2.

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:28.910
And that way I'd
retroactively be correct.

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:31.789
No, yeah, he messed that up.

00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:33.330
Which is funny
because they called me

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:36.410
for a bunch of pronunciations
on, OK, what is this?

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:37.410
And how's it pronounced?

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:38.770
How do people say this?

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:43.640
But nobody ever asked me
how to pronounce ASCII.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.470
They are making a
new version of it,

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:47.710
which I'm not sure
if it's out yet.

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:49.400
But they're re-recording
it from scratch

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.850
because there were a
lot of edits and changes

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:53.660
between the original
Kindle version

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.080
and what's releasing now.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.530
No significant plot
changes, nothing like that,

00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:00.120
but a lot of the wording.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.150
It's much more polished.

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:06.570
And it's much better now thanks
to Julian at Random House.

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:11.150
And so the audio book guys,
Podium Publishing, decided,

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:12.980
well, we'll re-record
it from scratch.

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:17.330
And I told them, A-S-C-I-I-
is pronounced AS-key.

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:21.097
So I think they'll get it
right in the newer version.

00:29:21.097 --> 00:29:23.180
AUDIENCE: So I listened
to the audio version, too.

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:25.110
I really liked it.

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:31.330
So there was a lot in the
book about NASA politics

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:35.610
and what happened inside NASA.

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:37.060
Did you just dream that up?

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.796
Or did you know
somebody on the inside?

00:29:38.796 --> 00:29:39.670
Or how did that work?

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:42.639
ANDY WEIR: Made it all up.

00:29:42.639 --> 00:29:43.930
AUDIENCE: It sounded very real.

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:44.930
ANDY WEIR: I thought so.

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:48.160
Well, I've worked for
the government before.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.960
As he mentioned, my first
job was Sandia National Labs

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:56.430
as a little weaselly computer
programmer at age 15,

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:58.560
as opposed to the
41-year-old weaselly computer

00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:59.960
programmer I am now.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:04.270
And I just saw how
things worked there.

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:07.400
And I said, like, well,
NASA's a big federal agency.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.290
So was Sandia.

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:12.580
So I'll just assume that
they're kind of similar.

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.785
But, yeah, I made all that up.

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:21.810
I had no contact with NASA
or astronauts or anyone

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:23.810
in the industry at all
before writing the book.

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:25.810
And I've since gotten a
lot of emails from them.

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:27.351
And they say that
that's about right.

00:30:31.779 --> 00:30:33.320
AUDIENCE: Not really
a question, I'll

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.810
just note that
besides Amazon Kindle,

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:39.475
it's also available
at Google Play Books.

00:30:39.475 --> 00:30:40.410
ANDY WEIR: All right.

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:41.124
There you go.

00:30:41.124 --> 00:30:42.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.248
ANDY WEIR: It's also available
on barnesandnoble.com.

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:49.170
MALE SPEAKER: Andy, what's
on your reading list?

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:51.110
ANDY WEIR: What's
on my reading list?

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:54.550
I really like to read the old
classic sci-fi stuff, which

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:57.460
I've read before and just
keep reading again and again.

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.480
So Heinlein, Clarke,
Asimov, that sort of thing.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:01.860
Those are my favorite authors.

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:04.860
And then also anything by
Terry Pratchett, completely out

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.920
of the sci-fi world,
but Terry Pratchett.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.860
Also I really like
Robert Asprin.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:12.450
But he died.

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:14.412
But that apparently
didn't stop him

00:31:14.412 --> 00:31:15.870
from making new
books because I see

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:19.310
there's a new release
that's by Robert Asprin.

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:21.560
And I'm not sure
how that happened.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.284
So either someone
else has taken up

00:31:23.284 --> 00:31:24.700
the role of writing
Robert Asprin.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:25.199
Books.

00:31:25.199 --> 00:31:27.440
Or it's some manuscript
he was partially through,

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.896
or I don't know.

00:31:28.896 --> 00:31:30.520
AUDIENCE: So right
after "The Martian,"

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.895
I read-- speaking
of old sci-fi--

00:31:31.895 --> 00:31:35.660
if I read "When Worlds Collide,"
which is from 1933, I think.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.190
And the jump from
scientific accuracy

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:42.571
to scientific hand-waving
was never so great.

00:31:42.571 --> 00:31:43.820
Because there was a spaceship.

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:44.470
And they fly.

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:47.405
And they just sort of say, yeah,
let's build a spaceship now.

00:31:47.405 --> 00:31:48.780
And we'll fly to
this new planet.

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:49.695
And that'll work.

00:31:49.695 --> 00:31:51.230
ANDY WEIR: It seems reasonable.

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:53.770
Or when they're like--
oh, I never read the book

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:55.660
but I saw the movie
from the '50s--

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.990
and they land their
spaceship on the new planet,

00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:59.480
the one that just destroyed
Earth, and they're like,

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.190
well, let's go outside.

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:00.800
And they're like, what?

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.380
You don't know if the
atmosphere is good.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:03.921
And it's like, well,
if it's no good,

00:32:03.921 --> 00:32:06.410
we're all going to die anyway.

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:07.850
Yeah, it's good.

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:10.515
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:10.515 --> 00:32:12.140
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
speaking of old sci-fi,

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.740
there was a couple of the
early Doc Smith novels

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:17.070
that had roughly the
same set-up-- guy

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:19.250
crashes on an
outer system planet

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:24.090
and has to build up civilization
until he can make a radio.

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:25.290
Have you read any of those?

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:28.640
And can you bring yourself to
having done the research now?

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:31.440
ANDY WEIR: I did not
read any of those.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.290
As for the research, that was
just really important to me.

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:37.590
I just wanted to be as
accurate as I possibly could.

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:39.422
There are a few places
that are inaccurate.

00:32:39.422 --> 00:32:40.880
The biggest place
that's inaccurate

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.260
is right at the beginning.

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:46.350
Don't tell anybody, but if
you're in a dust storm on Mars,

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:47.820
you're not even
going to feel it.

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:50.290
Mars' atmosphere is
less than 1% of Earth's.

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:53.360
So a 150 kilometer an
hour wind would feel

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.190
like about a 1 kilometer
an hour wind does on Earth.

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:57.780
It wouldn't do any
damage to anything.

00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:59.760
Shh.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.090
I had other ways of doing it.

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:04.930
I had an idea where the MAV
would have some sort of failure

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:07.440
that caused an explosion
which does all the damage.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.730
And they're short on
time because the MAV fuel

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:11.480
tank is leaking, so
they need to lift off.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.521
And they're sure Mark's
dead and stuff like that.

00:33:13.521 --> 00:33:17.945
But most people don't know
how Martian dust storms work.

00:33:17.945 --> 00:33:19.570
Most people don't
realize that it's not

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:20.910
like being in a sand blaster.

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:22.451
And it's just more
dramatic that way.

00:33:22.451 --> 00:33:24.220
So I just made that concession.

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.360
I know I'm a liar.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.870
I just wanted that more.

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:30.580
It was more dramatic.

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:36.310
AUDIENCE: So there used to be a
sci-fi story by George Landis.

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:40.505
The title was "A
Walk in the Sun."

00:33:40.505 --> 00:33:42.130
There was an accident,
and an astronaut

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:45.360
has to survive by her
own on the moon for one

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.360
month until rescuers arrive.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.410
So that's very similar
to this set-up.

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:50.245
Have you read that?

00:33:50.245 --> 00:33:51.120
ANDY WEIR: I haven't.

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:51.855
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:33:51.855 --> 00:33:54.430
ANDY WEIR: But
basically "The Martian"

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:57.942
can be described as Robinson
Crusoe on Mars, right?

00:33:57.942 --> 00:33:59.400
Except for there
was a movie called

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.922
"Robinson Crusoe on
Mars," and my story

00:34:01.922 --> 00:34:03.255
does not have a monkey sidekick.

00:34:05.867 --> 00:34:07.867
AUDIENCE: You should
consider a monkey sidekick.

00:34:07.867 --> 00:34:09.320
Yeah, are you considering one?

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.486
ANDY WEIR: There should
have been a monkey sidekick.

00:34:11.486 --> 00:34:12.190
I see that now.

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:15.660
AUDIENCE: If they adapt this
for Hollywood, [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:18.035
ANDY WEIR: There's clearly
going to be a monkey sidekick.

00:34:18.035 --> 00:34:19.786
There would have to be.

00:34:19.786 --> 00:34:21.480
Well, they might adapt
it for Hollywood.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.310
20th Century Fox optioned
the movie rights.

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:25.639
So they could make a movie.

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:26.677
We'll see.

00:34:26.677 --> 00:34:28.760
AUDIENCE: The most important
question, when can we

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.065
expect another book from you?

00:34:30.065 --> 00:34:31.689
ANDY WEIR: Well, I'm
working on a pitch

00:34:31.689 --> 00:34:33.070
right now for my next book.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:35.487
But I've been so
busy with the-- it's

00:34:35.487 --> 00:34:37.070
real busy for a
writer around the time

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:38.850
his book comes out,
let me tell you.

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:40.790
So I've been doing
stuff related to that.

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:43.801
But as soon as things calm
down, I'll work on the pitch.

00:34:43.801 --> 00:34:45.800
And then if they like it,
I'll start writing it.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.760
And it'll probably
take me maybe a year.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.135
AUDIENCE: Or you could just
self-publish it and put it up

00:34:50.135 --> 00:34:51.560
on Amazon if they don't like it.

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:56.100
ANDY WEIR: If Random House
gives me a bunch of money,

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.940
they're going to want me
not to put it up for free.

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.109
AUDIENCE: Not
free, but you know.

00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:02.400
As long as you write something.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.670
I mean, seriously,
this is the best

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:04.920
book I've read in a long time.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.110
ANDY WEIR: Well, thank you.

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:07.000
Glad you liked it.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.075
AUDIENCE: I will say I'm
only halfway through it.

00:35:09.075 --> 00:35:11.760
But that's got to be
the best first line

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:15.928
since "it was a dark
and stormy night."

00:35:15.928 --> 00:35:16.922
ANDY WEIR: Thank you.

00:35:19.909 --> 00:35:21.950
I figure you have one line
to convince the reader

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:23.267
to read the first paragraph.

00:35:23.267 --> 00:35:24.850
And you have one
paragraph to convince

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:26.310
them to read the first page.

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:27.934
And if they read the
first page, you've

00:35:27.934 --> 00:35:29.860
probably got them
for a while anyway.

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:32.150
But that first
line is important.

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.740
AUDIENCE: I was going
to say, partially

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:35.114
to what you were saying before,
even if the atmosphere is

00:35:35.114 --> 00:35:37.830
really thin but it's blowing
around chunks of sand,

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:40.200
wouldn't the mass of the sand
moving at that speed still

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.117
cause a lot of damage?

00:35:41.117 --> 00:35:43.408
ANDY WEIR: Right, but the
sand that it's blowing around

00:35:43.408 --> 00:35:45.574
in a dust storm is basically
like talcum powder.

00:35:45.574 --> 00:35:46.490
AUDIENCE: Fair enough.

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:47.740
ANDY WEIR: It's not
like big granules.

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:49.615
AUDIENCE: The actual
question I was going ask

00:35:49.615 --> 00:35:51.860
is how much of the ending
and sort of storyboard

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:53.730
was known when you
started the book,

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:56.197
and how much was made
up as you went along?

00:35:56.197 --> 00:35:58.280
ANDY WEIR: Most of it was
made up as I went along.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.190
I had some ideas for
how the ending would go.

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:02.580
And it didn't go that way
because it didn't make sense

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.640
with how the story developed.

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:09.440
They say there are two kinds
of writers-- the plotters

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:11.264
and the pantsers, right?

00:36:11.264 --> 00:36:13.680
Plotters work everything out
in an outline format and say,

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:14.460
this is what's going to happen.

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:16.880
Pantsers are like, eh,
let's just see what happens.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.910
And I'm the latter, for sure.

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:21.055
So at the end, I
had this in my mind

00:36:21.055 --> 00:36:22.930
the whole time I'm
writing the book is here's

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:23.950
what the final
scene's going to be.

00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:24.940
And it's going to be awesome.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:25.770
Here's how it's going to be.

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:26.936
And it couldn't be that way.

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.920
AUDIENCE: So related to
that, your protagonist

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.607
has to overcome a
lot of problems.

00:36:34.607 --> 00:36:35.440
So which came first?

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.930
The problems that you'd have
to find a clever solution for?

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:39.080
Or you came up with
the solution and said,

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.410
how do I get in that situation?

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:41.460
ANDY WEIR: I would
start with the problems.

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:43.779
What I wanted to do
was have the problems--

00:36:43.779 --> 00:36:45.820
I didn't want him to just
get struck by lightning

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:48.740
over and over, figuratively.

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:52.120
I didn't want there to
be too many coincidences.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.360
So I wanted all of his
problems to either derive

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.360
from the fact that he's
using outdated equipment,

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.060
or that he's using
equipment in ways

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.830
that it wasn't
intended to be used.

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:02.910
So the solution to
his previous problem

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:05.190
would often cause
the next problem.

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:08.050
And so I would try to come
up with the problems first.

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:09.610
Then I'd come up
with the solutions.

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:12.980
The cool thing is, though,
being a writer I can cheat.

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:15.670
So every now and then,
I'd get him into trouble,

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:17.420
and I'd be like, he
can't get out of this.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:18.196
He's going to die.

00:37:18.196 --> 00:37:19.820
OK, I'm going to go
back a few chapters

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:23.942
and put in some stuff that,
oh, and this leads to that

00:37:23.942 --> 00:37:24.900
and this leads to that.

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.240
And here's this thing
that he'll have access

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.072
to which can solve this problem.

00:37:30.072 --> 00:37:32.530
AUDIENCE: I don't know how much
insight you have into this,

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:35.509
but which of your
sales channels seems

00:37:35.509 --> 00:37:37.050
to be doing best in
this day and age?

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:40.540
So I've found the book
on [INAUDIBLE] blog

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:43.457
and read it in
the last few days.

00:37:43.457 --> 00:37:45.040
How much does that
sort of thing help?

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.646
And electronic versus physical?

00:37:47.646 --> 00:37:49.270
ANDY WEIR: The answer
is, I don't know.

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:55.130
I do know that right now, in
this release-- so it released

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:56.940
officially two
days ago, so we're

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:59.210
just right at the
beginning-- I do know

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:01.730
that the digital
version is outselling

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:02.720
the physical version.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:12.690
That's usually the case early
on because there's still

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:16.530
pipelining and delivery
hiccups here and there

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:17.710
for various bookstores.

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:21.140
And we also don't get a lot of
our reports from bookstores.

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.000
But anyway, more
specific than that,

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.060
when it comes down
to how did somebody

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:27.010
end up at the page
where they buy it?

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:27.710
I don't know.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:31.360
I don't have that data.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.531
AUDIENCE: But you do
think that posting

00:38:33.531 --> 00:38:35.550
to whatever was a good idea?

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:39.880
ANDY WEIR: Oh, well, so that was
mostly-- in fact, all of that--

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.810
was arranged by Random House's
marketing and publicity.

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:44.875
So they said, like,
then they arranged it

00:38:44.875 --> 00:38:50.091
with the site owners and blogs
and stuff like that, and said,

00:38:50.091 --> 00:38:51.590
we'd like you to
be on all of these.

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:54.180
Let's see which ones of them
are interested in having you.

00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:57.160
And they do that
kind of matchmaking.

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:59.150
I have this big
folder full of what

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:01.844
I called homework, just essays
and articles and things that I

00:39:01.844 --> 00:39:03.510
write, which was one
of the reasons I've

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:07.822
been too busy to work
on the next book.

00:39:07.822 --> 00:39:09.530
AUDIENCE: So do you
still have a day job?

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:11.130
Or are you now a
full-time writer?

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:12.050
ANDY WEIR: I still
have a day job.

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:13.000
I work for MobileIron.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.370
I am an Android programmer.

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:21.460
And I've warned everybody at
my company so they know this.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:24.742
If I get an advance for this
next novel that I'm pitching,

00:39:24.742 --> 00:39:26.200
then I'm going to
quit the day job.

00:39:29.182 --> 00:39:31.390
AUDIENCE: Maybe you don't
know the specifics of this,

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:37.520
but what with the vagaries of
having been published twice,

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:42.110
are you eligible for
next year's Hugos?

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:45.060
ANDY WEIR: I don't know.

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:48.122
I hadn't thought
about awards at all.

00:39:48.122 --> 00:39:51.914
(WHISPERING) I'll find out.

00:39:51.914 --> 00:39:54.080
AUDIENCE: What did you think
of the movie "Gravity"?

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.040
ANDY WEIR: I liked it a lot.

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.250
I thought it was really
beautiful cinematography,

00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:57.990
first off.

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:02.640
And it had a bunch
of accuracy problems.

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:06.120
But, I mean, you
can't get too picky.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:10.070
It wasn't supposed to be
a space station tutorial.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:12.770
It was supposed to
be an exciting movie.

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:13.530
And what was it?

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:17.080
Like for one thing,
ISS and the Hubble

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:19.890
are in orbits that are
nowhere near each other,

00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:21.200
nowhere near the same velocity.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:26.340
In fact, NASA did, at one
point, try to arrange a mission

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:28.607
where they would repair
the Hubble from ISS.

00:40:28.607 --> 00:40:30.690
And they could not find
any way to make that work.

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:36.280
So there are few
errors in "Gravity,"

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.790
but I liked it a lot.

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:40.740
It is kind of inconvenient,
though, because I released

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:42.620
"The Martian" before
"Gravity" came out.

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:44.581
I wrote it all before
"Gravity" came out.

00:40:44.581 --> 00:40:46.080
Now the re-release
of "The Martian,"

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:49.172
people are like, oh, hey,
this is like "Gravity."

00:40:49.172 --> 00:40:51.000
I'm like, no,
"Gravity"'s like me.

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:57.209
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering, did you

00:40:57.209 --> 00:40:58.750
manage to get any
input on the cover?

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:00.520
I mean, it looks really nice.

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:01.810
ANDY WEIR: Thanks.

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:03.990
That's actually funny.

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:06.260
I didn't like it.

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:10.230
And they said, hey, here's
the cover we're going to go.

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:11.605
The Random House's
art department

00:41:11.605 --> 00:41:14.400
said-- here's this
whole big thing

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.030
that they did-- and
they said, here it is.

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:19.650
And I said, I don't like it.

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:21.330
But everybody else does.

00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:23.450
So I'm glad I was wrong.

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:24.790
Or I'm glad-- how do I put it?

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:26.130
I'm glad I didn't have any say.

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:32.290
Although I did point
out one problem.

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:36.350
Originally, in the-- that's an
actual photo of an astronaut

00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:39.430
who is on a space shuttle
mission at the time

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:40.550
this photo was taken.

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:43.370
I mean, obviously all the
red stuff is Photoshopped.

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:46.010
But in his helmet, you
could see the reflection

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:48.180
of the space shuttle cargo bay.

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:49.390
And I pointed that.

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:50.360
I'm like, nah.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:53.790
So they fixed that.

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:55.590
AUDIENCE: What would you prefer?

00:41:55.590 --> 00:42:00.720
ANDY WEIR: I imagined--
well, the Dutch cover--

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.140
so every language
that's selling-- it's

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:05.390
getting translated
into 21 languages

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:09.160
and pretty much every one of
them has their own cover art.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:11.900
And the Dutch cover is
kind of what I liked.

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:15.800
It's just basically a
lone figure, very small,

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.910
like, in the middle there and
just big, empty Martian scenery

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:22.070
just to show there's
isolation and stuff.

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:23.540
And I thought that was cool.

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:25.460
But this is like--
there are actually

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.662
websites that just judge
books by their cover.

00:42:27.662 --> 00:42:29.120
Like that's literally
what they do.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:29.619
They say--

00:42:29.619 --> 00:42:32.594
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:32.594 --> 00:42:34.010
Literally all they
do is they say,

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:36.160
like, we're rating
covers of new release,

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.820
not the content of
the book, nothing.

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:41.690
Just think of them as
artistic analysis websites.

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:44.200
And they loved the
cover of "The Martian."

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:45.950
AUDIENCE: By the way,
great title, too.

00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:47.379
ANDY WEIR: Thanks.

00:42:47.379 --> 00:42:49.420
Yeah, a lot of people will
say, oh, like pro tip,

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:52.140
there's no actual
Martians in this.

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:53.280
There's no aliens.

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:57.230
He's the Martian, you see,
because he's stuck there.

00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:59.960
MALE SPEAKER: Tell me,
so how did you actually

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:04.144
start to think about writing
a story of somebody on Mars?

00:43:04.144 --> 00:43:05.810
I know we talked a
little bit about this

00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:07.680
before the talk itself.

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:10.400
We're sort of an Apollo
generation type of thing.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:14.210
But what was that
moment that's, hey,

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:15.820
I'm going to write
a story about Mars.

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:16.720
Why?

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:19.190
ANDY WEIR: Well,
dork that I am, I

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:22.700
was imagining how a manned
Mars mission could work.

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:25.700
And so I was just trying
to say, realistically,

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.810
how do you get the
astronauts to Mars?

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:30.160
How do you build a ship
big enough to support them?

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.251
How does that work?

00:43:31.251 --> 00:43:32.250
How do you get it there?

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:34.416
That's why I had use ion
engines because it was just

00:43:34.416 --> 00:43:35.754
too implausible otherwise.

00:43:35.754 --> 00:43:37.670
It's like once they're
there, what do they do?

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:39.380
How do they get back?

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.780
And, oh, you could send all
the supplies in advance.

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:45.244
It uses heavily from
Mars Direct, which is--

00:43:45.244 --> 00:43:46.410
MALE SPEAKER: Zubrin's plan.

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:49.460
ANDY WEIR: Yeah,
Zubrin's suggested

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:52.360
way of doing a Mars
mission, which if and when

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:54.094
we have a Mars mission
in the real world,

00:43:54.094 --> 00:43:56.510
it will almost certainly be
something very much like that.

00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:59.910
Anyway I was considering all
the things that could go wrong.

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:01.560
I was saying, any
mission plan has

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.726
to account for things that
can go wrong and say, oh,

00:44:03.726 --> 00:44:05.860
if this happens, then the
astronaut should do this.

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:07.420
If this happens,
they should do this.

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:09.670
And I started thinking of
all these failure scenarios.

00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:12.590
And those started to seem
really interesting to me.

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:14.755
So I made a poor,
hapless main character

00:44:14.755 --> 00:44:15.880
to suffer through them all.

00:44:18.647 --> 00:44:21.230
MALE SPEAKER: The readers won't
suffer if they read this book.

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:22.140
I'm sure about that.

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:24.630
So please give
thanks to Andy Weir.

00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:30.828
