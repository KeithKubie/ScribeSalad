00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.700
I got this problem here
from the 2003 AIME exam.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.360
That stands for the American
Invitational Mathematics Exam.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.880
And this was actually the
first problem in the exam.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.230
The product N of three positive
integers is 6 times their sum,

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.060
and one of the integers is
the sum of the other two.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.080
Find the sum of all
possible values of N.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.380
So we have to deal with
three positive integers.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.650
So we have three positive
integers right over here.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.080
So let's just think about
three positive integers.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.405
Let's call them a, b, and c.

00:00:35.405 --> 00:00:36.280
They're all positive.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.530
They're all integers.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.160
The product N of these
three positive integers--

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.030
so a times b times c is equal
to N-- is 6 times their sum.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.110
This is equal to
6 times the sum.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.810
Let me do this in another color.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.450
So this is their product.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.690
So the product N of
three positive integers

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.050
is 6 times their sum.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.310
So this is equal to 6
times the sum of those

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.510
integers a plus b plus c.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.020
And one of the integers is
the sum of the other two.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.440
Well, let's just pick c
to be the sum of a and b.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.190
It doesn't matter.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.600
These are just names, and
we haven't said one of them

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.330
is larger or less
than the other one.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.400
So let's just say
that a plus b is

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.880
equal to c, that
one of the integers

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.990
is the sum of the other two.
c is the sum of a plus b.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.990
Find the sum of all
possible values of N.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.160
So let's just try to do a
little bit of manipulation

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.050
of the information we
have here, and maybe we

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.146
can get some relationship
or some constraints

00:01:50.146 --> 00:01:51.770
on our numbers, and
then we can kind of

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.050
go through all of
the possibilities.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.730
So let's see, we know that
a plus b is equal to c.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.360
So we can replace c
everywhere with a plus b.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.110
So this expression
right over here

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.130
becomes ab, which is
just a times b, times c.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.780
But instead of c, I'm going to
write an a plus b over here.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:25.440
And then that is equal to
6 times a plus b plus c.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.360
And so once again, I'll replace
with the c with an a plus b,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.610
and then what does
this simplify to?

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.150
So on the right-hand side,
we have 6 times a plus b

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.020
plus a plus b.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.680
This is the same thing
as 6 times 2a plus 2b,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.520
just added the a's and the b's.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.700
And we can factor out a 2.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.740
This is the same thing as if
you take out a 2, 6 times 2

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.320
is 12 times a plus b.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.856
The left-hand side
right over here

00:02:55.856 --> 00:03:01.720
is still a times b
or ab times a plus b.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.710
So ab times a plus b has got to
be equal to 12 times a plus b.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.430
So this is pretty
interesting here.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.610
We can divide both
sides by a plus b.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.140
We know that a plus b cannot be
equal to 0 since all of these

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.940
numbers have to be
positive numbers.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.740
And the reason why I say that
is if it was 0, dividing by 0

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.450
would give you an
undefined answer.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.130
So if we divide both
sides by a plus b,

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.150
we get a times b is equal to 12.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.140
So all the constraints
that they gave us

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.290
boiled down to this
right over here.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.530
The product of a and
b is equal to 12.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.726
And there's only
so many numbers, so

00:03:43.726 --> 00:03:46.100
many positive integers where
you if you take the product,

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.950
you get 12.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.174
Let's try them out.

00:03:49.174 --> 00:03:50.590
So let me write
some columns here.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.290
Let's say a, b, c.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.070
And then we care
about their product,

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.700
so I'll write that
over here, so abc.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.050
So if a is 1, b
is going to be 12.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.530
c is the sum of those two, so
c is going to be 13, 1 times

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.380
12 times 13.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:21.959
12 times 12 is 144 plus
another 12 is going to be 156.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.620
And just for fun, you
can verify that this

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.035
is going to be equal
to 6 times their sum.

00:04:27.035 --> 00:04:32.280
Their sum is 26,
26 times 6 is 156.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.530
So this one definitely worked.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.850
It definitely worked
for the constraints.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.100
And it should because we
boiled down those constraints

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.060
to a times b need
to be equal to 12.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.720
So let's try another one.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.670
2 times 6, their sum is 8.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.200
And then if I were to take
the product of all of these,

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.730
you get 2 times 6
is 12 times 8 is 96.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.830
And then we could try 3 and 4.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.154
3 plus 4 is 7.

00:05:01.154 --> 00:05:06.705
3 times 4 is 12 times 7.

00:05:06.705 --> 00:05:09.080
Actually, I should have known
the a times b is always 12,

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.560
so you just have to multiply
12 times this last column.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.190
12 times 7 is 84.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.199
And there aren't any others.

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.240
You definitely can't go
above 12 because then you

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.580
would have to deal
with non-integers.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.840
You would have to
deal with fractions.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.520
You can't do the negative
versions of these

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.436
because they all have
to be positive integers.

00:05:27.436 --> 00:05:28.120
So that's it.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.620
Those are all of the
possible positive integers

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.070
where if you take their
products you get 12.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.300
We've essentially
just factored 12.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.620
So they want us to find the sum
of all possible values of N.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.420
Well, these are all
the possible values

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.350
of N. N was the product
of those integers.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.920
So let's just take the sum.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.980
6 plus 6 is 12 plus
4 is 16, 1 plus 5

00:05:52.980 --> 00:06:01.740
is 6 plus 9 is 15 plus
8 is 23, 2 plus 1 is 3.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.750
So our answer is 336.
