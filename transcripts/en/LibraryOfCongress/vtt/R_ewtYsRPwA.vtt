00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.460
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: My
name's Georgia Higley.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.680
I'm head of the newspaper
section, and it's the home

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.730
of the comic book
collection of the Library.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.140
So I want to welcome you to our
latest program that's sponsored

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.560
by the Serial and Government
Publications Division.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.590
This program celebrates one
of our special collections,

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.810
The Comic Book Collection, and
in particular, one part of it,

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.280
The Mini Comics Collection.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.730
So in August of 2011, the
Library signed an agreement

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.710
with the Small Press Expo,
SPX, and as a result,

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.250
the Library acquires independent
comics and cartoon art

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.400
from creators and publishers
that appear at the annual expo.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.430
And also for those that submit
and are nominees and winners

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.420
of the Ignatz Award
that they give out.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.360
So, through this talk, we're
actually recognizing the rewards

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.920
of the agreement, and I would
say we have over 4,000 items

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.080
that have been added to the
collection as a result of this.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.980
And we're also celebrating
the comic book art form.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.670
We're also celebrating the
web comics that we acquired

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.500
through this agreement.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.780
And just this week, the
small press, I mean I want

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.170
to make sure I get
the right title,

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.890
The Small Press Expo Comic

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.550
and Comic Art web archive went
public, and some of the titles

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.440
from that collection
dates back to 1998.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.470
So it's actually a significant
archive for web comics.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.000
So we're looking forward the
acquisitions that are going

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.900
to happen in just two days,
within the next two days

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.560
at the festival in North
Bethesda, Maryland.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.440
So, today, let's turn to the
topic that we'll be discussing.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.720
I'm very pleased to have
Charles Brownstein speak to us

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.750
about intellectual
freedom and comics.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.880
Please note that across by the
windows we have a selection

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.370
of comic books from the Serial

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.730
and Government Publications
Division

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.700
that highlight comic
book censorship issues.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.450
And I will say there
are a couple surprises

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.270
if you take a look
at some of those.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.380
So, Charles Brownstein has
been the Executive Director

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.340
of the Comic Book Legal
Defense Fund since 2002.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.350
And I'm going to be referring to
that as the CBLDF from now on.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.610
During his tenure, the
organization has been vigorous

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.730
in the defense against
censorship.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.200
It's achieved a number
of legal victories,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.120
and it's been cited
by the Supreme Court.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.110
And it's become really
the leading source

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.000
of education advocacy for
combatting comic censorship

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.160
in libraries and schools
around the country.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.790
In addition to his jog at CBLDF,

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.910
Brownstein also writes
extensively about comics,

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.670
and he's written the Oddly
Compelling Art of Denis Kitchen

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.480
and Monsters and Titans
Battling Boy Art on Tour.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.350
He's also chair of Banned Books
Week Coalition, and he serves

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.740
on the Board of Trustees of
the Freedom to Read Foundation,

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.660
the Board of Directors
of the Media Coalition,

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.230
and on the steering
committee of SPX.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:47.780
So, he has an incredible resume
for the talk he's about to give.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.710
So please welcome him

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.780
as he discusses the
Comic Legal Defense Fund,

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.510
Comics and the Power of
Intellectual Freedom.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.290
[ Applause ]

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.080
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein: Thank you
for the generous introduction,

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.480
Georgia, and before we begin
today, I'd like to take a moment

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.150
to acknowledge that so much
of what's great in our fields,

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.530
that is to say, intellectual
freedom, librarianship

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.410
and comics, is done by
people that volunteer or may

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.580
as well be volunteering
for the pay scale

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.400
that we devote to
these professions.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.680
And so, I'd like to take a
moment to acknowledge Georgia,

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.030
Meagan and all the great folks
here at Library of Congress,

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.050
as well as the steering
committee of SPX

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.890
who tirelessly make sure
that we can have events

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.300
like this here in the D.C. area.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.100
Thank you so much.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.830
[ Applause ]

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.410
So today I'm going to be
discussing the history comics

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.720
and their impact on
intellectual freedom.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.030
And this comes from
the prism of my work

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.820
at Comic Book Legal
Defense Fund.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.640
We're a nonprofit organization
that protects the freedom

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.090
to read comics from
courtrooms to classrooms,

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.060
all over the United
States, providing legal aid

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.990
and education and
advocacy activities.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.500
You can learn about
our work and get many

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.760
of our publications
at CBLDF.org.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.060
I know the first rule

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.360
of PowerPoint is
don't rea PowerPoint,

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.420
but I always make an exception
for this particular slide

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.540
because I think a lot of people
throw around the First Amendment

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.340
without really taking to
hear the five freedoms

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.640
that it guarantees.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.470
And it's so short that it
almost fits on a tweet.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.170
"Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.170
of religion, or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof;

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.670
or abridging the freedom
of speech, or of the press;

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.950
or the right of the people
peaceably to assemble,

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.420
and to petition the government
for a redress of grievances."

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.420
That simple language should
make it appear self-evident

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.680
that we all have the right to
express freely without fear

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.980
of government restriction.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.640
Now freedom of expression
doesn't give you a free pass

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.010
for saying things
that are rejectable

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.340
by the marketplace of ideas.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.760
It merely allows you the
opportunity to compete

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.700
in the marketplace of ideas.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.440
And yet, throughout history,
we have seen pushback

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.600
against the very notion of
some topics finding their way

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.430
into the public square, largely

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.530
through mechanisms
of moral panic.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.220
This intense feeling that
there's an issue that appears

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.150
to threaten the social order.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.950
Usually, this is about
protecting youth and children

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.000
because they are our future
and our most impressionable,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.360
and we all forgot what
it was like to be one.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.820
And so there are these
panics that emerge

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.920
around what the kids
are looking at.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.850
When I was growing up,
it was heavy metal,

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.240
listening to Judas Priest whose
British Steel cover you see

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.710
on there, or Slayer,
was going to turn me

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.240
into a blood-thirsty
baby-killing marauder.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.680
And it turned me into a person

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.710
that protects free speech,
which maybe is worse.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.010
I don't know.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.230
But the truth is that pop
culture has always been sexually

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.750
dangerous and awesome
because we're people.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.050
And the contents

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.020
of our consciousness doesn't
really change over time,

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.460
just the things that are
inflected within those contents.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.680
So here is some popular culture

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.410
from the early part
of the 20th century.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.600
A show bill for a
Hedy Lamarr movie.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.640
This amazing gun-toting
flapper lady

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.630
that I really wish I
knew what that was from

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.030
and somebody would revive it

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.190
because I would binge
watch that on Netflix.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.490
Phantom Lady.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.610
Down you see Cliff Sterrett's,
you know, wild composition.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.290
And all of this stuff was
blamed for the downfall

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.700
of society in its time as well.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.070
In fact, this handsome
gentleman, Will H. Hays,

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:41.380
is a Presbyterian elder put
into effect the censorship code

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.500
that governed motion
pictures in the early 1930s.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.090
The Hays Code or the
Production Code attempted

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.640
to really reign in cinema.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.100
This popular and powerful
field of mass communication,

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.580
with again, the fear that
youth might see nudity

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.010
or might hear language that will
set them off on the wrong foot.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.430
And so thing like pointed
profanity, words like God, Lord,

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.700
Jesus or Christ were prohibited.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.460
Any licentious or
suggestive nudity, in fact

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.720
or silhouette was prohibited.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.640
The description or depicted
of illegal traffic or drugs,

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.890
inference of sex perversion,
whatever that means,

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.400
because that certainly
changes over time.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.750
Scenes of child birth,
ridicule of the clergy,

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.580
offense of nation,
race or creed,

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.280
which obviously was interpreted
very openly in those days.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.700
All of these things were
prohibited by the Hays Code.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.950
And this, again, emerged
out of moral panic.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.240
And so you see, this is what ran
in front of all of those movies.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.620
And let's take a look at
some of the before and after.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:45.400
Here is Tarzan and his mate,
which was the first act

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.840
of the Breen Office
enforcing the Hays Code.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.290
On the left side you see Maureen
O'Sullivan having a scene

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.700
that most of us would recognize

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.650
as an adult limerence
connection.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.440
And on the right, you see that
the costume has been lengthened,

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.740
and it's been changed
to this kind

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.890
of dopey family drama format.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.490
And so this kind of just
reflects the attitudes

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.280
that this kind of
censorship code imposed.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.140
And it was into this
culture of self-censorship

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.420
that comic books emerged.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:17.170
Comics as a form of mass
communication had enjoyed a

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:20.390
tremendous audience
since the earliest days

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.610
of the 20th century,
particularly

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.100
through the newspaper format.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.420
And here in the Library,
you can see a lot

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:30.770
of the great old strips
from Winsor McCay,

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.920
whose Little Nemo
kind of set the tone

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.870
for what the page could do

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.740
and was also a very gifted
editorial cartoonist.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.660
Through people like
George Herriman

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.960
who was recently explored
in a book called Krazy,

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.820
the Life of George Herriman,
who is now recognized as one

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.650
of the first great
African-American cartoonist.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:52.950
But at the time, you know,

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:57.880
really hid that under
the culture of the times.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.210
The strips and the papers would
reach these vast audiences,

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:02.880
and in the middle of the 1930s,

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.220
a guy named Max Gaines
was trying

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.210
to keep the printing
presses running overnight,

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.320
because there was all
of this fallow time.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.830
And he realized,
hey we print all

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.580
of these promotional
publications

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.870
of old comic strips, what
if we got some new stuff

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.220
in there and gave that away.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.560
And everybody said,
that's a horrible idea.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.290
He says okay, fine, then
I'll do and I'll see.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:22.590
And it worked.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:23.890
It worked really, really well.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.800
Well enough that he was able
to establish new company

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.320
that was putting out a
whole bunch of new comics.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.680
And so that's where you start
to see these early titles

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:37.350
like Famous Funnies, More Fun,
Detective Comics, Action Comics.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:41.440
And they were hugely popular
amongst a wide range of readers,

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.170
but especially younger readers,

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:46.000
for a lot of the same reasons
the comics are popular now.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.300
They were colorful.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.180
Their visuals were engaging.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.480
Their stories of moral
crusades and right

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.950
and wrong really
resonated with audiences.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.190
But it was all kinds of
stories for all kinds of people.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.210
That's lost in the shadow
of the 1950s, as we're going

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:02.510
to get into in a moment.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.120
But scenes like this were
happening all over the country.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.190
And it was sending a lot of
early critics into a lather.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:09.840
In particular, Sterling North,

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.880
who was a children's book
author whose books sold

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.850
in the thousands,
really took great umbrage

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:19.030
that these comic books had
sold in the tens of millions.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:22.290
And so he wrote an
editorial that appeared

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.460
in the Chicago Daily
News in 1940

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:28.850
where he characterized comics
as badly drawn, badly written

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.650
and badly printed, a
strain on young eyes

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:33.290
and young nervous systems.

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:36.540
Their crude blacks and reds
spoil the child's natural sense

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:37.840
of color.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.470
Their hypodermic
injection of sex

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.950
and murder make the child
impatient with better,

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:43.650
though quieter stories.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.390
And you wonder how much
of that was the writings

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:47.930
of a frustrated children's
book author who A, couldn't use

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:51.840
that kind of prose in
any other setter, and B,

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.280
was seeing this stuff
really outselling the work

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.820
that he was doing.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.850
And so it was framed
in the context

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:01.100
that we've seen time
and time again.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.200
This kind of stuff is going
to corrupt younger people.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.500
This kind of stuff is going

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.620
to diminish their reading
and language skills.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.920
This kind of stuff is going

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.840
to make them morally
bankrupt and suspect.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.060
I heard it when I was
listening to Raining Blood.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.580
Some people in this
room heard it

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.700
when they were playing
Grand Theft Auto.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.150
Some folks heard it in this room

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.120
when they were listening
to Miles Davis.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.200
This argument never
really goes away.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.450
But against comics, it stuck.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:30.650
And so you saw the national
disgrace being reprinted all

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:35.760
over newspapers throughout
the United States by 1941.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.320
In response to that criticism,
National, which was one

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.970
of the companies that would
merge into be DC Comics,

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.730
developed an editorial
advisory board in 1941

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:47.140
where they recruited a
variety of child psychologists

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.810
and educators to give a stamp
of approval to the comics.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.200
And it's an open
question how much

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.360
of this stuff was a publicity
exercise and how much

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:58.350
of this stuff they actually
did engage with the content.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:00.690
Despite the criticism that
was leveled against the field,

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.680
though, it was more
and more potent

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.210
with every year that went by.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.860
And with the United States'
entry into the Second World War,

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.140
a new audience of military
personnel came to comics

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.510
that would represent
a full quarter

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:12.810
of the printed matter going

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:14.800
to military post exchanges
during the conflict.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.280
So let's back up and think
about that for a second.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.710
We're talking about
audiences between the ages

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.310
of 18 and 25 predominantly.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:26.490
Mostly men, but young women
as well, who under the strain

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:29.810
of the conflict in the
European and Pacific theaters,

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:31.410
were reading comic books.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:32.970
This isn't terrifically
different

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:34.790
from the readership
of comic books today.

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:37.730
It's still largely
young adult audiences.

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:41.560
And yet, lost in the
sands of time is the fact

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.670
that so many young adults
were reading comics as well.

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.020
Here on the home front,
you saw that trend advance

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:51.630
with the crime comic that
emerged most forcefully

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:54.670
after 1942's Crime
Does Not Pay debuted.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:56.900
It was developed by Charlie
Biro and Charlie Wood

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.190
for Lev Gleason's publishing and
marketed itself as true crime,

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:02.410
focusing on the lurid depiction
of criminals and their deeds.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:06.550
And here you can see a
variety of the imitations.

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:08.910
It was kind of like
MSNBC on the weekends

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.310
but a little bit
more interesting just

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:13.610
because somebody had to draw it.

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.950
The news stand provided
this huge range

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:22.780
of full-color fever dreams that
ranged from the whole semantics

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.420
of funny animals to
the sultry exploits

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.960
of adventurers taming
their cousins of the wild.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.430
Superheroes, successful,

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:32.210
suspenseful adventurers,
sports, detectives.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.730
Comics didn't pay good wages,

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:36.370
but it offered a limitless
canvas for the imagination

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.110
for the people that
were working there.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.450
It also allowed underprivileged

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.120
and otherwise culturally
disadvantaged people

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.680
to find a place to
do their work.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.520
There's been much
scholarship done

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.520
that early comics were largely
created by Jewish populations.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.320
They were largely
created by populations

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.850
that came from the ghetto.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:55.500
They were largely
created by populations

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:59.070
that could not get a job in
the quote legitimate fields

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.400
of advertising or
strip cartooning.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.880
It's there that you see people
like Jack Kirby and Will Eisner

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.570
and Matt Baker, one of the first
African-American cartoonists

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:13.390
who was instrumental in
Phantom Lady create their work.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:14.690
It was here that you started

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:19.290
to see early women cartoonists
find an audience for their work.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:21.290
There were obviously
exceptions in the strips.

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.680
I had mentioned Herriman before,
and there was, of course,

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:28.780
women cartoonists in
the newspapers as well.

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:32.470
But comics provided a
more level access to entry

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:34.470
and a big appreciative audience.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:35.770
So you can look at
a lot of this stuff

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:37.500
and the 9010 rule
definitely applies.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.560
It might even be in 9505,
you know, looking at it.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.420
But that doesn't excuse
the fact that there,

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.730
it doesn't overwrite
the fact that there was

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:48.580
so much amazing material
reaching an interested audience.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.780
These image-filled stories
attracted the disapproval

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.920
of a variety of groups,
especially the Catholic Church

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.260
and PTA groups in the 1940s.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.570
John Francis Noll, the Bishop
of Fort Wayne, Indiana,

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.990
used his National Organization
for Decent Literature

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:05.790
and the publication Our
Sunday Visitor to speak

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.400
out against immoral
reading material.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.550
So every month they
would publish a blacklist

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:13.530
of publications disapproved
for youth

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:15.440
in their publication,
The Acolyte.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.060
Now you and I might look at
that now and say, all right,

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.500
well that's the stuff to read.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.500
But the people that were
reading the Acolyte were going,

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:23.800
I don't want to go to hell,

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.870
so I'm not going to
sell Wonder Woman.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:27.170
You know, seriously.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.900
Much to the chagrin, by
the way, of Max Gaines,

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.520
one of the publishers
of Wonder Woman.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:36.000
And he went and said why are
you putting my book on this.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.090
I publish, you know, picture
stories from the Bible.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:41.340
And they go well, the skirt's
a little bit too short.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.640
I mean, that wasn't
the only thing

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.940
in Wonder Woman,
let me tell you.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.220
But that was the thing
that they picked on.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.430
The NODL also created
other publications

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:49.870
like the one you see
on the screen here,

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:51.360
The Case Against the Comics.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.710
And you see this devil with
the hypodermic needle injecting

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.130
these sleepy-lidded
kids with the fantasies

00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:59.940
that you see behind him.

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:04.760
This is the kind of depiction
that comics were painted as.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.900
This was what comics
were shown to be.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.780
And again, you see this
recur time and again.

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.310
Video games are going to
make your kids shoot people.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:15.390
The internet is going
to ruin everything.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:16.770
Well, maybe that's true.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:21.980
But nonetheless, comics were
one of these early moral panics

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.850
that got some traction.

00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:27.240
Here is a news story from
The Pittsburgh suburbs

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.550
in 1947 published in
the Lewiston Daily Sun.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:33.390
Comics blamed in death
of 12-year-old youth.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:38.380
So here this poor kid, Bill
Becker, hanged himself.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.330
The mother tearfully
blamed it on the comic book.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:42.750
She said at the coroner's
inquest,

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.540
I burned every one I found,

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.160
but Billy always found
ways of hiding them.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.770
Now this is an unfortunate story

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.040
where the coroner's
inquest stopped

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.620
at the media effects argument.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.620
You saw the same
thing in the 1980s

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:59.010
when some unfortunate teenager
killed himself in the room,

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.580
and a copy of Ozzy Osbourne
Suicide Solution was

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.880
in there as well.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.020
And they said, see, it
says suicide and solution.

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.040
This is obviously it, without
actually listening to the song

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.610
and figuring out
that it had to do

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:14.210
with alcohol being the suicide
solution they're speaking of.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:18.470
This solution, this chemical
solution that makes people mad.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:20.570
So again, there's always
this kind of shortcut

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:22.840
that moral panic likes to take.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.690
And comics, and especially the
prevalence of crime comics,

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:27.820
like the ones I showed
you a few moments ago,

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.740
became targets of moral panic.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:33.480
In 1948, law enforcement
began to take an interest,

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.940
particularly the
first two passed laws,

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.890
was Detroit Police
Commissioner Harry S. Toy,

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:42.050
which is a name nobody
could invent, right.

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.590
That's just, your editor
would throw that out.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:50.670
So Harry Toy of Detroit
created this ordinance

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.550
that would ban an
initial 36 titles.

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:56.830
According to David Hajdu of the
indispensable Ten-Cent Plague,

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:59.570
the city classified a comic
as objectionable if it met any

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:00.870
of these four criteria.

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:03.530
Number one, it depicted
characters planning

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.040
or perpetrating a crime.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.670
Two, it had stories
involving youth in a crime.

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:09.380
Three, the entire
comic was dealing

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.680
with crime or criminal deeds.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.600
Or four, it portrayed
gruesome or brutal conduct

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.670
on women, children or race.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:17.940
And so this was the template

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.190
from which copycat bans
would follow in Ann Arbor,

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.690
Mt. Prospect, Illinois,
Hillsdale.

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:25.350
According to Hajdu, in
the months to follow,

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.900
more than 50 municipalities,
including several

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.160
of the most populous
in the United States,

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.410
would develop initiatives to
curb the sale of comic books.

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:36.530
It was into this climate that
Dr. Fredric Wertham emerged.

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:40.060
Now, how many here have already
heard of Wertham before this?

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.110
So about half of you in here.

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:45.010
Wertham his somebody
that posterity might look

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:47.240
at differently were it not

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.740
for his publicity-seeking
campaign against comic books.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:54.230
He was a pioneer of the
study of neuroscience.

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.770
He was a pioneer in
advocating for the rights

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:59.460
of disenfranchised young people.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:03.020
He was central in the
Brown versus Board

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.390
of Education decision
that led to desegregation.

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:07.980
And did a tremendous
amount of work

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.700
that I'm sure was
sincerely motivated

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:13.500
to ameliorate the condition
of disadvantaged kids.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:17.850
Having said that, he
also used junk science

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:19.800
to propose this notion

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.090
that comic books were
a direct causal factor

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:24.500
in juvenile delinquency.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:29.350
And in 1948, he presented
a symposium in New York

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:33.170
on the pathopsychology
of comic books.

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:36.930
Here you see some
articles that developed

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:38.950
as a result of this symposium.

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:40.930
This is Judith Crist,
Horror in the Nursery,

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:42.230
which ran in the March edition

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:45.140
of Collier's discussing
Wertham's findings.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.750
Time Magazine also
made a freelancer's day

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.690
when he published
the headline Puddles

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:53.070
of Blood covering
the same symposium.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:56.070
Now Wertham had the Lafargue
Clinic in Harlem, New York.

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:58.300
He dealt with kids
that were already

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.020
in a segregated environment.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:03.300
He was dealing with kids
that were already at risk,

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.390
that already were in
socioeconomic conditions

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:11.190
that would predispose them to
have more difficulty than kids

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:12.960
in better socioeconomic
conditions.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.290
Now, what kind of
faces do you not see

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:17.960
in these staged photographs?

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.030
What kind of inferences are
not being fully disclosed here,

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.330
right?

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:24.650
He's blaming everything
on the comics

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:27.830
and not the other
factors around the comics.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:34.420
And this led to a severe
public concern that this kind

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:37.280
of material was in fact going
to take the normal child,

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.280
the kind depicted in the staged
photographs I showed you,

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.940
down a bad road.

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.100
He published this article
in the Saturday Review

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:48.090
of Literature dubbing comics
the marijuana of the nursery.

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:50.780
Which might explain
why Portland, Oregon,

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.470
where I now live,
is Comics Town USA.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.330
But there was this
notion of, you know,

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.320
taking these panels
out of context.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.810
You know there's
pictures within pictures,

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:01.440
if you know where to look.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.030
Batman and Robin will teach
kids to be homosexual.

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:07.260
You know, all of this
kind of stuff was put

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.080
out there in these articles.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:13.970
So this in tandem with the
laws against comics led

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:19.130
to a big public debate about the
value of comics and ultimately,

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:21.880
led to anti-comic sentiment
that included church

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.690
and school groups having
public burnings like the one

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:26.680
that you see here
in Connecticut.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.490
So just a few years
after we came back

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:33.280
from the Second World War, where
we were fighting against Nazis

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.200
that literally burnt books, we
had these public demonstrations

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.750
that would encourage
kids to bring in a bundle

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:42.260
of comic books to
get a clean book.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:45.150
You know, being held
all over the country.

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:47.350
In an attempt to
diffuse this criticism,

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:52.130
some people within the comics
industry developed an early

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:53.720
comics code, the Association

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.720
of Comic Magazine
Publishers comics code,

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.440
which you can read
in full on CBLDF.org.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.590
But ultimately, there
was not uniform buy-in.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:04.800
And so comics continued
to do what they would do.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.920
And that is to say
companies like Dell

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:11.370
that were primarily
licensing movie franchises

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:14.020
and Disney comics and
things of that nature said,

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.020
we're not associating
ourselves with these other guys.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.490
Everybody knows who
Walt Disney is.

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:18.790
We're clean.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.090
We're not going to
buy into this.

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:22.490
Publishers like National
said we got our own stuff.

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:23.790
We're not going to participate.

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.960
And so the industry kind of
collectively put its head

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.680
in the sand while
more laws passed.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.830
1948, September, LA County
passes a misdemeanor law

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:36.090
outlawing any adult person,
firm or corporation to sell,

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:38.930
give or any way furnish anyone
under 18 a book, magazine

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:42.390
or other publication depicting
an account of a crime,

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:46.020
with a penalty of 500 bucks
or six months in jail.

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.980
Steep penalty for 1948.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.260
More than 50 cities or towns
ban the sale of comics either

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.940
through legislation or
censorship committees.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:55.470
And by March of 1949,
laws regulating comics,

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:57.340
prohibiting their
sale to minors,

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.250
were occurring in 14 states.

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:02.160
Canada also got into the act
providing a maximum prison

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.150
sentence of up to two
years for anybody printing

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:08.290
or publishing any
sorts of crime comics

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:10.890
that would have an
undue negative influence

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:12.730
on youthful persons.

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:19.240
So, by 1950, you saw crime
comics really taper off.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.870
And the industry
recognizing a void said,

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:23.770
we've got to find
something else.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:27.330
And so there was a boom
for romance comics.

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:30.360
And I present these to
you without comment.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.700
But these were some
of the titles

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.950
that were published at the time.

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:36.850
And, you know, very, very
successful materials.

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:41.010
It led to a company in,
I'm sorry, a university

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:43.370
in Connecticut to do a study
about the causal effects

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:46.570
of comics, good or bad,
and they found nothing good

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:47.870
or bad about comics.

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:49.170
Simply that kids read them.

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:53.290
Which directly countered
what Wertham was saying.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:55.960
And when the Lafargue
Clinic was asked about this,

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.310
they said, well, just wait.

00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:58.610
He's on sabbatical.

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:00.170
He's working on something big.

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:03.300
So let's let Wertham
work on something big off

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.340
in the Lafargue Clinic
in Harlem and talk

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:07.100
about this fellow, Bill Gaines.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.440
Now, I talked about his dad, Max
Gaines, the guy who was trying

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.190
to keep the printing
presses running all night

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:15.790
and created the comic
book as a result.

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:18.640
Bill was his least
favorite child.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.870
Bill was the kid that would come
to work and would get yelled

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:23.170
at for being a screwup

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.270
for spilling the coffee,
for being a no-good.

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:28.570
He was just persona-non-grata
in his dad's eyes

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:30.450
and a perpetual disappointment.

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:32.550
So this tubby schlub
wanted nothing to do

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:36.980
with his dad's life or
livelihood and was in school

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:39.610
at NYU to be a chemistry
teacher.

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:42.490
His social skills with
women were about as good

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:43.950
as his coffee-carrying skills.

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:47.200
And so he was, his marriage
was arranged by his mother.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:52.880
And late in 1948, he called his
mom and said, I'm very sorry,

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.270
but we're getting a divorce.

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.570
Oh, the shame.

00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:59.190
We cannot relate to this now.

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:01.070
Oh, the horrible shame.

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:04.530
The stigma of divorce being
visited upon this family

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.380
by Bill the screwup.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:10.170
And so Max Gaines took his
wife out to their vacation home

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:13.370
in Lake Placid to comfort
her from, you know,

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:16.430
this horrible situation that
this no-good kid was going

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:18.390
to bring upon the family.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:21.080
And while they're there and
she's soothing her nerves

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:24.480
with Lord knows whatever they
soothed their nerves with,

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:29.000
he's out on a boat with a
friend and that friend's kid.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.840
And another boat is speeding
out of control towards them.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.350
Max Gaines grabs the young
boy that is fishing with them,

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:40.010
throws him overboard,
takes the full brunt

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:42.630
of the oncoming speedboat.

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:45.950
So, now Bill Gaines has not
only broken his mother's heart

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:47.340
with the stigma of divorce,

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:51.380
he's inadvertently killed his
father, who he hated anyway.

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:53.890
But still, nobody's ever
ready to deal with that,

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:55.640
particularly suddenly.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.460
And so, Mrs. Gaines
calls Bill and says,

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.410
this company is your
father's legacy,

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:03.100
you're going to carry it on.

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.400
What the hell do I know

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.350
about running a comic
book company, he asks.

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:07.650
I don't care.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:08.950
You're going to do it.

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:10.760
So he trudges down to
Little Italy in the offices

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.260
on Lafayette Street

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.200
where educational comics
were doing business,

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.870
and he signs the
checks once a week.

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:17.700
And then he goes back to study.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:21.640
And after a few months starts to
look at this stuff and go, well,

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.350
we're losing money and
it's really terrible.

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:25.000
What can we do to change it?

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.440
So, they started chasing
different fads and started,

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.010
you know, they got
into the love business.

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:30.690
They got into the
funny animal business.

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:34.530
They changed their
content a number of ways.

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:38.690
In walks another young man,
Gaines is about 26, 28,

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:41.340
in this period, named
Al Feldstein,

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.080
who was around 23,
24 in this period.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.040
And Al Feldstein worked
for Victor Fox Publishing,

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:51.530
and he was trying to get into
the teenage magazine segment

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:53.200
of the market that was
opened up by Archie.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.740
And he brought in
a bunch of drawings

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:59.370
of well-endowed teenage
girls in brassieres

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:02.630
that were affectionately called
headlight cartoons at that time.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:04.620
And he shows his
portfolio to Bill,

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.360
and Bill goes [chuckles] boobs.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.480
And the two of them had a
friendship that sparked one

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.630
of the greatest creative
collaborations

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:12.930
in the history of comics.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:16.750
They would drive home
each day together and talk

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:18.180
about well, what can we do?

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:19.480
What can we do?

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.780
What can we do?

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:22.980
Now both of these guys,
you know, not just fans

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.980
of headlight cartoons,
were also fans

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:28.650
of the other popular culture
of the time, science fiction,

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:35.330
horror, radio drama, all of
these kind of nascent genres

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:37.700
that were booming in
the early television

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.770
and film period in
the United States.

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:43.980
And on one of those rides
home, Feldstein reportedly said

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:45.940
to Bill, although
Feldstein's one of those guys

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:47.950
that if you listen to him,
he invented the world.

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:49.510
And if you listen to Bill,
he invented the world.

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:51.560
So parse it as you will.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.460
Feldstein says he said to
Bill, hey, instead of chasing

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:57.200
down these trends, why
don't we start our own.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:02.060
And so that was the birth of the
new trend that EC introduced,

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:06.920
beginning with the Vault of
Horror and Tales from the Crypt

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.900
and Crime Suspense Stories

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.250
and the science fiction
titles Weird Fantasy,

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:16.270
Weird Science and many others.

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:20.720
Now what makes EC
distinct is not merely

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:24.710
that they captured the zeitgeist
of the culture in terms

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:26.260
of their subject matter.

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:30.360
Not merely that they
employed the best artists

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.120
that the field had to offer.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.370
Paid them just a
little bit better

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:36.580
than the shitty wages they
were getting elsewhere.

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:39.230
For which Bill kept
the original art,

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:42.430
which is a whole other
conversation for historians.

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:45.340
But they were also
actively engaged

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.610
in making comics for each other.

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:50.260
They were engaged
in making comics

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:54.050
that certainly a kid could
read, but that kid needed

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:57.040
to raise themselves to the
level of an adult genre reader.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:00.020
It was the same logic that
in-fueled pulp science fiction.

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:02.280
It was the same logic
that in-fueled a lot

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:05.620
of the popular magazine
content of the time.

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.750
And in fact, if you look at the
EC Comics, they had an awful lot

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:11.480
to say about social
justice issues of the day.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.800
There's a terrific strip
called In Remembrance

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.250
that I definitely
recommend everybody seek out.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:20.490
It's a seven-pager by Wallace
Wood written by Al Feldstein

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:23.580
that tells the story of
a young man coming home

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:24.990
from the Korean War.

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:27.000
And it happened to be
published the same month

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.230
that the Armistice was signed.

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:30.530
This young man is wounded.

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:35.070
He gets to a small town,
white kid, white town.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:37.770
He's met with a victory parade.

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:40.400
And he goes home with is
parents, and they say hey,

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.100
before the big victory
parade tonight,

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.130
when we all celebrate what
you did out there, do you,

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:47.430
is there anything
you want to do?

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.330
He says yeah, I want
to visit Sam's grave.

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:50.740
And the parents get
very nervous,

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:53.110
and they say well, about that.

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:55.560
I know you wanted him
buried in the family plot.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.340
I know he took the grenade
and saved your life,

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:01.000
but we had to bury him
in the colored cemetery.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.650
There's simply no way that we
could continue to be a part

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:07.130
of this town and do business
in this town if we put him,

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:08.760
you know, in the white plot.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.510
And the kid's very upset.

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:12.880
And the parents say look, we
spent more than we could afford.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.180
You know, we did
everything that we can,

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:15.660
but this is the best we can do.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.420
So the soldier withdraws.

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:20.250
He goes to the parade
that night.

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:24.230
They ask him to give a speech,
and he says, I went out there

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:27.150
to protect all of our freedoms.

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:29.430
And I mean all of our freedoms.

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:32.320
I am ashamed by what
you did to this man

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.320
who sacrificed himself
for me and for you.

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.690
You have completely diminished
everything that we stand for.

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:40.720
Powerful stuff for
1952 in a comic book.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:45.640
In the months that followed,
you saw a debate in the pages

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:49.020
of Shock Suspense Stories
letter column from members

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:50.910
of the armed forces
talking about this,

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:54.730
beginning with a person in
the Air Force that wrote in,

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:59.270
Dear Editors, I am in the
Air Force and there's no way

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:01.250
that we would ever put N words

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:02.830
in the same bunks
as white people.

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:04.850
This is liberal propaganda.

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:08.710
So, as you can see, some
things never change.

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:11.140
In the months that
followed, other people

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.630
in the military wrote
in and said, hey,

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:15.330
that guy's a disgrace.

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:18.670
We are members of the
Army, Navy, whatever.

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:20.190
We all fight for equality.

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:22.000
And in fact, three months
somebody wrote in and says hey,

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.580
I looked up that
guy that wrote in.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:26.090
He was dishonorably
discharged a few months ago.

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:29.770
So, one of the big
social justice discussions

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:33.220
of the time being had by adults

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.760
in the pages of these
comic books.

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:43.100
1953, Fredric Wertham is
ready to release the work

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:45.430
that would define his legacy.

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:48.520
And it came out in the
Ladies Home Journal,

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:51.720
which was the highest
circulated magazine of the time.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.190
And really one of the
most influential organs

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:59.440
for determining what came
into American households.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.020
An article called What Parents
Don't Know about Comic Books,

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:05.300
which was an excerpt from his
upcoming book, The Seduction

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:06.780
of the Innocent,
which was published

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:11.600
as an immediate bestseller
in 1954, where he posited

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:15.550
that comic books are
a corrosive influence

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:18.690
that has a direct
causal relationship

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:21.170
on children engaging in
delinquent behaviors,

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:23.200
whether that is sexual
delinquency.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.590
Whether that is crime
delinquency.

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:28.020
Whether that is disrespect
for authority.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.630
It is all there.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:33.960
He defined pretty much all comic
books as crime comic books.

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:37.350
If there was a crime happening,
whether it was Captain Marvel,

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:40.160
Jr. thwarting somebody
stealing candy,

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.810
or one of those proto-MSNBC
comics

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:44.670
that Charlie Biro published,

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:48.280
it was all a crime
comic to Doc Wertham.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:51.860
And it was a compelling argument
because at the same time

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:53.160
that he was putting
it out there,

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.690
we had this new thing
called the teenager.

00:33:55.690 --> 00:34:00.160
There had never really been
a group of young people

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:06.090
with that much disposable time,
income and hormones let loose

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:08.150
in their own way, right.

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:12.750
And so, of course, there
were increases in delinquency

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.940
because that's what young people
do when they don't need to go

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:18.700
down to the factory to
earn any money that,

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:20.000
you know, the family needs.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.830
You know, and there's going
to be some bad apples there.

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:24.660
Because here's a
secret everybody,

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:28.020
the job of young people is
to horrify their elders.

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:30.400
That's the social contract.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.430
Some of them do find
the wrong path.

00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:34.940
The simplistic argument

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:37.750
that comic books were
leading them there was very,

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:39.750
very appealing.

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:42.800
So, these good intentions
that Wertham poured

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.270
into it were backed up by
ultimately poor science.

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:48.110
He had no control group.

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:51.320
He was working primarily with
at-risk kids, at-risk kids

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.420
that would come see him, and
they called him Dr. Quarter

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.760
because for a quarter he
would listen to your problems,

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.580
and you know, helped
diagnose you.

00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:01.100
You know, all of this
stuff, but Dr. Carol Tilley

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.990
who does her research
in Chicago later found

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:06.470
that he actually falsified a lot

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:10.100
of his information
conflating evidence,

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:14.060
taking one kid's written
statement and tying it

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.050
to another kid's written
statement in the quotations

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:21.150
that he used in Seduction of the
Innocent to assert his claims.

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:24.390
So this was not known
at the time.

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:25.770
All that was known
was that this guy

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:28.430
who helped us end
segregation and wrote,

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:29.730
literally wrote the book

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:32.750
on neuroscience is saying
this stuff is bad for kids.

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:37.470
So what are we going
to do about it?

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:41.160
The US Senate determined that as
they were holding their hearings

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:44.280
on juvenile delinquency
that when they got

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.700
to New York they were going

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:48.640
to investigate the
comic book industry.

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:53.880
This incensed William Gaines
because two years before,

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:57.190
in 1950, Estes Kefauver, I'm
sorry four years before 1950,

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:59.810
Estes Kefauver had had
the subcommittee hearings

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:01.350
on organized crime.

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:04.220
And this was the birth of the
Court TV genre that plagues us

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:08.970
to this day where they had,
you know, members at the top

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:12.190
of the various New York crime
families being televised

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:14.060
with their testimony
for the first time.

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:17.520
And Gaines, who really lived
up to that Leonard Cohen line,

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.820
if your abandon your masterpiece

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:20.220
and find your real
masterpiece felt

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.580
that he had found his
masterpiece in EC Comics.

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:24.400
I'm pouring my heart and soul
into this, and they're going

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.010
to make me look like I'm one of
these organized crime crooks.

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:28.310
Oh hell no.

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:30.770
And so he created this ad
that you can actually see

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:33.650
on the table over there,
are you a red dupe?

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:35.420
Where he asserted the
group most anxious

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:38.660
to destroy comics
are the communists.

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:41.380
This was in the days
of the red scare.

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:47.340
He sent this to every
senator on that subcommittee.

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:53.250
So, in this incredible
defiant act of smartassery,

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:56.310
he determined that,
you know, the reference

00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:58.490
to communism would
be a sly pointed jab

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:01.220
at Wertham, at the lawmakers.

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:05.900
He was actually denounced on
the Senate floor for this.

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:08.240
&gt;&gt; No he wasn't.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.540
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein: Really?

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:10.840
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.140
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein: Go on.

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.880
&gt;&gt; No, when he went out on the
Senate floor, what he said was.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.670
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein: Are you
talking about the testimony,

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:17.970
or are you talking about --

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:19.270
&gt;&gt; I'm talking about
when Hendrickson went

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:20.570
out on the Senate floor to talk

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:24.220
about why they were having the
Senate comic book hearings.

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:27.190
He said, look, the reason
why we're doing this is all

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:30.330
of these people have
sent us mail saying

00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:33.420
that comics are the cause
of juvenile delinquencies.

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:36.820
They had a public relations
problem on their hands.

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:39.350
And so between they had all
these experts telling them

00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:41.070
that there was a
cause and effect,

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:44.990
because they had already written
one document about the cause

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:47.280
of juvenile things
in the United States.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.430
They said, we've got to
do something about this.

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:51.050
We can't not investigate it.

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:52.750
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein: No
I think, that's correct.

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:55.900
But the red dupe was
specifically called out.

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:57.580
&gt;&gt; Right. The red
dupe was called out.

00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:58.880
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein:
That's what I'm saying.

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:01.480
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein: I wasn't
saying comics were denounced.

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.780
I said the red dupe
was denounced.

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.080
&gt;&gt; No, the red dupe
was sort of called

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:08.360
out because Hendrickson
basically said well now wait a

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.990
minute, all right.

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:11.800
And he said on the Senate
floor, I'm not looking

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.430
to censor anything, okay.

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:15.350
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein: Warren,
we're agreeing with each other.

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:17.340
&gt;&gt; Sort of.

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:18.640
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein: Okay.

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.760
&gt;&gt; I don't want to
hijack [inaudible].

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.060
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein:
So anyway.

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:26.830
Red dupe was definitely an
irritant to the senators

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:30.010
that were in this position of
the public relations problem

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:33.140
that Warren is identifying
of the moral panic saying

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:37.240
that comics are this thing
that are harming kids.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.260
What are you guys
going to do about it?

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:42.210
And so the senate subcommittee
hearings that happened

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:43.960
in New York City in April

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:48.370
of 1954 gave those senators
the opportunity to respond

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:51.700
to their constituents' letters
and also created the opportunity

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:56.800
to really get to the
bottom of this concern.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.230
Now, Gaines was not
on the witness list,

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:01.320
and he saw this,
and he was furious.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:03.620
He felt that, you
know, if they're going

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:06.490
to be making a mockery of
our business, I'm going to go

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:07.790
out there and set it straight.

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:09.760
And these are, you know,
all lawfully-elected people.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.550
They'll see it my way, surely.

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:15.360
Which was not a smart move,
as we'll get into in a moment.

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:17.780
So, Wertham began the
afternoon session.

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:20.420
He was given very careful
treatment in the way

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:23.480
that he outlined that comics
were detrimental to youth.

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:25.770
And although the science has
been debunked, it carried a lot

00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:28.300
of weight at the time,
particularly when he said

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:32.080
that the normal child
is the one that is more

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.810
at risk by comic books.

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:38.960
And the other quote of the day
was that the Nazis had nothing

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:43.370
on the comic book industry when
it comes to poisoning youth.

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:45.240
This is strong stuff.

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.670
And Gaines is sitting
there, and he's squirming

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:50.480
and he's fuming and
he's sweating.

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.430
And it's not just
from the content

00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:54.130
of what Wertham was saying,

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:56.450
it's also that the
drugs were wearing off.

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:57.990
So let me explain.

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:02.300
Bill is this kind of
portly 32-year-old guy

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:05.850
who has the self-righteousness
of youth on his side.

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:09.180
And he's going out there to
read a statement that is going

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:12.080
to tell these guys,
look we're all in this

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.380
for the right reasons.

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:14.920
We're protected by
the First Amendment.

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.250
You're looking for
simple solutions.

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:19.740
But you know, he went
out there and, you know,

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:22.890
he's been taking these diet
pills to control his weight.

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:24.940
Which we would now call speed.

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:27.810
And he had been taking
them for days up, you know,

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:29.770
late at night working
with Lyle Stuart who went

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:31.220
on to be a famous publisher

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.770
in the underground
press in his own right.

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:35.350
You know, this big
defiant statement.

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:38.160
And Gaines was going to go
on slightly before lunch.

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.710
The proceedings ran late.

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:42.940
This German quack is up there
pulling up a copy of my comic

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:46.000
about discrimination where
we use the word spick to show

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.300
that discrimination is bad.

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:49.830
And he's saying we're teaching
kids how to use the work spick.

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:51.930
I can't believe this monster.

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:55.310
And then the drugs crash when he
goes up to give his testimony.

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:59.060
So sweaty, nervous, looking
down at his prepared statement.

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:00.360
He's mumbling.

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.660
He's muttering.

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:02.960
He looks like hell.

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:06.550
And the senators who see this
guy that asked to be there

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:08.980
and that called them communists

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:12.980
in there are you a red dupe ad
smelled this blood in the water.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:16.210
So Chief Counsel Herbert Beaser,
let me get the limits as far

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:17.510
as what you put in
your magazine.

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:19.190
Is the sole test of what you put

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:20.580
in your magazine
whether it sells?

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:22.700
Is there any limit you can
think of that you would not put

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:25.510
in because you thought a child
shouldn't see or read about it?

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:26.810
No, says Bill.

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:28.110
I wouldn't say there's
any reason,

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:29.410
limit for the reason
you outlined.

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:30.710
My only limits are the
bounds of good taste.

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:32.580
What I consider to
be good taste.

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.590
So you think a child
could not in any way,

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:37.640
shape or manner be hurt by
anything a child reads or sees.

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.200
I don't believe so, says Bill.

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.820
So there's no limit to what
you put in your magazines,

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:43.820
only the bounds of good taste.

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:46.270
And they produce this cover.

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:50.920
Here is your May 22nd
issue, says Kefauver.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:54.220
This seems to be a man with a
bloody ax holding a woman's head

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:56.070
up which has been
severed from her body.

00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:58.830
Do you think that
is in good taste?

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:03.800
So drug-addled-crashing
Gaines says, yes sir I do,

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.690
for the cover of a
horror comic book.

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:07.710
So all of the reporters
are like this is great.

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:09.010
I'm going to go to the bar.

00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:10.310
I've got my story.

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:11.670
But then he kept talking.

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:14.100
A cover in bad taste, for
example, might be defined

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:15.400
as holding the head
a little higher

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.730
so the neck could be seen
dripping blood from it.

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:19.660
Or moving the body over a
little further so the neck

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:21.130
of the body could be
seen to be bloody.

00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:24.840
You have blood coming
out of her mouth.

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:31.090
A little. It did not go well.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:34.710
No harm in horror, comics issuer
says, rang out the headline

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:36.840
in next day's New York Times.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.160
The following week's
Newsweek piled on.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:42.860
If the comic book industry is
not going to regulate itself,

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:47.370
if their own moral judgment
are these people like Gaines,

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:49.070
then something has
to be done about it.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:52.200
And either they clean up their
own act, or Congress needs

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:53.540
to clean it up for them.

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:56.860
And so the moral panic was
now at a new fever pitch.

00:42:56.860 --> 00:43:00.240
And Gaines knew that
he didn't just step

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.120
in it, he stepped in it.

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.190
The whole floor collapsed,
and now everybody was

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:05.850
in the muck along with him.

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:10.060
And so he called the industry
together and said, all right,

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:12.280
not my finest moment up there.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.430
But, we got to do
something about this.

00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:16.890
Let's make this code
they're talking about so

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:19.490
that we can put this
all behind us.

00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:23.710
And so the heads of National
Publications and the heads of,

00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:27.580
you know, which was DC,
Archie Publications,

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:29.870
now they go, this
is a great idea.

00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:33.400
And as it came into the
drafting, it became clear

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:36.620
that this great idea was going
to be putting Bill and others

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:37.920
like him out of business.

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.710
This is not what I had
in mind, Bill said,

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:43.610
as the code determined
that it was going

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:47.420
to basically sanitize the
content of comic books in a way

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:50.580
that it would be appropriate for
only the youngest of viewers.

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:55.530
And in fact, in the up yours
Bill Gaines rule that I call

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:57.920
in here, no comic shall
use the word horror

00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.720
or terror in its title.

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:03.150
Fundamentally, and you can read
all of the code on our website,

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:09.160
fundamentally, what the code
did was assured the public

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:11.390
that the industry took
their concerns seriously.

00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:13.930
There was no need for
government regulation.

00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:17.800
It assured the public that
your kids will be safe reading

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.220
comic books.

00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:23.620
But in doing so, it
sanitized the subject matter

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:26.320
and really infantilized
the medium.

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:29.680
I'm going to show you just a
couple of quick before/after,

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.770
to show you how the code
actually executed its work.

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:35.580
So, here is a War of
the Worlds-type story

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:38.120
that was published pre-code.

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:40.140
Look at just the top two panels.

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:44.430
The man's eyes are
fully dilated and wide

00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:46.420
in panel one on the left side.

00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:49.730
But on the right, his
expression has been put

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:52.490
to a half-lidded,
less excited state.

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:54.950
The three-eyed weirdo
is now a dude

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:57.060
with an unfortunately
large head.

00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:00.350
The conclusion of, you know,
getting away from these aliens

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:02.370
that have come to invade
us and conquer our planet,

00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:04.850
in the original story
is a murder-suicide.

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:07.640
In the sanitized story
is packing their bags

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.730
and going to who knows where.

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:11.370
We just got to put this
thing on the stands

00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:13.460
and hope nobody looks
for the logic in it.

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:15.500
This is too, again, deal

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:18.030
with the way the
code managed content.

00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:22.200
Here's a Simon and Kirby
Captain America page.

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.760
You can see that they changed
the features of the red skull

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:27.010
to make him less gruesome.

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:31.660
Here's another one that also
reduced not only the gruesome

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:33.950
menacing of the fanged
character,

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:37.220
but also removed the
woman who is being menaced

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:39.980
by the centaur over the altar.

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:42.810
And just two more here.

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:45.510
This is to show you how the
edits were actually done.

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:47.720
When they sent these to the
school teachers that worked,

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.520
retired school teachers
that worked

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.880
at the Cartoon Magazine
Association of America

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:54.430
that administrated the code,
they would just take white out

00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:58.460
and go write on the boards
to correct the materials.

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:00.870
And finally, this last one,

00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:03.610
while the previous scenes
were being gruesome,

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:06.650
this one you can see that this
hint of cleavage is too much

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:10.190
for the teenagers and
children of the 1950s.

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:13.290
And so Gaines deciding
that he was going to try

00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:14.970
to make an earnest go of it did,

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:18.140
and he launched a new
trend in magazines.

00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:20.720
But ultimately, that
became clear

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:23.420
that this new stuff
wasn't going to work

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:27.270
when he sent an inventory story
in to be approved by the code

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:29.720
that was called Judgment
Day by Joe Orlando

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:33.360
where an astronaut is going
to a planet to admit them

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:36.130
into the Federation
of Planets and finds

00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:37.430
that there's discrimination

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:39.850
against orange robots
by blue robots.

00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:42.580
And in the last panel
of this story,

00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:44.160
recommends we're not
going to let them

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:45.460
in because they haven't
advanced enough,

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:47.680
takes off his helmet,
and it's a black man.

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:50.830
And Feldstein took this
over to Charles Murphy

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:52.130
that ran the code.

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:54.140
Murphy says, you can't have it.

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:55.440
This is not going
to be approved.

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:56.740
Well, why not?

00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:58.040
Can't have it.

00:46:58.040 --> 00:46:59.340
I'm going to tell Bill.

00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:00.640
He's going to go
through the roof.

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:01.940
He's going to tell everybody
that you're a racist.

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:03.240
Can't have it.

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.160
So he goes down to Bill, and
Bill goes all right, Murphy.

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:07.460
He picks up the phone.

00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:08.760
I'm going to have a press
conference and tell everybody

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.300
that you're a racist and the
CMA is racist and, you know,

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.340
you're not going to let me
run this story that's clearly

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:14.840
about discrimination.

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.390
And Murphy says, tell you what,

00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:19.090
take the sweat beads off the
astronaut, and you can have it.

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:20.390
So Bill just recognizes

00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:21.870
that they're just
completely messing with him.

00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:24.900
So he looks, you know, does
a double-take, looks at phone

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:27.300
and yells as loud as
he can, well fuck you

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.220
and slams down the phone.

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:31.510
Gets out of the comic
book business completely.

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:36.530
And redirects that energy into
what would become Mad Magazine.

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:38.390
Really proving the
Leonard Cohen maxim

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:39.980
of you abandon your masterpiece,

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:41.470
you sink into your
true masterpiece.

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:44.040
Because it was Mad
Magazine that proved

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:47.810
to have a lasting influence,
not only on the youth of America

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:51.530
and the medium of comics,
but all of American satire,

00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:54.410
humor and politics in
the time that followed.

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:56.600
The rest of the comics
weren't so lucky.

00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:58.160
If you look at the end
of Ten-Cent Plague,

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:01.130
you'll see pages after
pages after pages

00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:06.270
of 11 point single-spaced
three-columns per page

00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:08.950
of cartoonists that
never worked again

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:11.620
after the purge of the 50s.

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:15.980
Comics went from a diversity
of subject matter and content

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:18.660
for a diversity of
audiences to these charming

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:22.700
but dopey illustrations that
I selected here on the screen.

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:26.570
It wasn't until the early 1960s
that comics finally started

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:31.600
to in the comic book format at
least, nudge a little bit way

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:34.480
up from being just for,
you know, little children.

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:38.610
And the Marvel Comics, in
particular, that emerged in 1961

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:43.560
and 1962 and 1963 under the
watch of Stan Lee, Jack Kirby,

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:46.010
Steve Ditko and other
cartoonists,

00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:50.650
introduced a more
realistic teenager and hero

00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:53.230
into their comic subject matter.

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:55.970
And that matured over
the course of the decade,

00:48:55.970 --> 00:49:00.570
reaching a following in
college environments as well.

00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:03.710
Now, in those same college
environments starting in 1965,

00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:08.290
the kids that grew up reading
the EC comics didn't know

00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:09.590
where they went.

00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:10.890
They just knew they were gone.

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:12.990
There's a great Spain
Rodriguez quote that growing

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:17.240
up in Buffalo, New York, you
know, you're told, hey kid,

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:18.540
you've got all this freedom.

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:19.840
We're the United States.

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.140
We stand for freedom.

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:22.440
Then they take away
the Vault of Horror.

00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:24.440
It's like, no kid, you
ain't got no freedom at all.

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:29.540
And these kids that grew up with
that stuff learned in college

00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:33.190
when they had access to the, you
know, reproduction technology

00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:35.840
of the college newspaper,
oh, we can do this.

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:37.310
So in Texas you started

00:49:37.310 --> 00:49:42.780
to see underground cartoonists
emerge including Gilbert Shelton

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:44.390
and Jack Jackson.

00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:47.230
Jack Jackson did God Knows.

00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:49.490
Gilbert did Wonder Warthog.

00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:51.160
He would later go on to
create the Fabulous Furry

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:52.460
Freak Brothers.

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:56.380
In California in 1965, Joel
Beck created Lenny of Loredo,

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:58.330
which came out of the
free speech movement led

00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:01.460
by Mario Savio and
referenced Lenny Bruce

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:03.370
as a martyr of free speech.

00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:08.060
In Chicago in the Midwest
area, you had Jay Lynch

00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:10.890
and Skip Williamson, both of
whom died earlier this year,

00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:12.750
produced Bijou Funnies,
Denis Kitchen,

00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:15.190
created Kitchen Sink Press.

00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:19.150
In New York, you had Spain,
Trina Robbins, Kim Deitch

00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:21.350
and others create
Gothic Blimp Works.

00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:25.790
But the real person that brought
it all together was Robert Crumb

00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:29.610
whose Zap Comix, which were, you
know, sold in the first issue

00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:31.490
from a baby carriage
in Haight-Ashbury

00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:35.700
in 1968 was the one
that really brought home

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:38.890
that comics had something
to say in the context

00:50:38.890 --> 00:50:42.230
of the young adult rebellion
that was happening in rock

00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:45.950
and roll, experimental film
and the protest movement.

00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:50.370
This in its own way
advanced the subject matter

00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:55.060
of comics far beyond what was
possible in, certainly the code,

00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:56.610
but even the pre-code area.

00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:59.820
And it was quickly stamped out
by law enforcement as well.

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:05.750
In 1971, a pair of book
store clerks were convicted

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:07.600
in New York for selling copies

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:09.750
of Zap number four
to an undercover cop.

00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:14.170
In 1973, when the Supreme
Court's community standards

00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:16.940
decision came in in
Miller versus California,

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.550
the head shops decided
we're going to get

00:51:18.550 --> 00:51:19.890
out of this business entirely.

00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:22.220
It's just far, far too risky.

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:25.720
And so, first in the 50s comics
were intellectual freedom was

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:29.820
attacked by the moral panic that
emerged because of the contents

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:31.400
that were sold on
the news stand.

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:33.680
In the 1970s, the more
intellectual freedom

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:36.870
of comics were attacked
because of the subject matter

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:40.060
that was reaching to
counterculture audiences.

00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:44.780
From that collapse, the direct
sales market emerged as a place

00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:48.340
that fans could actually
use, you know,

00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:50.900
comics as a form of expression.

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:53.720
It happened because
Phil Seuling got busted

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:55.810
for selling Zap number
four in a sting at one

00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:57.630
of his monthly conventions.

00:51:57.630 --> 00:52:00.270
Phil was a conventioneer
in New York.

00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:03.250
He created a mechanism by
which comics didn't need

00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:04.990
to submit to the comics code.

00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:08.830
He created a mechanism by which
comics could reach directly the

00:52:08.830 --> 00:52:11.590
audiences that were
interested in them.

00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:13.510
And so you started
to have a renascence

00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:16.010
of self-published comics
that continues to this day

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:19.040
at the festival we're going
to attend this weekend at SPX.

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:22.120
It created the circumstances
for mainstream companies to put

00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:25.380
out books for adult audiences
without the comics code.

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:27.260
It created the opportunity
for new formats

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:29.150
like the graphic
novel to emerge,

00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:31.120
which Will Eisner popularized

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:34.300
with his short story collection
A Contract with God in 1978.

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:40.660
By 1986, there was this great
confluence of work that emerged

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:43.300
out of the combination of
finally having an environment

00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:46.190
where you could sell
comics without censorship

00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:49.260
and having an environment
of readers that were able

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:50.990
to take the form for what it is.

00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:54.430
So you had the simultaneous
arrival of,

00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:58.550
by accident I might add,
of Maus in first volume

00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:01.540
by Art Spiegelman, Batman
the Dark Knight Returns,

00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:06.000
the Reagan Allegory by
Miller and Janson and Varley

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.530
and Watchmen by Alan Moore
and Dave Gibbons emerged

00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:11.790
to show this is what
comics can do.

00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:13.770
They are the high-water marks.

00:53:13.770 --> 00:53:15.360
There was a lot of other
stuff happening as well,

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:16.960
but those are the ones we
looked back on and went,

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:20.710
and the popular press at
the time said, this is it.

00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:23.230
Comics aren't just
for kids anymore.

00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:25.670
Again, law enforcement comes in.

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:29.890
In late 1986 in November
while monitoring places

00:53:29.890 --> 00:53:31.630
where youth congregate
in Lansing, Illinois,

00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:34.720
Officer Anthony Van Gorp and
his partner purchased 15 comics

00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:36.050
from Michael Correa, the manager

00:53:36.050 --> 00:53:38.700
of a store called Friendly
Franks and busted him

00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:42.530
for possession and sale of
obscene materials for some

00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:44.900
of the titles that you see here,
as well as some innocuous stuff

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:47.060
like Wonder Woman,
which the judge said,

00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:48.360
this isn't obscene,
I'm throwing it out.

00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:51.550
But I can definitely see
the satanic overtones in it.

00:53:51.550 --> 00:53:52.900
The more things change, right.

00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:57.640
He was convicted at the lower
court level, and Denis Kitchen

00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:01.320
who published some of the comics
there determined this isn't

00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:05.860
right and led an effort by the
industry to raise the funds

00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:09.610
that would ultimately go on
to hire the lawyer Burt Joseph

00:54:09.610 --> 00:54:11.630
that would win the appeal.

00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:14.000
For the first time in our
history, comics had stood

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.290
up for our intellectual freedom
and for the intellectual freedom

00:54:17.290 --> 00:54:18.770
of our retailers and one.

00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:22.850
It was from this basis that the
Comic Book Legal Defense Fund

00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:25.440
was established as
an ongoing concern.

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:28.860
And in the decades that have
followed we've engaged in dozens

00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:33.080
and dozens of cases for
retailers who have been targeted

00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:36.440
for selling work but also for
artists who have been prosecuted

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.170
for the contents of their work.

00:54:38.170 --> 00:54:40.450
Our most notable loss came

00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:42.400
when we were a very
young organization,

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:43.830
and in underground cartoonist

00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:46.570
from Florida named Mike
Diana was convicted

00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:48.660
of creating obscene
material as a result

00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:51.060
of his comic book Boiled Angel,
which would not be out of place

00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:52.740
on today's Adult Swim.

00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:56.310
But at the time, the
grotesque subject matter

00:54:56.310 --> 00:54:59.510
and visual style was
too much for audiences,

00:54:59.510 --> 00:55:03.330
and the prosecutor said, if
you think this stuff belongs

00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:06.420
in a museum, then
you think it's art.

00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:08.650
And if you think this
stuff doesn't belong

00:55:08.650 --> 00:55:10.240
in a museum then you
think it's obscene,

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.630
go ahead and convict it.

00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:12.930
And the jury did.

00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:15.160
It was a bad decision,

00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:17.130
and it showed no matter
how much you might think

00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:18.430
that the First Amendment
will prevail.

00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:20.100
Certainly, everybody in
comics at the time did.

00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:22.110
In fact, so many people
went out of their way

00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:24.820
to distance themselves
from Mike Diana's work

00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:26.810
and say well surely
his stuff is gross,

00:55:26.810 --> 00:55:28.580
but the First Amendment
will prevail,

00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:29.880
that everybody was
caught flat-footed

00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:31.490
in the industry when, in fact,

00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:33.370
the First Amendment
didn't prevail.

00:55:33.370 --> 00:55:36.150
This is the less of the moral
panic, even when you think

00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:38.140
that you have advanced
to a point

00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:40.100
where there are these victories,

00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:41.690
there's always the
danger of setback.

00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:45.000
And we're seeing those setbacks
today with a new generation

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.080
of challenges to some of
the most innocuous comics

00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:50.360
and graphic novels
that are happening.

00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:52.180
In fact, when I got into
this job 15 years ago,

00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:54.200
I thought for sure for the rest
of my life I was going to be

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.950
that guy that defends creepy
porno comics for a living.

00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:59.640
It's a bittersweet
thing to find that no,

00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:01.810
I'm defending the rights of
young people to read authors

00:56:01.810 --> 00:56:03.300
like Raina Telgemeier.

00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:07.180
Just last year, the top two
most frequently banned books

00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:10.730
in the United States was
This One Summer by Mariko

00:56:10.730 --> 00:56:13.680
and Jillian Tamaki, a very
sensitive, intelligent coming

00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:15.660
of age tale about
these two girls

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:17.870
on the brink of adolescence.

00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:20.280
And Drama by Telgemeier.

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:23.820
Now, a lot of these are
happening in environments

00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:27.720
where comics isn't really what
the parents are upset about.

00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:29.650
Or is it the fact that
they love their kids,

00:56:29.650 --> 00:56:31.800
and their kids are going
through changes in life.

00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:34.560
And you can attack the
John Green book more easily

00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:36.590
than you can attack say Tumblr.

00:56:36.590 --> 00:56:38.540
I'm sensitive to all of that.

00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:41.220
I wouldn't want to be a parent
raising a teenager right now

00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:43.640
because nobody over 25
has any idea what it's

00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:45.430
like to be under 25.

00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:47.460
And that's a fact you
can take to the bank.

00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:50.920
Nonetheless, our
job as elders is

00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:55.010
to help them understand the
world that they're coming into.

00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:58.330
Is trying to ban a comic
that you morally disagree

00:56:58.330 --> 00:56:59.940
with the right thing to do?

00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:01.380
I don't think so.

00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:03.070
I think that you have
a right as a parent

00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:04.970
to determine what you
want in your home.

00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:06.760
I think you have the
right as a parent to ask

00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:08.390
for an alternative
assignment if it is

00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:10.060
so offensive to your values.

00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:11.360
But you don't have
the right to parent

00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:12.660
for the rest of the community.

00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:13.960
And that is where a lot

00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:17.200
of the funds work these
days is concentrated.

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:19.870
Despite these challenges,
which I could to into in much,

00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:22.240
much greater detail if you
want to find me afterwards.

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:25.150
Comics are the future.

00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:31.360
Comics are the 21st century's
most potent form of literature.

00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:36.690
They marry the visual
literacy and textual literacy

00:57:36.690 --> 00:57:41.200
that our audiences
now crave and demand.

00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:44.060
And you can see it in
the growing success

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:45.400
of the graphic novel category.

00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:46.830
You can see it this weekend

00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:50.840
as SPX approaches fire
marshal levels of attendance.

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.580
You can see it every year

00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:55.490
when Sand Diego Comicon
sells out in a day.

00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:57.480
You can see it every
time you turn on your TV

00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:00.020
and there's a new
television program adapted

00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:03.600
from a graphic novel series,
whether it's an all-ages cartoon

00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:05.940
on the Disney Channel
or an AMC show

00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:08.520
like The Walking
Dead or Preacher.

00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:12.280
And in the end, I want to come
back Bill Gaines and what he had

00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:14.300
to say about comic's
intellectual freedom.

00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:17.510
Because I think it sparks the
resonant through line note

00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:21.480
that applies whether we're
talking about people being mad

00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:24.670
at Raina Telgemeier because her
comic has a gay character in it.

00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:27.020
Or people being mad
at William Gaines

00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:29.620
because he publishes
these gruesome images,

00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:31.680
or he talks about racism.

00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.070
What are we afraid of, he asks

00:58:33.070 --> 00:58:36.060
in his prepared statement
to the Congress.

00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:38.100
Are we afraid of
our own children?

00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:40.180
Do we forget that they are
citizens too and entitled

00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:42.410
to select what to read or do?

00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:45.030
The basic personality of a child
is established before he reaches

00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:46.590
the age of comic book reading.

00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:49.780
The truth is, that juvenile
delinquency is the product

00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:51.640
of a real environment
in which the child lives

00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:53.460
and not the fiction he reads.

00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:55.720
There are many problems that
reach our children today.

00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:57.220
No pill can cure them.

00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:59.450
No law will legislate
them out of being.

00:58:59.450 --> 00:59:02.670
The problems are economic and
social, and they are complex.

00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:04.920
Our people need understanding.

00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:07.800
They need to have affection,
decent homes, decent food.

00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:10.590
I can never remember
having seen one boy or girl

00:59:10.590 --> 00:59:13.740
who has committed a crime or
who became neurotic or psychotic

00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:17.230
because he or she
read comic books.

00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:20.240
The job of young people is
to horrify their elders.

00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:22.290
It's what they've done
since time and memorial

00:59:22.290 --> 00:59:26.120
and what they are going to
do until the end of time.

00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:29.150
Our job as elders is to have
those conversations with them

00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:32.030
that make them into good
citizens in training.

00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:34.180
Instead of attacking their
intellectual freedom,

00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:36.960
whether that takes the form of
a comic book or a video game

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:38.260
or a television show
or something

00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:41.960
that hasn't been invented
yet, watch it with them.

00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:43.480
Listen to them.

00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:44.820
Talk to them, because
they're going to be

00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:46.140
in your shoes one day too.

00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:48.510
Thanks for your time
this afternoon.

00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:59.090
[ Applause ]

00:59:59.090 --> 01:00:00.390
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley:
[Inaudible] for questions?

01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:01.690
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein: Yeah,
it's a little bit after one,

01:00:01.690 --> 01:00:03.310
so if anybody needs
to go, no problem.

01:00:03.310 --> 01:00:06.190
If anybody has any questions,
I'm happy to field any.

01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:07.490
Yeah, Mike.

01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:08.790
&gt;&gt; Can you flip back

01:00:08.790 --> 01:00:10.490
to the Captain America
censorship stuff?

01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:13.570
Those reprints are from
like '68 or '69 aren't they?

01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:15.480
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein: Mike's
asking if I can flip back

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:16.980
to the Captain America
censorship stuff

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.690
and asking the providence
of the reprint.

01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:23.110
And yeah, that's '66.

01:00:23.110 --> 01:00:25.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so much later than
people would have thought.

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:26.960
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein: Yeah.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.260
&gt;&gt; Still being aggressively
[inaudible].

01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:30.560
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein:
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.860
So to summarize.

01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:36.520
This was in the mid-60s that
these comics were amended.

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:38.620
Are there other questions?

01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:41.420
&gt;&gt; Was that Bill Gaines
book from his testimony?

01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:42.720
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein: Yeah,

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.020
that was from his
prepared statements,

01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:45.330
which I encourage
people to read in full.

01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:47.120
They're much more
eloquent than he was

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:49.510
in his naivety down there.

01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:50.910
Emily, you were next.

01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:53.270
&gt;&gt; You said something,
and I wasn't able

01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:54.570
to get the last part of it.

01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:57.610
You said comics are the
21st century's most potent,

01:00:57.610 --> 01:00:58.910
and I just wanted
to get the rest.

01:00:58.910 --> 01:01:00.210
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein:
Oh, form of literature.

01:01:00.210 --> 01:01:01.510
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.

01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:02.810
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein: There
was another one over here.

01:01:02.810 --> 01:01:04.110
Yes.

01:01:04.110 --> 01:01:07.240
&gt;&gt; Have you seen, now we're
seeing actual novels being

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:09.510
converted into graphic
novels and things like that.

01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:12.240
Have you seen and has
there ever been a case

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:15.610
where a graphic novel
has, somebody has gone

01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:18.330
after the graphic novels
and not the original novel?

01:01:18.330 --> 01:01:19.630
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein: Yeah,
that's a good question.

01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:22.550
The question was that
there are now an abundance

01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:26.490
of graphic novels that
are, that come from novels

01:01:26.490 --> 01:01:29.430
that they've been adapted
from the novel form

01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:30.730
and have I seen any cases

01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:33.760
where the graphic novel has been
challenged and not the original.

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.650
Yes, in fact, the fund
has been very active

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:38.270
in defending The Graveyard
Book graphic novel adaptation

01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:40.970
of Neil Gaiman's
prize-winning novel

01:01:40.970 --> 01:01:44.640
where the novel adaptation was
attacked in several localities

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:47.620
because it addresses
the death of parents.

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:49.650
And that being too
upsetting or inappropriate

01:01:49.650 --> 01:01:51.320
for the middle school audiences

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.950
that are confronting
that material.

01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:54.250
&gt;&gt; Wait a minute.

01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:55.550
The graphic novel
is attacked but --

01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:56.850
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein:
But not the novel.

01:01:56.850 --> 01:01:58.150
&gt;&gt; I was going to say,

01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:59.510
and I guarantee you they
will let [inaudible] Bambi,

01:01:59.510 --> 01:02:00.810
which is --

01:02:00.810 --> 01:02:02.110
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein:
Yeah right.

01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:03.410
Yeah.

01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:08.830
&gt;&gt; As a continued thought,
are there formalized groups

01:02:08.830 --> 01:02:12.960
that are, like we
had in the past?

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.720
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein: Sure, the
question is, are there any kind

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.860
of formal pressure
groups that are going

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:19.370
after graphic novels now
as there were in the past.

01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:21.010
And the answer, thank fully,

01:02:21.010 --> 01:02:24.000
is that not at the
moment that we are seeing.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.980
However, there are
campaigns that happen

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:30.040
in local environments
with great frequency.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.990
Some of the slides I had to pass

01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:36.740
over for time involve
media attacks on teachers

01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:39.650
and librarians that are making
graphic novels available.

01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:43.700
Earlier this year, we defended
a book edited by Ariel Schrag,

01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:46.160
an anthology called Stuck
in the Middle, which is,

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:49.280
I think it was called 12
Stories from a Difficult Age.

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:52.840
And it was anthology of stories
about being in middle school.

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:55.730
And the mother of a middle
school kid that checked it

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:57.470
out in the school library
where it had resided

01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:59.750
for the last ten
years or so objected

01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:03.550
because it depicted kids
smoking, and there was a scene

01:03:03.550 --> 01:03:05.300
where a kid talked
about his fantasy

01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:06.880
of how he would murder people.

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:10.430
Which I guarantee you, if you've
ever met a 12-year-old boy,

01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:12.300
or 12-year-old, like
this is a thing

01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:13.600
that happens in their head.

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.740
It wasn't just on the page.

01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:17.700
But they don't do it, right.

01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:20.550
It was a safe place to access
these feelings and emotions.

01:03:20.550 --> 01:03:24.260
And it was kind of talking
about everybody feels this way.

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:26.220
So this parent didn't
just challenge the book,

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:30.890
she went to the local TV station
that took the flagged copy,

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:33.640
the parent's flagged copy of
the book and did the old saw

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.430
of this book is so dangerous,

01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:37.230
we can't even show
you what's in it.

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:39.890
You know, that stuff
happens with great frequency.

01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:41.290
And the fund is active

01:03:41.290 --> 01:03:44.360
in providing resources
both intellectually,

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:47.290
and in some cases,
actually sending, you know,

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:50.750
experts that we pay for in to
help deal with these situations.

01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:52.210
Was there on this side, yes.

01:03:52.210 --> 01:03:56.090
&gt;&gt; I grew up in a
dictatorship in Spain.

01:03:56.090 --> 01:04:00.020
And it had a very
active censorship office.

01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:04.640
And those two remind me
of the [inaudible] stuff.

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.940
For example, [inaudible]

01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:11.670
which was the main comic book
publisher in Spain [inaudible].

01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:18.440
And I wanted to add also
that during the same period

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:24.470
of the dictatorship, one of the
creators became very famous,

01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:27.510
and he created two
comic book [inaudible].

01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:31.550
And those comic books
defied today's dictatorship.

01:04:31.550 --> 01:04:35.870
I mean the censors
missed the big picture.

01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:39.650
Because usually we have
the [inaudible] story

01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:43.000
that you would defeat the
enemy, meaning the dictator.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:48.040
And he would establish sort of
like a local governance council.

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:52.040
And the censorship
missed the big picture.

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:55.130
And he was laughing at
[inaudible] in the 1990s.

01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:58.870
But yeah, they had to fight
those things, but for him,

01:04:58.870 --> 01:05:01.410
it was a way to fight
the dictatorship.

01:05:01.410 --> 01:05:03.780
And he was a communist,

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:07.590
which means that in [inaudible]
it automatically means you're an

01:05:07.590 --> 01:05:09.540
enemy of the state.

01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:13.680
But he used those two comics,
the most popular comics

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:18.120
in Spain, to fight the
dictatorship and the censorship.

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:19.420
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein:
That's a great story.

01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:20.720
Thank you for --

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:24.160
&gt;&gt; And I just recommend those
two titles for the library.

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:25.960
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein:
And what are they?

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:29.610
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

01:05:29.610 --> 01:05:34.070
&gt;&gt; [Foreign Language]
was created in 1956,

01:05:34.070 --> 01:05:37.710
and [Foreign Language]
was created in 1958.

01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:39.800
The first one was set
in the Middle Ages.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:44.070
The second one was set
in the [inaudible].

01:05:44.070 --> 01:05:45.690
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein:
Before I get to you, Shannon,

01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:47.060
thank you for sharing that.

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:50.770
And it brings up a really
great aspect of comics

01:05:50.770 --> 01:05:53.420
in that their ability

01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:58.640
to be subversive is
very, very important.

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:02.690
Whether it is these
example in Franco, Spain.

01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:08.230
Walt Kelly taking on Estes
Kefauver in the strip Pogo.

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:14.330
You know, modern efforts of
editorial cartoonists that are,

01:06:14.330 --> 01:06:16.220
you know, in some cases really
putting their livelihood

01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:19.010
on the line by speaking
truth to power.

01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:21.380
You know, all are
contained within this medium.

01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:23.770
And for a long time,
because it was regarded

01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:26.860
as low value speech,
it was a place

01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:30.350
where people could really
give voice to these sorts

01:06:30.350 --> 01:06:33.660
of concerns either
about political justice

01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:36.570
or social justice and the way
that I shared the EC stories.

01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:40.120
And I think it continues
to perform that function.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:41.420
Shannon.

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:42.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was just curious,

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:48.880
like '48 is where you said
all these laws were beginning

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:51.980
to be passed against comics
and against publishers.

01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:53.280
I'm just wondering,

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:56.110
what convictions were
happening at that time.

01:06:56.110 --> 01:06:58.130
Because until Mike
Diana came along,

01:06:58.130 --> 01:07:01.250
that's the first time I've
heard of a comic artist being --

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:02.840
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein: Sure.

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:05.470
So the question was with the
laws passed against comics

01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:08.630
in 1948, what's the
conviction record?

01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:11.540
And that's a very good question

01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:14.700
that there aren't
really good answers to.

01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:17.590
The first serious
conviction that I'm aware

01:07:17.590 --> 01:07:21.850
of involving the sale of
comics was the 1971 conviction

01:07:21.850 --> 01:07:26.680
of the New Yorker Bookstore
in the Zap number four case.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:30.690
Prior to that in the underground
comics there were a lot

01:07:30.690 --> 01:07:35.420
of cases brought against
head shops and bookstores

01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:37.670
that would sell underground
comics didn't make it all the

01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:38.970
way to court.

01:07:38.970 --> 01:07:41.650
Ron Turner, famous, the
publisher of Last Gasp,

01:07:41.650 --> 01:07:45.800
tells a story about a comic
book pungently entitled Felch

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:49.490
which was the basis of a
prosecution in Long Beach,

01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:51.580
California, and it
was they were going

01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:53.160
to bust the store that sold it.

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.510
And they were going to put
these guys in jail forever.

01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:58.550
But one of the cops stole it
because they wanted to pass it

01:07:58.550 --> 01:08:00.390
around the office, so it
never made it into evidence

01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:02.100
and the case was thrown out.

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:04.290
There's a lot of stuff
like that that happened.

01:08:04.290 --> 01:08:07.700
The first one that really stuck
was this Zap number four case.

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:13.070
The stuff in the
1940s and the 1950s

01:08:13.070 --> 01:08:16.770
after the Kefauver hearings were
really about being deterrents.

01:08:16.770 --> 01:08:19.450
They were about creating
an economic deterrent

01:08:19.450 --> 01:08:23.370
to distribution of the material
that was found objectionable.

01:08:23.370 --> 01:08:26.390
And in a lot of ways were
using the laws in a way

01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:27.690
that was unconstitutional.

01:08:27.690 --> 01:08:28.990
Because they were attempting

01:08:28.990 --> 01:08:31.680
to create a prior restraint
upon the freedom of expression.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:34.210
But there wasn't,
certainly there was no group

01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:39.170
like the funds and the ACLU,
while they spoke out for comics

01:08:39.170 --> 01:08:41.870
in the 1950s, and in particular,

01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:45.490
in the 1954 subcommittee
hearings, you know,

01:08:45.490 --> 01:08:46.790
wasn't really bringing cases

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:49.080
against those sorts
of laws at the time.

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:51.400
And I don't think it
would have helped anyway

01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:53.170
because the public
was so adamant

01:08:53.170 --> 01:08:57.170
that this stuff is a
danger to our youth

01:08:57.170 --> 01:08:58.770
that something needs
to be done about it.

01:08:58.770 --> 01:09:01.610
That the economics
dictated the code.

01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:03.030
Never forget, the
code is a creature

01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:05.100
of the comic book
industry first and foremost

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:07.090
and always had been
throughout its time.

01:09:07.090 --> 01:09:09.630
There's on this side, and
then I'll get to you, Mike.

01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:11.430
Was there on this side?

01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:12.890
Okay, I'm sorry about
that, Mike.

01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:14.190
Go ahead.

01:09:14.190 --> 01:09:16.700
&gt;&gt; Oh, I was just going to say
the current comic [inaudible]

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:20.180
and talks a little bit about
his trial first edition

01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:21.840
in World War I.

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:27.080
So he was actually affected
and had economic consequences.

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:32.110
&gt;&gt; But that was for violating
the then [inaudible] law.

01:09:32.110 --> 01:09:34.200
[ Overlapped Speaking ]

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:36.530
It's still for his
cartoons, though Warren.

01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:38.000
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.650
&gt;&gt; So how do we actually
give you money, Charles.

01:09:39.650 --> 01:09:43.020
That was my main question.

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:44.320

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:46.040
to the Comic Book
Legal Defense Fund,

and thank you for that, Mike.

01:09:47.830 --> 01:09:50.040
You can contribute to the
Comic Book Legal Defense Fund

in a variety of ways.

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.790

01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:59.880

as five bucks a year.

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.440
And it does two things.

resources we need

01:10:04.530 --> 01:10:06.970
to protect the people
that need protection.

01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:09.240
And it also gives us standing
in cases where we have

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.440
to fight unconstitutional
legislation and can point

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:14.420
to membership within
that environment.

01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:17.580
You can also support our work
by coming to SPX this weekend

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:19.010
where we're going to
be having signings,

01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:21.760
and we've got graphic novels
available that are signed

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:24.540
by their creators to
raise money for our work.

01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:26.300
But yeah, when we break up here,

01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:28.670
I'll pull the publications
out of the bag.

01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:30.010
We have our new brand
books [inaudible] handbook

01:10:30.010 --> 01:10:31.370
that I can give to everybody.

01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:33.830
And that has all of
our signup information.

01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:37.520
Whatever you can do to help,
whatever's within your budget,

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:39.170
does help us achieve our book.

01:10:39.170 --> 01:10:41.830
We're a small staff of
three full-time folks,

01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:45.780
and a part-time editorial
director

01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:47.180
that does all of this work.

01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:49.260
And we pride ourselves
on being transparent

01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:51.230
and being good stewards
of your contributions.

01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:53.970
&gt;&gt; And you get an
awesome looking lapel pin.

01:10:53.970 --> 01:10:55.890
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein:
We do have good merch.

01:10:55.890 --> 01:11:00.540
Our Deputy Director Alex
Cox makes amazing merch.

01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:03.510
&gt;&gt; Georgia Higley: Okay, let's
thank Charles one more time.

01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:10.230
[ Applause ]

01:11:10.230 --> 01:11:11.530
&gt;&gt; Charles Brownstein:
Thank you folks

01:11:11.530 --> 01:11:14.810
And here are those handbooks
with our membership info.

01:11:14.810 --> 01:11:18.470
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
