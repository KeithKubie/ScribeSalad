00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:08.040
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.900 position:56%
&gt;&gt; The Library of Congress Junior
Fellows program offers undergraduate

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.960
and graduate students the
opportunity to work on projects

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.170
with specialists at
the world's largest

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.730
and most comprehensive
repository of human knowledge.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.560
Through the Junior Fellows program,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.010
the Library of Congress furthers
its mission to increase access

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.150
and awareness of its collections.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.420
Junior Fellows are
exposed to a broad array

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.650
of library work including:
reference, conservation,

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.670
digitization, cataloging,
and collections processing.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.190
Fellows work with a
broad range of materials

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.090
and use their varied
educational backgrounds to work

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.610
with the collection in
a wide array of fields.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.970
&gt;&gt; BETHANY: I work on
the Yudin Collection

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.300
and the Yudin Collection
is the basis

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.400
for the Russian language collection
here at the Library of Congress.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.200
We acquired it in 1906
and there are round

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.440
about 80,000 volumes
in this collection.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.840
The breadth and depth
that is covered

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.780
within this collection is vast.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.740 position:56%
We have a hand written card catalog.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.380
People who worked for
Yudin sat down and wrote

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.780
down every single book
that he ever acquired.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.080
Neatly hand written.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.550
It really helps us out because then
we can identify exactly what it is

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.220
and if the item that we have
is the Yudin item or not.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.870
&gt;&gt; ANASTASIA: I'm working with
the Congressional Research Service

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.780
with two analysts and I'm
helping them compile a report

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.750
on behavioral health issues
among American Indians

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.770
and Alaskan natives.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.710 position:56%
I'm studying library and information
science and I have an interest

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.740
in both librarianship,
but also research

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.020
and I am particularly interested
in indigenous systems of knowledge.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.700
And this report seemed like a
really good fit and a utilization

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.390
of both my interests and
also research on a scale

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.720
that I've never done before.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.760
&gt;&gt; GRAYSON: We are working with
the popular applied graphic

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.330
arts collection.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.110
Its scope includes pretty much
anything that was produced

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.210
for popular consumption,
commercially.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.580
So, we have everything
from decorative prints,

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.520
chromolithographs, to
advertisements and teaching aids.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.040 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RYAN: This collection encompasses
hundreds and hundreds of prints.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.220
So, in order to get through this,
we first had to organize them,

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.570
remove duplicate prints since
many of them were submitted

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.650
in pairs to the Copyright Office.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.290
And then prepare them in an
organized fashion for the next step

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.260
which is processing them
and then recording data.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.930
&gt;&gt; SARA: So, with the
recording data, we do it mostly

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.230 position:56%
on a computer in an Access database.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.220
What we do is record artist,
publisher, the medium.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.020
And then if there are
any special notes,

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.480
we do the copyright information.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.170
And that will be used by the
cataloger to make the record

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.380
that most patrons will see
and then it will go up online

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.640
after it's been digitized.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.130
&gt;&gt; RYAN: I'm a political
science major,

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.250
so I've really been interested in
some of the drawers that have had

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.110
to do with the U.S.
government, or the military,

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.040
major sites in Washington DC.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.810
So, it's really interesting to see
the holdings that you can find here

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.470
at the library but
not many other places

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.800
in the United States
or in the world.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.700
&gt;&gt; CAROL: My responsibility is

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.050
to help digitize the Hebraic
section's manuscript collections.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.760 position:56%
So, we have approximately 225
manuscripts that we like to digitize

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.600
and make accessible to both
researchers and to the public.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.440
And so what I've been
ding on a daily basis,

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.630
is I've been scanning
manuscripts one at a time

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:54.420 position:56%
and making them basically uploadable
on to the Hebraic section website.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.230
This manuscript is called a
khetuba and it's made on vellum.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.660
So a khetuba is an official
marriage contract written

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.980
in Hebrew and Aramaic.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.850
All of these manuscripts as
well as the khetuba are all part

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:19.250 position:56%
of Jewish marriage ceremony in
Italy during the early modern period

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.270
into the nineteenth century.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.390
And I just really love
seeing what's on every page

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.910
and just all the intricate details.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.160
And so, it's been such a privilege
working to be able to work

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.490
with sometimes objects that
are 200, 300, 500 years old.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.310
&gt;&gt; KATHERINE: I'm working
on a project

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.720
that involves cataloging
photographic

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.980
and photographic related
samples and photography manuals

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.260
from the nineteenth
and twentieth century.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.330
So, what I've been doing
is to locate these samples,

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.120
to identify then in a
database, to photograph them,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.390
and to also find other materials
in these texts about the samples.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.450
Some of these things
we kind of found

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.430
and discovered just pulling books
off the shelf in the general stacks

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.090
and it's so amazing,
what is back there.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.360
You don't know what you're going to
find when you open up these things.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.660
It's totally mind-blowing.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.980
Really, I think that's the
only way to describe it.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.310
So, get out there and explore
in the areas you are interested

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.800
in you will find rally, in many
cases totally unique objects

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.940
that you can't find anywhere else.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.060
&gt;&gt; Aside from their
assigned projects,

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.590
Junior Fellows also have a calendar

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.600 position:56%
of educational enrichment activities
throughout the ten week program.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.630
Some of these include meeting
the Acting Librarian of Congress

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.990
and tours of the National
Audio-Visual Conservation Center

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.570
in Culpeper, Virginia.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.340
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Those are
really interesting places

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.300
because not even very many
Library of Congress employees,

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.850
unless you work there,
not many get to tour.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.360
So, it was really neat to see
inside the satellite facilities

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.790
that are off limits to the public.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.090
&gt;&gt; The Junior Fellows program
concludes with Display Day:

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.710
an opportunity for Fellows
to showcase their discoveries

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.560
and accomplishments and answer
questions from the Librarian

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.640
of Congress and library
staff, friends and family,

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.860
and special guests
including members of Congress.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.770
&gt;&gt; BETHANY: I have loved
this program so much.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.840
I don't think I could
have made a better choice

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.500
for my Summer internship.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.020
I have done enough research
within this collection

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:27.890 position:56%
that I am writing two articles to
hopefully be published with the help

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.180
of some of my supervisors.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.630
&gt;&gt; KATHERINE: One of
the great things

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.830
about doing this project is working
with really wonderful conservators,

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.370
especially my supervisor whose
been a really wonderful mentor

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.330
to me here - has helped me
gain a much better knowledge

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.560 position:56%
of the chemistry and technical
aspects of the production of photos,

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.940
especially in the 19th century.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.160
And that's been really helpful.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.880
&gt;&gt; RYAN: When I hear the
word, library, I thing books.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.240
But, the Library has a
lot more than just books.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.610
So, it's really interesting to
see the variety that go outside

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.200
of what you might initially think
of when you hear the word, library.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.460
&gt;&gt; SARA: You can walk up to
anybody and ask what they're doing

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.390
and they'll explain it to you or at
least tell you what they're doing

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.120
on a basic level and I really like
that as somebody that's coming

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.360
up in that kind of field.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.660
&gt;&gt; BETHANY: I would apply.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.060
You can't do a better internship
for your library program,

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.840
for your humanities program.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.540
This is the Library of Congress.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.850
It's the largest library
in the world.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:32.620
How can you say no?

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.990
This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
