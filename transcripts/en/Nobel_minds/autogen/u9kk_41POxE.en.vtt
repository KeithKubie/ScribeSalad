do so what were you doing when the call

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329
do so what were you doing when the call
 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:56.069
do so what were you doing when the call
came from urine and what was your first

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079
came from urine and what was your first
 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.319
came from urine and what was your first
thought hearing the news I was

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329
thought hearing the news I was
 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.049
thought hearing the news I was
completely shocked and surprised

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059
completely shocked and surprised
 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.030
completely shocked and surprised
marvelous marvelous the truth is that

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040
marvelous marvelous the truth is that
 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.430
marvelous marvelous the truth is that
anyone almost anyone who receives the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440
anyone almost anyone who receives the
 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.920

Nobel Prize has some indirect knowledge

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930
Nobel Prize has some indirect knowledge
 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.630
Nobel Prize has some indirect knowledge
of one sort or another that they might

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640
of one sort or another that they might
 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.230
of one sort or another that they might
be a candidate and so you know at some

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240
be a candidate and so you know at some
 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.820
be a candidate and so you know at some
level is not a complete surprise but

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830
level is not a complete surprise but
 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.350
level is not a complete surprise but
that it actually happens is an

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360
that it actually happens is an
 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.270
that it actually happens is an
out-of-body experience and do you think

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280
out-of-body experience and do you think
 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.860
out-of-body experience and do you think
you're going to relish the onslaught of

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870
you're going to relish the onslaught of
 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:39.830
you're going to relish the onslaught of

medicine is that is that when proteins
 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.330
medicine is that is that when proteins
operate at the sub cellular level they

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340
operate at the sub cellular level they
 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.550
operate at the sub cellular level they
behave and there's certain ways if they

absolutely fascinating when you when we

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660
absolutely fascinating when you when we

when we study chemistry the chemistry
the rules of chemistry electrons and so

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510
the rules of chemistry electrons and so
 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.360
the rules of chemistry electrons and so
on they they operate it as even smaller

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370
on they they operate it as even smaller
 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.890
on they they operate it as even smaller
level of atoms and molecules but when

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900
level of atoms and molecules but when
 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.890
level of atoms and molecules but when
you get to the sort of level of the nano

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900
you get to the sort of level of the nano

always have it's a beautiful picture and
 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:30.099
always have it's a beautiful picture and
actually my orientation originally was

in physics I was trained as a physicist
busy young and what so attracted me

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690
busy young and what so attracted me
 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.259
busy young and what so attracted me
about molecular biology was the the the

the opportunity to find simplicity thank

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829
the opportunity to find simplicity thank
 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.479
the opportunity to find simplicity thank
you but and in in a week or twos time

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.979
question
what gave you the courage to embark on

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989
what gave you the courage to embark on
 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.440
what gave you the courage to embark on
this study in the first place because

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450
this study in the first place because
 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.849
this study in the first place because
the initial experiments were it wasn't

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859
the initial experiments were it wasn't
 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.909
the initial experiments were it wasn't
clear that they'd work at all no I don't

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:12.919
clear that they'd work at all no I don't
 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.379
clear that they'd work at all no I don't
know you probably have the benefit of

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389
know you probably have the benefit of
 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:19.060
know you probably have the benefit of
the press release so I don't know quite

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070
the press release so I don't know quite
 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.540
the press release so I don't know quite
how the committee you know has written

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550
how the committee you know has written
 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.760
how the committee you know has written
this story but yes there were in the

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770
this story but yes there were in the
 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.890
this story but yes there were in the
earlier years when I

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900
earlier years when I
 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.469
earlier years when I
when I started this project it Stanford

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479
when I started this project it Stanford
 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:34.360
when I started this project it Stanford
University everybody told me that that

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370
University everybody told me that that
 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.820
University everybody told me that that
it was nuts to go and try to reproduce

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830
it was nuts to go and try to reproduce
 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.040
it was nuts to go and try to reproduce
you know the complexities of the

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050
you know the complexities of the
 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.870
you know the complexities of the
mysterious complexities that occur in

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880
mysterious complexities that occur in
 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.529
mysterious complexities that occur in
the whole cell in a cell-free extract

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539
the whole cell in a cell-free extract
 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:50.610
the whole cell in a cell-free extract
and but III and and my courage came from

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620
 
 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.730
 
three sources I would say the first in

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740
three sources I would say the first in
 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.550
three sources I would say the first in
all seriousness was youth because

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560
all seriousness was youth because
 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.790
all seriousness was youth because
there's a certain arrogance and in youth

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800
there's a certain arrogance and in youth
 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.930
there's a certain arrogance and in youth
I don't know if I'd have had the courage

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940
I don't know if I'd have had the courage
 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.939
I don't know if I'd have had the courage
to do that today

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949
to do that today
 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.710
to do that today
the second was the fact that you could

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720
the second was the fact that you could
 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.080
the second was the fact that you could
in those days in the United States you

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090
in those days in the United States you
 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.390
in those days in the United States you
could do adventurous things with very

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400
could do adventurous things with very
 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.370
could do adventurous things with very
little or no preliminary data and you

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380
little or no preliminary data and you
 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.400
little or no preliminary data and you
could still get support from the NIH to

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410
could still get support from the NIH to
 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.310
could still get support from the NIH to
do it and so in today's environment I

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320
do it and so in today's environment I
 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.200
do it and so in today's environment I
doubt very much and I would have had the

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210
doubt very much and I would have had the
