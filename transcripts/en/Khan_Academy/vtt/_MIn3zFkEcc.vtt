00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:06.800
Round 9.564, or nine and
five hundred sixty-four

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.310
thousandths, to the
nearest tenth.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.645
So let me write it a little
bit larger, 9.564.

00:00:16.645 --> 00:00:19.340
And we need to round to
the nearest tenth.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.760
So what's the tenth place?

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.730
The tenths plays
is right here.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.170
This right here represents
5 tenths.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.820
This is the ones place, this is
the tenths place, this is

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.430
the hundredths place,
and this is the

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.920
thousandths place right here.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.260
So we need to round to
the nearest tenth.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.790
So if we round up,
this will be 9.6.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.460
If we round down, this
will be 9.5.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.620
And just like regular rounding,
when we're not

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.920
dealing with decimals, you move
to one spot, or you look

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.480
at one place to the right or one
place lower, I guess, and

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.950
you say is that 5 or larger?

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.500
If it is, you round up, if
it isn't, you round down.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.040
6 is definitely 5 or larger,
so we want to round up.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:19.800
So this 9.564 becomes 9.6,
or we can call this

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.510
nine and six tenths.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.200
And then we're done!
