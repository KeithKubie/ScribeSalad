00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.648
Since we know our equation is written in the form y equals mx plus b, cost of

00:00:04.648 --> 00:00:09.058
new machinery must be this b. In other words, cost of new machinery is the

00:00:09.058 --> 00:00:13.526
y-coordinate of the y-intercept of this line. I am just going to make that

00:00:13.526 --> 00:00:18.491
variable replacement right now, and just replace cost of machinery with b. So,

00:00:18.491 --> 00:00:23.128
this equation looks pretty good. But can we go any further? Think about what we

00:00:23.128 --> 00:00:26.943
are trying to find. We want to find out how much Grant should spend on nozzle

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:30.567
machinery. Keeping in mind what it is we are trying to find out, do we have

00:00:30.567 --> 00:00:34.776
enough information to go further with this problem, and calculate that quantity?

00:00:34.776 --> 00:00:38.499
In other words, do we have enough information to come up with a number that is

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:42.483
equal to the amount that Grant should spend on nozzle machinery? Please tell me

00:00:42.483 --> 00:00:42.990
yes or no.
