In this video we're going to
experiment with melting epsom salt,

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.180
In this video we're going to
experiment with melting epsom salt,

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.860
also known as magnesium sulfate.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:11.840
[Music]

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.160
YouTube user Dallas Woiken
was curious what would happen

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.360
if we put epsom salt in our foundry.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.460
Will it melt down into a liquid
the same way table salt does?

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.840
Here's what we want to learn.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.980
Can we melt Epsom salt in our furnace?

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.100
And if we pour it out into a mold,
can we cast something out of it?

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.580
Epsom salt is magnesium sulfate,

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.640
and it's most commonly
dissolved into water,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.220
and used as a mild first aid
for things like sprains or bruises.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.620
This is also used as a saline laxative.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.820
Meaning you mix it with water,
it turns it into a salty water,

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.640
and it helps you go of your stopped up.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.620
But it is a type of salt,

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.160
and we're going to see if we can
get it to melt down into a liquid

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.020
similar to the melting down table salt.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.400
[Music]

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.160
It's kind of bitter.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.180
I really don't enjoy that.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.040
It doesn't taste at all like table salt,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.100
like none whatsoever.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.680
It's not terribly surprising.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.040
It's entirely different compounds.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.250
It's entirely different chemicals.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.400
It just happens to look similar,
and it is a type of salt

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.080
but it's not table salt.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.940
But let's see what happens
when we melt it down.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.140
Can we get this to turn
into a puddle of clear liquid?

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.980
[Music]

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.480
Don't know why one is
blue and one is green.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.960
[Music]

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.340
It does look like something is
happening around the edges of the cup.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.880
So I'm inclined to think that maybe
this is going to go somewhere.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.450
However, magnesium sulfate is
supposed to melt at quite a bit

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.260
higher of a temperature than table salt.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.460
So we are going to put the
lid on and let it sit for a while,

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.840
and see what result we get.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.740
After we look at the melted epsom salt,

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.360
I wanted to try casting it,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.840
and I was trying to
decide on a good shape,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.180
and I thought, well, it's a crystal,

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.820
what if we make it
look like a bigger crystal?

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.100
So I took this piece of wood,
and I cut it and I sanded it down

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.900
to sort of look like a crystal growth,

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.460
then I fit an eye bolt in the back,

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.660
and we're going to try and mold
this wooden crystal in some dirt,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.140
pull it out, and then cast our
magnesium sulfate in that crystal shape.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.520
Our epsom salt has been in the foundry

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.380
for probably 30, maybe
40 minutes at this point,

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.130
and it's just starting to liquefy.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.870
However, the steel cup that
it's in is starting to fall apart.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.100
The added heat makes
it oxidize a lot faster,

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.260
and it's possible that the magnesium
sulfate does something to it as well.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.000
But I think we've started losing
part of the sidewall of our steel cup.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.560
We're going to take a look at
what's happening inside this thing.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.140
It's all very bright.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.480
[Music]

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.760
So we've got some liquid down there.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.170
It's sort of like a thick liquid
but this cup was solid when it went in,

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.440
and it's just now falling to pieces.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.980
Very thin-walled steel cup.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.220
I'm afraid if we give it any more time,

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.460
that cup is just going to
completely going to disintegrate.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.520
In fact, it might already.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.880
It might just fall apart
as I try and take it out.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.420
[Music]

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.620
And leaving the top off of
the foundry cooled it off enough

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.860
that whatever liquid we did have
at the bottom of that cup is just gone.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.820
By gone, I mean it's re-solidified.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.760
I have a crucible that is now
full of regular table salt,

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.440
and we're going to try
and melt it down here.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.440
And the reason we didn't use the
magnesium sulfate in this crucible

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.200
is that these crucibles
insulate quite a bit more,

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.560
and since I knew that our foundry
was only barely able to get

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.180
to the temperature that melts
the epsom salt in the first place,

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.340
I didn't think it would be able
to melt it through this crucible.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.600
However, the table salt has a
much lower melting point,

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.460
and we should be able to liquefy it in here.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:51.260
[Music]

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.840
It has cooled down, turned back
to being mostly white,

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.140
but it's still very hot.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.200
So let's pour some water on,
and see what happens.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.500
[Music]

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.720
Oh, a lot of steam.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.099
That's some weird formation.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.020
The shapes that this is turned into
on the sides is pretty funky stuff.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.460
Rest in peace
stainless steel measuring cup.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:19.020
[Music]

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:24.280
Completely destroyed the
integrity of that steel cup.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.040
It's just gone.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.880
[Music]

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.060
And here's our salt.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.360
[Music]

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.180
To mold our little wooden crystal,

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.520
we're going to mix some water in
with this dirt that I've sieved a little bit

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.300
to get all of the large pebbles out.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.960
And we're going to try and use
these two by four pieces

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.520
of sort of box to hold it together.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.760
I'll press this in and really press
all of the-- I guess we call it mud,

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.260
but it won't be quite so wet as that,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.660
and we'll try and make
a mold then pull this out.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.460
Hopefully it comes out nice and cleanly,

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.000
and we can pour our salt into that.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:05.680
Okay,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.220
the inside of that looks pretty good.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.620
That's going to be our mold.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.200
We'll see what happens
when we try casting salt into it.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:21.400
[Music]

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.380
Oh-oh.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.580
[Music]

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.020
I believe the force of the salt
hitting the water in the mold

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.720
broke the mold apart,

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.360
and we started having our
liquid salt flowing out the bottom.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.260
I admit I did have some suspicions
that something like that would happen.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:51.580
[Music]

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.400
Lots of salt flowing over there.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.960
[Music]

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.240
Some right there.
There is still some in the mold,

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.300
but I'm not sure if any of it
stayed in intact in there,

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.210
like the shape of the mold
might be completely destroyed.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.020
I don't see any clear exit points though.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.259
So that could all just be salt
that bubbled over off the top and ran.

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:14.240
It might not have broken out of the mold.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.200
It might have just
bubbled up from the mold.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.960
Let's give that a couple 
minutes to cool down.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.620
[Music]

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.260
Well, I wouldn't say
it casted up very pretty,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.160
but we did get the shape
of the crystal a little bit.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:50.520
[Music]

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.720
Attempting to melt epsom salt
did not really work very well.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.220
We were barely able to
get it to melting temperature,

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:02.160
and by the time the heat had caused
our steel cup to oxidize so badly

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.760
that it lost all structural integrity,

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.400
and all we got were some
lumps of half-melted salts.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.040
Melting down the regular table salt,

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.680
we then tried casting that,
and it was mixed results.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.960
We cast it in really wet dirt,

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.420
and the salt reacted with the
moisture in the dirt unsurprisingly,

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.930
and a lot of the salt
bubbled up out of the dirt,

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.210
and what didn't bubble up had
a tendency to stick to the dirt itself.

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.220
So there's dirt sort
of embedded in the salt.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.740
There have been a lot of questions
asking whether or not we can cast salt.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.900
A lot of people have
commented wanting to see that,

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.360
and this is by no means
a definitive answer.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.980
We got a fairly poor result,
but we did get a result.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.060
It took the shape
that it was poured into,

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.480
but it's so full of air bubbles,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.700
and the dirt of the substrate
that it was being poured into,

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.380
it's not a very good representation.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.960
But there's lots of different
things you can cast in.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.140
Just because it did not
work in this one method,

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.460
doesn't mean it won't work at all,

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.500
and we might want to try some
other methods in the future.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.080
Hmm.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.520
Salt and dirt. What a great mix.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.980
Guys, that's not the end,
there's always more to see.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.699
That box up at the top will transport
you directly to our last video,

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.780
and you should go check that out.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.662
The other box will show you what
YouTube thinks you need to be watching next,

00:08:10.662 --> 00:08:12.840
and this bomb in the middle
will subscribe you to the channel

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.360
so you never miss out on the fun.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.340
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we will see in the next one.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:16.970
Talk to you then.
