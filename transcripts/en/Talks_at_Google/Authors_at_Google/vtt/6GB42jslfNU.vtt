VISHAL JAIN: Welcome everyone to
today's Talks at Google event.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.280
I'm Vishal Jain, product
manager here at Google.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.790
And I'm happy to host our
guest today, the founder

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.671
and CEO of KIND bar, and
also the author of this book,

00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:16.129
"Do the KIND Thing,"
where he talks

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.570
about his experiences
starting the KIND bar company,

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.500
and some of the
lessons that can apply

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.300
to socially conscious
enterprises around the world.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.730
So with that, I'd like to
introduce Daniel Lubetzky.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.960
So today I thought that
a good format would

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.806
be for us to just
ask a few questions,

00:00:35.806 --> 00:00:37.930
and we're going to do some
audience questions later

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.500
on as well.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.270
And I apologize in
advance if it sounds

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.530
as though we're interviewing
you for a job at Google.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.900
I assure you we're not.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.100
DANIEL LUBETZKY: It would
be an honor and a pleasure

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.402
if I could even try to make it.

00:00:52.402 --> 00:00:54.110
VISHAL JAIN: Well,
we'd love to have you,

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.250
if you decide that you
want to change careers.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.750
DANIEL LUBETZKY: You
heard it here first.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.650
VISHAL JAIN: So Daniel, one of
the really interesting things

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.946
about what you've done
is you've made a margin

00:01:04.946 --> 00:01:08.070
in an industry that's very
different than our industry

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.300
here at Google, which is in the
consumer packaged goods world.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.450
And obviously, we have
KIND bars distributed

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.280
around Google's micro kitchens,
and all of our offices.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.377
And we love the product.

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:19.710
But as someone who's done
something really interesting--

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.620
DANIEL LUBETZKY:
Thank you, guys.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.770
VISHAL JAIN: As someone
who's done something really

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.170
interesting in
the CPG world, I'm

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.420
just curious about when
you look at the landscape

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.799
today, what CPG companies
are really inspiring you?

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.090
And what brands do you think
have really done something

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.006
interesting out there?

00:01:37.404 --> 00:01:39.820
DANIEL LUBETZKY: But you want
me to focus on CPG companies

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.160
in particular?

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.129
I find companies that are true
to their brands [? to be ?]

00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:47.420
the ones that most interest me.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.660
It doesn't necessarily need to
be a socially conscious brand.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.487
I mean, I really
admire Starbucks.

00:01:53.487 --> 00:01:54.570
They're a partner of ours.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.420
And I really like a
lot of what they do.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.165
I really like
Target as retailers.

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.280
There's so many different
companies I like.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.090
But I like brands like Snickers.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.449
I think Snickers is a
very authentic brand.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.560
It's very much about--
it knows what it is.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.920
Snickers satisfies you.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.095
It does a very good job at
being fun and irreverent.

00:02:16.095 --> 00:02:18.420
It doesn't try to
be something else.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.420
So I think what
brands that I enjoy

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.920
the most are the ones that
really understand their value

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.800
proposition, and who they
are, and what customer

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.940
they cater for.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.990
And then they just
live their brand.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.630
I like Lululemon a lot
in terms of what they've

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.920
achieved in such a short time.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.390
But it's not necessarily the
socially conscious brand for me

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.590
that I would [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.746
It's most about authenticity.

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:45.370
VISHAL JAIN: That
makes a lot of sense.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.826
And I can see how
Snickers, in that sense,

00:02:47.826 --> 00:02:49.450
must have been one
of your inspirations

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.783
as well when you were starting--

00:02:50.783 --> 00:02:53.087
DANIEL LUBETZKY: I
wouldn't go that far.

00:02:53.087 --> 00:02:55.670
I mean, I have my Snickers, but
they're a very different value

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.720
proposition from ours.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.920
But I just think that they know
who they are, what are they,

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.586
and they don't try
to be something else.

00:03:00.586 --> 00:03:05.140
I think what's dangerous
is when a brand-- consumer

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.510
tastes are changing a lot.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.030
And Snickers is
always going to have

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.920
a great market for
the mass consumer that

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.110
wants a candy bar.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.350
And it's a great product.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.360
But for people that
want to eat more

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.349
nutritionally dense
products, there's

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:21.640
a completely different product.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.380
And what I think
would be dangerous

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.819
is for Snickers to try
to become what it's not.

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:26.860
That's why I admire them.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.210
Not because I aspire or
took that much inspiration

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.800
from them, other than that
they learned who they are.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.540
When I started my first company,
I didn't really think enough

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.620
about these issues.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.750
And I was trying to be
everything for everybody.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.401
And I talk a lot about the
most embarrassing examples

00:03:43.401 --> 00:03:43.900
in the book.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.557
But I really was trying to
do a lot of things at once

00:03:46.557 --> 00:03:48.640
and cater to a lot of
different type of consumers.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.010
And I wasn't sufficiently
mindful about the importance

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.600
of being obsessive
about what your brand is

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.090
and what it should stand for.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.530
And somebody once said
that a brand is a promise.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.710
And a great brand is
a promise well-kept.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.650
And that has really
stayed with me,

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.650
particularly after the
many mistakes and failures

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.460
in my earlier career, when
I was not being sufficiently

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.140
obsessive about staying within
the guard rails of the brand

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.610
promise that we made.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.110
VISHAL JAIN: That's
really well-put.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.952
I like that.

00:04:20.952 --> 00:04:22.910
It's interesting you talk
about the combination

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.290
of different value propositions.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.040
And in the book you talk a
lot about the "and" principle.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.040
And it sounds as though
you're basically saying,

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.390
you've got to pick sort of
the right two or three things

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.598
that you really want to
combine together that haven't

00:04:34.598 --> 00:04:36.030
been combined together before.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.760
Obviously, for KIND bar, taste
and health in the same product

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.515
was, I think, the big,
unique value proposition

00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:44.499
you brought to the market.

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:45.290
I was just curious.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.600
When you look at the
Google product portfolio,

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.710
and when you look at the
technology industry as a whole,

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.160
do you see opportunities
in technology

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.110
where the "and" principle
could be applied?

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.800
And are there any
products, for example,

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.175
that Google makes that you
think represents the same sort

00:05:01.175 --> 00:05:03.324
of "and" principles that
KIND bar started with?

00:05:03.324 --> 00:05:04.990
DANIEL LUBETZKY: You
ask easy questions.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.890
Only softballs.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.860
Let me try to go back
for once again, just

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.330
to make sure that
everybody knows

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.130
what the "and" philosophy is.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.550
So at KIND, what we try to do is
to question false assumptions,

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.240
and to try to get at what
those false assumptions is.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.774
Because there's a lot of
opportunity to create value

00:05:23.774 --> 00:05:25.190
certainly in the
technology world,

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.670
even more than any, by
trying to see how have people

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.080
have been doing something.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.310
And do we really need
to accept it as dogma

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.480
that this is the way
it has to be done?

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.470
And very often, because
our brains are efficient,

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.360
they shortcut to the easiest
answer, or the fastest answer,

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.160
rather than the one that would
be best in the long-term.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.430
Sometimes in the long-term,
if you work harder upfront,

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.431
you can achieve goals that
may be seemingly at tension.

00:05:53.431 --> 00:05:54.930
And so the "and"
philosophy is about

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.560
trying to combine goals that are
seemingly impossible to achieve

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.540
at the same time.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.290
So for KIND, it's about
doing something that's

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.540
nutritionally rich and
delicious, where it's

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.790
both nutritious and
delicious; or something

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.970
that is economically sustainable
and socially impactful;

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.710
or a product that
actually travels

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.580
well that's convenient to travel
with, but that's wholesome.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.537
So those are goals
that normally people

00:06:22.537 --> 00:06:24.120
think are at tension
and incompatible,

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.860
and if you really work hard
enough, you can achieve.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.580
When you are able to
uncover it, you actually

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.680
unleash a lot of value.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.130
So in the technology
world, you look

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.560
at the way things
are and then say,

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.340
well is it really true
that it has to be this way?

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.510
You ask the questions
why and why not.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.290
And if you're able to find
the underlying assumptions,

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.017
you're already well
underway to trying

00:06:49.017 --> 00:06:50.600
to challenge those
assumptions and see

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.960
if they can be actually broken.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:59.166
And so in your world,
an example-- well, first

00:06:59.166 --> 00:07:01.790
of all, I think the way Google's
philosophy works-- and we were

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.290
talking about this a
second ago-- I think really

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.820
is in the long-term-- it's
very long-term oriented, right?

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.010
They don't try to
win 100% of the time

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.710
at all time in the short-term.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.560
They try to give the
consumer the best solution.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.344
And they know if they
do that, then people

00:07:16.344 --> 00:07:18.510
will continually going to
use their search products.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:22.005
So they combine between--
I guess in some ways saying

00:07:22.005 --> 00:07:25.520
and-- in the search platform.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.820
You can get links,
or you can actually

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.550
sometimes get the answers.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.220
And how do you decide
whether-- you could probably

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.070
sell more ads if you
generated more pages.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.420
But sometimes the consumer
wants a more immediate answer.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.930
And if you're able
to serve that up,

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.930
even if you're not going
to generate more pages,

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.110
or if you're going to compete
with yourselves or with others,

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:47.820
you're trying to find
that right medium.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.601
But the standard is always,
what is the best consumer

00:07:50.601 --> 00:07:51.100
experience?

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.510
What does that end user want?

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.440
And I think that should
always be the standard.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.610
I remember on YouTube--
I'm going to date myself,

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.460
because you guys were
probably not born--

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.140
but there once was a time
when on YouTube, you couldn't

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.070
click inside the videos.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.700
Did you realize that?

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.142
There was a time where
YouTube didn't exist.

00:08:12.142 --> 00:08:13.350
You guys probably don't know.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.026
But there was a need.

00:08:19.026 --> 00:08:20.850
There was this ability, why not?

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.510
Why not be able to view
the experience and interact

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:24.200
with it?

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.190
And somebody-- Chad
Hurley or someone,

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.720
who used to support us many
years ago on the social front

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.169
and other work I've done--
figured out at some point

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:37.720
that there's a way with "and" to
have the video experience also

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.460
be interactive.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.679
So certainly
technology's probably

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:43.890
one of the best grounds for
disruptiveness and for you

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.180
to think with "and."

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.870
The challenge is for
us as human beings,

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.110
because-- sorry I'm giving
you a very long answer.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.320
VISHAL JAIN: No, no.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:49.600
It's really interesting.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.016
DANIEL LUBETZKY:
I should give you

00:08:51.016 --> 00:08:52.260
profound and concise answers.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.620
But I'm not good at that stuff.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.990
But the challenge is not that
technology can't do stuff.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.030
The challenge is
that our brains have

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:04.130
been so trained to do things
every day the same way,

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:07.930
that for us to step
back is so important.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:11.150
And even with our technologies,
we get used to how things are.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.570
That's why fresh
eyes and fresh brains

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:16.870
can really, really be disruptive
and win, often when you are

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.230
able to see things differently.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.330
And in the book, I
talk a lot about how

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.670
to try to find a way to
keep that fresh perspective,

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:26.520
even when you're used to
doing something and some tools

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.372
we use at KIND to try
to think differently.

00:09:29.372 --> 00:09:30.330
VISHAL JAIN: Very cool.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.050
And I notice a lot
of similarities there

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.260
actually, between the
way Google and KIND look

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.469
at the consumer value
proposition and the attention--

00:09:36.469 --> 00:09:38.510
DANIEL LUBETZKY: Well,
thank you for saying that.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.670
Because obviously Google
does a really awesome job.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:41.628
VISHAL JAIN: Thank you.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.210
Maybe more of a
softball question.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.760
In the book, you
talked a little bit

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.090
about the origin of your
food industry experience

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.310
and the work that you
did with PeaceWorks

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.640
where you worked with Israeli
and Palestinian businesses

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.589
to build bridges between
those two cultural groups.

00:09:59.589 --> 00:10:01.130
One of the things
I was curious about

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:06.030
was what was sort of your
business model as a consultant

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:07.450
there?

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.640
You obviously had
a social cause.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.410
But you also needed
to make money.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.560
DANIEL LUBETZKY: The
PeaceWorks business model?

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.270
VISHAL JAIN: Yeah.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.061
DANIEL LUBETZKY: So
right after law school,

00:10:15.061 --> 00:10:18.930
my first company after law
school was and is still called,

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:19.890
PeaceWorks.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.470
And it tries to bring
neighbors in conflict regions

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.660
to work together.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.850
And I actually did try
first as a consultant.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.700
But here was this confused
Mexican Jewish lawyer

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.510
trying to consult to
Arabs and Israelis.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.220
Nobody wanted to have
anything to do with it.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.810
So I tried to build
a consulting business

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.650
to try to get Arabs and
Israelis to work together.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:42.800
And the Americans were
going to be the catalysts

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.160
to these joint ventures.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.170
But the consulting
thing went nowhere.

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.060
And I decided to end
up actually starting

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:52.670
such a venture--
PeaceWorks venture-- where

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:56.660
we brought trading partners
to trade with one another.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:01.380
And the way it started was
I was doing this research,

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.660
and I came across this jar of a
sun-dried tomato spread, which

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.714
back in the early
'90s, at least to me,

00:11:07.714 --> 00:11:09.380
I had never heard of
sun-dried tomatoes.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.050
Today, again, we take
that for granted.

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:14.290
But in '93, when I came across
this jar of sun-dried tomato

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:16.290
spread, I had never heard
of sun-dried tomatoes.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.280
I bought the jar.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.660
I downed the whole thing in one
evening in my late research.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.180
And I tried to buy some more.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.100
And there was no
more in the store.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:29.380
So long story short, I
almost choked to death

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.880
the manager at the
store for him to give me

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.555
the name of the
former manufacturer.

00:11:33.555 --> 00:11:34.380
No, I'm joking.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.780
It was not violent.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.710
But I did insist a lot
to get the information.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:43.600
And I got to the
ex-manufacturer of this product.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:49.840
And it turned out he was
buying his sun-dried tomatoes

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.120
from Italy and his glass
jars from Portugal.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.360
And it was very expensive.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.385
And I showed him that he could
buy his glass jars from Egypt

00:11:57.385 --> 00:11:59.430
and buy his sun-dried
tomatoes from Turkey.

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.170
And we started sourcing
olives and olive oil

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.040
from Palestinian and
Arab-Israeli farmers.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.700
And the model was that
this Israeli manufacturer--

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.820
this Israeli-Jewish
manufacturer--

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.100
would trade with Arab
citizens of Israel,

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.790
with Palestinians living
in the West Bank and Gaza,

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:18.820
with Turks, Egyptians,
and other Arab neighbors.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.570
And by them trading
with one another,

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:23.080
the concept of PeaceWorks
was that they would

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.080
shatter cultural stereotypes.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.980
They would discover
each other's humanity.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.230
And then they would cement
business relationships

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.500
because they would be
working with one another.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:36.145
So we launched in '93, '94,
this line called first Moshe

00:12:36.145 --> 00:12:37.300
and Ali's.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.250
The original name was very,
very succinct-- Moshe Pupik

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:44.210
and Ali Mishmumken's
World-Famous Gourmet Foods.

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:45.600
And nobody could pronounce it.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.550
And I learned about simplicity
through that lesson.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.672
And I talk about that
story there also.

00:12:52.672 --> 00:12:53.630
But that was the model.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:54.880
The model was a trading model.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.070
I would buy the products
from my trading partners

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:58.680
and sell them in
the United States.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.170
And then they would
work together.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.200
And the nice thing
about the social concept

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.189
was that the more that we
would sell these products,

00:13:05.189 --> 00:13:06.730
the more that we
could buy from them,

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.502
the more that we could foster
that trade among neighbors.

00:13:09.502 --> 00:13:10.460
VISHAL JAIN: Very cool.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:11.260
DANIEL LUBETZKY: And
you can see that it

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.760
was so successful that we
have peace in the Middle East.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.704
Everything's solved.

00:13:16.704 --> 00:13:18.620
VISHAL JAIN: Well, we
have sun-dried tomatoes.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.230
DANIEL LUBETZKY: You have--
and at a macro level,

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:23.090
we have not scaled
the way we would like.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.790
I'm actually now
going to reinvest

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:28.270
in doing PeaceWorks 2.0, because
I really have neglected it

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.150
the last 20-plus years.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.970
But at the personal level,
many of the relationships

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:36.800
that started 21 years ago
are still there today.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.050
And throughout the
vicissitudes of the conflict,

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:42.470
Yoel Benesh continuing trading
with Abdullah Ghanim's family.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.530
Abdullah passed on, passed away.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:46.420
But his son still
trades with them.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.690
So those relationships
at the personal level

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.210
did get cemented.

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.200
VISHAL JAIN: Very cool.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.245
And you mentioned sun-dried
tomatoes, which is obviously

00:13:56.245 --> 00:13:57.120
in the food industry.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.680
Is that then how you
organically kind of moved

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.950
into nuts and fruits,
and eventually

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.570
what became the
constituents of KIND bar?

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:07.342
And how did you
decide that snack bars

00:14:07.342 --> 00:14:08.550
is where you wanted to start?

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:08.880
DANIEL LUBETZKY: Yeah.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.588
If you had told me
right after law school

00:14:10.588 --> 00:14:13.140
that I was going to be in
the food space, I would say,

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:13.790
you're cuckoo.

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:18.420
I mean, it never was part
of my dream growing up.

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:19.820
I was a magician.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.330
And I sold watches.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.110
And I did a lot of crazy jobs.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:29.680
But at the beginning,
food was a conduit

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.430
towards pursuing my mission of
bringing neighbors together.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:34.890
And then I fell in love with it.

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.255
And I really started liking it.

00:14:36.255 --> 00:14:36.880
It took awhile.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.537
But at the beginning
I was suffering a lot,

00:14:39.537 --> 00:14:41.120
because I was making
so many mistakes.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:45.080
And fortunately I didn't
realize how bad I had it.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.690
But the first 11
years when I was

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:49.780
like going up and down the
streets of Manhattan, selling

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.652
store by store
with my briefcase,

00:14:51.652 --> 00:14:54.730
with my leather briefcase--
or fake leather briefcase,

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:57.780
not even leather briefcase,
my fake leather briefcase--

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.610
and take out the
legal books and put

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:03.670
jars of sun-dried tomato
spread and bread for people

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:04.630
to sample the product.

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:07.970
And I would go starting at
7:00 AM in the morning on 122nd

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.870
Street on Broadway, and walk
the west side of Broadway

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.760
all the way down to Wall Street.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:13.990
And then I would cross.

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:16.130
And then I would
walk all the way up.

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.160
And after a couple
days of taking orders,

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.660
the next day I would
take my beat-up Cougar,

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.040
and I would put the
product in the trunk.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.560
And I would seal
it with duct tape

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.610
because the trunk was broken.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:29.430
And I would deliver the product.

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:32.276
And I forgot why I'm telling
you this whole story.

00:15:32.276 --> 00:15:33.400
What were we talking about?

00:15:35.459 --> 00:15:36.750
Oh yeah, I have the transition.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:40.700
So then after 11
years of mistakes,

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.730
I learned about the food space.

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:47.260
And I was traveling to do
ventures all over in the Middle

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:51.330
East, and in Sri Lanka, and
Indonesia, and in Mexico,

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:54.320
not focusing, trying to do
a lot of things at once.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.290
And as I was traveling, or I
was skipping lunch, or skipping

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:00.760
dinner, or traveling
in the US to sell,

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.060
I felt very frustrated with
my own snacking options.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.920
And I always sensed
that there were

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.190
opportunities to do
healthful snacking better.

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:10.700
And it wasn't satisfying me.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.940
I wasn't finding something that
I could feel good about eating.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.900
And so I kept being
on the search.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:19.740
And once we came up
with KIND, I knew

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:21.240
that there was going
to be something

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.100
that would satisfy
others too, because I

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.440
felt that there was that need.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.910
And today, by the way, 11 years
later, it's just the beginning.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:32.210
I mean the revolution of
eating more mindfully, more

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:37.510
healthfully, and snacking,
and healthful snacking,

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:40.160
and responsible snacking,
is just at the beginning.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.580
Even though it's
very disruptive,

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:42.930
we're just entering it.

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:45.921
I think it's going
to be far, far

00:16:45.921 --> 00:16:47.420
more disruptive in
the coming years,

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:49.500
because those trends
are so powerful.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.469
All of us are busy, and
so we are on the go.

00:16:52.469 --> 00:16:54.760
But we want to eat something
wholesome, and nutritious,

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.360
and real.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:03.030
And at the same time-- so
the need for convenience

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.280
and the need for
healthfulness is really

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.010
providing a lot of opportunities
for a lot of people.

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:08.770
VISHAL JAIN: That's
really fascinating.

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:10.820
So it actually had a lot to do
with your own personal travels

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.609
and the fact that
you're always on the go.

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:15.190
So that format is something
you had a need for.

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.400
DANIEL LUBETZKY: Still
today, I have four children.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.225
When I get home at 6:00
PM, I have a very nice meal

00:17:20.225 --> 00:17:20.849
waiting for me.

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:24.910
But for lunch, and Julianne
and Rebecca can attest to it.

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:28.540
Every day for lunch I tend
to have one or two KIND bars.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.254
That's my lunch.

00:17:30.254 --> 00:17:31.920
They also don't let
me do anything else.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.800
I try sometimes to escape.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.340
They're like, no!

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:34.506
You shall eat the KIND bars.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:40.480
VISHAL JAIN: I want to
shift a little bit away

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.610
from the business
and into the book.

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.970
We all have the story to
tell, but not everyone

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:48.350
takes the time to
sit down and actually

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:49.800
write it through thoroughly.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.470
And you've obviously put
a lot of thought and time

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:54.260
into producing this.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.750
So I guess why the transition
from the food industry

00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:00.150
into the publishing
industry, so to speak?

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:01.880
DANIEL LUBETZKY: Well,
it's not-- I mean,

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.390
this is more a way to help
us deepen into the work

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:06.490
that we're doing.

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:08.340
But I think two primary reasons.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:13.870
One is a lot of people
gave a lot to me in my 11

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:14.950
years of the wilderness.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:16.820
Even still today, I
have a lot of mentors.

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.840
And Ben Cohen, the
guy that started

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.620
Ben and Jerry's, and
many other people were

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:25.670
on my advisory board, and just
taught me a lot of what I know.

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.030
And now when young
entrepreneurs come to me

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:30.660
and ask me questions, I
don't have enough time

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.050
to go as deep as I would like.

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:36.107
And I felt that the book
really is a very raw exposition

00:18:36.107 --> 00:18:38.690
of a lot of the failures-- which
I think from the failures you

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:41.890
derive more lessons--
as well as the insights

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:44.410
and some of the successes.

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:46.250
So it was a way for
people that want

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:49.546
to learn from my
mistakes-- whether it's

00:18:49.546 --> 00:18:51.920
social entrepreneurs or people
in the food space, or just

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.045
people that when I learned
how to think with "and,"

00:18:54.045 --> 00:18:55.870
or think creatively,
or just draw

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:58.650
from any of those experiences.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:02.780
And the second is that for
our aspiration and our dream

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:07.920
for what we want KIND to become,
we don't want to be a company.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.220
We want to become a movement.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.270
We don't want to just
be a business that

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:14.910
has a social responsibility.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:19.510
We want to transcend the way
people think of businesses

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:22.880
or products to something that
they connect with viscerally,

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.690
that belongs to them, that
becomes a state of mind.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:27.760
And it probably
sounds like you think

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.894
that I had something
very weird for breakfast,

00:19:29.894 --> 00:19:32.060
but in the coming years
you'll see some of the ideas

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.250
that we have, and how we're
going to implement that.

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.889
And the first step in
trying to build that

00:19:36.889 --> 00:19:38.430
was to show people
our vision of what

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:41.001
we're trying to create
so that hopefully they'll

00:19:41.001 --> 00:19:43.000
be more excited about
joining us on that journey

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:43.916
and learning about it.

00:19:43.916 --> 00:19:47.720
So telling people
about-- our products

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.840
are sold, we understand why you
guys buy our products, or why

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.354
that you get them here
at, what do you call them?

00:19:53.354 --> 00:19:54.520
VISHAL JAIN: Micro kitchens.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.853
DANIEL LUBETZKY: Micro kitchens.

00:19:55.853 --> 00:19:57.940
Because they're
delicious, and they're

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:01.680
made with nutritionally
rich ingredients.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.220
And so we never forget that.

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.420
And also because in my
early years at PeaceWorks,

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.545
I was so obsessive
about the mission

00:20:07.545 --> 00:20:09.670
of bringing Arabs and
Israelis together that that's

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:10.900
all I would talk about.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.470
I made the mistake of not
focusing on the product.

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.200
And at KIND, I
promised myself that I

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.050
would focus on the product.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.150
So for the last
10, 11 years we've

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:21.475
talked very little about
our social mission.

00:20:21.475 --> 00:20:23.600
And through the book, it's
giving me an opportunity

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.974
to talk a little
bit more broadly

00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:27.284
about where we're
coming from, what's

00:20:27.284 --> 00:20:28.700
important to us,
what we're aiming

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:35.540
to do in society, as a first
step in the remaining journey

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:36.173
that we have.

00:20:36.173 --> 00:20:36.556
VISHAL JAIN: OK.

00:20:36.556 --> 00:20:37.055
Cool.

00:20:37.055 --> 00:20:39.470
And just so you guys
know in the audience,

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:41.770
we'll be getting audience
questions in a little bit.

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:43.353
Just want to step
up to the microphone

00:20:43.353 --> 00:20:47.060
and start thinking about what
questions you might have.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.356
And one of the other things
you spoke about in the book

00:20:49.356 --> 00:20:50.980
that I was curious
to learn more about,

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.950
and was hoping you could
tell us more about,

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:56.010
is the Universal
Values Curriculum.

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:58.264
Can you just tell us a little
bit about what that is?

00:20:58.264 --> 00:20:59.180
DANIEL LUBETZKY: Yeah.

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:03.420
So that's unrelated to-- not
so directly related to KIND,

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.950
but it's something else
that I care a lot about.

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:11.700
I think that-- let me
take one step back,

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.200
because I've been talking about
this a lot in the last week.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.074
But maybe you guys have
never heard about it.

00:21:16.074 --> 00:21:19.350
But a lot of what drives me is
that my father was a Holocaust

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:20.480
survivor.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.360
And he was in a
concentration camp in Dachau.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.620
So the common thread
in all I do is

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:29.160
trying to build bridges
not to be nice to society,

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.000
but as a survival instinct.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.085
I want my children to
not have happen to them

00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:35.210
what happened to my father.

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.590
I want other human
beings not to have

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:39.570
happen to them what
happened to my father.

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:43.520
So one of the
things that I think

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.430
a lot about as we
see what's going on

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:50.950
in the Middle East with ISIS,
the Islamic State, and so many

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:53.474
divisions within societies
and between societies,

00:21:53.474 --> 00:21:55.890
and what's happening in Israel
and the Israeli-Palestinian

00:21:55.890 --> 00:22:00.300
conflict, and more broadly--
and also when you think more

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:04.700
broadly about climate change,
about resource scarcity, 2

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:08.710
billion people are elevating
their standard of living.

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:10.400
And what that means
is that more people

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.430
are going to demand more premium
products that require more

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:15.700
from our Earth.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.090
And water scarcity
in California,

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:21.940
water scarcity
globally, scarcity

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:26.090
of natural resources and
food, nuclear proliferation--

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:28.591
these things are
major challenges

00:22:28.591 --> 00:22:30.090
that we're going
to face in society.

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:33.680
And the only chance we have
as a human race to survive

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.880
is to recognize
our shared humanity

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.070
and to work together as one.

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:44.400
And divisions that are in some
ways actually deepening over

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.835
the last few years between
the West and the East,

00:22:48.835 --> 00:22:53.150
and in the Middle East, I
think need to be challenged.

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.570
And the way you challenge
those is not just

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:57.010
through military means.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:00.170
I personally-- my
father survived

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:02.660
because American
soldiers rescued him.

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:10.580
So I'm very grateful for the
military's sacrifice for people

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.660
that they had never
met, like my father.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.700
And so I do think
there's a role to play

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:20.480
in using force very cautiously
to fight totalitarianism.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.140
But it's never
going to be enough.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.470
And the way to really,
really win ultimately

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:26.160
is to have an
alternative ideology.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:30.130
And one of my thoughts was--
this is a very long way

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:31.800
to answer your
question, but it's

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:35.206
a deep conversation--
is if you look today

00:23:35.206 --> 00:23:37.330
at the community of nations,
at the United Nations,

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:40.580
there's 200 members
of the United Nations.

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.860
And they've created laws
on the law of the sea

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.860
and on all these other compacts.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:49.060
But on this core issue of
shared values and education,

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:52.970
we've done nothing, in the
sense that today there's

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:58.640
nothing that a kid in Israel,
or in Palestine, or in Iran,

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.880
or in the United States
necessarily share.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.690
They don't necessarily get
taught what brings us together

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:05.750
as a human race.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:10.160
Why not create the common core
curriculum where we encourage,

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.300
and ultimately if
we succeed, mandate,

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.090
that all third graders,
or all first graders,

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:17.720
are going to share in this
common core curriculum

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.030
to discover each other's
humanity to learn.

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:24.070
Now we can use technology
to connect them.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.380
Google can be a partner.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:26.530
Skype can be a partner.

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.040
Others can be partners.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:34.010
To try to build more
threads between kids

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:37.620
all across the world, starting
with educational materials

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:40.620
where they ask themselves,
what makes me a human being?

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:42.500
What do I have in
common with other kids?

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.430
And for them to ask
those questions,

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:46.790
for them to be the ones
who discover the answers,

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:49.340
and then connecting
kids through technology

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.800
so that kids across
the world all

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.190
are part of sharing
the same set of values

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:56.730
of learning what brings us
together as human beings.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.930
So the idea of this
Universal Values Curriculum

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:00.989
is something that
I'm starting slowly.

00:25:00.989 --> 00:25:02.530
I've been working
on it for 10 years.

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:04.290
But hopefully this
year we're going

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:07.720
to start funding it and working
with educators to create

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.430
this common
curriculum that we'll

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:14.220
offer for free for schools
that commit to teach it.

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:17.040
And we'll even provide
them incentives or tools,

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.570
educational materials.

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:21.150
There's already a potential
partner in Pakistan

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:24.380
that has a half a million
students that they fund.

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:27.540
And there's different programs
all over the world that we hope

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.700
will join this
and be part of it.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:33.450
And the dream is that X number
of years from now, the United

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:36.230
Nations-- all members of
the community of nations--

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:38.710
will mandate that all
kids across the world

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:40.790
will learn about
their shared humanity

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:44.600
and become part of something
bigger than ourselves.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.290
Simple idea.

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:48.410
VISHAL JAIN: It is actually
a simple idea really,

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:49.030
at its root.

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:50.970
But it's just probably
too complicated

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:52.950
to actually bring it to life.

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:58.890
I guess wrapping up
with my questions,

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:01.890
you spoke a little bit about
what's next for KIND bar

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:04.980
and how the book plays
into the long-term mission.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:09.040
But just whatever you can
share with us about what some

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:13.260
of those big next milestones,
either for the book,

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:14.392
or for the company are.

00:26:14.392 --> 00:26:16.350
DANIEL LUBETZKY: By the
way, it's not KIND bar.

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:17.730
It's KIND.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:20.530
And we have a couple
team members that

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:22.320
work for the clusters team.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.500
And they might otherwise
really come after you

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.150
if I don't clarify that.

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:29.450
Some of you got the parfait
with the KIND healthy grain

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:30.570
clusters.

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:33.430
But we never wanted
to be a bar company.

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:37.186
We happen to know that bars are
a very efficient way for people

00:26:37.186 --> 00:26:39.560
to travel, and so we're very
proud of being part of that.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.540
But that's not what defines us.

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.660
What defines us is the common
thread among all KIND products

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.530
is ingredients you
can see and pronounce.

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:48.050
That's our trademark.

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:52.210
So whether it's in bar format
like the original fruit nut

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:53.812
bars, or I don't
know if you've seen,

00:26:53.812 --> 00:26:55.520
or you have carry in
your micro kitchens,

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.720
the STRONG &amp; KIND bars
that have savory flavors.

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.100
So if you're feeling
like something savory,

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.634
instead of a bag
of potato chips,

00:27:02.634 --> 00:27:04.300
you can get something
more nutritionally

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.150
rich that has 10 grams
of protein, all natural.

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:08.930
So that's the
STRONG &amp; KIND bars.

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:10.160
I'm giving you my ad.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.850
Or whether it's a
KIND Healthy Grain

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:15.130
bars, which are kind of like
a better type of granola

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:19.740
that has five super grains like
amaranth, and quinoa, and chia,

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.290
and gluten free oat, et
cetera, and buckwheat;

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:25.980
or the KIND Healthy Grain
Clusters, which are-- So

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.660
in our vision,
what's next for us,

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:32.070
is if you look at all those four
areas where we've innovated,

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:34.560
we tried, we would like to
believe, that we brought

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.460
something totally new that
didn't exist in the marketplace

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:42.490
before, that was fresh,
and that people wanted,

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:44.690
even though they didn't
know it until we created it.

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:46.380
So that's our standard.

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.670
We want to innovate
in new categories.

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:50.839
But we only want to do
it when we really are not

00:27:50.839 --> 00:27:53.130
going to do a meet two item,
or just try to copy and do

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:54.338
something like somebody else.

00:27:54.338 --> 00:27:57.560
We want to do it where we
really can disrupt the space

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:02.770
and really elevate the standards
for that particular category.

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:07.310
This fall we're launching
another new product

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:09.440
line, again, into a new space.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.910
And every year or
two, our ambition

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:14.600
is to be able to enter a
new category with products

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:19.070
that are elevating the
standards of healthful eating.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:26.120
But we have sometimes gotten
it wrong, and not launched.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:30.527
So we also have the discipline
to say if we don't-- it's very

00:28:30.527 --> 00:28:31.610
different from technology.

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:35.250
In technology, you can go and
try something, and fail fast,

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:36.040
and start again.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.415
And you're giving
out the product

00:28:37.415 --> 00:28:39.300
for free in some
sense, so you can

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.410
allow people to say I didn't
like it, beta test, whatever.

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:46.390
But in food, what I found
in consumer goods is

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:48.124
when you try our
product, it's a promise

00:28:48.124 --> 00:28:49.540
that we gave you
that you're going

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:50.920
to have a great experience.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.420
And if we disappoint
you, you're not

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:54.295
going to not just not
try that product again,

00:28:54.295 --> 00:28:56.160
but you might abandon our brand.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.780
So we are very, very obsessive
the way we launch products.

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:01.690
It has to be exceeding
people's expectations.

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:05.370
And when we do all the work,
when all is said and done,

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:07.755
we don't think that it's
going to raise the bar

00:29:07.755 --> 00:29:09.390
and exceed your expectations.

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:11.440
We just have the discipline
to not launch it.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.380
So we hopefully will
continue innovating,

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:18.080
but with the humility to know
that if you get it wrong,

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.930
you should just not do it.

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:22.520
VISHAL JAIN: That's a pretty
hard discipline to stick to.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.894
DANIEL LUBETZKY: Especially
when you've invested yourself

00:29:24.894 --> 00:29:26.040
so hard into something.

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.280
And you're like, ah, all right.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.172
Let's walk away.

00:29:30.172 --> 00:29:32.630
VISHAL JAIN: With that, do any
of the folks in the audience

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:33.250
have--

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:34.850
DANIEL LUBETZKY: Elijah, please.

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:36.570
It's the Passover
allusion to the person

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:39.430
that's not by the microphone.

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:40.875
Sorry.

00:29:40.875 --> 00:29:42.490
I can't much Jon Stewart.

00:29:45.059 --> 00:29:45.600
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.590
I'm a huge KIND fan.

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:48.472
Thanks so much for coming today.

00:29:48.472 --> 00:29:49.930
DANIEL LUBETZKY:
Thank you so much.

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:52.820
AUDIENCE: My question is about
this ambitious growth strategy

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:55.140
that you've just
described to us.

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:56.490
How do you plan to finance it?

00:29:56.490 --> 00:30:00.870
And do you grow concerned
that at a certain point

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:04.110
there's a tension between
involving other investors who

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:09.720
may have a different position
on how best to grow the company,

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:14.480
and your personal vision for
how the company should grow.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:19.940
DANIEL LUBETZKY: So I'm very
lucky because I screwed up

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:23.500
so bad for the first
11, 12, 13, 14, 15 years

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.700
that nobody wanted to
invest in my company.

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.560
So I ended up owning most
of it till the company was

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.530
healthy enough that I didn't
dilute myself so much.

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:37.350
But we brought in
investors in 2008.

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:40.010
And then they were
great partners.

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:41.370
They taught me a ton.

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:44.430
And we had a
commitment that they

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:48.210
would be with us for up to five
years, four and a half years.

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:53.160
So I think it was 2012, '13,
where we bought them back.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.170
And it was a very
difficult thing to do,

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:56.940
because the company
had performed well.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.296
So they made a lot of money.

00:30:59.296 --> 00:31:00.170
But they deserved it.

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:02.390
They added a lot of value.

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:05.910
And we financed
that in two ways.

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:08.120
One is we took debt
for the first time,

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.070
because I'm very averse to debt.

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:11.300
But we took some debt on.

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.230
And we also brought
in a new investor

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:14.980
that could help take
us to the next level,

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:17.240
the [? grad ?] be smart money.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:23.189
And we were very upfront with
them about what our values are,

00:31:23.189 --> 00:31:25.730
and the fact that we are doing
this for more than just money,

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:29.054
and that our social
mission is not negotiable.

00:31:29.054 --> 00:31:31.220
And they understood that
the social mission actually

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.800
feeds loyalty and that
it has a positive impact

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.530
on the business, also.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:37.310
And also it happens
to be good that I'm

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:38.351
the majority shareholder.

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:44.030
They do have protections
as investors,

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:48.670
but ultimately I listen to them.

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:50.860
I don't think I've ever
reached a decision that

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:55.697
wasn't unanimous, like our board
really has saved me from myself

00:31:55.697 --> 00:31:57.530
sometimes, because it's
very important to be

00:31:57.530 --> 00:31:59.980
creative and come up with
all these crazy ideas,

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.860
but you also need
to have filters.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.750
And they talk a lot
in the book about how

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:07.500
to divide the creative process
from the filtering process.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.050
And they have to
be very separate,

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:11.140
and how to really,
really come up

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.450
with completely
differentiated ideas,

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:14.850
and then how to test them.

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:17.330
And I think it's very important
to separate those stages.

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:21.390
But currently we're
cash flow positive.

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:23.860
So we don't need more money.

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:27.440
So the question is, what
am I going to do with it?

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:31.210
And we explored going public.

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:33.450
And for now, as of
right now, we don't

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:35.390
think that that's the
right answer for us.

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:39.500
We're having a lot of fun
and building a community

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.470
and a movement internally also.

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:43.530
Like we have-- every
team member that

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:45.690
works at KIND who's
a full-time member

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:48.480
is a fellow shareholder
in the company.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:54.060
And so for now at least, we're
going to continue doing it

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:54.650
ourselves.

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:56.388
But who knows what
happens tomorrow?

00:33:01.449 --> 00:33:01.990
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:03.450
Thanks for coming.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:05.160
So I really loved
what you were saying

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.710
about brand authenticity.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:10.780
And we work with a lot of brands
that have clear brand equity

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.220
but have fallen out of
public favor-- cereal brands,

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.380
for instance.

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:17.420
So I'm just curious what your
advice would be to those brands

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.774
in really tapping into
what makes them authentic.

00:33:20.774 --> 00:33:21.690
DANIEL LUBETZKY: Yeah.

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:22.856
That's a very good question.

00:33:22.856 --> 00:33:25.300
I actually think about
that question a lot

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:29.290
because it's so easy for me
to say, be true to your brand.

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:31.630
But what if your brand
falls in disfavor?

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.680
First of all,
everything is relative.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:37.180
Right?

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:41.280
The cereal space is
still a $29 billion

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.030
space or $22 billion space.

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:43.630
It's very big.

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:45.490
It's bigger than the
nutritional bar space.

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:47.540
Now nutritional
bars are growing,

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:49.960
and cereals are
slowly contracting.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.170
So yes, it's not a growing area.

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:54.020
But it's a gigantic area.

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:56.150
A lot of people
still have cereal.

00:33:56.150 --> 00:34:00.900
So these guys have
very smart people too.

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:03.249
And I think I've seen
some of the moves

00:34:03.249 --> 00:34:04.790
that Kellogg's and
General Mills have

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:09.760
taken to try to take their
cereal equity into convenience

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.590
and make their products more
convenient to carry and travel

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:13.420
on the go.

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.770
I think that's good.

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:16.940
I think that's smart.

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:21.090
And I think they're going to
see some payoff from that.

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:23.790
What would not work is-- I
think what you need to do first

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:26.767
and foremost is to understand
your brand well, and understand

00:34:26.767 --> 00:34:28.350
what is a consumer
expecting from you,

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:31.825
and does your brand have
license to go somewhere else?

00:34:31.825 --> 00:34:34.659
So an indulgent
brand that is selling

00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:38.889
sugary beverages,
or cereal, or stuff

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:42.179
like that, that brand
should probably not

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:45.170
try to reposition itself
as a healthy brand,

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:47.679
because the consumer is
not going to trust it.

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:50.739
A brand that does that and
tries to proclaim itself

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:52.219
to be something
else, you probably

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:54.389
will actually hurt
the parent brand

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:55.792
because it will
seem unauthentic.

00:34:55.792 --> 00:34:57.250
So I think the most
important thing

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:59.550
is to be authentic,
to understand

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:02.740
what is it that you are, and
what does your core consumer

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:03.240
care about.

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.360
And then do that
for your consumer.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:09.550
And then if you're
a gigantic company

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:12.030
and you feel that you need
to go in a another category,

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:16.300
sometimes it's better to just
acquire or start a new brand

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.940
than to have a brand
that has negative equity

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:20.960
in the particular place
where you want to go.

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:24.600
But I don't believe that you
need to go to all places.

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:28.830
I've seen a lot of friends at
other companies say, oh wow.

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:30.560
Right now the hot
thing is organic.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.436
And oh wow, right
now it's gluten free.

00:35:32.436 --> 00:35:34.310
And then they come up
with gluten free salsa.

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:35.070
Well yeah.

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:40.080
Salsa is gluten free because
it doesn't have gluten.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:44.655
But consumers are very
sophisticated in the end

00:35:44.655 --> 00:35:45.190
of the day.

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:47.700
You can actually fool
them once or twice,

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:49.650
but in the longer
term, in the mid-term,

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:51.089
they're going to figure it out.

00:35:51.089 --> 00:35:52.630
So I think you need
to really, really

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:55.600
be authentic and understand
what your brand stands for,

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.870
and have a conversation
with your own consumers

00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:59.760
and with yourself,
and then figure out

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.510
how to deliver to
them what that is.

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:04.770
Again, in the
cereal space, there

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:08.285
are so many opportunities
within that brand equity,

00:36:08.285 --> 00:36:11.890
I just would try to stay there.

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:14.810
Fortunately, I don't have to
answer that question for real.

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:18.490
[? Because ?] there are $60
billion dollar companies,

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:20.870
$100 billion companies that
have a lot of these legacy

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:21.990
challenges.

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.892
And it's not easy.

00:36:22.892 --> 00:36:24.850
And a lot of the people
leading these companies

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:27.410
are formidable
good human beings,

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:30.370
they're just inheriting
these challenges.

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:33.195
And it's not easy.

00:36:33.195 --> 00:36:35.320
AUDIENCE: So we have a
couple of young vegetarians,

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.430
so KIND has been a great way
to get at least a little bit

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:38.305
of protein into them.

00:36:38.305 --> 00:36:39.680
So thank you for that.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:43.300
I'm a big fan of the salted
chocolate caramel, personally.

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:45.350
But you actually
anticipated my question,

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:48.440
which is as a consumer,
the only reason I

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:51.960
hesitate to buy sometimes is you
don't have an organic option.

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.390
So what has been your take on
the whole organic movement?

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:56.250
And is that something that
might be in the works?

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:57.083
DANIEL LUBETZKY: No.

00:36:57.083 --> 00:37:00.280
I mean, we think about these
questions all the time.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:05.270
For us, we needed to choose what
we're going to be as a brand.

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:08.630
And what we chose is to provide
people nutritionally rich,

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:10.110
premium ingredients.

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:14.530
And in our particular
categories where we play,

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:16.920
we felt that was what was
most important and most

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.600
differentiated for us to add.

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:23.412
And you know, I respect a
lot of other fair trade,

00:37:23.412 --> 00:37:25.120
organic, other things
that are important.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:29.390
We try to behave
environmentally responsibly.

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:31.830
We're doing a whole 360
evaluation ourselves

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:33.830
about how to do things
in an environmentally

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:35.060
responsible way.

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:38.650
We try to source everything with
KIND in a responsible manner,

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:39.910
in a fair manner.

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:41.640
But to certify
ourselves organic,

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.160
to certify ourselves fair
trade, to certify everything,

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.326
the product would be outside
of the reach of people.

00:37:46.326 --> 00:37:48.140
We already are the
most expensive product

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:52.790
because we give you a lot more
whole almonds and whole nuts

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:55.770
and treat the product
with a lot of respect.

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:57.230
And so we needed
to choose what was

00:37:57.230 --> 00:38:00.590
the most important thing for
us to provide to the consumer.

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:03.460
There's also an issue
of sustainability

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:04.820
that concerns me a lot.

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:08.510
Like right now,
there's not enough

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:12.120
honey in the world-- there's
not enough organic honey.

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:16.660
There's not enough organic
almonds to supply what we buy.

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:20.360
And it's shocking how
dangerous the situation is.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.530
I was alluding to
scarcity of food.

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:24.240
It's a very serious problem.

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:26.610
There's huge drought
problems in California.

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:31.435
There's bee collapse
challenges that are finally

00:38:31.435 --> 00:38:32.310
starting to come out.

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:35.280
But still, the amount
of production of almonds

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:39.160
and of honey in the last several
years has been so challenged.

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:42.260
And in the meantime,
consumption is skyrocketing.

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:43.930
So that's why these
things are becoming

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:45.550
more and more expensive.

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:48.540
And as we're going to need to
feed 2 billion more people,

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:50.400
there's a lot of questions
that as a society

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.890
we need to ask
ourselves about how

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:54.450
we're going to be feeding all
of those 2 billion people.

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:56.390
Right now what our
team is obsessing about

00:38:56.390 --> 00:39:02.250
is being able to even
source quality products

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:03.530
on a sustainable basis.

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:08.280
So there's a lot of questions
that we're challenged with,

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.490
try to balance.

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:12.580
As a brand, we want to
just continue always

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:17.940
being nutrition-rich ingredients
that you can see and pronounce.

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:18.773
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:24.050
AUDIENCE: My kids love
the KIND clusters.

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:26.740
So thank you for making things
that my kids will actually eat.

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:28.198
DANIEL LUBETZKY:
Thank you so much.

00:39:28.198 --> 00:39:31.500
And I didn't pay any of
them to say these things.

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:35.110
AUDIENCE: You talked a
little bit about mistakes

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:38.444
that you made when you
were a fledgling startup.

00:39:38.444 --> 00:39:40.110
Can you talk a little
bit about anything

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:42.730
that really sticks
to your mind, lessons

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:44.550
that you learned as
you were growing?

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:48.280
And especially in the arena of
shifting categories from bars

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:51.570
to clusters, for instance.

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:54.640
DANIEL LUBETZKY: I actually
talk-- first of all, my biggest

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.589
mistakes where I drew
the most-- and that's

00:39:56.589 --> 00:39:58.130
why I really share
them in the book--

00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:00.640
was in the first 11 years,
when I didn't know anything,

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.830
and I just kept making
mistake after mistake.

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:06.550
And from those lessons, I
think a lot of KIND success

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:08.434
was because we
were more focused.

00:40:08.434 --> 00:40:09.850
Whereas in the
first 10, 11 years,

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:12.015
we were very undisciplined
in every way,

00:40:12.015 --> 00:40:14.390
trying to develop too many
products as opposed to staying

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:16.980
focused the way we
do it now-- trying

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:18.730
to go into too many
stores, any store that

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:21.400
would have us as opposed to
having a migration strategy

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.425
and being focused
on how we expand.

00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:30.690
To your question about going
from bars to clusters--

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:33.630
and I talk about this in a
lot more depth in the book--

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:36.430
but I'll tell you
two quick thoughts.

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:38.750
One is, there was
a reason why we

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:40.830
chose to go with
the clusters first

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:42.450
rather than into
another set of bars.

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:44.430
That we wanted to
communicate to the consumer

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:48.380
that we were not a bar company
but a healthy snacking company,

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:51.240
and a healthy eating company,
whose common thread was not

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:55.146
the bar format, but the use of
nutritionally rich ingredients

00:40:55.146 --> 00:40:56.520
that you could
see and pronounce.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.574
So we were thinking about
doing another granola bar.

00:40:59.574 --> 00:41:01.115
And we thought, then
people are going

00:41:01.115 --> 00:41:02.614
to think we're the
KIND bar company.

00:41:02.614 --> 00:41:05.312
Even right now, they still--
not to put you on the spot.

00:41:05.312 --> 00:41:07.270
VISHAL JAIN: My apologies
to the clusters team.

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:08.270
DANIEL LUBETZKY:
But a lot of people

00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:09.728
still think of us
as a bar company.

00:41:09.728 --> 00:41:13.930
And we early on decided
to do the clusters.

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.300
It's a much smaller category.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.470
The bag granola category, I
think it's like $400 million

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:24.550
compared to the granola
bar category, which

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:25.530
is like $4 billion.

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:28.540
So granola bars are
a much bigger space.

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:30.440
Logically, we should
have gone there.

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:34.440
But we consciously decided
to first go to clusters

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:37.510
because we wanted to convey
to the consumer this point.

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:40.100
And when you're
building products,

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:45.130
oftentimes the second line
you introduce is as or more

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:47.220
important than the
first, because you're

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.270
connecting the dots.

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:52.536
Actually, Eric Berman, who
I think actually works here

00:41:52.536 --> 00:41:55.770
at Google, first
taught me that point.

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:01.035
OK, this is what the KIND
Fruit + Nut Bars are.

00:42:01.035 --> 00:42:02.259
But what is a common thread?

00:42:02.259 --> 00:42:03.550
It could be that we use fruits.

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:05.140
It could be that we use nuts.

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:07.880
It could be that we use
nutritionally rich ingredients.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.420
It could be the bar
format, so on and so forth.

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:14.230
By launching the
clusters, we connected,

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:16.610
and we said, the common
thread is ingredients

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:17.660
you can see an pronounce.

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:20.530
It's nutritionally
rich ingredients.

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:23.270
It's not necessarily
the bar format.

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:26.400
We made a mistake when
we started with clusters

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:30.160
several years ago in not
sufficiently understanding

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.430
how sensitive those grains
that we were sourcing were.

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:40.360
And the use of grains
that we use-- amaranth,

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:43.290
is very, very
susceptible to go rancid.

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:45.760
And so you need to treat
it with a lot of respect.

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:47.900
You really, really,
really need to protect it.

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:50.800
And early on when we launched
the clusters, like a month

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.610
into it, we started getting
complaints from consumers

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:55.650
that they felt the
product was rancid.

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:58.150
And we were freaking out,
because of the promise

00:42:58.150 --> 00:43:00.300
that I told you that
I promised myself

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:01.980
I would make to our consumers.

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:07.350
And we got on average for
a KIND bar product line--

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:09.080
I'm doing it from
memory, so I may get it

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.320
a little off-- but it's
something like less

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.980
than one complaint per million.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.130
It's I think 0.01
complaint per million.

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:16.960
We almost don't get complaints.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:20.220
All of a sudden we got
200 complaints per million

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:21.100
on the clusters.

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.780
And for us that was a very,
very large and alarming thing.

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:26.060
Maybe in another company
it would be acceptable.

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:28.510
For us, we were really
obsessing about quality.

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:31.210
We didn't want to
disappoint consumers.

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:34.194
Because every one person that
complains, at least that person

00:43:34.194 --> 00:43:36.610
you can talk to them, and you
can fix the issue with them,

00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:39.060
and you can even build a
relationship with that person.

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:40.560
But for every person
that complains,

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.980
there's another
1,000 or 10,000 that

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:44.640
just stop buying your product.

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:47.550
Those are the people
that I worry about.

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:50.810
So we very quickly, we had
a couple people camp out,

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:52.300
I remember.

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:56.170
Several of our team members
went there for weeks on end

00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:57.410
to try to fix the issue.

00:43:57.410 --> 00:44:00.785
And I was really appreciative
of their major sacrifice

00:44:00.785 --> 00:44:02.820
on behalf of the
company to fix it.

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:07.190
And within two, three months,
we improved our practices

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:09.750
for sourcing these grains.

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:11.710
Within a few months,
the number of complaints

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:14.060
was back down to like
0.01 per million,

00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:15.730
or whatever is in the book.

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:22.250
But it was a humbling lesson in,
when you're entering adjacency,

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:27.839
be careful about sourcing
ingredients with care.

00:44:27.839 --> 00:44:29.630
VISHAL JAIN: And actually
just to follow up

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:31.910
on that, when you're
structuring your organization

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:35.290
to be able to take these kinds
of smart, methodical bets,

00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:39.170
do you have sort of a classic
brand management, you know,

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:42.240
category managers,
brand managers, and sort

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.290
of innovation managers?

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:45.590
Or do you try to structure
the team differently

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:49.514
to suit the KIND strategy?

00:44:49.514 --> 00:44:51.430
DANIEL LUBETZKY: First
of all, we just brought

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:53.730
in an amazing head of marketing.

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:55.170
Her name is Lisa Mann.

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:57.990
She had an incredible career.

00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:59.880
She could probably
answer your question

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.410
10 times better than I can.

00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:03.610
And what I love about KIND
is that we attract people

00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:05.234
and bring people that
are better than I

00:45:05.234 --> 00:45:07.460
am at the areas of
their expertise.

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:11.350
And so she is going to
be working with our team

00:45:11.350 --> 00:45:13.930
in reviewing all
the way we currently

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:16.470
do things to see how
we do them differently.

00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:21.000
But the way we've done
it in the past-- I

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.670
really try to get our team to
think more from the gut than

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:24.720
from the data.

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.790
We have awesome
team members that

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:27.957
bring so many data insights.

00:45:27.957 --> 00:45:29.623
And by the way, I
really appreciate them

00:45:29.623 --> 00:45:31.480
because they're very
different from me.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:33.120
I don't think enough
from the data,

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.485
and data is very important.

00:45:34.485 --> 00:45:37.060
But when you're
designing something new,

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:40.600
the data is obviously very
important when you're selling.

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:42.970
It's very useful data.

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:46.130
And it's to some degree useful
also when you're planning.

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:49.304
But when you're innovating,
data only tells you

00:45:49.304 --> 00:45:50.970
the history of where
you're coming from.

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:52.678
It doesn't tell you
where you need to go.

00:45:52.678 --> 00:45:55.540
And it also doesn't tell you
who are, your brand promise.

00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:58.480
So you need to be very careful
when you're looking at data not

00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:01.120
to try to chase a
fad that's ephemeral

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.400
or that belongs
to somebody else.

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.920
So I really try to work
with my team for them

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.970
to think completely
out of the box.

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:11.580
So we have a very
[? atraditional ?] structure

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:14.201
on the new product development
side because we're trying

00:46:14.201 --> 00:46:15.450
to think [? atraditionally. ?]

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:17.720
And a lot of the
innovation that's coming,

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:19.970
it's coming from team members
that are just completely

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:21.530
thinking outside the box.

00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:25.040
And we try not to put them in
too structured an environment,

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.837
because I don't
want them to think

00:46:26.837 --> 00:46:28.420
that just because
they come from here,

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:32.021
the next thing is
in that same space.

00:46:32.021 --> 00:46:34.691
VISHAL JAIN: Any other
questions from the audience?

00:46:34.691 --> 00:46:36.790
DANIEL LUBETZKY:
Should we wrap up?

00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:39.410
We have two more
minutes if anybody

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:41.865
wants to win a free car.

00:46:41.865 --> 00:46:42.740
Was that what their--

00:46:44.767 --> 00:46:46.350
VISHAL JAIN: Is that
coming from KIND?

00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:46.940
Or is that--

00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:47.773
DANIEL LUBETZKY: No.

00:46:47.773 --> 00:46:51.560
It's a Google-- it's
a Google car, right?

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:52.601
Random House is here.

00:46:52.601 --> 00:46:54.350
They're my partners
from Ballantine Books.

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:57.522
So thank you for
being great partners.

00:46:57.522 --> 00:46:59.480
VISHAL JAIN: The books
are at sale in the back.

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.105
DANIEL LUBETZKY: The
books are on sale.

00:47:01.105 --> 00:47:05.630
And you saw all of our KIND team
treating you to some products.

00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:09.690
So thank you to Julianna
and Rebecca for putting this

00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:13.420
together, and to all or our
team members in the fields team

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:16.710
that are every day
nourishing the community.

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:18.770
Thank you so much
for having us, guys.

00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:20.395
VISHAL JAIN: Thanks
for coming, Daniel.

00:47:20.395 --> 00:47:22.720
