00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.540
In 2003, a ground breaking genetics report that

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.800
performed the y chromosome analysis, revealed that a significant

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.055
proportion of men alive today, are actually direct line

00:00:10.055 --> 00:00:13.470
decendants from one man who lived about 1000 years

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.190
ago. A whopping 16 million of men alive today

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.502
actually share the same y chromosome. That's like 0.5%

00:00:20.502 --> 00:00:23.314
of the world population of men, or about one

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:26.250
in 200 men. So how did a y chromosome

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.490
spread so fast in only about 30 generations?

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.765
Almost all the evidence points to a single man,

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:37.110
Genghis Khan. About 10% of all men living

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.290
within the borders of what was once the Mongul

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.940
Empire, share the same y chromosome. And Genghis

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.030
Khan was a warlord. An emperor of the Mongol

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.580
Empire who gained land mainly thru battle and trade.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.740
Now the key to understanding how his y chromosome

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.010
might have spread so fast is not so hidden in a

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.950
quote that's attributed to him and the methods of his empire

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.810
expansion. The greatest joy of a man is to defeat his

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.489
enemies. To drive them before him and to take from them

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.630
all they possess. To see they love in tears, to ride

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.550
their horses and to hold their wives and daughters in his

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.050
arms. And Genghis Khan was one of the most ruthless warriors

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.080
who ever lived. And his y chromosome has been so successful

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.530
in part, because of forcible rape and

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.400
reproduction of the many women that he came

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.710
in contact with. And now 0.5% of the world is the genetic evidence to prove it.
