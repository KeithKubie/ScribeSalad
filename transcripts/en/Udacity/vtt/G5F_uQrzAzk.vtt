00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:04.774
To understand why the GPU is such an interesting processor today, we'll start with technology trends.

00:00:04.774 --> 00:00:06.507
Why the world has gone parallel.

00:00:06.507 --> 00:00:08.387
And first, we'll start with some good news.

00:00:08.387 --> 00:00:10.889
Modern processors are made from transistors.

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.050
Each year those transistors get smaller and smaller.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.093
This graph is from Stanford's CPUDB project. Thanks, guys.

00:00:18.093 --> 00:00:21.725
What it shows is the feature size of processors over time,

00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:25.495
where the feature size is the minimum size of a transistor or wire on a chip.

00:00:25.495 --> 00:00:28.699
So what we're seeing is this is time going in this direction.

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.541
That's a long time ago and that's today.

00:00:31.541 --> 00:00:34.638
This is the feature size, so how big transistors are.

00:00:34.638 --> 00:00:38.079
Notice that it's getting smaller and smaller every generation.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.272
When you hear talk about 45 nanometer process or a 22 nanometer

00:00:42.272 --> 00:00:44.713
that's what we're referring to, the feature size.

00:00:44.713 --> 00:00:47.682
We see that it's consistently going down over time.

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:52.385
As the feature size decreases, transistors get smaller, run faster, use less power,

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:53.889
and we can put more of them on a chip.

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:58.660
The consequence is that we have more and more resources for computation every single year.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.935
However, we've also got some bad news.

00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:04.498
Historically, as transistors improved, processor designers would then

00:01:04.498 --> 00:01:08.269
increase the clock rates of processors, running them faster and faster every year.

00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:12.004
Let's take a look at this diagram of clock speeds over the years.

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:17.170
So again, we have time going on this axis, okay? So, a long time ago, today.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.568
Here we have clock frequencyâ€”how fast we're clocking these transistors.

00:01:21.568 --> 00:01:26.206
Historically, one of the primary drivers of clock performance has been clock speed increases.

00:01:26.206 --> 00:01:30.310
We see over many years, we see clock speeds continue to go up.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.748
However, over the last decade we see that clock speeds have essentially remained constant.
