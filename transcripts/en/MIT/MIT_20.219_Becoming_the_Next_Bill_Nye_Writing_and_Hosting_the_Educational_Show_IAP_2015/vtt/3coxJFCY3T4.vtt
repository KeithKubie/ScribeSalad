00:00:05.313 --> 00:00:07.250
PROFESSOR: Hey, Kenneth.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.474
KENNETH CHEAH: Hi.

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:12.969
PROFESSOR: So how do you
feel with it being over?

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.510
KENNETH CHEAH: A little nervous
because I'm having my friends

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.440
from Singapore come over.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.490
Some of them will be
seeing it, and I'm not sure

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.890
how they really would
like it or not like it.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.552
So yeah, I'm a little nervous.

00:00:23.552 --> 00:00:26.396
PROFESSOR: How was this
class different from the ones

00:00:26.396 --> 00:00:29.240
that you've taken at SUTD?

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.770
KENNETH CHEAH: I think it's a
lot more hands-on, definitely.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.470
We have a similar
course back in SUTD,

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.440
where it's called
Film Studies, but I

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.220
think that's a more
film-related module.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.280
This feels a lot more like
a good mix between education

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.410
and entertainment.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.620
It's really, really nice
to see all this stuff

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.010
that you always wanted to
do or you always see around.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.760
I see so many people
making YouTube videos

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.460
and you're kind of learning
the theory behind it all.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.300
And usually, it was just, oh,
let's just set up a camera

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.060
and just put it on,
but there is actually

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.630
a lot more going into it.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.130
And yeah, probably that's what's
the difference between all

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.230
the good videos you see and
some people just teaching

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.584
how to derive some equations
on a blackboard, I guess.

00:01:16.584 --> 00:01:18.250
PROFESSOR: What is
the most useful thing

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.500
that you learned in the class?

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.916
KENNETH CHEAH: I think the
small class size really, really

00:01:21.916 --> 00:01:23.999
helps and the fact that
we just help each other.

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:25.165
We give each other feedback.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.220
The conventional way would
just be turn in your ideas

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.060
and one teacher or maybe two
teachers would just grade it.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.720
But this, you get the
whole class's feedback,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.115
which is a lot more useful.

00:01:40.115 --> 00:01:41.906
PROFESSOR: Do you think
it would work if it

00:01:41.906 --> 00:01:43.171
were more than ten people.

00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:45.670
KENNETH CHEAH: I think it might
be a bit hard because things

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.060
and people may
not be to gel that

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.480
well to be able to be
comfortable to give

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.469
too much comments.

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:51.052
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:01:51.052 --> 00:01:52.740
Thank you very much.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.550
KENNETH CHEAH: Thank you.
