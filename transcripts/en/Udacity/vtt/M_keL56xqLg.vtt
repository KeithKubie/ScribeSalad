00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.690
So Paul, what do you guys do to
actually get out of the way when you're

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.010
testing with the user?

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.939
What questions do you ask them or what
statements do you give them to make sure

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.595
that they're comfortable just
taking the product as it is?

00:00:10.595 --> 00:00:11.270
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.510
So by far the most important one is
to make sure that the user knows

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.480
that we are not testing them,
we are testing the software.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.200
We will actually often make
that just 100% explicit,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.640
say we are not testing you,
we are testing the program.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.800
If you feel like you're doing
something wrong, you're not,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.530
our program is doing something wrong.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.350
Then we kind of step back and
let them start using the software.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.130
The other thing that we do during
tests which is really important is to

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.980
have the user think aloud.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.350
So thinking aloud is a little bit
different than just talking or

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.770
just thinking, right?

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.610
One of the great, best ways that I've
found to get a user to think aloud, or

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.710
to understand what thinking aloud is,
is to ask them how many windows they

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.980
have in their house or their apartment,
and most people will say, four?

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.810
And you go,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.440
okay, well hang on, walk me through
the process of how you got there.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.950
And the user will go well,
I guess there are two in the kitchen,

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.460
then I turn left and there's another
little one there, so that's three, and

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.010
then I go upstairs and I guess there's
a couple windows on the staircase.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.710
Okay, that's the process
we want you to go through.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.884
We want to know what you're thinking
as your thinking, what you're noticing,

00:01:17.884 --> 00:01:22.310
what you're understanding when you
realize something we want to know that.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.400
And then as the test goes on,
you kind of keep poking them and

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.185
keep prompting them.

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:27.470
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; And if they start to

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.480
get frustrated you go back and
remind them again.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.900
This is great information for
us, you're doing nothing wrong.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.620
This is exactly what we want to know,
yep.
