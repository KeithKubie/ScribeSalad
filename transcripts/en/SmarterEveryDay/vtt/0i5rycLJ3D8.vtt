00:00:00.206 --> 00:00:01.378
Hey it's me Destin

00:00:01.378 --> 00:00:02.704
Welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.704 --> 00:00:03.729
Have you ever been driving along

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:05.972
and you suddenly stop and realize that you're moving

00:00:05.972 --> 00:00:08.393
around this world in a bubble of glass?

00:00:08.393 --> 00:00:09.841
It's kind of weird if you think about it.

00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:11.036
But it's really cool.

00:00:11.036 --> 00:00:13.432
Engineers have designed the glass in your car

00:00:13.432 --> 00:00:16.048
to be extremely safe, so that when you have a wreck

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:17.919
you decrease the chance that you're getting

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:19.701
cut in half like the bad guy in Ghost.

00:00:19.701 --> 00:00:20.807
Remember the movie Ghost? Anyway.

00:00:20.807 --> 00:00:22.485
So today on Smarter Every Day

00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:24.616
I want to investigate the two different types of glass

00:00:24.616 --> 00:00:25.874
that go into car windows.

00:00:25.874 --> 00:00:27.625
On the side you have tempered glass,

00:00:27.625 --> 00:00:29.719
kind of like a Prince Rupert's Drop, but flat.

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:32.241
And on the windshield you have annealed glass.

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:34.026
First let's talk about windshields.

00:00:34.026 --> 00:00:38.090
Glass on a windshield is designed to take a hit from a rock and not fall in on your lap.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.997
However, glass on the side windows are different.

00:00:39.997 --> 00:00:43.037
To demonstrate that, I got a window out of a car in a junkyard

00:00:43.037 --> 00:00:45.424
and we're gonna hit it and just watch what happens.

00:00:45.424 --> 00:00:47.238
Check out how it breaks.

00:00:48.738 --> 00:00:49.894
It doesn't break.

00:00:49.894 --> 00:00:52.637
That's because it's designed to be very very strong in the center

00:00:52.637 --> 00:00:53.991
but not on the edge.

00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:55.839
Watch what happens if we do the same thing on the edge.

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:57.382
[shatters]

00:00:59.402 --> 00:01:01.106
The whole thing shatters.

00:01:01.106 --> 00:01:03.528
To understand exactly why this happens

00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:05.662
we're gonna go to my driveway and use a high speed camera

00:01:05.662 --> 00:01:08.893
to analyze this at 20,000 frames per second.

00:01:08.893 --> 00:01:10.580
What are you doing Mr Helper?

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.869
- Holding glass.

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.491
- He's holding the glass. This is not tempered glass.

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:17.694
We've got a high speed camera, this is a V1610

00:01:17.694 --> 00:01:19.590
which at the time that we made this video is the fastest

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.860
high speed camera on the market.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.342
And I have another helper over here.

00:01:22.342 --> 00:01:23.730
Not you.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:24.768
What are you doing?

00:01:24.768 --> 00:01:28.167
Pushing the button when the camera breaks..

00:01:28.167 --> 00:01:29.684
I mean when the, um..

00:01:29.684 --> 00:01:31.387
- The camera's not gonna break! [laughs]

00:01:31.387 --> 00:01:32.069
- The glass.

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:33.628
- When the glass breaks, and what does that do?

00:01:33.628 --> 00:01:35.110
- Start the camera.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.112
- That's right. OK.

00:01:36.112 --> 00:01:38.085
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna drop tempered glass

00:01:38.085 --> 00:01:39.185
and not tempered glass,

00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:40.891
and we're gonna show the difference between the two.

00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:42.737
And there's a special announcement at the end of this.

00:01:42.737 --> 00:01:44.889
So, let's do some science.

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:46.001
You can move buddy.

00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:48.072
- I can move?

00:01:48.072 --> 00:01:50.170
- I've got it. Yep, safety glasses on.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.920
You ready little girl?

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.567
Ready?

00:01:54.017 --> 00:01:56.077
3.. 2.. 1..

00:01:56.547 --> 00:01:57.935
[shatters]

00:01:59.915 --> 00:02:01.744
[laughs] OK, did you do it?

00:02:03.924 --> 00:02:08.859
[slowed shatter]

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:16.390
OK you ready buddy?

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.619
Tempered.

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:20.337
Are you ready?

00:02:20.337 --> 00:02:21.724
Do your best.

00:02:21.724 --> 00:02:24.149
3..2..1..

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:26.661
Did you get it?

00:02:37.471 --> 00:02:39.071
It didn't break.

00:02:39.071 --> 00:02:40.153
The tempered glass didn't break.

00:02:40.153 --> 00:02:41.572
Dropping from higher this time.

00:02:41.572 --> 00:02:43.036
Try to drop it on the corner too.

00:02:43.036 --> 00:02:44.680
3.. 2.. 1..

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.969
Yahaa!

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:48.040
It's not breaking!

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.107
OK so it wasn't breaking so we're gonna tape this wrench onto the bottom

00:03:02.107 --> 00:03:03.204
of the glass.

00:03:03.204 --> 00:03:07.279
And the idea is that maybe the wrench will actually twist the edge

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:10.546
and break the glass when it impacts.

00:03:10.546 --> 00:03:11.449
We'll see.

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:12.773
Hopefully it works.

00:03:16.003 --> 00:03:18.394
3.. 2.. 1..

00:03:18.394 --> 00:03:19.366
[smashes]

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:20.239
There we go.

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:40.246
[slowed smash]

00:03:46.656 --> 00:03:47.824
OK this is the aftermath.

00:03:47.824 --> 00:03:49.755
You can see on the left we have tempered glass.

00:03:49.755 --> 00:03:52.016
On the right, that's just normal annealed glass

00:03:52.016 --> 00:03:54.371
so the question is, why do they break differently?

00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:55.661
It's pretty awesome though isn't it.

00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:57.733
OK so what did we learn from this experiment?

00:03:57.733 --> 00:04:00.153
Annealed glass is just normal glass that's been

00:04:00.153 --> 00:04:03.940
heated up in the manufacturing process and then allowed to cool down gradually.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.620
This cooling relieves any internal stresses on the glass.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.625
You'll notice when the annealed glass breaks,

00:04:09.625 --> 00:04:13.954
not only is the cracking slow but sometimes it doesn't even make it to the other side of the glass.

00:04:13.954 --> 00:04:15.357
Which is good for windshields.

00:04:15.357 --> 00:04:19.130
A small crack in one spot of the windshield doesn't completely blind your vision.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.520
Also they put a piece of plastic between two sheets of annealed glass

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.042
so that these big shards don't fall in and cut you inside the car.

00:04:26.042 --> 00:04:27.826
Tempered glass is very different.

00:04:27.826 --> 00:04:29.986
Instead of allowing the glass to cool down slowly

00:04:29.986 --> 00:04:33.123
they use forced air to cool down the outer sides of the glass really quickly

00:04:33.123 --> 00:04:35.419
which leaves the inside of the glass hot.

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.168
Kind of like how a Prince Rupert's Drop is made if you remember that video.

00:04:38.168 --> 00:04:40.013
The inside is still hot so as it cools down

00:04:40.013 --> 00:04:43.172
it shrinks and pulls in which puts the outside of the glass in compression

00:04:43.172 --> 00:04:45.538
but the inside in really high tension.

00:04:45.538 --> 00:04:48.542
Just like the Prince Rupert's Drop if you can get through that hard outer layer

00:04:48.542 --> 00:04:52.610
it releases the tension and the feathering front destroys the entire sheet of glass.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.558
On the Prince Rupert's Drop you have to get through the outside curved surface

00:04:55.558 --> 00:04:57.100
of the drop to release the tension.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.306
But on a car window you have to get through the flat tempered surface to release the tension.

00:05:01.306 --> 00:05:04.092
With a sheet of glass though, we have to start it along one of the edges.

00:05:04.092 --> 00:05:06.115
Even after you break tempered glass

00:05:06.115 --> 00:05:10.619
you can sometimes still hear the stress releasing itself as it continues to break.

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:11.321
So there you go.

00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:13.453
The next time you need to escape from a car window

00:05:13.453 --> 00:05:15.363
remember that the windshield is annealed

00:05:15.363 --> 00:05:16.626
and it's gonna hold together

00:05:16.626 --> 00:05:18.721
but the side windows are tempered and they're gonna bust out

00:05:18.721 --> 00:05:21.666
completely as long as you hit them on the edge.

00:05:21.666 --> 00:05:23.052
OK I'm just gonna go for this.

00:05:23.052 --> 00:05:24.920
You're smart, you know how YouTube works.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.607
A company approaches a person with a large channel

00:05:27.607 --> 00:05:30.170
and says can we sponsor a product on your channel

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.656
and the guy says yes, and they agree on a price.

00:05:32.656 --> 00:05:33.946
This is different.

00:05:33.946 --> 00:05:36.428
I actually contacted this company

00:05:36.428 --> 00:05:38.504
because their product has changed my family

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:41.698
in a really good way and I want that to happen to your family.

00:05:41.698 --> 00:05:43.318
It's called Kiwi Crate.

00:05:43.318 --> 00:05:46.488
Last christmas I wanted to get a gift for my kids that would help

00:05:46.488 --> 00:05:47.688
me spend more time with them.

00:05:47.688 --> 00:05:50.370
Right now I've been living in hotels for two and a half weeks,

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.018
I want to spend time with my kids right now.

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:56.996
Every month a Kiwi Crate shows up at the house for each of the kids.

00:05:56.996 --> 00:06:01.099
My son has a tinker crate, which is like a science and engineering kit.

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:04.685
This is a trebuchet he gets to build, laser cut plywood.

00:06:04.685 --> 00:06:06.912
This is my daughter's. It's called a doodle crate.

00:06:06.912 --> 00:06:08.630
She gets to do an art project every month.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.564
She made paper. We did it together.

00:06:10.564 --> 00:06:12.217
My youngest son gets another one.

00:06:12.217 --> 00:06:13.441
This one's on transportation.

00:06:13.441 --> 00:06:15.190
This is called a koala crate.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.451
It's a little thing for his age group.

00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:20.493
But every month they each get a box and they know

00:06:20.493 --> 00:06:23.468
that this box is something they get to do with daddy.

00:06:23.468 --> 00:06:25.440
So, I really want you to do this.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.247
If you know a kid and you want that kid to

00:06:28.247 --> 00:06:30.507
you know, just have their mind stimulated

00:06:30.507 --> 00:06:31.613
in many different ways.

00:06:31.613 --> 00:06:35.619
Please consider going to kiwicrate.com/smarter

Get a subscription for that kid.

00:06:37.424 --> 00:06:39.040
Because I approached Kiwi Crate

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.117
the first Kiwi Crate or tinker crate you get is free.

00:06:43.117 --> 00:06:45.803
If you don't like it, just cancel and never pay anything.

00:06:45.803 --> 00:06:47.029
I know you're gonna keep it

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:49.966
because we do this and our family loves it.

00:06:49.966 --> 00:06:51.936
It is quality time I get to have with my kids

00:06:51.936 --> 00:06:53.433
and I, that's all I want right now.

00:06:53.433 --> 00:06:56.565
So, if you are interested in supporting Smarter Every Day,

00:06:56.565 --> 00:07:00.085
and spending time investing into the mind of your children,

00:07:00.085 --> 00:07:02.810
give it a shot. I'm selling it hard, I really am.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:03.840
I know I'm selling it hard,

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.707
and the reason is, I believe in it.

00:07:05.707 --> 00:07:06.645
There you go.

00:07:06.645 --> 00:07:08.138

You're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:07:12.885 --> 00:07:13.858
Have a good one.

00:07:13.858 --> 00:07:14.890
That's pretty cool isn't it.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.097
I want to say thank you to a really awesome security guard

00:07:19.097 --> 00:07:21.103
that decided not to stop me.

00:07:21.103 --> 00:07:21.871
Thank you very much.

00:07:21.871 --> 00:07:22.614
What was your name?

00:07:22.614 --> 00:07:23.095
- Tony.

00:07:23.095 --> 00:07:25.918
- Tony. Tony has common sense and he's awesome.

00:07:25.918 --> 00:07:27.519
I really appreciate that.
