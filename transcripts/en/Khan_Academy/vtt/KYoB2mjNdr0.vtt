00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.480
 

00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.630
We finished the last video
with the Reign of Terror,

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:17.940
which lasted essentially from
April of 1793 to July of 1794,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.230
where Robespierre himself got
the losing end of the

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.740
guillotine.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.110
So it looks like France was done
with the low point of the

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.375
Revolution.

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:29.480
And that is true, especially
from the point of view of the

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.920
French people.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.530
Then we go into 1795.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.210
France is doing well
in its wars with

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.830
essentially the rest of Europe.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.575
And peace is declared with
Prussia and Spain.

00:00:43.575 --> 00:00:52.010
 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.720
So the only two major
enemies left are

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.710
Great Britain and Austria.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.590
So slowly, France is dealing
with its enemies.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.130
And this was essentially
a victory for France.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.480
So France victorious with
this huge citizen

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.290
army that it created.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.440
And then this was in
April of 1795.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.100
And then in August of 1795-- let
me do that in a different

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:28.010
color-- in August of 1795,
the new republic

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.520
constitution gets approved.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:41.950
And it gets ratified through
a vote of the people, which

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.160
makes France officially
a republic.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.430
They don't need kings anymore.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.580
And it set up a governing
structure where the executive

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.940
was essentially this group
five directors.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.900
So the executive is called
the Directory.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.290
So you don't have
one president,

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.910
you had five directors.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.880
 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.250
And then the legislature, and
this was significant because

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.070
this was the first bicameral
legislature for France, it had

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.920
two houses.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.170
It had the Council of 500, which
is analogous to the U.S.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.095
House of Representatives.

00:02:16.095 --> 00:02:19.740
It had 500 members in it,
500 representatives.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.600
Let me write that down.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.520
It was by bicameral.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.000
It had two houses, just like
the U.S. Congress.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.480
So it's Council of 500.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:35.640
And then you had your Counsel
of Elders, which had 250

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.400
representatives.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.730
And that, if you want to view it
from a U.S. point of view,

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.420
that was analogous to
the U.S. Senate.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.420
And the Directory, the
directors, the candidates were

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.520
submitted by the Council of
500 to of the Council of

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.870
Elders, who then picked the
five directors-- the five

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.870
people who would essentially
be the executive in France.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.480
Already, things are looking
really well.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.770
But, even though they had the
military victories, there was

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.910
still a lot of unrest.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.450
You still had Royalist
out there.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.870
You still had Great Britain
causing trouble.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.020
Great Britain was attacking the
western regions of France.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.560
There were Royalists
throughout Paris.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:28.850
And then, in October of 1795,
there was a Royalist uprising.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.130
And Royalists are the
people who wanted to

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.420
bring back the crown.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.900
Or they were against the
revolutionary government.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.900
And to a large degree, they
weren't just upset about the

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.590
fact that the royalty is gone.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.910
There were also upset
that they were

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.690
excluded from the Directory.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.330
So it excluded the Royalists.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.020
So before the Directory could
even form in any major way,

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.790
you had a Royalist uprising
in Paris.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.510
 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.530
And they stormed
the Tuileries.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.940
This is the same place that you
might remember earlier on,

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.190
a couple of videos ago, where
the king and queen were in

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.100
house arrest. And later, they
were assaulted by the

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.360
revolutionary government.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.120
That was this painting
right here.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.600
This was only three years ago.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.600
This was in 1792 and this is
when they actually took the

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.660
king and queen prisoner.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.690
And then they executed
Louis XVI only a few

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.040
months after that.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.500
So now it was on
the other way.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.950
Instead of the royalty being
in the Tuileries, and being

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.020
sieged by the revolutionaries,
the revolutionary government

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.720
was in the Tuileries and it was
being sieged by Royalists.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.940
And actually, the situation
did not look good for the

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.030
revolutionary government.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.470
They were out numbered.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.075
It looked like the Royalists
had better numbers.

00:04:38.075 --> 00:04:42.800
 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.980
But lucky for the revolutionary
government,

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:52.830
there was a young, very
ambitious, very egotistical,

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.300
military captain at this point,
who had observed the

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.470
Siege of the Tuileries when
Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.420
were captured.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.830
And back then, he made
a mental note.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.030
He said, they would have been
able to stop the siege if only

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.080
they had good artillery.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.860
Remember, he was an
artillery captain.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.900
That's where he first
became famous.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.520
In the Siege of Toulon he was
able to use artillery

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.680
effectively to suppress
a rebellion.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.850
So he was actually observing
this scene three years later.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.450
And now, in 1795, as the
revolutionary government is in

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.110
the Tuileries and the Royalists
are about to

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.750
essentially take it over,
Napoleon, using what he

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.070
learned when he observed the
first time, he was able to

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.460
place cannons and artillery
in such a way.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.750
And he shot what they
call grapeshot.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.240
And it's essentially like a
shotgun coming out of a canon.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.410
And even though they were
significantly outnumbered by

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.270
the Royalists, he was
essentially able to mow them

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.240
down with the canons.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.620
So even though you had
more numbers, you

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.840
had all these cannons.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.780
Let me draw one.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.560
You had a canon and the actual
ammunition would have these

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.470
little pellets.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.290
That's why it was called
grapeshot, it looked like a

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:02.670
bundle of grapes.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.080
And when you shot it out, it
would go in every direction.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.850
So you could imagine, it would
just mow down whoever is in

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.150
the way of the canon.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.160
And so essentially, Napoleon
was able to save the

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.660
revolutionary government.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:21.630
And allow the actual Directory
to come to power.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.370
So this once again, Napoleon was
in the right place at the

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.790
right time.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.740
And he was very competent
in military tactics.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.330
By all measure he was
egotistical, he narcisistic,

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.350
but the dude knew what
he was doing.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.350
And so Napoleon becomes
even more famous.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.540
This event, October 5, 1795
where Napoleon is able to

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:46.230
defend the revolutionary
government, this is know as 13

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.480
Vendemiaire.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.140
 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.180
I know I'm saying it wrong.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.310
But once again, this was the
month of October in the new

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.580
French Revolutionary Calendar.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:03.690
But it made Napoleon even more
of a national hero, or even

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.040
revolutionary hero.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.320
People are starting to realize
that this guy, he definitely

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.220
knows what he's doing.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.390
But you could imagine at the
same time, the Directory

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.790
really didn't like this dude
hanging around too close to

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:18.650
the seats of power.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.110
He was obviously ambitious.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.100
He was obviously competent.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.180
And at some point, he
might be a threat

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.140
himself to the Directory.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.030
So they gave him power.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.620
But they made sure that he
was far away from France.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.570
So he was essentially
put in charge of the

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.420
campaign into Italy.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.410
 

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.800
Remember, we're still fighting
Austria and Great Britain.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.810
So we're fighting Austria
in Italy.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:47.710
And Napoleon is made a Commander
in Chief of the

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.390
Italian forces.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.010
And he's tremendously
successful.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.630
This was kind of the least
important front of the war

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.170
with Austria at this point.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.620
But out of all of the generals
of the different fronts,

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.010
Napoleon is the one that
proves himself to be

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:04.650
tremendously innovative
and tactical and an

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:05.820
all-route good general.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.700
So this Napoleon kicking
butt in Italy.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:13.330
 

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.940
So once again, he becomes
even more famous,

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.850
even more well known.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:28.010
Eventually, Austria admits that
hey gee, we're not going

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.300
to beat the French anymore.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.780
They're really taking care
of us quite well.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:43.370
And they make peace with the
French in October of 1797.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:48.890
The Italian campaign
occurred in 1796.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.350
So he defended the
revolutionary

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:52.890
government in 1795.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:56.320
He kicks butt in
1796 in Italy.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:01.330
In 1797 there's peace
with Austria.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:02.740
So you only have Great
Britain left.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.150
But this peace with Austria
is actually

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.400
going to be very temporary.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.290
 

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:11.015
This is from the Treaty
of Campo-Formio.

00:09:11.015 --> 00:09:12.265
Let me write that down.

00:09:12.265 --> 00:09:21.670
 

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.090
And once again, this was
peace with Austria.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.160
But France was the victor.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.040
So this is another
French victory.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.610
And the only real enemy left
was Great Britain.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.530
But the main problem was that
Great Britain had the dominant

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.170
navy in the world at the time.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:42.500
So France, and especially
Napoleon, wasn't in a position

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.030
to confront Great Britain
on the water.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:48.660
And this was kind of a
controversial decision.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.070
In 1798-- and remember, the
Directory really didn't want

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:53.470
Napoleon hanging
around France.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:55.490
They're like OK, you're hugely
popular, you're a good

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.460
general, you're a
great general.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.690
You go do what you want.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:09:59.920
Whatever you think is proper.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.080
So Napoleon gets it into his
head to attack Egypt.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.090
And people aren't 100% sure what
was the main strategic

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:10.090
goal of attacking Egypt.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:15.140
So in 1798, he leaves
from Toulon.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:18.450
Remember Toulon was the port
that he helped suppress.

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:23.200
He leaves from Toulon, he takes
Malta along the way.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.510
And then eventually, he
arrives in Egypt to

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:28.730
essentially take over Egypt.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.770
And people believe that his
desire to take over Egypt was

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.730
essentially to, at some
point, undermine

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:35.720
the British in India.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.520
He'd maybe make some Muslim
allies in Egypt and then maybe

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.710
befriend some of the Muslim
insurgents, if you will.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.240
Especially they were talking
about Tipu Sultan, who he

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.660
wanted to meet up with and
maybe help undermine the

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.150
British in India.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.290
But people aren't quite sure.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.230
It might have been just Napoleon
having some visions

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:54.500
of grandeur.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:59.130
And he wanted to go to Egypt
because Egypt was a formerly

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:00.480
great empire.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.600
So in 1798, Napoleon
goes to Egypt.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.050
These are paintings
of him in Egypt.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:12.780
And once again, he was able to
kind of route the Mamluk

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.680
forces who are in power
at the time in Egypt.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.330
This is the Battle
of the Pyramids.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.610
Once again, Napoleon is
hugely successful.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.800
Except for one problem.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.390
He brings his 20,000 troops into
Egypt, obviously by ship.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:31.150
They're sitting here, they're
kicking butt in Egypt.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:35.050
But they're still at war
with the British.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:38.130
So what the British do, with
their dominant Navy, they send

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.760
Horatio Nelson in charge
of a fleet.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.800
And he comes here where the
French navy was parked.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.630
And he just destroys them.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:49.580
So Horatio Nelson destroys
the French fleet in the

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.700
Battle of the Nile.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:51.520
And this is a depiction.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.100
This is Horatio Nelson
right here.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:58.070
 

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:05.210
This is a depiction of the
Battle of the Nile, which

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:09.040
essentially strands Napoleon's
20,000-person army.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.010
They're stuck in Egypt.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:15.440
So not knowing what else to do--
they can't leave with all

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.670
of their forces-- Napoleon
then goes into

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.340
Damascus and Syria.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.950
And then he causes all sorts
of havoc in raping and

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.420
pillaging and whatnot.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.850
But still that kind of begs the
question of, how are they

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:27.740
going to get back?

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.620
And you could imagine, for
someone as ambitious and

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:34.380
egotistical as Napoleon, he
didn't really care a lot about

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.230
what happened to his troops.

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:43.680
And so when an opportunity
arose in 1799, he left.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.050
He left his entire army.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:49.970
This gives you a lot of view
into Napoleon's character,

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:54.170
that he was willing to leave his
entire army in Egypt and

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:58.330
in Syria to essentially be left
to die at the hands of

00:12:58.330 --> 00:12:58.720
the Ottomans.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.460
And then he sneaks his
way back to France.

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:08.160
So in 1799, Napoleon goes
back to France.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:14.920
 

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.170
Let me write this down.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:28.610
 

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:32.110
And once he gets back there, he
sees that the Directory is

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:33.870
unbelievably unpopular.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:38.850
 

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:41.180
And the main reason is the
reason that every government

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:44.080
in France throughout this whole
series of videos has

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.010
been unpopular.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:46.640
People are still hungry.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.770
France is still poor.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:49.960
Notice in everything I've talked
about, in all of these

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.590
videos, we still haven't
addressed the issue that

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:56.470
France is essentially broke
and that people are still

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:57.150
going hungry.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:59.440
So throughout all of the
violence, all of the wars, the

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.810
Directory is hugely unpopular.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:04.690
And then a few of the directors,
two in particular,

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:07.650
actually three of the directors,
want to plot with

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.190
Napoleon, who was
hugely popular.

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:12.190
And they essentially
plan a coup.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:15.100
And the way that they allow
themselves to come to power is

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.370
they resign.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:19.480
And then they tell the
legislature that's meeting at

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.970
the Tuileries, hey, there's
a Jacobian revolt

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:25.200
and you're in danger.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.320
Why don't you go to this
estate west of Paris.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.450
So that's Paris, where
they normally meet.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:34.260
They tell them to go to an
estate west of Paris.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.960
So the legislature goes
here to this estate.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.710
And you'll be protected
by Napoleon.

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:43.980
 

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.580
And they're protected by
Napoleon and his army.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:50.710
 

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.410
Now once they're there, Napoleon
goes in and starts

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:56.440
making these speeches about
you guys being essentially

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.190
illegitimate.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:00.230
And he looks like he really
wants to take power.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.250
And they just jostle him
out of the room.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:05.230
But once he gets jostled out
of the room, his brother

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:08.420
points to the bruises
on Napoleon.

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:13.000
He tells the guards outside of
where the legislature is

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.840
meeting, hey those
guys in there,

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.150
they're becoming violent.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.490
You have to go in there
and take order.

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:21.560
So that convinces
the military.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:25.370
And they go in and they
essentially dissolve the

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:26.890
Council of 500.

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:28.930
So essentially, you've dissolved
the legislature,

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:33.660
Napoleon is in charge of the
military that dissolved the

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.470
legislature.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:38.220
And so that allowed Napoleon
and two of the plotting

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.000
directors to take power.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.170
They became the three
consuls of France.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:51.950
They form the Consulate, or the
new executive of France.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:54.940
And very shortly they'll have
their own constitution.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:58.650
But this really marks the point
where Napoleon takes

00:15:58.650 --> 00:15:59.910
power of France.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.500
Because even though he took
power with these other two

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:07.330
dudes, he eventually is able to
scheme his way to be called

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:08.580
First Consul.

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:12.720
 

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:17.630
At which point he is the
authoritarian ruler of France.

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.540
So we've gone from, over the
course of the French

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:28.730
Revolution, from 1789 where we
had an absolute monarch in

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:34.620
Louis XVI, now we go all the way
to 1799, 10 years later,

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:39.280
after all of this bloodshed,
after multiple revolutions and

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.170
counter revolutions.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:44.880
We end up with Napoleon,
essentially being

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.860
in charge of France.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:47.360
