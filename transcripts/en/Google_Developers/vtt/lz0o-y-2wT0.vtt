00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.480
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Hey, everybody.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.430
Welcome here to a beautiful, cool day in San
Francisco.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.280
We're on the roof of the Moscone center.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.160
I know we showed you something really special
yesterday.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.240
And we got so much interest that we want to
show you how we put it all together.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.520
And, actually, we want to show you some of
the pretty same exciting action that you saw,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.210
but from a new perspective this time.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.800
So you can see, this is the roof.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.960
Some of our bikers are warming up out there.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.630
And they're doing some of their cool tricks,
getting ready for their part of this demonstration.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.150
You can also see that the airship is actually
overhead.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.400
You might be able to see it through my view
through my Glass in the Hangout.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.000
And we actually have a number of the jumpers
in the Hangout now.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.290
Now, as I walk over here, you'll see that
it's actually tricky to keep them in the Hangout

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.070
because of the really challenging wireless
environment.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.010
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: And if I can show you all on

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:12.170
here, we're pointing each of these dishes,
using different kinds of RF technology for

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.549
redundancy.

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.930
Each jumper has a different piece of technology
coming down.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.820
And that's how we felt comfortable that we
could maintain at least a couple of them in

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.670
the Hangout.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.979
I'm also, by the way, testing out a new kind
of iteration of Glass with these shade clip-ins

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.610
here right now.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.150
And they're -- definitely makes it better
out here in the bright sun.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.569
So we're going to have -- we've worked, you
know, with a lot of people around here, with

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:50.100
the City of San Francisco, the FAA, and the
offices of Oakland and San Jose to make this

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.100
happen.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.549
But the coordination is pretty tricky, as
you might imagine.

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.729
Let's seeâ€¦

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.450
Our jump master is here.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.450
This is Marshal.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.009
Marshal, how far out are we?

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.259
&gt;&gt;&gt; Under two minutes from the wing suits
being in the air.

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:03.710
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Under two minutes?

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.680
That's super exciting.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.920
And you guys might be able to see their perspectives
right now in the Hangout live.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.750
This is pretty exciting to me.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.640
How's -- have you heard from J.T.?

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.660
How are they doing up there?

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.240
&gt;&gt;&gt; They're in position right now.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.503
They're going to hover for a little while,
they're going to open the door, they're going

00:02:25.503 --> 00:02:26.503
to fly in their wing suits northwest of us
here, deploy their parachutes.

00:02:26.503 --> 00:02:28.650
And then you and I will be out here and it
will be high fives and smiles when they land.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.650
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Awesome.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.240
Since we only have a couple minutes, why don't
you guys walk with me.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.200
I want to get closer to their landing zone.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.080
And, you know, as we go here, I can just point
out, I mean, it's just stunning here.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.040
But if you look over there, as we walk toward
the landing zone, you can see a fog bank right

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.670
over there.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.800
And that fog bank is actually very scary to
us.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.120
It seems to be clearing out, so we feel good
about the jump today.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.380
But there was no guarantee.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.800
And, in fact, I should note that skydiving,
you know, there's no such thing as instrument

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.800
skydiving.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.800
You actually have to see your landing.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.640
I guess, conceivably, with Glass, you could
make an instrument version.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.740
You have a nice heads-up display where you're
going.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.200
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: But, anyway, we'll have to

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.200
try that another time.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.830
I know, I'm scaring my jump master.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.400
Today, we have sunny skies.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.480
You can see -- there's the airship pretty
much straight overhead.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.790
I don't know if we can get -- maybe we'll
get another shot of that.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.340
We have a few cameras scattered here that
can show you that.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.250
And let's keep walking here.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.080
A lot of exciting action.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:47.280
Now, I don't want to -- I don't want to block
your view.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.460
Hopefully, the audience is seeing right now
-- how is our Hangout going?

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.650
&gt;&gt;&gt; We're ready to go up to the airship.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.650
&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:55.650
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Okay.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.650
They're ready to jump.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.650
Cool.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:58.650
How's our view in the Hangout coming along?

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.490
&gt;&gt;&gt; I think J.T. is ready.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.490
Go up to J.T.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.490
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Okay.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.350
That's so cool.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.970
Why don't we throw it up to J.T. and he can
take it away.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.240
And, hopefully, this Hangout will go as well
as yesterday did.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.270
But, you know, you never know.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.870
A million things can go wrong.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.680
Okay, take it away, J.T.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.680
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.299
Good to be here, Terry.

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.650
Yeah, lucky with that fog.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.400
Good job calling ahead on that one, Sergey.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.659
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: And Marshal, who's going to
run the countdown?

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:28.310
&gt;&gt;&gt;Neal, on the airship.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.310
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Neal, is on the airship.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.169
He's going to be counting down.

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.169
The door is open.

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.169
&gt;&gt;&gt; Good morning, San Francisco!

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:36.169
Hey, how are the winds doing down there?

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:37.169
All right.

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:38.169
Well, we're going for it.

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:39.229
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Okay.

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:40.229
We've got 30 seconds, everyone.

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:41.229
I'm super excited about this.

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:42.229
&gt;&gt;&gt; See you in a few.

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.010
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Almost straight overhead.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.830
It's a beautiful day.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.370
We're really lucking out that the fog is holding
back.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.099
Door is open.

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:56.810
Pretty much standing still right now.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.499
&gt;&gt;&gt; Just going that way.

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:04.699
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: God, that -- That must be a
beautiful feeling to just fly right out of

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:05.699
there.

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:07.769
&gt;&gt;&gt; Five, four, three -- one!

00:05:07.769 --> 00:05:08.999
&gt;&gt;&gt; Jumping away.

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:12.509
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: And there they are!

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:15.669
There they are!

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.939
You can see them flying.

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:26.729
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: They're soaring across the
sky.

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:28.099
Toward the downtown.

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:29.490
Look at that.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.009
They're weaving closely in and out of each
other.

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:37.979
The Hangout footage, I'm sorry, I don't have
it.

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.120
It must be beautiful.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.120
Their chutes are opening.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.380
We've got two chutes open.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.509
And the third one, with a puff of smoke, just
opened.

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:53.669
If you're wondering why, we had to put one
of them with a puff of smoke so the radio-aiming

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:57.830
folks could know which skydiver was theirs.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.879
&gt;&gt;&gt; Walk over here and get in position -- we'll
try to get high fives as they land.

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:06.559
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Yes, if we can get over this
way pretty quick, and, hopefully, you guys

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:11.919
can tag along.

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:17.659
Okay, bikers ready.

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:20.569
You can see we're getting ready.

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:22.690
Skydivers coming down.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.849
All right.

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:27.189
Where should I stand here?

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:31.279
&gt;&gt;&gt; Going to land right --
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Okay.

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:35.180
You can see them clearly.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:50.819
You can now --
&gt;&gt;&gt; Give us 30 feet or so.

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:57.769
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: All right.

00:06:57.769 --> 00:07:04.719
&gt;&gt;&gt; Step right over here.

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:09.810
They're going to be landing, coming towards
us.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.810
&gt;&gt;&gt; Here comes J.T. right here.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:13.810
&gt;&gt;&gt; All right.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:14.810
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Woo-hoo!

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:15.810
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, buddy.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:16.810
Yeah, all right!

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:17.810
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; Here comes Carey.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:18.810
Here comesâ€¦

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:19.810
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Incoming.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:20.810
&gt;&gt;&gt; Whoa all right!

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:21.810
Nice!

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:22.810
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: That was awesome.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:23.810
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for having us.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:24.810
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Thanks for coming down.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:25.810
All right.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:26.810
That was amazing.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:27.810
&gt;&gt;&gt; Good job.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:28.810
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: All of our jumpers are down.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:29.810
And they make it look so easy.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:30.810
All right.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:31.810
Don't get blown away here.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:32.810
Hey, hey, that was great.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:33.810
Thanks, again.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:34.810
Amazing jump.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:35.810
Thanks, guys.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:36.810
&gt;&gt;&gt; (indiscernible).

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:37.810
&gt;&gt;&gt; That was awesome.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:38.810
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Great job.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:39.810
All right, thanks, guys, so much.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:40.810
Now, don't forget, we tested -- that was an
amazing jump.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:44.139
We have more in store to show you just how
did we do the rest of it.

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:45.919
We have our excellent bikers here.

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:49.169
And this is a really fun area here.

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:51.099
There are a few kind of natural blocks and
things.

00:07:51.099 --> 00:07:56.389
But the killer thing that we put in there,
because the roof goes up and down, there's

00:07:56.389 --> 00:07:58.389
a really great ramp that we put in there.

00:07:58.389 --> 00:08:01.219
And that was where you saw that magical moment.

00:08:01.219 --> 00:08:06.330
So maybe we can actually get a chance to see
the bikers -- let's see what you guys got!

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:10.379
Why don't you hit the ramp.

00:08:10.379 --> 00:08:11.729
All right.

00:08:11.729 --> 00:08:15.659
And we're going to try to make our way so
we can first of all watch this.

00:08:15.659 --> 00:08:16.659
Watch this.

00:08:16.659 --> 00:08:17.659
Yeah!

00:08:17.659 --> 00:08:18.659
Whoa, another back flip.

00:08:18.659 --> 00:08:20.520
That was amazing.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.169
All right.

00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:26.090
We're going to head over now and try to catch
them on the other side.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:30.009
The roof goes, actually, up, and then there's
the giant dropoff on the other side.

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:31.009
Yesterday, they cruised right through that.

00:08:31.009 --> 00:08:32.009
But today, we're going to get ourselves time
to get over there so we can have a really

00:08:32.009 --> 00:08:33.009
nice view.

00:08:33.009 --> 00:08:34.009
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: So here we are.

00:08:34.009 --> 00:08:36.560
And -- actually, it's kind of cool, because
I don't know if you guys can see me right

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.560
now.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.510
I'm now in a Hangout.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:42.219
Back on the other side, had a little bit of
issues keeping me in the Hangout.

00:08:42.219 --> 00:08:43.520
But here it's working nicely.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.830
And it's a -- I mean, I know they make it
look easy.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.690
But they're probably, what, 15 feet up there?

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:55.410
And they're going to just show us how they
get down off that big ramp.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:01.110
All right, guys.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:09.000
Let's see you go.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:17.810
&gt;&gt;&gt; Go, go, go!

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:29.550
&gt;&gt;&gt; They're hitting the drop.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:35.430
&gt;&gt;&gt; All right.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.372
See you down there.

00:09:38.372 --> 00:09:40.190
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: You can see that they're -- we've
got three, actually.

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.360
And it's a long way down.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.209
It's a long way down.

00:09:43.209 --> 00:09:49.490
I'm actually going to take off my Glass so
you can see this.

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:53.000
Okay.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:13.360
Now, hopefully, they've made it down safe
and sound.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:27.019
&gt;&gt;Sergey Brin: Thank you, all, for watching.

00:10:27.019 --> 00:10:33.620
I know we have a lot of interest.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:38.939
And we just wanted to show for the people
who just, you know, heard about it just yesterday,

00:10:38.939 --> 00:10:44.050
want to show you about something that it took
and actually show you some of that amazing

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.730
action again.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.410
All right.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:51.540
Well, we'll keep you abreast of our progress
on Glass.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:56.440
This is just one of the exciting things that
we've had the privilege of working on and

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.769
that -- I'm hoping this is going to lead to
something really exciting going forward.
