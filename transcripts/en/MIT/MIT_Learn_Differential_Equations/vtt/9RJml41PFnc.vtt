00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:01.130
GILBERT STRANG: OK.

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:04.700
This is the start of
Laplace transforms.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.980
And that's going to take
more than one short video.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.560
But I'll devote this video to
first order equations, where

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.790
the steps are easy
and pretty quick.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.590
Then will come second
order equations.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.520
So Laplace transforms
starting now.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.590
So let me tell you
what-- I use a capital

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.410
letter for the Laplace transform
of little f, a function of t.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.410
The transform is capital
F, a function of s.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.550
And you'll see where s comes in.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.490
Or if it's the solution
I'm looking at,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.490
y of t, its transform
is naturally

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.890
called capital Y of s.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.940
So that's what we want-- we
want to find y, and we know f.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.830
OK.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.320
So can I do an example?

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.770
Well, first tell you what
the Laplace transform is.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.980
Suppose the function is f of t.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.560
Here is the transform.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.930
I multiply by e to the minus
st, and I integrate from 0

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.080
to infinity.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.380
0 to infinity.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.730
Very important.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.060
The function doesn't
start until t equals 0,

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.380
but it goes on to
t equal infinity.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.810
I integrate, and
when I integrate,

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.230
t disappears but
s is still there.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.440
So I have a function of s.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.430
Well, I have to do an example.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.490
So to find the Laplace transform
is to do an integration.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.480
And you won't be surprised
that the good functions we know

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.670
are the ones where we
can do the integration

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.890
and discover the transform,
and make a little table

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.960
of nice transforms.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.820
And the number one function
we know is the exponential.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.480
So can I find--
for that function,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.190
I'll compute its transform.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.450
So what do I have to do?

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.300
I have to integrate
from 0 to infinity--

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.330
you might say 0 to
infinity is hard,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.570
but it's actually the
best-- of my function, which

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.045
is e to the at.

00:02:14.045 --> 00:02:21.330
So that's my function
times e to the minus st dt.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.830
OK.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.390
I can do that integral,
because those combine into e

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.420
to the a minus st. I
can put those together

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.750
into e to the a
minus st. I integrate

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:45.780
so I get e to the a minus
st divided by a minus s.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.830
That's the integral of that.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.680
Because what I have
in here is just that.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.980
To integrate the exponential,
I just divide by the exponent

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.060
there.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.770
And I have just substitute t
equal infinity and t equal 0.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.110
So t equal infinity,
starting at 0 to infinity.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.140
OK.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.400
Infinity is the nice one.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.790
It's the easy one.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.850
I will look only at s's
that are bigger than a.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:27.570
s larger than a means that this
exponential is decreasing to 0.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.940
It gets to 0 at
t equal infinity.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.180
So at t equal infinity, that
upper limit of the integral

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.720
ends up with a 0.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.510
So I just have to
subtract the lower limit.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.450
And look how nice.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.810
Now I put in t equal 0.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.850
Well, then that becomes 1.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.100
And it's a lower limit, so
it comes with a minus sign.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.120
So it's just the 1
over, the minus sign

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.240
will flip that s minus a.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.380
The most important Laplace
transform in the world.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.530
Remember, the function
was in to the at.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.420
The transform is
a function of s.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.400
The original function depended
on t and a parameter a.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.269
The result depends on
s and a parameter a.

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.950
And an engineer would say,
here we have the exponent.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.826
The growth rate is a.

00:04:28.826 --> 00:04:32.090
And over in the transform--
so this is the transform,

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.590
remember.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.620
This is the transform f of x.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.150
In the transform,
I see blow up--

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:49.580
a pole, that's called
a pole-- at s equal a.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.470
1/0 is a pole.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.620
And I'm not surprised.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.060
So the answer is
blowing up at s equal a.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.230
Well, of course.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:05.440
If s equals a, then this
is the integral of 1 from 0

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.470
to infinity, and it's infinite.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.760
So I'm not surprised to
see the pole showing up.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.510
The blow up showing up
exactly at the exponent a.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.270
But this is a nice transform.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.570
OK.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.520
I need to do one other-- oh, no.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.540
I could already
solve the equation.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.090
So let me start
with the equation dy

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:36.785
dt minus ay equal 0.

00:05:36.785 --> 00:05:40.350
Oh, well, I can take the
Laplace transform of 0

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.880
is 0, safe enough.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.290
The Laplace transform of
y is capital Y. But what's

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.170
the transform of this?

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.840
Oh, I have to do one
more transform for you.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.450
I'm hoping that the transform
of the derivative, dy dt,

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.660
connects to the transform of y.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:04.700
So the transform of this
guy is the integral from 0

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:10.320
to infinity of that function,
whatever it is, times e

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.480
to the minus st dt.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.880
This is the transform.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.320
So this Laplace transform.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.520
Now what can I do
with that integral?

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:29.910
This is a step that goes back
to the beginning of calculus.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.560
But it's easy to forget.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.490
When you see a derivative
there inside that integral,

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.850
you think, I could
integrate by parts.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.340
I could integrate
that term and take

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.030
the derivative of that term.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.170
That's what integration
by parts does.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.200
It moves the derivative
away from that and onto that

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.270
where it's no problem.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:59.440
And do you remember that a minus
sign comes in when I do this?

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.910
So I have the integral
from 0 to infinity of-- now

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:07.570
the derivative is coming off
of that, so that's just y of t.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.740
And the derivative
is going onto that,

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:15.170
so that's minus se
to the minus st dt.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.670
Good.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.340
And then do you remember
in integration by parts,

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:26.930
there's also another term
that comes from y times e

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.080
to the minus st?

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:37.250
This is ye to the minus
st at 0 and infinity.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.440
OK.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.520
I've integrated by parts.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.390
A very useful, powerful
thing, not just a trick.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.960
OK.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.570
Now, can I recognize
some of this?

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:53.590
That is minus minus, no problem.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.690
I bring out-- that
s is a constant.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.146
Bring it out, s.

00:07:58.146 --> 00:08:00.980
Now, what do I have left
when I bring out that s?

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.360
I have the integral of
ye to the minus st dt.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.830
That is exactly the
Laplace transform of y.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:16.370
It's exactly capital Y.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.030
Put the equal sign here.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:22.740
I'll make that 0 a little
smaller, get it out of the way.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.180
OK. sY of s.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.630
So that whole term
has a nice form.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:31.220
When you take the
derivative of a function,

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:35.230
you multiply its
Laplace transform by s.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.789
That's the rule.

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:38.820
Take the derivative
of the function,

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.909
multiply the Laplace
transform by s.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:44.550
If we have two derivatives,
we'll multiply by s twice.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:45.510
Easy.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.710
That's why the Laplace
transform works.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.220
But now, here is a final term.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:55.300
y at infinity-- well,
and e to the minus

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.500
st at t equal infinity, 0.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.600
Forget it.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:06.940
So I just have to subtract off
y at 0 times e to the minus st

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.310
at 0, which is 1.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:12.180
e to the 0 is 1.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.300
So do you see that
the initial condition

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.670
comes into the transform?

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:18.380
It's like, great.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:24.560
We have the transform of Y.
Now, all this is the transform.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:33.890
This is the transform
of dy dt that we found.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.740
Now, why did I want that?

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:39.390
Because I plan to
take the transform

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:42.910
of every term in my equation.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:47.480
So like there are two steps to
using the Laplace transform.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:53.370
One is to compute some
transforms like this one,

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:56.680
and some rules like this one.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.660
That's the preparation step.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.640
That comes from just
looking at these integrals.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:06.360
And then to use them, I'm
going to take the Laplace

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.600
transform of every term.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.300
So I have an equation.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.680
I take the Laplace
transform of every term.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.390
I've got another equation.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:23.440
So the Laplace transform of
this is sY of s minus y of 0.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.080
That was a Laplace
transform of this part.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.610
Now the Laplace transform
of this is minus a,

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.840
a constant, Y of x.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.250
And the Laplace
transform of 0 is 0.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.980
Do you realize what we've done?

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.470
I've taken a
differential equation

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.450
and I've produced
an algebra equation.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:47.620
That's the point of
the Laplace transform,

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:51.500
to turn differential
equations-- derivatives turn

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.740
into multiplications, algebra.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.810
So all the terms
turn into that one.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:02.110
And now comes-- so
that's big step one.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:03.690
Transform every term.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:07.000
Get an algebra
problem for each s.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.840
We've changed from t, time
in the differential equation,

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.110
to s in Laplace transform.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.340
Now solve this.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.770
So how am I going to solve that?

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:22.080
I'm going to put y of 0
on to the right-hand side.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.180
And then I have Y of
s times s minus a.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:34.615
So I will divide by s minus a.

00:11:34.615 --> 00:11:38.380
And that gives me Y of s.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.130
So that was easy to do.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.550
The algebra problem
was easy to solve.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.110
The differential
equation more serious.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.610
OK.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:48.699
The algebra problem is easy.

00:11:48.699 --> 00:11:49.365
Are we finished?

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:59.230
Got the answer, but we're in
the s variable, the s domain.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.920
I've got to get back
to-- so now this

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:10.340
is going to be an inverse
Laplace transform.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.190
That's the inverse transform.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:17.800
To give me back y
of t equals what?

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.090
How am I going to do
the inverse transform?

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:25.190
So now I have the
transform of the answer,

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:26.930
and I want the answer.

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:32.530
I have to invert that transform
and get out of s and back to t.

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:36.500
Well, y of 0 is a constant.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.080
Laplace transform is
linear, no problem.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.990
So have y of 0 from that.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:45.750
And now I have 1 over s minus a.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:51.130
So I'm asking myself, what is
the function whose transform is

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.430
1 over s minus a?

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.490
Then it's that function
that I want to put in there.

00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:00.260
And what is the function whose
transform is 1 over s minus a?

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.880
It's the one we did.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.320
It's this one up here.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:09.140
1 over s minus a came from
the function e to the at.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:13.840
So that 1 over s minus
a, when I transform back,

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.310
is the e to the at.

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.460
And I'm golden.

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:24.370
And that you recognize, of
course, as the correct answer,

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:29.460
correct solution to this
differential equation.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:36.170
The initial value y of 0
takes off with exponential e

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:36.800
to the at.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.210
No problem.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:39.390
OK.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:44.290
Can I do one more example
of a first order equation?

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:47.630
Now I'm going to
put it in an f of t.

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.770
I'm going to put
in a source term .

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:54.310
So I'll do all the
same stuff, but I'm

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.460
going to have an f of t.

00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:00.680
And what shall I take for-- I'll
take an exponential again, e

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.970
to the ct.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:06.660
So that's my right-hand side.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:13.740
Can I do the same
idea, the central idea?

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:19.280
Take my differential equation,
transform every term.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.810
I've started with
a time equation

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.190
and I'm going to
get an s equation.

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:29.470
So again, dy dt minus ay, that
transformed to-- what did that

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:30.890
transform to?

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:36.510
sY of s minus y of 0.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:37.880
Came from there.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.885
Minus aY of 0-- minus aY of s.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.650
Minus aY of s.

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:51.620
And on the right-hand side,
I have the transform of e

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.480
to the ct.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.650
We're getting good
at this transform.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:15:00.231
1 over s minus c,
instead of a at c.

00:15:00.231 --> 00:15:00.730
OK.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.820
That's our equation transform.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.080
Now algebra.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.860
I just pull Y of s out of that.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.560
How am I going to pull Y
of s out of this equation?

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.975
Well, I'll move y of
0 to the other side.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.250
And I'll divide by s minus a.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:22.710
Look at it.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:26.960
Y of s is-- OK.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:31.320
I have 1 over s minus c.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.170
And I have an s minus
a that I'm dividing by.

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:37.790
S minus a.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:43.310
And then I have the y
of 0 over s minus a.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:52.380
I've transformed the
differential equation

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.210
to an s equation.

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:58.160
I've just done simple algebra
to solve that equation.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.020
And I've got two terms.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.780
Two terms.

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:03.930
You see that term?

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:05.900
That's what I had before.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.650
That's what I had just there.

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:10.580
The inverse transform was this.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:11.550
No problem.

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:17.780
That's the null solution that's
coming out of the initial value

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:18.460
.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:24.180
The new term that's coming
from the e to the ct,

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:28.030
coming from the
force, is this one.

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:33.320
And I have to do its
inverse transform.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:38.020
I have to figure out what
function has that transform.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.890
And you may say,
that's completely new.

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:44.580
But we can connect it
to the one we know.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:45.080
OK.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:54.340
So that will give me the same
inverse transform, the growing

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.490
exponential.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:58.360
But what does this one give?

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.190
That's a key question.

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:07.200
We have to be able to do--
invert, figure out what

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.800
function has that transform?

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:14.810
The function will involve
a and c and t, the time.

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:21.260
And s, the transform variable,
will become t, the time period.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.170
So that's the big question.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:27.440
What do I do with this?

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.840
And notice, it has two poles.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:34.390
It blows up at s equal a,
and it blows up at s equal c.

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:43.020
And I have to figure out--
well, actually, by good luck,

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:46.030
I want to separate
those two poles.

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:47.540
Because if I separate
the two poles,

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.430
I know what to do with a blow up
at s equal a and a blow up at s

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:52.210
equal c.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:56.190
The problem is, right now I
have both blow ups at once.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:57.800
So I'm going to separate that.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.480
And that's called
partial fractions.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:05.150
So I will have to say more
about partial fractions.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.580
Right now, let me just do it.

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.860
That expression there,
I'll take this guy away.

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.330
Because it gives that
term that we know.

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.610
It's this one.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:21.910
Is that one.

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:25.420
It's this two poles
thing that I want

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.430
to separate those two poles.

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:30.450
So this is algebra again.

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.400
Partial fractions
is just algebra.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.900
No calculus.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.080
No derivatives are in here.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:42.190
I just want to write
that as 1 over s minus c.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.250
It turns out-- look.

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:47.020
There's a way to
remember the answer.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:19:00.730
s minus c times c minus
a and 1 over s minus a.

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:03.700
And now a minus c.

00:19:06.448 --> 00:19:11.070
Do you see that that has
only one pole at s equals c?

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:12.870
This is just a number.

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.260
This has one pole at s equals a.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.250
That's just a number.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:19.660
In fact, those numbers
are the opposite.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:24.150
So now, are we golden?

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:27.910
I can take the inverse
transform with just one pole.

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:35.050
So now that gives me the
solution y from-- so this

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:40.310
is just a constant,
1 over c minus a.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:44.720
And what is the inverse
transform of this?

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:49.230
That's the simple pole at c.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.805
It came from a pure
exponential, e to the ct.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:57.375
Right?

00:19:57.375 --> 00:20:01.070
And now this guy, this one.

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:01.970
OK.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:05.730
Well, this has a minus c, which
is the opposite of c minus a.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:10.410
So if I put a minus sign, I can
put them all over c minus a.

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:11.090
Look at that.

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:12.160
Look at this.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.280
C minus a is in both of these.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.570
Here it is with a plus sign.

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:24.390
And that transform came
from that function.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.550
Here it is with a minus sign.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:28.850
So I want a minus there.

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:34.180
And what function gave
me that transform?

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.780
e to the at, right?

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.040
That's the one we know.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:44.680
The unforgettable transform
of a simple exponential,

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.660
e to the at.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:53.360
That is the particular solution.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:21:01.440
So the Laplace transform, we
transformed the differential

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.980
equation.

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.900
We got an algebra equation.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.060
We solved that algebra
equation, and then we

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:15.240
had to go backwards to find what
function had this transform y.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.680
And to see that, clearly we had
to use this partial fraction

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.980
idea which separated these
two poles into one pole

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:29.430
there, when s is c, and
another pole, when s is a.

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:31.520
We've got two easy fractions.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:36.110
The easy fractions each
gave me an exponential.

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:38.970
And the final
result was this one.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.380
And I don't know if
you remember that.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:47.670
That is the correct solution
to the first order linear

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:51.100
constant coefficient
equation, the simple equation

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:56.070
there, when the right-hand
side is e to the ct.

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:59.480
So our final solution
then is the null solution

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.620
with the initial value in it.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:08.280
And that function comes from
the right-hand side, comes

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.500
from the force, e to the ct.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:16.210
And so that's how
Laplace transforms work.

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:19.490
Take the Laplace
transform of every term.

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:25.421
Solve for y of s, and try your
best to invert that transform.

00:22:25.421 --> 00:22:25.920
OK.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:30.830
More of that coming in the next
lecture on Laplace transforms.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:32.630
Thank you.
