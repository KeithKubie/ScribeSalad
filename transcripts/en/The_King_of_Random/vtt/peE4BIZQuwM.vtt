00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.710
Hey guys Grant Thompson (The King of Random) and welcome to my royal, round table

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.760
I was going to start off with a joke or some kind of a funny story, but in reality

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.909
I'm not really that funny of a guy so let's just skip that part [now]

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.289
I realize there are a lot of questions and comments about the way I do things that a lot of you have had for quite

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.999
A long time even though I do answer those questions in the comments sometimes most of you don't see them

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.909
So I'm going to do my best today to answer some of the most frequently asked questions

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.180
and if you have more then just post those comments in the description

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.849
And I'll do my best to answer those in the future now firstly

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.929
I have an announcement to make about CVX live I've been invited out to Orem,

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.329
Utah to appear for a [2-day] event and the reason that I said yes to go is because I want to meet you

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.839
So I just accepted this a couple of days ago, so it's kind of short notice

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.340
It's happening this month on March 25th and March 26. I'll be there on [Friday]

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.010
From 3 p.m. To 5 p.m.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.469
For a public meet and greet so come up say hi ask questions, shake hands take pictures

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.299
Whatever you want the point is I want to meet you now on Saturday Night March 26

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.870
I'm going to be on the stage

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.570
Premiering a video that no one has ever seen before so if you want to see a video that hasn't been launched yet

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.019
And won't be launched you know for quite a while, then come out and see that

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.470
I'm really just going to meet you and to be available and to hang out

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.610
I don't have much [of] an agenda

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.869
So come pick my brain and let's get to know each other a little bit better. Alright, now

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.289
Let's move on to some of the frequently asked questions. These are comments that I see popping up a lot

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.500
I see a lot of positive comments, and I love that

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.759
But I'm specifically gonna address some of the concerns that you have here

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.349
And I don't feel like any question is too taboo. You really have legitimate concerns about the way

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.750
I'm doing things. I probably have a reason for the way

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.290
I do it but I'm happy to talk about it with you one of the questions

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.169
I get asked a lot is why did you change the quick clip music?

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.589
I'm sick of this new song I like the old music and I want it back now

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.530
That's a really good question and the main reason is because I no longer have a license to use that music the company that produced

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.659
That track took it off their website and no longer offer copyright licensing on it

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.129
So I don't have the ability to use that track any longer the other reason is because for over a year

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.070
People were actually asking me to change the quick clip music

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.639
So I finally tracked down a new track developed a whole new series

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.600
and then made

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.480
Change only to find out that the other half of people didn't want it to [change] and so we've got that battle of emotions

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.369
So I just chose [to] stick with the new quick clip [music] and not change it rather than having a knee-Jerk reaction

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.080
Of bouncing all over the place. [I] may change the quick clip [music] again, but for the near future

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.010
That's the template [that] I'm using and I'm going to keep it that way [all] right. Here's a comment

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.109
That says please do more videos. Why don't you make videos more often do more videos?

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.880
I would love to I really would

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.019
Now here's the thing [I] work 8 to 12 hours a day six days a week for the last five years

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.450
Making the videos that I do and putting them out every five days actually stretches me to the Max

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.729
And that's the fastest I can physically

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.150
possibly put them out

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.510
Producing and editing these videos is actually really really

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.609
Time [consuming] and difficult and if you'd ever like to know what goes into making a video king of random style

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.999
[I'd] be happy to share that with you. If it would give you some insight and help give some perspective

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.939
Why it's so difficult and takes so long to make these videos. I experiment. [I] prototype and some videos

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.710
Have you know eight to ten prototypes before I even film them writing the script takes forever?

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.969
and there's a lot that goes into these videos that I can't even begin to tell [you] about and I am

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.649
Physically and mentally and emotionally giving it everything that I've got if I can make videos

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.119
Faster I would but this is the best that I can do and honestly I'm getting tired

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.170
I need to take a little break so for the next month you may not see any uploads from me

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.670
That doesn't mean I'm [going] [to] stop

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.900
I've still got videos [queued] up

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.040
And I've got a lot of projects filmed and I'm going to get back to working on but I just need to take a little

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.429
Breather why do you upload the same videos over and over again [now]?

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.150
This is a question

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.780
I've seen popping up from a few different people who may just not understand the bigger picture

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.309
So let me explain videos like the mini Master sword a year ago

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.149
[I] cast a prototype sword out of aluminum with the promise that one day

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.720
I would do a tutorial of the finished product and now I've just

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.980
Released the tutorial on how to make the finish master sword now in other videos

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.980
I often feature or cameo other

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.730
projects that I [asked] you to look for in future videos and so of course [that] leaves the

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.290
Condition that I need to make that future video and when I make it and post it

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.270
It's not read up loading a same project

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.700
It's a completely new video that fulfills a promise that I made earlier, [so] another question says didn't you do this already?

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.299
Why do you make so many videos of the same thing are you trying to milk the view?

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.639
And the YouTube money [are] you out [of] ideas?

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.109
That's a really good question and let me explain

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.150
Why I do things the way that I do now when I design my projects. I like them to have multiple purposes

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.139
I don't like to do one thing that you

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.688
Never use. I like it to be purposeful, and I like it to have multi purposes

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:41.319
There's a big picture in my videos where a lot of the projects are interconnected

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:45.309
And you need one [to] do another for example in my rockets you need an iGniter

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.870
So I have an iGniter tutorial

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.819
but the igniters relate to the rockets which relate to the remote-control launcher which relate to the

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:57.579
Rocket launch Pad all these are separate elements separate videos, but they're all completely related to each other

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.909
So if you're going to make something like I don't know a silicone

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:05.408
Lego gummy mold I'd love to be able to use that [to] maybe build something like

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.769
Chocolate Lego Mario which you're probably gonna see coming up in another video, and if you don't have access to food grade silicone

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.099
Maybe you can use some [kind] of rubber. You can make yourself

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:17.769
So you see all these tutorials are completely different

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.810
but they are related to each other you can think of certain videos almost like a series for example making the styro-slicer'

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.639
There's a tutorial on how to use it [a] tutorial on how to make it. There's also

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.710
tutorials on projects you can do with it like the master store the styrofoam handgun and

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:39.009
Foam fighter jets to name a few so all those projects are interrelated and they do reference each other which I could see looks like

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.379
Uploading the same content being out of [ideas]

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:44.739
but that's just part of one mini series inside of this whole

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.919
Massive realm of videos and I do tend to run in random phases and once I leave one phase

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:54.038
I move into another phase another viewer asks. Where do you get your ideas?

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:02.049
[an] idea is really come from everywhere sometimes I see things online sometimes my kids are doing things that inspire [me] reading books

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:10.088
Experiences, I had growing up sometimes I see things on pinterest that spur ideas and sometimes other youtubers are doing things that give me ideas

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:12.069
That I want to take and modify now

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:17.559
I have never uploaded a video in my recollection where I've just taken an idea and copied it everything [that] I do I

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:20.379
Experiment with it. I modify it I recreate it

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:25.718
I turn into something different, and I give it a king of random aspect so I am constantly inventing creating

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:30.549
Experimenting and doing things new but they're all based on something that inspired me

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.550
So look in the description of my videos, and you'll always find

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.120
inspired by and

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.570
Usually a link to the thing that inspired me

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.869
And if you want you can compare the two and see what differences you may see

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.080
another viewer asked the question are you [going] to run out of ideas and

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.060
The answer to that is no

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.049
I'm going to run out of motivation to produce videos before I run out of ideas

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:56.690
Because as long as I keep living life and being inspired by things that I see and want to try I'm going to keep [making]

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.610
Projects, I've been doing it for four years straight

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:59.990
[I] guess five years now

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.570
And I'm going to keep going as long as I can keep [making] videos

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:08.539
Getting burned out on production is probably going to kill me before I run out of ideas themselves, but the answer is no

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.799
I won't run out of ideas. What did you study in school to learn all this I'm basically self-taught

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:19.430
I put myself through the school of Grant thompson using the internet personal experience. You know the experience of people around me and

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:27.950
Just thinking things [through] before trying them. I have been studying non-stop for last 15 [years] after [I] got out of school, but in school

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.190
Itself I didn't really study anything in [particular]

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:35.209
What do you do for a living is this your official job, or do you have a side job well?

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.260
I did have a full-time job

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.420
I actually just put in my resignation today

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.199
And I don't really want to disclose what that profession was but it was I?

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.609
Would say it's relatively prestigious in its industry, and it was very difficult to achieve

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.539
I've got Eleven years with the company that I was just working with and

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.830
[Thirteen] years in the industry total but officially as of today

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:59.749
I am focusing fully on YouTube which I was basically doing before but I

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.899
Make videos. That's what I do right now grant

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.140
Why don't you use the metric system?

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:08.929
And that's a very good question I get asked this all the time now. The metric system is awesome. We all agree

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.060
I grew up in Canada using the metric system

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:16.760
So I understand it but down here in the united states everything in the stores are sold in imperial measurements

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.470
[so] when I do my tutorials

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:22.940
It doesn't really make sense to do them in metric now if you're having a hard time doing the conversions

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:27.529
Just use the google tool because google will give you the answer and make all those conversions very easy for you

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.989
Your kids show any interest in your projects

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.310
[I] am starting to see a glimmer of hope in my kids here, but to this point. They really couldn't care less

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:39.650
They're all pretty young and they haven't really cared too much about what's been going around them but they are just starting to get old

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:43.129
enough to appreciate the projects and the videos and that's exciting because

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:48.390
Now I can start spending more time with them getting our hands dirty together [how] many videos?

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:49.110
Do you have saved up?

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.710
I have over 10

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:56.309
project videos and quick clips ready to go that gives me a little bit of breathing room so I can still release on schedule and

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.299
Make new content, but those burn up pretty quickly right now

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.539
[I've] reduced my schedule for posting every week, so every Tuesday

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:07.020
But I would like to get back on a once every 5 day schedule if possible

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:11.400
I'm just looking for ways [to] still have a little bit of free time because I'd really don't take [vacations]

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.269
[I] don't have fun, and I need to have a little more fun. I miss the mine vendors

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:19.109
Are you bringing them back so the mindbender trivias were just an excuse to give away some cool stuff?

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:26.340
I would like to bring those back, but I just focused on project videos for now and getting those guns with no distractions

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:33.030
[so] I will probably bring back mine vendors and giveaways whenever I can fit it in so look forward to that

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.869
Hopefully that answers most if not all of your questions for now

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.859
I am doing the best I can and I've always done the best I can to give 110 [percent]

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:45.419
Into all of my videos my goal is to reach the best quality content based on my own

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.949
experiences and to be really true and genuine with all the information [that] I give you so

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.130
I hope you feel that

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:56.309
I've had a lot [of] discouraging comments pop up lately that have really brought [me] down and hurt my feelings and

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:01.319
Frankly made me feel like I just want to quit making videos altogether, but I have pushed through that now

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.150
I'm kind of back on top of things

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.939
[I] got a lot of fresh new projects that I can't wait to share with you

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.089
And I want you to be a part of my future [videos] as well

00:10:09.089 --> 00:10:13.889
I'm looking to engage with you back and forth a little more frequently and one of the best things you can do for me

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.640
Right [now] is to come out to CVx live and meet me in [person]. I need to know who you are

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:23.129
I need to know who my subscribers are to meet you face to face to shake your hand [and] to hear some of your experiences

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:24.420
watching my videos

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:30.360
That's the kind of feedback that I need so hopefully I can see you there CVX live March 25th March 26

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:36.060
Look at CVX live calm for the schedule of when I'll be there. I'll be there on Friday and Saturday

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.570
I'll put some links in the description

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:42.629
With a lot more information and remember the private [meet-and-greet] is going to be limited to about a hundred people

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.390
So if you want in on [that] make sure you get down and get your tickets quickly

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.229
[so] hopefully you got some kind of a value out of this video hopefully your question was answered and

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.740
Hopefully feel like we're able to connect a little more one-on-one [as] always

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:56.110
Thanks again for your support, and I'll see you in the next project video do them

00:11:20.019 --> 00:11:22.019
you
