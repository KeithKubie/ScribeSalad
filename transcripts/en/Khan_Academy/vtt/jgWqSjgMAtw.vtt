00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.499
 

00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.370
What we're going to
talk about in this video

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.070
is the idea of a fraction.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.270
And we'll see there's many
ways to think about a fraction.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.490
But first, we'll think
about the most fundamental.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.540
So let's say that
I have this square.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.397
And we can consider
this a whole.

00:00:17.397 --> 00:00:18.480
So let me write that down.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.030
This is a whole.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.390
It is a complete square.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.320
Now, what I'm going to do is
divide this into 4 equal parts.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.490
So with one cut like that, I've
divided it into 2 equal parts,

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.170
and then with another
cut like this,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.460
I could divide it
into 4 equal parts.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.872
So there are 4 equal parts.

00:00:40.872 --> 00:00:42.330
And now what I'm
going to do is I'm

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.880
going to select one
of those equal parts,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.240
so let's say this
part right over here.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.410
I am going to select that.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.380
So the question is, what
fraction of the whole

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.930
is the part that I
have shaded in red?

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.220
Well, it is 1 out of the
4 equal parts, right?

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.960
I've shaded in 1 out of
1, 2, 3, 4 equal parts.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.350
So we write this
as this fraction.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.670
This piece represents
1/4 of the whole.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.900
And there's two ways that
you can think about this.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.530
You could view this as
1 of the 4 equal parts,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.900
or you could view this
as a whole divided by 4

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.919
would get you exactly this much.

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:25.960
Now let's do another one.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.900
And this time, let's
think about how

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:37.670
we could represent 1
over 8, so 1 over 8.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.780
Well, we could divide
this whole, in this case,

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.230
the whole is this
rectangle-looking thing.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.920
We could divide the
whole into 8 equal parts.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.980
So let's do that.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.820
So here I've divided
into 2 equal parts.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.390
That looks pretty good.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.350
And now I can divide each
of those into 2 equal parts

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.730
to get me 4 equal parts.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.740
And then if I were to
divide each of those

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:06.180
into 2 equal parts, I
will have 8 equal parts.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.055
And it's not exact.

00:02:07.055 --> 00:02:08.430
Obviously, I've
drawn it by hand,

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.020
but hopefully this
gets you a sense.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.650
So now I have 8 equal parts.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.550
And now I'm going to
select exactly one of them.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.470
And that'll represent 1/8.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.030
And I could select
any one of these,

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.571
but I'll just do
this one to show you

00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:24.390
it does not have to be
necessarily the first one.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.650
So once again, this
square right over here

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.777
that I'm shading in red
represents 1/8 of the whole.

00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:34.360
Now, let's look at
a few more examples

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.880
where I've shaded
them in ahead of time.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.800
And what I want you to do
right now is pause the video,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.080
and either in your head
or a piece of paper

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.390
write down if you consider this
purple thing, the whole, what

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.430
fraction does this
red part represent?

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.660
If you consider this
blue part the whole,

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.260
what fraction does this
red part represent?

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.540
If you view this yellow
triangle as a whole,

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.110
what fraction does this
red part represent?

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.790
And so I encourage you
to pause the video now.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.580
Well, let's look
at each of these.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.470
So in this case,
for this rectangle,

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.070
we have 3 equal parts, and
we've shaded in one of them.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.700
So this red rectangle
right over here

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.941
represents 1/3 of the whole.

00:03:17.941 --> 00:03:18.440
Now,

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.140
Over here, in this kind
of pie-looking thing,

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.055
this circle-looking thing, we
have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 equal parts.

00:03:26.055 --> 00:03:28.660
 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.510
And we have shaded in 1
of those 5 equal parts.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.760
So this little slice of the
pie, this represents 1/5.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:45.260
This right over here is
1/5 of the entire pie.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.790
Now, this one's interesting.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.440
You might be tempted to
say, well, I've got 4 parts,

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.760
and then I've shaded in 1.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.760
That must represent 1/4.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.130
But remember, it needs
to be 4 equal parts.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.700
And it's pretty
clear looking at this

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.790
that this part right
over here is not

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.081
equal in size to this part right
over here or this part right

00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:05.580
over here.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.850
These are not 4 equal parts.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.230
So we cannot say that this
is 1/4 of the triangle.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.989
So you cannot say that.

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:14.489
