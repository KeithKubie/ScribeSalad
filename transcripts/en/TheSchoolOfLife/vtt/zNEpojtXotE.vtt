00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.580
People have always had trouble pronouncing his name;

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.400
if you don't speak German it's not at all obvious how you're supposed to say it.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.780
A safe bet is to start with a hard G on Ger- and end with a -ter: Ger-ter.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.000
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe has often been seen as one of Europe's big cultural heroes,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.180
comparable to the likes of Shakespeare, Dante, and Homer.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.420
During his life, Goethe's admirers were impressed by his literary works,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.680
but more than any of his books, what impressed people at the time,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.820
was how he lived his life, the kind of person he was.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.460
We can pick up some vital lessons from him:

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.020
1. Stop being so romantic

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.660
Goethe's first proper job after law school was as an assistant at a national tribunal

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.400
judging cases between the many minor German states that, at that time, made up the Holy Roman Empire.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.460
While he was working, Goethe fell in love with the fiance of one of his colleagues.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.600
He then committed a huge indiscretion and wrote up the love affair as an novel.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.380
He called it, "The Sorrows of Young Werther".

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.020
The central character, Werther, is a lightly disguised self-portrait.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.760
The book tells the story of how, Werther/Goethe falls in love with a young woman, Charlotte.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.840
It's a very detailed description of all the tiny steps one takes on the road to infatuation:

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.800
they danced together, at one point their feet accidentally touch under the table,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.060
they smile, they write each other flirtatious little notes;

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.220
it makes being in love seem like the most romantic experience in life;

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.740
Werther asks himself, "what is a life without romantic love? A magical lantern without a lamp".

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.320
This deeply charming novel was a best-seller across Europe for the next 25 years.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.060
Napoleon boasted he'd read it seven times.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.220
The story has a miserable ending:

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.580
Charlotte doesn't really love Werther and finally rejects him.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.740
In despair he kills himself.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.180
The tragic denouement shows Goethe beginning to see the limitations of the romantic view of life.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.240
Romantic love is deeply attractive but it causes us immense problems too.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.240
The core problem, as Goethe came to see it, is this:

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.160
romantic love hopes to freeze a beautiful moment;

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.380
it's a summer's evening after dinner; Werther is walking in the woods with his beloved;

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.960
he wants it to be always like this so he feels they should get married, have a house together, have children;

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.320
though, in reality marriage will be nothing at all like the lovely June night;

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.500
There'll be exhaustion, bills to pay, squabbles, and a sense of confinement.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.260
By comparison, with the extreme hopes of Romanticism, real love, as Goethe came to see,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.400
is always, necessarily, a terrible disappointment.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.360
That's why Goethe gradually moved away from romanticism towards an ideology of love he termed "classicism" :

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.580
marked by a degree of pessimism and acceptance of the troubles that afflict all couples over time,

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.560
and of the need to abandon some of the heady hopes of the early days for the sake of tranquility and administrative competence.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.640
Goethe was a critic of romantic ideology, not because he was cold-hearted or lacking in imagination,

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:06.020
but because he so deeply and intimately understood the attractions of romanticism and therefore its dangers.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.660
2. Get a real job

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.300
In April 1775, not long after his big success with Werther, Goethe got a job as a civil servant.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.160
Karl August, the Duke of Weimar, appointed him as his chief adviser

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
and senior administrator to help run his country.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.380
Goethe continued in this employment for most of the rest of his life.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.340
His main jobs was Minister for Roads and as the overseer of the state-owned silver mining operation.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.440
It can sound like a strange move for a very successful creative figure,

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.940
as if the winner of the Booker Prize became a civil servant;

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.420
we just assume that art and literature are at odds with an enthusiasm for government administration.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.260
But Goethe didn't see it that way;

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.240
he felt that understanding administration would help him put big ideas into practice.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.740
Later in his life, instead of writing about how good it would be to have a national theater,

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.740
he was able to establish one,

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.680
and instead of just saying that cities should have green spaces,

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.800
he was able to rev up the governmental machinery into action and actually create a model urban park.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.040
3. Travel as therapy

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.480
In September 1786, after 10 years in the Weimar civil service, when his 40th birthday was coming into view,

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.400
Goethe got fed up with Germany: the cold, the bad food, and this was key for him, the lack of sex.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.580
So he went to Rome with a very classical idea of the point of travel:

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.720
the outer journey was intended to support an inner journey towards maturity.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.660
He felt that there were parts of himself that could only be discovered in Italy.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.100
But, like many visitors to Rome, when he got there he felt a bit disappointed.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.760
In the famous book of poems he later wrote about his experience, the Roman Elegies;

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.700
he describes how the great city seemed to be filled with lifeless ruins

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.540
that were famous but didn't actually mean anything to him;

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.240
"Speak to me, you stones!", he pleads.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.040
It's a feeling many later visitors have had.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.540
Goethe realized that what he needed was not a more elaborate guidebook,

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.860
but the right person to have an affair with;

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.020
someone who would embody the spirit of the place he was in.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.960
In his poems he describes the woman he meets, whom he calls Faustina.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.140
They spend lazy afternoons in bed.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.580
She's not a great intellectual, but she breathes the spirit of Rome;

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.240
she tells him about her life, about the building she passes on her way to the market, the Pantheon,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.420
a Baroque church designed by Bernini, which she hadn't even realized were famous;

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.620
they were just the buildings that happened to be around when she was getting the milk and the aubergines.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:37.460
For Goethe, the point of travel isn't relaxation or just taking a break from routine, he had a bigger goal in mind;

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:44.720
the aim of travel is to go to a place where we can find a missing ingredient of our own maturity.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.720
4. Living Life to the Fullest

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.580
One of the most striking things about Goethe is how much he did,

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.760
how broad his horizons were, and how wide his interest came to be;

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.580
He explored this particularly through his most famous work, Faust.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.840
Goethe worked on Faust all his life;

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.360
the earliest sketches go back to his teens

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.240
and he only decided he was done with it when he was in his early eighties.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.980
Faust comes in two parts and together the performance takes about 13 hours.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.260
Goethe himself never saw the whole thing and few people have ever since.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.540
Faust is a medieval academic and scholar, he's very learned, but he doesn't do very much.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.360
He's unfulfilled in love, he hasn't made any money, and he has no power.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.820
His knowledge is sterile, his life feels pointless, and he wishes he could die.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.500
But then he is visited by a devil, called Mephistopheles,

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.080
who offers him boundless energy, good looks, and the ability to do whatever he wants.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.880
The question is: what will Faust want to do?

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.860
The first danger for Faust is to just stay an academic who resists worldly impact;

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:51.980
with the Devil's help he could be the ultimate bookworm; he could get his hands on the oldest rarest manuscripts.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.900
But Faust gets weary of words and longs for action.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.900
Now the second danger is that he will use his new powers to gratify every sensual appetite;

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.020
he might become just a pure hedonist.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:09.060
Faust goes some way down this path; he goes to a bar and gets everyone very drunk, he goes to huge orgy,

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:15.480
but then he realizes that what he really seeks is beauty and love, and this leads him on from sex and alcohol.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:20.200
The third danger is that Faust will become a confident, but shallow political leader;

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.220
but in a second part of the play, Faust pursues a grander purpose:

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:29.500
eventually he organizes the development of a new country, somewhat reminiscent of the Dutch Republic,

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.680
which at that time was the most enlightened and successful society in the world.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.380
Faust is a morality tale for all of us;

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.940
he shows us both the pitfalls of life and how we might avoid them.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.280
Faust knows a great deal, but he resists being an academic;

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.140
he love sex, but he doesn't give way to debauchery;

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.040
he likes power but he doesn't use it for megalomania;

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.920
he puts it to work in the service of noble ends.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.820
Faust's career path is not unlike Goethe's.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:59.220
Faust is essentially tracing for us a theory of how to live a full life:

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.380
he's very interested in ideas, but not a scholar;

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.920
he visits Italy, but he doesn't stay there;

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.240
he goes back to work: he tries out administration and learns how to wield power,

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.560
but once he's mastered this side of himself he moves on.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.620
The Faustian idea is that in order to develop fully,

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:21.180
we have to flirt with things that are quite dangerous, but hold on to a sense of higher purpose.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.060
5. Science for Artsy People

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:28.200
Goethe was the last European to do a certain kind of remarkable things:

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:33.280
to write great novels and plays, and also to play a significant role in science.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.420
His interest ranged through geology, meteorology, physiology, and chemistry,

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.420
and his most important work was in botany.

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:43.400
In 1790 he produced a study: The Metamorphosis of Plants,

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:48.620
and a book on optics and color, called The Theory of Colors, was published in 1810.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:54.900
Thereafter this combination of very significant work in the arts and in the sciences disappears from the European civilization.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.000
Goethe gives us some guidance as to why this has happened.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.740
He's a hero for people of a more literary and artistic sensibility,

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.280
who are attracted from a distance to the broad subject matter of science,

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.620
but who find the details a bit less appealing.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:12.620
Goethe liked science that you can do yourself, by looking carefully at the world around you;

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:17.160
for example, he did a lot of his research on plants in his own back garden in Weimar,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.820
he did a lot of his research on optics with candles and colored pieces of paper in his study;

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:26.280
he liked the training this gave in asking oneself, "what do I actually see?"

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:32.280
Goethe was very interested in the psychological aspect of our relationship to the sorts of things that science investigates:

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.600
plants, light, stones;

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.260
rather than exclude the issues of personal meaning,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.900
Goethe sees these essential to the proper and full investigation of nature.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.880
Goethe was worried by the direction that science was taking,

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.200
which he particularly associated with the work of Isaac Newton.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.300
As Goethe saw it, the academic professional scientist

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.380
wasn't interested in a personal meaning of the things they were investigating,

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.600
and thereby helped to kill the subject.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.540
As he aged, Goethe kept on working, and he kept on seeking love and sex;

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:07.260
in his seventies, he fell in love with a woman called Ulkrike; his passion was unrequited.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.360
He died at his house in Weimar in 1832, aged 83.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.160
We have so much to learn from him;

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.100
we don't often hear people declaring a wish to be a little more like Goethe,

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:22.920
but if we did, the world would definitely be a more vibrant and humane place.
