there are things that should have been
 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.450
there are things that should have been
done years ago everywhere and every one

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460
done years ago everywhere and every one
 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.890
done years ago everywhere and every one
of those things is a fight that hasn't

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900
of those things is a fight that hasn't
 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.690
of those things is a fight that hasn't

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729
were vacuumed are parallel to one
 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.240
were vacuumed are parallel to one
another and the and the furniture is

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250
another and the and the furniture is
 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.580
another and the and the furniture is
covered with plastic and you get a glass

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
covered with plastic and you get a glass
 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.109
covered with plastic and you get a glass
of water and then just as you're going

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119
of water and then just as you're going
 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.609
of water and then just as you're going
to set it down on the coffee table

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619
to set it down on the coffee table
 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.139
to set it down on the coffee table
the person rushes over and puts a

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.490
coaster underneath it and everything in
that house says to you that it would be

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500
that house says to you that it would be
 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.620
that house says to you that it would be
a lot more perfect in that house if you

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
a lot more perfect in that house if you

whole house is blasting at you and if
 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.780
whole house is blasting at you and if
you happen to live there then you're

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790
you happen to live there then you're
 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.999
you happen to live there then you're
going to be sick and what you're going

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009
going to be sick and what you're going
 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.999
going to be sick and what you're going
to be sick from is too much order and in

to be sick from is too much order and in
 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.229
to be sick from is too much order and in
the other house you're going to be sick

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239
the other house you're going to be sick
 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.980
the other house you're going to be sick
from too much chaos

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990
from too much chaos
 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.400
from too much chaos
and so when you interact with a house

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410
and so when you interact with a house
 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.470
and so when you interact with a house
the unexplored parts are the chaos that

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480
the unexplored parts are the chaos that
 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.240
the unexplored parts are the chaos that
have that parts that you have not yet

have that parts that you have not yet
 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.210
have that parts that you have not yet
contended with are the chaos that has

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220
contended with are the chaos that has
 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.220
contended with are the chaos that has
not yet been transformed by your
