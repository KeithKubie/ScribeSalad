[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.014 --> 00:00:09.430
CAMILLE GENNAIO:
Michael Tisserand

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.970
is a New Orleans-based
author, whose most recent book

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.890
that we're going to talk
about today is called "Krazy."

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.194
It's the George Hammerman--

00:00:17.194 --> 00:00:18.360
MICHAEL TISSERAND: Herriman.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.970
CAMILLE GENNAIO: "--Herriman:
a Life in Black and White"

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.960
is the title of the book.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.270
This book was one of
"The New York Times"

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.050
100 most notable books of 2017.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.240
And today, we're going to
learn a lot about Krazy Kat,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.040
about George Herriman, and of
course, about Michael's journey

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.310
to get to writing this book.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.940
And Michael's previous books,
"The Kingdom of Zydeco"

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.870
and "Sugarcane Academy" are
also well-renowned and amazing

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.064
reads.

00:00:48.064 --> 00:00:49.480
Over the past
couple of weeks I've

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.700
had the chance to learn
quite a bit about Michael,

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.970
about George, and
about Krazy Kat

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.901
just through some amazing and
very easy YouTube and Google

00:00:56.901 --> 00:00:57.400
searching.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.160
So I use our own tools.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.890
And we are thrilled to have him
here today to present to us.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.830
For those of you listening
on the live stream, please--

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.290
I'm sure that questions
will come up during the talk

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.860
as we learn more about the work.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.860
So please go to
the Krazy Kat Dory.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.120
It's gokrazykat-dory
to add your questions.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.430
We will have a Q&amp;A portion
at the end of the talk.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.007
And with that, I welcome
Michael to the stage.

00:01:21.007 --> 00:01:22.590
MICHAEL TISSERAND:
Thank you, Camille.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.330
CAMILLE GENNAIO: Thank you.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.562
MICHAEL TISSERAND: Thank you.

00:01:24.562 --> 00:01:27.240
We're going to be spending
some much needed time

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.790
with the funny pages today.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.540
I'm going to be showing
a lot of comics,

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.120
including a lot of
comics from the--

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.660
some from the late
1800s and early 1900s.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.440
And it's worth noting right now
that the roots of comic strips

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.320
and the roots of vaudeville
and minstrel shows

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.480
are one and the same.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.010
So some of the comics,
just to let people know,

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.590
are going to reflect some of
the ethnic stereotypes that

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.830
were on stage at minstrel
shows and on the page

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.550
in American newspapers,
and still exist now,

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.540
but submerged in
characters, like Cat

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.440
in the Hat, and Mickey
Mouse, and Krazy Kat.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.747
So some of them are
unpleasant-- a couple of them

00:02:03.747 --> 00:02:04.830
are unpleasant to look at.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.010
We'll talk about those.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.940
And I hope you'll see why
I'm choosing to show them

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.270
as part of this presentation
of George Herriman, who I think

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.180
is one of our most
amazing artists

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.500
that we've been lucky
enough to produce.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.910
And I think speaks so clearly
and wonderful to our time now.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.110
But that's the main course.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.609
And before I get
to the main course,

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.650
I want to start with a
little amused-bouche.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.680
So here's a comic from
the prohibition era.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.810
And you'll see why I'm
showing this particular one.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.000
Here's a Krazy Kat comic
strip-- a daily comic.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.490
Three panels from about 100
years ago during prohibition.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.500
There was no need to
explain to the readers

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.020
why they were going down
to those private cellars

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.740
at the time.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.400
This is Ignatz Mouse.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.160
"Ah-h-h, nobody about.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.690
I'm safe." says Ignatz.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.330
And here comes Krazy
Kat on the next cellar.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.880
"Nobody about.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.630
I'm safe." says Krazy Kat.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.820
And then they close the doors.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.350
And again, remember 100
years ago, there they are.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.570
So there's saying-- and this
is not altered for the audience

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:05.070
here.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.820
This was the comic
100 years ago.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.350
They're down there gulping down
their moonshine with a google,

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.260
google, google.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.710
So this might be the first
Google Doodle, I'm thinking.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.630
So that's Krazy Kat
from 100 years ago.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.450
And now we're going to talk
about the birth of the Krazy,

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.570
or how this character came to
be-- how George Herriman came

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.420
to invent this most
amazing, groundbreaking,

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.760
and still, I think,
revolutionary comic strip

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.780
character.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.610
So if you were a comics reader
from 1913 to 1944 opening up

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.840
a comics page, it might
look something like this.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.290
And if you turned
to Krazy Kat you

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.210
might start to read
a daily strip that

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.490
goes something like this.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.040
"I just found out
something, Ignatz."

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.700
"What?"

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.220
says Ignatz the mouse.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.870
"I ain't a Kat."

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.150
"No."

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.190
"And I ain't Krazy."

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.320
"Well, what are you?"

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.910
says Ignatz.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.690
"It's what's behind me
that I am," says Krazy.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.830
"And what is behind you
besides your tail, fool?"

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.220
says Ignatz.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.710
"It's the idea behind
me, Ignatz, the idea.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.622
And that's what I am."

00:04:12.622 --> 00:04:16.079
"Ahh, and that's not
all," says Ignatz.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.170
"There is also a brick
behind you, sipp."

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.519
And then the brick collides
with a zip and a peen

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.660
on the top of Krazy's head.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.510
So this is a strange
strip for readers

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.030
to be turning to in the
1920s, and a lot of them

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.400
were confused and
puzzled by it and puzzled

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.020
by these characters.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.355
Krazy Kat, Ignatz
Mouse, and there

00:04:34.355 --> 00:04:35.730
are a number of
other characters,

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.770
but we'll just mostly
talk about Krazy, Ignatz,

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.280
and Offissa Pupp.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.040
So first, Ignatz.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.500
Ignatz the Mouse, again,
lived on newspaper pages

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.880
from 1913 to 1944, is obsessed
with one thing and one thing

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.940
only, and that is
throwing a brick

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.970
and striking Krazy Kat on
the skull with it there.

00:04:56.954 --> 00:04:59.120
Ignatz is an artist at brick
throwing-- never throws

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.340
the same brick twice.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.130
It also sounds very
different sometimes.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.980
This is a very, very early
appearance of the word

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.890
jazz in American newspapers.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.490
When Krazy is hit by
the brick, Krazy Kat

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.000
interprets it as a sign of love.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.210
Interspecies masochism in
the newspapers in 19-teens,

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.830
and '20s, and '30s.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.940
Krazy is convinced that
every brick is a love letter.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.910
And there's Krazy
after the brick toss.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.860
"My dish of romance is full, and
I'm a happy, happy, happy Kat."

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.460
And Ignatz stalks away,
"Krazy as a Koot."

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.650
The third character
here is Offissa Pupp.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.700
Offissa Pupp is as obsessed with
stopping the brick as Ignatz

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.020
is with throwing the brick.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.600
So there's Offissa
Pupp searching around

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.380
for the brick in the forest
while a little submarine is

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.620
looking for him there.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.720
Offissa Pupp lecturing
Ignatz, "Wasting your time

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.290
being evil, wicked, sinful,
and full of skallawagness--

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.940
tossing bricks at that dear Kat.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.320
Don't your shame trouble you?

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.150
Don't your sin haunt you?"

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.250
And there is Offissa
Pupp's stated purpose,

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.660
is to have Ignatz in this
beautiful, beautiful panel,

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.790
safely in the
Coconino county jail,

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.690
with that great George Herriman
potato chip moon up in the sky

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:17.620
there.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.900
But Offissa Pupp has his
own little secret, as well.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.330
Offissa Pupp harbors his
own love for Krazy Kat.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.190
Which we only see once in a
while, such as in this Pupp

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.486
fantasy.

00:06:30.486 --> 00:06:32.360
And the fourth character
I should mention too

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.560
is George Herriman himself.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.740
Here, getting lectured
by Ignatz for having not

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.330
drawn a brick yet.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.840
Here, being begged by Krazy Kat
for a bottle of ink with a pen.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.810
Herriman is very much a
presence in his own strip.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.440
So with those characters
from 1913 to 1944,

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.210
Krazy Kat appeared in
newspapers around the country,

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:56.530
mostly with King Features and
William Hearst newspapers.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.200
And it garnered a lot of
incredibly notable fans.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.460
T.S. Eliot was a fan.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.380
Langston Hughes
once heard of blues,

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.140
and thought it was as
funny as Krazy Kat.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.230
E.B. White said that
Herriman's creation possessed

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.340
a bit of the big soul.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.470
And probably the biggest
and most influential

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.840
fan was E.E. Cummings, the poet.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.780
And when I read E.E. Cummings'
letters about Krazy Kat,

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:21.430
you can see Cummings'
impersonation of Krazy Kat

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:22.060
on the page--

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.580
Cummings' own poetic
voice start to emerge.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.920
And when George Herriman
died in 1944, E.E.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.140
Cummings contacted his
publisher and said--

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.447
keep in mind, there was no
way to see these strips.

00:07:31.447 --> 00:07:33.280
The papers were all
yellowing and crumbling.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.460
And said, this
comic must not die.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:41.380
And created the first book
anthology of Krazy Kat comics.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.210
That was seen by a
young man coming home

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.370
from military service
named Charles Schulz,

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.890
and forever changed the way
Charles Schulz would view

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.990
comics, later saying,
"I always thought

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.630
if I could do just something
as good as Krazy Kat,

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:53.380
I would be happy."

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.504
And there's a drawing from
Charles Schulz, himself,

00:07:55.504 --> 00:07:59.450
of Ignatz clobbering
poor Charlie Brown.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.330
Theodor Geisel, or
Dr. Seuss, actually

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.870
read Krazy Kat when he
was a child growing up,

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.480
and later said, "I'd much rather
spend any evening of any day

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.150
rereading the beautiful, insane
sanities of George Herriman's

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.400
Krazy Kat, than to sit myself
down at some opera house

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.090
to hear some smiling Irish
tenor murdering Pagliacci,"

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:17.080
says Doctor Seuss.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.070
There's a Cat in
the Hat-like drawing

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.250
by Herriman of Krazy Kat.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:26.010
However, despite fans
like this-- and members

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:27.870
the Algonquin Table
were also fans.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:29.580
And there were
articles about Herriman

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.809
being a genius of the comics
page in "Esquire" magazine,

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:35.250
and "Vanity Fair",
and other magazines.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:39.330
But often, readers would open
up a panel like that "It's

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.320
the idea behind me" panel
I showed earlier and not

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.650
know what's going on.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.850
And when newspapers would
run popularity polls,

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:51.992
Krazy Kat would more
than likely show up

00:08:51.992 --> 00:08:53.700
at the very bottom of
the poll, and often

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.950
be dropped by the newspaper.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.500
Often, readers opening
up the funny pages

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.570
did not want to
sit and contemplate

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:05.070
on the blissful mysteries of
the soul's sublime passion.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.970
Or encounter a panel like this
in which Krazy Kat goes out

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.460
into Coconino county,
which is Herriman's

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:15.050
version of northern Arizona
and Monument Valley area.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:17.750
"And look with Krazy and
meditate upon every tic

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.570
a birth, every tok a
death, and wiza woiza.

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:23.540
Every tic a second, every
tok a million years.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.690
Every tic a nothing,
every toc a something.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.220
And wiza woiza."

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.110
So not every reader
wanted to contemplate

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.200
being nothing in this time
and eternity when they

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.882
are opening up the funny pages.

00:09:34.882 --> 00:09:36.590
Or even make their
way through a sentence

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:38.000
like, "If I had widda
to go at, then would I

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.620
go widda-- but widda I go
widda, or widda I go not widda.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.170
I still would not know if I went
widda or not-- so why go widda

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:42.860
when one can go wince?"

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.990
was not what every
reader wanted to do.

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:46.440
Or come across a
panel that says,

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.859
language is so we can
misunderstand each other.

00:09:48.859 --> 00:09:50.900
And Herriman presented
these with no explanation.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.780
What's he up to?

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:57.590
Or when Krazy Kat would
walk into a beauty salon,

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:02.490
and walk out again having
changed color completely.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.780
And now Ignatz is for
some reason in love

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.120
with the lighter
shade of Krazy Kat.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.390
Again, presented
with no explanation.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:11.480
Or this daily strip--

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.669
Krazy Kat looking at the
mirror, "Not so nice."

00:10:13.669 --> 00:10:14.210
"What isn't?"

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.312
says Ignatz.

00:10:16.312 --> 00:10:18.270
"Golla, why din't you
tell me?" says Krazy Kat,

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:19.436
still looking at the mirror.

00:10:19.436 --> 00:10:21.630
"Tell you what?" says Ignatz.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.860
"That I had an inferiority
complexion," says Krazy Kat.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.687
And then the brick comes.

00:10:27.687 --> 00:10:29.770
By the way, if you look
at the date on the bottom,

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:32.352
this strip happened to
appear on August 20th, which

00:10:32.352 --> 00:10:33.310
is Herriman's birthday.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.760
But what readers really
went crazy about, even more

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.349
than that--

00:10:39.349 --> 00:10:40.890
and I note, they
complained about it.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.800
There were letters to
newspapers about it,

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.300
there were columnists
in newspapers

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.830
that complained about it--

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.440
is that Krazy was a
non-binary character.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:54.460
Krazy was both male and female,
or something else entirely.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.280
The pronouns switched
back and forth

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.440
feverishly when
dealing with Krazy Kat.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.050
In fact, in my book,
I was very careful not

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.030
to use a single pronoun
to describe Krazy,

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.342
because Krazy is
neither male nor female.

00:11:05.342 --> 00:11:06.550
And that's part of the strip.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:08.250
Here says Ignatz,
"I notice, Krazy,

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:11.580
that sometimes you are a Miss,
then again, you are a Mr."

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.320
"Yes, Ignatz so I am."

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.990
Here's Krazy shouting, "Hooray
for the sista hood of man.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:19.380
Hooray for the fraternity
of woman's kind.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:19.880
Horray."

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.520
And here's a longer comic
that's talked about by a writer

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.000
that I really admire
and learned a lot from,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.250
named Gabrielle Bellot,
who is, herself,

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.130
mixed race and transgender,
and writes very personally

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.177
about Krazy Kat in an
essay for "The New Yorker"

00:11:34.177 --> 00:11:36.385
that you can find on my
website, michaeltisserand.com

00:11:36.385 --> 00:11:39.036
or you can google her and
find it really quickly.

00:11:39.036 --> 00:11:40.410
I think she's a
tremendous writer

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:42.600
and she talks about this strip.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.440
The owl shows up.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.590
[KNOCKING]

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.590
"Sir, seeing you here,
I take it the lady

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:47.700
of the house is not in."

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.890
"Ah, but she is," says
Krazy and slams the door.

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:50.390
[KNOCKING]

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:52.607
And the owl says, "Lady,
seeing that you're here,

00:11:52.607 --> 00:11:54.690
I take it the gentleman
of the house is not home."

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:57.870
And Krazy says, "Oh, but
he is," and slams the door.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:58.480
"Ah, sly one.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.540
You say the lady
of the house is in

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.237
and the gentleman
of the house is in,

00:12:02.237 --> 00:12:03.570
then I take it they are both in.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:04.069
Yes?"

00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:06.450
And Krazy says, "No, they
ain't," and slams the door

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:07.700
again.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.740
"So to the winds with
delicacy and slickness,

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.450
I'm going to get
rough," says the owl.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:13.530
"Who is anyway?"

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:14.310
says the owl.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:15.325
"Who is here?"

00:12:15.325 --> 00:12:19.980
And Krazy says, "Me," that
great, simple, liberating

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.040
answer, "Me."

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.240
So who is Krazy?

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.050
Who is this Me?

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:25.670
What is the idea behind Krazy?

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:26.910
In one of these--

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:29.489
again, I'm moving
fairly quickly over it,

00:12:29.489 --> 00:12:32.030
but I recommend you go spend a
lot of time with these strips.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:35.030
Because as you can
see, George Herriman

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:38.650
had an open canvas on the comics
page to do with what he wanted.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:40.280
It was not a matter
of filling out

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.000
four panels or eight panels.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.940
He could create
the story visually

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.180
that he wanted to every
time he sat down to work,

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.210
such as this story about
the origins of Krazy

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:53.240
Kat in which Joe Stork
on the enchanted mesa

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:59.270
is telling Krazy Kat how Krazy
was dropped into a wash basin

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:02.330
in a haunted house
in the basement.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:06.960
And Herriman describes the story
of Krazy's origins like this--

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.260
that Joe Stork is
telling Krazy Kat a tale

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.750
which must never be told,
and yet which everyone knows.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:20.520
So what is that tale?

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.650
Who is Krazy Kat?

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:24.780
And for me, the
answer was trying

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:29.210
to find out more about
who is George Herriman.

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:32.350
So

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:34.559
So when I started working
on this, a couple of things

00:13:34.559 --> 00:13:35.933
were known about
George Herriman.

00:13:35.933 --> 00:13:37.520
There were photographs of him.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.180
This is George Herriman
as a young man in his 40s,

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:45.650
and then shortly
before he died in 1944.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.390
And this is the one thing that
had been found out about him.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.930
So his nickname was
George The Greek.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.330
And a friend of his said in
the early 1900s, none of us

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.000
knew what he was, so we
called him The Greek.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.130
And that became his
nickname, The Greek.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.680
And then in the early 1970s,
this birth certificate

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.200
was located from New
Orleans City Hall, which

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.070
stated George J. Herriman,
and in parentheses colored,

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.130
close parentheses.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:12.400
This was rejected by some people
who assumed that he was Greek.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.480
It was actually-- they
were very fair to not trust

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.940
a document coming out of
New Orleans City Hall.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.900
However, it was also
embraced by many people,

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.600
including Ishmael
Reed, the novelist,

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.150
who dedicated his
novel "Mumbo Jumbo"

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:28.480
in part to George
Herriman, Afro-American

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.610
who created Krazy Kat.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:33.950
So I set out to try to find
out more about this Herriman

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:34.480
family.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.971
And it took me into Herriman's
neighborhood of Tremé.

00:14:37.971 --> 00:14:40.220
And just incidentally, for
those of you who know Tremé

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:44.990
as the David Simon HBO
series, this is John Boutté,

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:47.650
who sings the theme song
to that show, "Treme"

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:51.130
who is a cousin of
George Herriman's.

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.110
Here's the church,
St. Augustine,

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.690
in Tremé that the Herriman
family worshiped and where

00:14:55.690 --> 00:15:00.390
young George Herriman attended
baptisms and conformations.

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:02.430
But what really
surprised me most of all

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:05.790
was to find out how ferociously
political that time was,

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:08.850
and how in the center
of that political time

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.460
the Herriman family
were positioned.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:15.390
This was the center of free
black activism for voting

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:16.590
rights during this time.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:19.020
Here was a petition
hand-delivered

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.350
to Abraham Lincoln by friends
of the Herriman family

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:23.587
demanding voting rights.

00:15:23.587 --> 00:15:25.170
And you see in that
third name there--

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:27.470
that's George Herriman's
father who signed it.

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:29.070
Herriman's father
and grandfather

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.230
both signed this petition.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.270
Another family
friend had started

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:36.120
the first black owned daily
newspaper in the United States,

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.220
"The New Orleans Tribune".

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:43.020
Here is a announcement for
an integrated Masonic lodge

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:44.960
that, again, Herriman's
father and grandfather

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.700
were both part of.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.450
The Herriman and Son
Tailor Shop on Royal Street

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.370
in the French
Quarter was not only

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.170
a place to get fine
fabrics, it was also

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.120
a place to get tickets
for political rallies

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.020
and demonstrations.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.820
"The New Orleans Tribune"
was located right

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.280
around the corner.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:05.150
One of the efforts made at that
time was to integrate schools.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:08.300
After some gains were made
during Reconstruction,

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.120
during Jim Crow, those gains
were lost in New Orleans.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.790
And it seems to me that that's
why George Herriman's father

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:20.630
gathered up his family
and moved to Los Angeles

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:23.540
when George Herriman
was nine years old.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:26.360
From that point on,
we see the Herrimans

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:31.580
in every document and every
census report identifying

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:34.200
as white or racially passing.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.030
The Herrimans go to
St. Vincent's College.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.530
There's the first
photograph we have

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:42.200
of George Herriman on a field
trip for St. Vincent's College.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.590
When he's 16 he starts
working at the "Los Angeles

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:51.140
Herald" as an office boy.

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.810
And he started to do cartoons,
such as, "The Convention

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:56.240
As The Office Boy Saw It."

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.190
Or this panel on
the classified ads

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:03.400
in which he also created
his very first black cat.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.510
At the age of 20 he
ambitiously hopped a train--

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:09.760
we don't know if he
bought a ticket or not--

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.960
to Coney Island.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.670
And he lived in a
boarding house who

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.829
was owned by a man
named Jones, who

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:19.329
had a shooting gallery
around the back.

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:23.230
And Herriman started beating
the trail for Newspaper Row,

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.589
knocking on the door of William
Hearst, for whom he wrote

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:31.439
his first cartoon for the Hearst
newspapers at the age of 21

00:17:31.439 --> 00:17:32.980
called, "Maybe You
Don't Believe It,"

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.620
where he rewrote
Aesop's fables to give

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:38.640
the fable a happy ending.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.540
Hearst fired him.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.330
He was told he did not have
a spark for cartooning.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:45.870
And he walked down the street
and met with Joseph Pulitzer,

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.510
and started creating more
characters, such as "The Two

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:49.530
Jolly Jackies--

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:53.850
Two Sailors on Perennial Shore
Leave," or Major Ozone's Fresh

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:54.700
Air Crusade.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.550
Again, Herriman was
about 21, 22 when

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.230
he created these characters.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:59.940
Major Ozone does
anything and goes

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:04.170
anywhere to find fresh air.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:06.140
Bud Smith, the boy who
does tricks-- and you

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:10.910
also see a black cat creeping
around the corner there,

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:14.300
which shows up again and
again in his cartoons.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.900
And then this most amazing,
disturbing, sad, and revelatory

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.780
strip that Herriman did
when he was 22 years old

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.070
called Musical Mose.

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:25.760
So Mose is a minstrel character
that showed up on stage,

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.340
as well as showed up
in newspaper comics.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.875
Herriman created Musical
Mose, a musician.

00:18:30.875 --> 00:18:32.510
He did about four
or five strips.

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:34.940
It ran across several
different newspapers,

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:38.575
using, as you see, the visual
cues for a minstrel character.

00:18:38.575 --> 00:18:40.700
They're very common in his
newspapers of that time.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:46.580
They did something with it that
no other cartoonist was doing.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:49.920
And that's created a story
in which Mose is an artist,

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.690
is a musician.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:52.580
And is an amazing musician.

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:55.550
And Mose goes out and
does an impersonation.

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:58.400
He'll be an Italian one strip,
he'll be a Scotsman one strip,

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.120
he'll be an Irish
fiddler one strip.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.670
And he's fantastic
at what he does.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:05.030
He's a beautiful musician.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:08.660
The ethnic groups
that he's playing for,

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.630
whether Irish or Italian,
they flock to go hear him,

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:12.710
his music is so good.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:16.180
And then they see him and they
discover that he is passing.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:18.020
And a panel like this erupts.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.580
"A Scotsman, are you?

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.410
How do you like that, Scottie?"

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.900
And then you see that bagpipe
that he was making his music

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:28.040
with just in the previous
panel broken now, saying,

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.410
"I wish my color would fade."

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:35.110
Really startling work to uncover
from a 22-year-old working

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.890
in Hearst in
Pulitzer's newspapers.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.780
The story of racial
passing is really

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.782
just starting to be
explored more and more now.

00:19:44.782 --> 00:19:46.490
Here's a fairly recent
book that came out

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:49.430
I recommend by Allison
Hobbes, in which she

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:51.440
talks about always
understanding racial passing

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.440
as a story of loss.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.045
So loss of self, a loss of
community, a loss of family.

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:03.120
But for an artist,
what could be lost?

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:08.190
This is a newspaper headline
from the "Los Angeles Examiner"

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:10.200
when Herriman is
working on staff

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:15.000
about a doctor who was being
embalmed-- she had passed away.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.350
And I'll read it to you.

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:19.110
The undertaker who
was embalming her

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:22.020
accidentally tore off
her wig with a comb

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:27.200
and disclosed a massive
kinky Ethiopian hair.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.970
Herriman must have known,
he was one headline away.

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:36.440
And seems to have,
besides Musical Mose,

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.410
went about doing his work.

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:40.610
And I don't know
what Herriman knew.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:43.260
I don't know what secrets
his family kept from him.

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.620
I don't know what secrets
his family disclosed to him,

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.144
or how it might
have been disclosed.

00:20:48.144 --> 00:20:49.810
But I do know something
really startling

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:53.380
happened as he was working
back in Los Angeles as a sports

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.640
cartoonist.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.030
Every sports page had a
cartoonist, or more than one

00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:59.650
cartoonist working on it.

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:03.454
And the biggest story in
sports at the time was boxing.

00:21:03.454 --> 00:21:05.120
The biggest sport of
the time is boxing.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:09.660
And the biggest story in boxing
was the boxing color line,

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.540
where John Sullivan
had declared,

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.820
I will not fight a black man
in the ring-- never will.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.640
It's beneath the dignity
of the white race

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.590
to fight against the color line.

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:22.470
What happened is
African-American boxers

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:28.080
started emerging in the
ring who were superior.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.900
Joe Gans being one of them--
a fantastic lightweight.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:36.370
He ended up going against Jimmy
Britt in a fight over the color

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:38.530
line and Gans won.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.870
Here's a George Herriman
cartoon shortly after Gans

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.540
won in San Francisco.

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:47.070
Here's a detail from it.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.130
Mr. Gans won the fight.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:49.042
Is that so?

00:21:49.042 --> 00:21:50.250
I'll make you take that back.

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:52.890
It's a race riot that George
Herriman's depicting here.

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:55.410
And then in the bottom corner,
"I spose cos I'm black,"

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:56.760
says the little dog.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.614
"Yeah, cos yer black."

00:21:58.614 --> 00:21:59.280
says his friend.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:09.410
Sam Langford, often considered
the finest boxer of the time

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:11.880
battled Fireman Flynn, who kind
of looks like Alec Baldwin,

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.280
I just realized this morning.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.970
But he battled Jim
Flynn, or Fireman Flynn

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:19.340
in a boxing match in Los
Angeles that Herriman was there

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.057
ringside for.

00:22:21.057 --> 00:22:23.140
And now Herriman does
something really incredible,

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:27.790
he starts to depict these
black boxers as cats.

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:31.240
Here's a scene where the
cat is being dragged out

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.490
of the Lilywhite Inn.

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:36.010
"Hooray, hooray," the
white boxers are shouting.

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:39.430
And then after Langford
wins his next bout,

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:42.785
he comes back bigger than
ever demanding his entrance

00:22:42.785 --> 00:22:43.660
in the Lilywhite Inn.

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:51.180
But the biggest story in
boxing was Jack Johnson,

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:56.010
an idol of Muhammad Ali's,
a intelligent, cultured,

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:59.610
ferocious fighter, a
son of Galveston, Texas.

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:01.407
There's an apocryphal
story of Jack Johnson

00:23:01.407 --> 00:23:03.990
that gives an idea maybe of how
people viewed him at the time.

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:07.469
That he was speeding one
time and he was pulled over.

00:23:07.469 --> 00:23:09.510
And he asked the officer,
how much is the ticket?

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:10.457
And he said $50.

00:23:10.457 --> 00:23:12.040
And he threw him a
$100 bill and said,

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.915
I'm coming back the
same way, officer.

00:23:13.915 --> 00:23:15.540
That's a little bit
about Jack Johnson.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.069
Also a classical musician.

00:23:18.069 --> 00:23:19.860
Jack Johnson had done
something incredible,

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:23.820
he had seized the heavyweight
championship of the world.

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.640
Jack London, the
novelist, led the fight

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.600
to get Jim Jeffries, the white,
former heavyweight champion

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.000
to leave the alfalfa farm
that he'd been tending,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.620
get back into fighting
shape, and reclaim

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.110
the heavyweight crown for
the glory of the white race,

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.880
stated over and
over and over again.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:49.590
I published this book
about a year ago.

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:53.190
And I've been talking about
this book now for the past year.

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:57.480
And the parallels to this
time can't escape me.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:04.260
That in 1910, the divisiveness
and blatant racism of the time

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:11.906
came to a head and people
were forced to take sides.

00:24:11.906 --> 00:24:14.280
And there was a boxing match
in which it was all centered

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:18.090
around in July 4th, 1910.

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:20.460
Originally set
for San Francisco,

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:23.860
but there was a death in the
ring a few months earlier,

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:28.950
and they shoved the match out of
San Francisco for Reno, Nevada.

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:33.730
William Hearst sent his best
writers and cartoonists,

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.580
including Beanie
Walker and Tad Dorgan,

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:38.590
all of Herriman's
friends to Reno, Nevada

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:39.860
to cover the fight.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.840
Brought George
Herriman to New York.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.270
So George Herriman was
not covering the fight,

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:45.940
he was not ringside,
he was not there

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.650
to go to the training camps.

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:50.770
And instead, George Herriman,
now at 30 years old,

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:54.610
did comic after a comic after
comic, specifically exposing,

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.940
and lancing, and satirizing
the white hysteria that

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:01.390
had blossomed around
this boxing match,

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:03.242
such as white
pugilists are fighting

00:25:03.242 --> 00:25:04.450
[INAUDIBLE] colored battlers.

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:06.310
Distressed indeed
in the dusky fleet.

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:09.430
And you see black boxers
crashed on the color line.

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:14.070
While on the ship, the
white boxers are cheering.

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:16.230
"Bring On The Large Black".

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:18.510
This is Jim Jeffries,
who Herriman often

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:20.730
portrayed as a portly
gentleman, because he was not

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:22.830
yet in fighting weight at all.

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:25.700
"Bring on the large
black," orders Jeffries.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.030
"Gentleman with a large black."

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:29.700
And there the chef is,
"Large black coming up.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.270
Of course not the cup of
coffee that he's hoping for."

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:33.270
One other amazing one.

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:38.220
Again, using a visual style
that's very tough to look at,

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:42.240
but also subverting it and
using it for his own ends.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.840
Here, a child standing.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.470
This is looking at
popular education

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:48.270
and how the fight is
changing everything

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:50.260
about public schools.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:51.820
Up in the upper
left corner, child

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.070
is standing up and declaiming,
"The imaginary line

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:57.670
that divides the earth in
half is not the equator,

00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:00.700
it's the color line teacher."

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.680
Everyone around the
country had reason

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.510
to believe that Jim
Jeffries would win,

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:06.040
because they had
been convinced that

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.440
by writers like Jack London,
except for the readers

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.150
of the Hearst newspaper.

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:13.280
Tad Dorgan, Herriman's best
friend and a very influential

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.850
sportswriter, said
very specifically

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:18.660
that you all don't know
that Jack Johnson is going

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.410
to win because you've
been discounting him

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:22.120
because of his color.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:25.360
And indeed, Jack Johnson
was the superior fighter.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.540
Again and again and again he
showed that in the ring here,

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:31.150
playing with Jim
Jeffries and smiling.

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:32.620
And in fact, Jack
London reported,

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:35.890
the man of the summer
temperament smiled and smiled,

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:39.220
and the day did belong
to Jack Johnson.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.500
While he was fighting, he
was taunting Jeffries--

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:50.150
talking to members of the
press, talking to the refs,

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:54.090
as films were being
shot of the fight.

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:55.600
Now, Jack Johnson
and Jim Jeffries

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.433
seem to both know what
the outcome was going

00:26:57.433 --> 00:27:00.730
to be because they signed away
their film rights, knowing

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:03.580
that a film of Jack
Johnson's victory

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.112
would be next to worthless.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:12.050
The result-- Jeffries is
knocked out over the canvas

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:14.850
under the blazing Nevada sun.

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:18.360
And the immediate result across
the country were race riots.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:22.620
New Orleans,
California, New York.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:27.090
Tenements were set fire
where blacks were living,

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:32.820
blacks were shot and killed
for celebrating too loudly

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:33.480
on the streets.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:40.880
Oddly enough, William
Hearst newspapers,

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:44.720
which had been stoking with
bloodlust-- the battle again

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:48.290
and again and again, now took a
new turn on its editorial page.

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:51.290
"The Prize Fight Was
Disgraceful, Demoralizing,

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:52.130
and Harmful.

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:57.280
And in the name of decency,"
the Hearst papers extorted,

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:58.820
"the fight films
must be destroyed."

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.449
And there's Uncle Sam.

00:28:00.449 --> 00:28:02.240
This is not a Herriman
cartoon, by the way.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.690
This is a ponderous cartoon
by Robert Carter, clearly done

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:06.614
by Hearst's demand.

00:28:06.614 --> 00:28:08.030
"In the name of
decency, Uncle Sam

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:10.510
is destroying the fight films."

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:13.270
But here comes George Herriman
with his own idea about what

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:16.200
to do about these fight films.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.200
In "Moving Picture Owners
Have Their Troubles, Eh?"

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.210
by George Herriman.

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:23.880
He has a man walking up and down
the aisles of the movie theater

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.820
in a plaid suit shouting,
"Here you are, get

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.160
your transformation glasses.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.100
They make the whites black
and the blacks white.

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:33.750
You can't see the
show without them."

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:42.150
And two weeks after the
fight came this comic.

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:44.160
Underneath "Mr. Dingbat
Demands His Rights

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.877
From The Family Upstairs," which
was a story about the Dingbat

00:28:46.877 --> 00:28:48.960
family that Herriman, a
cartoon dareman, is doing.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:53.520
He added these two characters
in the bottom, Ignatz Mouse,

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.000
Krazy Kat-- not yet named.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.650
Ignatz creeps up
slowly and slowly,

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:01.470
takes up something, maybe
a little brick or a pebble,

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:02.540
throws it Krazy's head.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.050
And Krazy looks back and
wonders what happened.

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:10.000
And Krazy Kat was born.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.950
That was the start of Krazy Kat.

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:15.130
Underneath-- in that gutter
space of the Dingbat family.

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:18.040
And it had become his
own strip in 1913.

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:22.330
And it's certainly
hard to reduce

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:26.740
Krazy Kat to any one idea,
despite what Krazy told Ignatz.

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:31.000
But you do see again and again,
something really interesting

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.130
happening with notions of
identity, language, and color.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.750
If you remember that early diner
scene of Jim Jeffries ordering

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:45.910
the cup of large black,
here you see Ignatz saying,

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:48.220
"A cup of coffee black."

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.310
Krazy's now in the
kitchen, "Here."

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:52.570
"This isn't black
coffee," says Ignatz.

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:55.170
"Sure it is," said Krazy
"look under the milk."

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.490
Or this scene.

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:00.990
"Gosh!

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:05.470
What a kinky tail," says
Ignatz looking at Krazy.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:10.330
"Kinky my elbow," says Krazy,
"I just had it marcelled."

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:15.466
So this idea of curly hair
being represented by the tail

00:30:15.466 --> 00:30:17.090
reflected the fact
that George Herriman

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:20.210
was known by family
members, by friends

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:21.770
for always wearing
a hat to cover

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:23.960
his own head, both
indoors and out.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.030
Here, Herriman did
a comic about it.

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:28.410
"Look, he's got his hat off,"
says Krazy, "Yeah, and look

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:31.374
what he found in it".

00:30:31.374 --> 00:30:32.790
If you remember
that beauty parlor

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:35.280
that Krazy Kat once went
into to change colors.

00:30:37.842 --> 00:30:39.550
Herriman explained
that in a later strip.

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:42.240
"Dark cats go blonde,
blonde mice go dark.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:42.980
It's all wrong."

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:43.810
"It's style."

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:46.720
"But it upsets all the
processes of law and order."

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:49.680
"It's style."

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.870
Very late in his
life, George Herriman

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:54.990
created a new character called
The Brown Weasel, or Mr. W.

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:55.979
Weasel.

00:30:55.979 --> 00:30:58.020
And the insurance company
considers him poor risk

00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:58.590
when he's brown.

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.090
This is about a
year before Herriman

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:02.310
died in 1943, this comic.

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:05.230
"Fancy a color making a
difference in its value,"

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:06.060
said Krazy Kat.

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:11.680
"Is this the place?" coming
back to that same beauty parlor.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.370
"Yes, this is the
place," said Ignatz.

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:16.460
Then the weasel
comes out pale white.

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:20.520
"Wonderful, a blonde beauty,
pale moonshine, white hibiscus,

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.730
fair flower,
snowflake." says Ignatz.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:28.980
"I'm a bleached weasel,"
says the weasel.

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:32.460
So this idea of beauty, again,
ideas that Herriman could not

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.420
speak out loud.

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.040
Herriman was married
to a white woman.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.470
He lived in property that had a
racial covenant attached to it.

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:38.969
He would lose his
property if it was

00:31:38.969 --> 00:31:41.390
known that he was
African-American or mixed race

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:42.640
at the time.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.660
So this idea of beauty that he
interrogated in the comic strip

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.989
is an incredible thing
to see looking back.

00:31:48.989 --> 00:31:51.280
But also I want to talk about
what George Herriman also

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.550
found in his life, which
was a new way of looking

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:55.540
at beauty itself.

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:59.230
And for George Herriman,
he found this in Arizona--

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:01.810
he found this in Monument
Valley, Arizona specifically.

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:04.480
Here are The Mittens if
any of you have been there.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.880
He would go there every
summer he could for as long

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.910
as he could, staying with
a family, the [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:11.710
in Kayenta, Arizona.

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:14.470
Krazy Kat was set
in Coconino county--

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:16.150
his own version of
Coconino county.

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:19.990
And in fact, the landscape would
shift behind the characters

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:21.100
while they were talking.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:24.760
There might be a butte one time,
a mesa, a cactus the next time,

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:27.160
always madly dancing as
if they were on stage

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:30.130
and there was a drunk
stagehand moving the scenery

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:32.637
back and forth while the
characters were talking.

00:32:32.637 --> 00:32:34.720
And Herriman, in one of
the few serious interviews

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.400
he gave about Krazy
Kat said, people

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.060
don't talk enough
about the scenery,

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:42.950
but to me that's as important as
any character I've ever drawn.

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:45.440
We might know Monument Valley
from John Ford's movies,

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.380
like this one, "Stagecoach",
showing the West

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.270
as a place where you
go prove yourself,

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:52.210
and maybe a man goes
to prove his manhood.

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:53.990
But Herriman got there first.

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:56.150
Here is Krazy Kat napping
in Monument Valley,

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:58.760
looking for "sweet silence
in which to slumba,

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:02.090
but them silly mittens
break out with applause."

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:04.370
Herriman was
fascinated by the Diné,

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:06.730
or Navajo and Hopi Indians.

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:09.470
And spent time going into
a hogan, eating lamb stew.

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:12.132
I was able to find a few
individuals in northern Arizona

00:33:12.132 --> 00:33:13.340
that knew him from this time.

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:19.640
And ideas and customs from
Navajo life and Navajo

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.760
art, such as weaving
would show up in Krazy Kat

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.531
as well during this time.

00:33:24.531 --> 00:33:25.780
He did the most amazing thing.

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:27.894
He was living in
Hollywood at this time.

00:33:27.894 --> 00:33:30.310
And as a way to give back,
there was a tuberculosis asylum

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:31.400
in Kayenta, Arizona.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.970
And he would send
westerns every week,

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:37.030
they were shown at the
hospital in Kayenta.

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:39.370
And it was the social event
of the time for both whites

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:44.230
and the Diné and Hopi Indians,
would all show up and watch

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:45.010
this together.

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:49.222
And some of the letters
and memories of this time

00:33:49.222 --> 00:33:51.430
include this very strange
memory that the white folks

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:55.000
had that the Indians
who were in attendance

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.530
would laugh at the
strangest times.

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:59.290
They ended up finding
out that some locals were

00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:02.752
used as extras, and they
would talk among themselves.

00:34:02.752 --> 00:34:04.210
It was captured on
the film saying,

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:09.170
look at this idiot here pointing
to the white hero in the movie.

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:11.600
So in appreciation
for his work, this rug

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:16.850
was woven and given to
George Herriman as a gift.

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:18.610
But it was a Navajo
beauty prayer

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:22.940
that shows up again and
again in Herriman's comic.

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:25.000
And here, as opposed
to the beauty parlor,

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.570
as opposed to the
cultural norm of beauty

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:33.460
that he was critiquing a
bit, lampooning, satirizing,

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:37.389
having fun with, and
including in Krazy Kat,

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:40.239
this other idea of beauty
also shows up again and again.

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:42.340
The Navajo beauty
prayer, which a woman

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:46.480
that I was able to talk with
who knew George Herriman--

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:51.280
Betty Rodgers-- said they
recited every morning

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.980
as children, "With
beauty before me, I walk.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.620
With beauty behind me, I walk.

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:57.310
With beauty all
around me, I walk.

00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:59.316
My world walks in beauty."

00:34:59.316 --> 00:35:01.860
This prayer shows up again
and again in Krazy Kat.

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:06.210
Offissa Pupp, "A good Earth a
gracious globe lies in beauty."

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:09.480
"Shifting sands dust its
cheeks in powdered beauty."

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:15.540
Here's Krazy Kat,
"Before me beauty is.

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:18.190
Behind me all is also beauty."

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:24.360
And I guess it's that that I've
gotten personally from my 10

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.790
years with Krazy Kat.

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:28.890
Living in a time
now that I would

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:35.640
posit as divisive or worse and
as prone to violence or worse

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:41.220
than the 1910
Jeffries/Johnson prizefight.

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:44.400
Knowing that Herriman
created this little miracle

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.040
of comic art
creation, a character

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:51.900
that inhabited that world and
found Krazy's way to beauty

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:55.060
is, I think, a little
miracle of art.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:58.030
And I'm going to close
here with just a few lines

00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:00.786
that Herriman wrote
to his critics.

00:36:00.786 --> 00:36:02.910
You have written truth,
you friends of the shadows,

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:05.090
yet be not harsh with Krazy.

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:06.780
He is but a shadow
himself, caught

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.670
in the web of this mortal stain.

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:10.050
We call him Kat.

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:11.520
We call him Krazy.

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.280
Yet he is neither.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.140
At some time will he ride away
to you, people of the twilight.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:19.410
His password will be the echoes
of the vesper bell, his coach

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:20.510
a zephyr from the west.

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:22.710
Forgive him, for you
will understand him

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:25.650
no better than we who linger
on this side of the pale".

00:36:30.447 --> 00:36:33.030
So that's the birth of the Krazy
and a little bit of the story

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.806
of George Herriman.

00:36:34.806 --> 00:36:35.430
Thank you, all.

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:38.160
Thank you to Black
Googler Network.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.070
And I encourage you to
spend much, much, much, more

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:42.030
time with Krazy Kat.

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:45.080
It's a strip that continues
to surprise me and teach me

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.050
every time I open up a page.

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:48.270
Thank you very much.

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:49.645
CAMILLE GENNAIO:
Your book starts

00:36:49.645 --> 00:36:51.930
with such a deep
history of the family.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:53.070
MICHAEL TISSERAND: It does.

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:54.360
CAMILLE GENNAIO: Is that
part of the reason--

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.640
because I feel like his
story is so incomplete.

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.910
There's been many books
written about the work.

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:02.370
And I think that your book
goes deeper into the family.

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:04.267
Is that why you did
so much research--

00:37:04.267 --> 00:37:06.350
MICHAEL TISSERAND: I know
more about the Herrimans

00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:07.683
than I know about my own family.

00:37:07.683 --> 00:37:08.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:10.235
CAMILLE GENNAIO: Wow.

00:37:10.235 --> 00:37:11.610
MICHAEL TISSERAND:
And I think it

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:18.300
was really important to
figure out not just the DNA,

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:21.960
I guess, but also
the ideas that we're

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:26.280
moving the Herrimans through
19th century New Orleans.

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:30.090
So Stephen Herriman, the
white riverboat captain,

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:32.250
George Herriman's
great grandfather

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:35.820
and Justine Olivier,
the free woman of color.

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:38.700
There was a huge free people of
color population in New Orleans

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.839
before the Civil War.

00:37:40.839 --> 00:37:42.630
And that's one reason
why it was the center

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:45.180
of black political
activism during that time.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:52.590
I think that when we
saw Herriman erupt

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:57.090
with those comics during the
Jack Johnson/Jim Jeffries

00:37:57.090 --> 00:38:01.320
fight, when we saw him go to
something like Musical Mose,

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:04.922
go to those kinds of
really interesting stories

00:38:04.922 --> 00:38:07.380
that you don't see anywhere
else in the comic page in quite

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.180
that way--

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:17.550
it seems that the noisiness
of that family around those

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:20.310
issues during that
time, the unwillingness

00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:23.160
to accept New Orleans
culture as it was

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:26.450
and to try to move it
forward during that time,

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:27.920
that that was
submerged in Herriman

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.790
and came out during those times.

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:31.300
That is my interpretation.

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.460
Herriman doesn't write
about this, and in the book

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:35.880
I really tried hard
not to say what

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.670
I thought Herriman was thinking
at a certain period of time.

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:42.010
But it does seem that just
looking at the work itself,

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:45.180
that it reflects the agitation
of the 19th century in New

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:48.000
Orleans, as well as the
agitation that Krazy Kat lived

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.374
in the 20th century.

00:38:49.374 --> 00:38:50.720
CAMILLE GENNAIO: Right.

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.220
And if there's any question in
the audience, just interrupt.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:54.570
MICHAEL TISSERAND: And
it's just so amazing.

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:55.861
CAMILLE GENNAIO: It is amazing.

00:38:55.861 --> 00:38:57.370
MICHAEL TISSERAND: Fascinating.

00:38:57.370 --> 00:38:58.800
There was a Creole
seance movement

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.758
that Herriman's father
and grandfather went to.

00:39:00.758 --> 00:39:03.840
And they would gather in
a room a couple of blocks

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.430
away from their
home, and they would

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:08.490
engage in automatic writing,
in which the spirits of Jesus

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:12.270
Christ or Benjamin Franklin
would talk to them and say,

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:13.800
there's a better world coming.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:17.410
Keep working, the
light is there.

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:20.610
Don't rest.

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:26.640
It's just that combination
of trippy spirituality

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.490
and political activism.

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:31.960
It's like 1960s New Orleans--

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.910
1960s United States in
a certain kind of way.

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:40.370
It's just an incredible thing
to witness and read about.

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:44.440
CAMILLE GENNAIO: I'd say that
in my small amount of research,

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:47.670
I also see the parallels
to a lot of things

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:55.940
that are happening here now in
2017, 2018 as you were writing.

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:58.640
What kind of impact do
you feel that this work--

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.910
as people continue to explore
Krazy Kat, George Herriman,

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:05.990
some of his earlier works--
could have on us now,

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:07.400
even in such a--

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.600
we have so much access now.

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.016
We have Google, we have YouTube.

00:40:11.016 --> 00:40:12.140
We can research everything.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:13.556
You have access
to everything that

00:40:13.556 --> 00:40:16.500
happens almost immediately.

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:21.840
How can use this kind of
historical information

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.524
to help better ourselves
and better our lives?

00:40:24.524 --> 00:40:26.440
MICHAEL TISSERAND: It's
funny, we have access,

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.410
and then there's
still a lot of stories

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:31.050
that we don't have access to.

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:33.480
The Library of Congress set
out this wonderful Chronicling

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:36.360
America series, in which
they were going to digitize

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.360
American newspapers.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.330
And they ran out of funding.

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:41.370
None of the Hearst
newspapers are up there.

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:42.840
And none of the
Hearst newspapers

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.560
are on the private sites, like
Ancestry or Genealogy Bank,

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.230
or newspapers.com.

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:49.230
So I actually had
to spend the better

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:53.130
part of about a year and a half
just spooling through pages

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:56.580
and pages and pages of microfilm
to get to some of the stories,

00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:58.590
to find out that
they made jokes--

00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:01.590
his friends in the newspapers
where Herriman was working

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:05.790
were making jokes about
his hair in print,

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:09.420
to find out that there were
headlines about racial passing

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:11.910
in the newspapers at that time.

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:13.100
But the comics were there.

00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:13.930
You're right.

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.060
Krazy Kat comics are there.

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:19.830
Interestingly
enough, too, I think

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:23.836
we're having a
renaissance of comic art,

00:41:23.836 --> 00:41:24.960
in part because of the web.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:29.100
I think web comics opened
up a whole new world.

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:31.170
That blank canvas
that I talked about,

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:34.682
where that Krazy Kat origin
story was played out on,

00:41:34.682 --> 00:41:36.890
that would not have been
possible-- that was possible

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:39.840
in the teens and '20s,
and somewhat in the '30s

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:40.980
when Herriman was drawing.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:43.664
But by the '50s and '60s
and '70s, the reason why

00:41:43.664 --> 00:41:45.580
Charles Schulz' Peanuts
worked the way it did,

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:48.090
is because Charles
Schulz worked in a way

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:51.464
that the panels could be
shrunk down and still read.

00:41:51.464 --> 00:41:53.130
That amount of detail
was just no longer

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:55.170
possible in the comics page.

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:58.400
And that's still the
case in print newspapers.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:02.220
But on the web, of course,
it's wide open again.

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:04.620
And Herriman's work
was also incredibly

00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:07.830
personal in a way that
the comics at that time--

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:10.050
maybe "Happy Hooligan,"
or "Katzenjammer Kids,"

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:13.530
or "The Yellow Kid," they were
sociological and political

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:15.440
sometimes, but not so personal.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:20.730
Herriman did a
comic of Krazy Kat

00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:24.750
seeing a falling star
land on the desert floor,

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:27.270
and realizing it's a baby star.

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:30.450
And Krazy was sleeping
and took the pillow out

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:33.004
of the pillowcase, and held
the pillowcase over the fire,

00:42:33.004 --> 00:42:35.670
made a hot air balloon, and sent
the star back up to the heavens

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:36.600
again.

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:40.600
And then a note came down and
said, I'm back home, thank you.

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.780
And in looking at the
date of that comic,

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:45.660
I realized he did that comic
right after his daughter died.

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:51.530
He did really
personal work that I

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:55.230
think points the way
to memoir comics,

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:57.930
like Allison Bechdel's "Fun
Home" and Art Spiegelman's

00:42:57.930 --> 00:43:03.360
"Maus," and the new boom time
we have of graphic novels.

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:05.910
If you go to the comics shelf
of your local independent

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:10.440
bookstore there's just an
amazing amount of work that

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.750
some acknowledge
Herriman and some don't.

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:16.290
But I think they do all come
from his idea of creating

00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:19.639
allegorical, yet
very personal work.

00:43:19.639 --> 00:43:20.930
CAMILLE GENNAIO: Any questions?

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:23.060
Yes, [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:26.810
AUDIENCE: So thank you again for
taking us through this journey

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:29.030
from this person I had
never even heard of

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:33.500
and now I feel like if
I were to meet him today

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.630
we will have a
lot to talk about.

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:37.820
MICHAEL TISSERAND: I
feel that way, too.

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:39.740
I had one dream about Herriman.

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:42.727
And I dreamed that
I was told Herriman,

00:43:42.727 --> 00:43:44.060
"I think I found your birthday."

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:46.322
And he said, "You
think so, huh?"

00:43:46.322 --> 00:43:48.739
So I can't imagine what talking
to Herriman would be like,

00:43:48.739 --> 00:43:50.405
but I think it would
be very elliptical.

00:43:50.405 --> 00:43:51.650
AUDIENCE: That's really fun.

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:53.870
So I can't help
but wonder though,

00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:58.280
what was your personal
motivation in this journey?

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.860
I assume you've probably been
a comic your whole life--

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:03.440
I mean, into comics
most of your life.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:08.750
And then how did you go from
being into comics in general

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:13.660
and then getting
interested to this person

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:15.020
and following his work?

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:16.100
MICHAEL TISSERAND:
Yeah, I did love comics.

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:17.683
As a kid, I was
obsessed with Peanuts.

00:44:17.683 --> 00:44:21.620
Actually, I drew Charlie
Brown constantly.

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:23.810
My mom would drop me
off at the Willard

00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:25.740
Library in Evansville, Indiana.

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:29.300
And I discovered on my own
the 741.59 section, that's

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:30.980
where all the comics were.

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:34.620
So you'd see "Katzenjammer
Kids" or "Dick Tracy."

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:38.190
This is late 1960s, early 1970s.

00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:40.600
There was no Quentin
Tarantino for me,

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.030
but there was Dick
Tracy, which is

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:45.080
a weird and violent and bloody
as any-- it was like nothing

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:45.580
else.

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.210
It was not like the
"Hardy Boys" or--

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:48.500
AUDIENCE: There was no Marvel?

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.000
MICHAEL TISSERAND:
Well, there were.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.456
I couldn't get to them though.

00:44:51.456 --> 00:44:54.500
I wasn't allowed to buy
comic books, actually.

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.880
I disobeyed and bought
Wacky Packies, but--

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:59.170
AUDIENCE: There wasn't quite
the universe of Marvel--

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:01.294
MICHAEL TISSERAND: Right,
not the way there is now.

00:45:01.294 --> 00:45:03.790
But there was "Spiderman"
and "Fantastic Four."

00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:07.780
But I really started
to approach it--

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:09.810
I was editor of the
"Gambit" newspaper,

00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:12.060
the weekly newspaper-- the
alt weekly in New Orleans.

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:14.779
And I knew the story of
Herriman's birth certificate

00:45:14.779 --> 00:45:17.070
being found, and I knew that
it was still controversial

00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:19.830
and nobody really
knew Herriman's story

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:20.840
in New Orleans.

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:24.510
So I approached it with
that in mind at first.

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:26.820
And just started to research.

00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:27.800
And then Katrina hit.

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:34.170
The newspaper was
back up and running--

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:36.410
my wife lost her job and
we were up in Chicago

00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:40.610
for a couple of
years after Katrina.

00:45:40.610 --> 00:45:42.980
And at that point,
I switched to doing

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:47.750
a lot of Katrina reporting
and writing about the effort

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:50.480
to rebuild New Orleans.

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.090
And right at that time,
an exhibit of original art

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:54.890
came through the country.

00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:57.535
And it only went to Los Angeles,
Milwaukee, and New York.

00:45:57.535 --> 00:45:58.910
So I went to
Milwaukee to see it,

00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:02.870
and the second room was all
George Herriman originals.

00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:04.580
And I have a really
visceral memory.

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:08.510
I was carrying my son, who's
6' 6" now, but at the time

00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:10.730
I was carrying him.

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:14.570
He was young and I was reading
Krazy Kat aloud to him.

00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:16.410
And I went into a
little bit of a talk.

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:18.934
But Krazy's hard to read, and
if you skip over it quickly,

00:46:18.934 --> 00:46:20.600
you're not going to
really dive into it.

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:21.808
But if you read it out loud--

00:46:21.808 --> 00:46:24.080
just like any poetry--
if you read it out loud,

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:28.020
it will start to emerge in
a different way for you.

00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:32.630
And I was reading these panels
to Miles and making the voices,

00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:35.900
and Miles was laughing.

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:39.500
And I just knew right then
I wanted to know everything,

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:41.000
I wanted to learn
everything I could

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.930
about the person who created
that comic, who I knew also

00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:46.259
was exiled.

00:46:46.259 --> 00:46:48.800
In a very different time, under
very different circumstances,

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:51.790
also exiled from New Orleans.

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:54.590
So a very personal moment.

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:57.542
AUDIENCE: Thank
you so much, yeah.

00:46:57.542 --> 00:47:01.490
CAMILLE GENNAIO: Does anybody
else have any other questions?

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:06.490
I'd like to say that I think
that the idea of passing, which

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:08.990
like you said, is being explored
more and more and more now.

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:11.420
I actually am from a family,
where we discovered sometime

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:13.460
in the '90s that we also had--

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:17.570
my great-grandfather who
disappeared and actually went

00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:18.200
north.

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:20.750
And we found family
members who thought

00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:23.600
that their great-grandfather
was a white man,

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:26.570
and had figured out
since that he was not.

00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:28.560
And we eventually reconnected.

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:31.370
So I know this is a story
that many families, especially

00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:35.501
in the south and the southeast
of the United States share.

00:47:35.501 --> 00:47:37.760
But that struggle-- and
you mentioned in your talk

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.490
that even at nine,
how much was he really

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:43.882
aware of as he was growing up?

00:47:43.882 --> 00:47:45.840
Not that you could know,
because like you said,

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:46.810
it's not like you had
the opportunity to speak.

00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:47.900
MICHAEL TISSERAND: He
never spoke about it,

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:48.775
never wrote about it.

00:47:48.775 --> 00:47:51.560
Never wrote in any letters
at least that have survived.

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:52.870
We just have Krazy Kat to read.

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:53.828
CAMILLE GENNAIO: Right.

00:47:53.828 --> 00:47:55.907
So he never discussed
it specifically?

00:47:55.907 --> 00:47:57.490
MICHAEL TISSERAND:
Not that I know of.

00:47:57.490 --> 00:47:59.960
Not that I know of.

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:02.390
His granddaughter has been
a huge help on this project

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:03.500
to me.

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:05.330
And she, like everybody
else, found out

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:08.120
about the story
in the early 1970s

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:09.990
when his birth
certificate was found.

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:11.000
She was actually
living in Africa

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.083
at that time with her
husband, who is a professor,

00:48:13.083 --> 00:48:18.520
and was thrilled to learn--

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.680
it just made her family
that much more interesting.

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:22.700
And I think it made
the work makes sense

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:26.240
to her in a new kind of way.

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:30.080
But as far as Herriman
himself, really all we can read

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.707
is what's in Krazy Kat.

00:48:31.707 --> 00:48:32.540
And there's so much.

00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:35.630
I did highlight some of the
material about identity,

00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:40.340
and language, and race, as that
prohibition cartoon showed you.

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:43.040
There's also just some cartoons
that are just very funny,

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:45.284
and don't hinge on
those kind of themes.

00:48:45.284 --> 00:48:45.950
It's a 30-year--

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:49.550
31-year comic.

00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:52.240
So there's a lot of work there.

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:55.130
But an amazing
amount of humor does

00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:59.060
settle on some of those
questions about language

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:03.530
not really working to describe
identity, about the idea

00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:05.870
that even terms like
black and white--

00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:11.390
as we know, one drop meant
black as a polluted kind of way.

00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:13.277
Bliss Broyard's book,
"One Drop," by the way,

00:49:13.277 --> 00:49:14.360
I'd also really recommend.

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:17.060
Her father, Anatole Broyard
was a "New York Times"

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:20.570
literary critic, and had a death
that confession to his kids,

00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:23.760
oh, by the way, there's a reason
why some of the family members

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.370
you've never met.

00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:27.780
So her book is a memoir
and explored that

00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:29.210
in a very, very personal way.

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:32.440
And her family and
the Herriman family

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:35.546
were in the same community
in New Orleans at that time.

00:49:35.546 --> 00:49:37.670
But we don't have anything
like that from Herriman.

00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:41.510
I can only extrapolate from
other historical sources.

00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:43.530
CAMILLE GENNAIO: There's
a lot in the work.

00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:43.920
MICHAEL TISSERAND:
There's a lot.

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:44.650
CAMILLE GENNAIO: It seems to be.

00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:46.190
MICHAEL TISSERAND:
And I think now,

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:49.310
racial passing is seen
as a moment in history.

00:49:49.310 --> 00:49:52.220
I think we have hopefully--

00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:54.470
I really don't take anything
for granted as far as how

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:57.320
we're progressing these days,
but it seems as if we're moving

00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:00.890
toward a time of greater
inclusively of allowing

00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:03.470
different kinds of
narratives about identity,

00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:09.320
accepting the multiculturalism
that we all live in, respecting

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:14.930
the strains of community and
family and beliefs that weave

00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:17.814
together, and realizing,
like you said--

00:50:17.814 --> 00:50:20.230
especially when people send
out for their DNA test and get

00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:21.517
surprises--

00:50:21.517 --> 00:50:23.975
that the lines aren't drawn
the way we think they're drawn.

00:50:23.975 --> 00:50:26.110
CAMILLE GENNAIO: Right.

00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:28.550
MICHAEL TISSERAND:
When I grew up,

00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:30.320
there was no racial passing.

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:32.540
There was sexual preference--

00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:34.100
sexual orientation.

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:37.460
Not preference-- sexual
orientation passing.

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:39.290
And there were gay
people in my school

00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:43.014
that could not be
openly who they were.

00:50:43.014 --> 00:50:43.930
So I think about that.

00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:45.994
I can't really
identify with Herriman,

00:50:45.994 --> 00:50:47.160
who's from a different time.

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:51.020
But I think we all know people
who can't be who they are.

00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:58.420
And some of us know people that
that was devastating to them.

00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:03.880
And I can only
imagine what Herriman

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:07.660
went through there
and his decision

00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:10.150
to create some of
the kind of work

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:13.210
that he did, so full
of love and joy.

00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:19.078
And it's so much
pointing toward beauty,

00:51:19.078 --> 00:51:22.240
it fills me with an
incredible amount of joy

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.890
and hope also
during these times.

00:51:23.890 --> 00:51:26.740
He's been a pretty good
companion in this last year

00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:28.440
in American history for me.

00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:31.140
It's been a subject I've been
very happy to talk about.

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:32.770
CAMILLE GENNAIO: Well, we are
thrilled that you came here

00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:33.790
to share with us today.

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:35.914
And I did just write down--
like, deep appreciation

00:51:35.914 --> 00:51:39.640
for beauty was the last note
I took from your speech.

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:41.500
Because I've been
looking at the comics,

00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:44.270
but you're right, that I
wasn't looking at the scenery.

00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:45.400
MICHAEL TISSERAND: Yeah.

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:47.530
CAMILLE GENNAIO: So you
have to look at everything.

00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:50.830
MICHAEL TISSERAND: Yeah, these
wonderful, doodle characters--

00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:52.060
no pun intended--

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:53.309
these really simple--

00:51:53.309 --> 00:51:55.600
Ignatz Mouse, just a few
lines and a line for the tail.

00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:58.240
But behind, you have this
cross-hatched shadows

00:51:58.240 --> 00:51:59.840
and it's multi-dimensional.

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:02.410
And they're just
simply gorgeous.

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:04.925
So yeah, it does exist on
so many different planes.

00:52:04.925 --> 00:52:06.050
CAMILLE GENNAIO: Wonderful.

00:52:06.050 --> 00:52:07.510
Thank you so much.

00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:08.230
MICHAEL TISSERAND:
Thank you very much.

00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:09.938
CAMILLE GENNAIO: Thank
you for showing us

00:52:09.938 --> 00:52:11.940
what might be the official
first Google Doodle.

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:12.400
MICHAEL TISSERAND: Exactly.

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:13.420
CAMILLE GENNAIO: I'm going
to send that to the team

00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:14.140
and see what [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:15.348
MICHAEL TISSERAND: Please do.

00:52:15.348 --> 00:52:17.050
Herriman's birthday
is August 20th,

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:20.170
so that would be a
good time perhaps.

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:22.280
And I encourage
everybody, of course,

00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:24.130
to visit your local
independent bookstore

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:27.410
and purchase "Krazy", as well
as any of my other books.

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:29.260
And my website,
michaeltisserand.com,

00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:32.230
has a lot more
comics and stories

00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:33.397
and writing about Krazy Kat.

00:52:33.397 --> 00:52:34.355
CAMILLE GENNAIO: Great.

00:52:34.355 --> 00:52:35.140
Thank you so much.

00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:35.530
MICHAEL TISSERAND: Thank you.

00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:36.347
Great to meet you.

00:52:36.347 --> 00:52:37.680
Thank you Black Googler Network.

00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:41.330
