00:00:10.145 --> 00:00:15.145
- to call back to the podium
for encore performances,

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.810
Dr. Clarissa Kripke who is

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.240
Clinical Professor of Family
and Community Medicine

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.240
and Director of the Developmental
Primary Care Unit at UCSF.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.820
The mission of the Office of
Developmental Primary Care,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.790
founded by Clarissa,

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.540
is to build a capacity
of the healthcare system

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.960
to serve transition-age youth and adults

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.170
with developmental disabilities

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.080
through clinical service,
advocacy, research and training.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.770
And I could say a lot more
good things about Dr. Kripke,

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.060
but I need to say some really good things

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.940
about Dr., Doctor Dora Raymaker

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.940
who earned her PhD since the
last time Dora presented here

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.840
and, so, she is a Research
Assistant Professor

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.870
at Portland State University's

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.300
Regional Research Institute
for Human Services.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.400
I have to read all of this
because it's so impressive.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.080
She's conducting
community-engaged research

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.760
with disability and
mental health communities

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.240
around employment, health and anti-stigma.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.543
Dora's also an autistic person

00:01:30.543 --> 00:01:33.585
and a disability-rights advocate

00:01:33.585 --> 00:01:38.043
who enjoys writing science fiction novels

00:01:38.043 --> 00:01:42.283
with disabled heroes in free time.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.350
My goodness, you must not
have a lot of free time

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.370
with all those academic endeavors.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.940
But so, we are certainly delighted that

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.940
they are going to present on
the AASPIRE Healthcare Toolkit

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.130
which Finn referred to earlier

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.300
as something that is used

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.170
with all of Finn's clients all the time.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.863
So let's hear about it.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.913
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:02:16.913 --> 00:02:20.080
(audience applauding)

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.813
- Thank you.

00:02:27.813 --> 00:02:29.510
I'm a Research Assistant Professor

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.560
at Portland State University
in the School of Social Work.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.890
I do social-service intervention research

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.490
with disability populations.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.640
I mainly work with people with
intellectual disabilities,

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.100
autistic people and people who experience

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.610
psychosis and mental-health challenges

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.270
and my research is around
employment, health.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.160
I have a pregnancy and
interpersonal violence,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.833
many things that I've heard
today and it's exciting.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.820
I'm also the Co-Director for

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.970
the Academic-Autistic Spectrum Partnership

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.600
in Research and Education

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.453
that is the research group
that created this Toolkit.

00:03:09.361 --> 00:03:12.507
I am also an autistic self-advocacy

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.470
and disability-rights advocate.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.360
You can see that, from an early age,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.288
I kind of had some ideas
about civil rights, so ...

00:03:22.288 --> 00:03:24.130
(audience laughing)

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.130
- And I am on the clinical
faculty and run a consult service

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.440
for people with complex
developmental disabilities and

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.551
provide primary care to people
with complex disabilities.

00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:41.540
And I am an academic partner
of the AASPIRE network

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.990
that you'll hear about today.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.610
- Before we get into the
AASPIRE Healthcare Toolkit,

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.260
I wanna give a little
background on the AASPIRE part.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.910
I co-founded AASPIRE with
my physician, researcher,

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.717
colleague, Christina Nicolaidis,
all the way back in 2006,

00:04:00.717 --> 00:04:02.060
before I ever thought

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.230
that I would get into
health-services research.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.750
I was her partner from
the autistic community

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.160
and we were trying to deal with

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.970
the problem of lack of
inclusion of autistic people

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.210
in autism research.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.530
AASPIRE is a team of academic researchers,

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.660
autistic people, family
members, healthcare providers

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.290
and disability professionals.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.900
And many of us, like myself,

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.350
wear more than one of those hats.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.270
We're housed at Portland State University

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.620
and we partner with a number of

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.070
both community-based and
academic institutions.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.290
Our mission, however, for all
these years has never changed,

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.767
which is to equitably
include autistic people

00:04:36.767 --> 00:04:40.560
in autism research that is relevant to

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.367
the autistic community and
creates positive change

00:04:43.367 --> 00:04:47.363
for people on the spectrum
by our own priorities.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.210
This Toolkit is the result of
a multi-year research project

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.380
to improve healthcare access and quality

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.300
for autistic adults.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.090
Some of you might remember
that I was here seven years ago

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.270
and, at that time, when I spoke to you,

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.900
we had collected our very
first data on that project,

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.510
but we hadn't done anything
about what we had found yet.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.250
So, I get to come back here

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.900
and present this next chapter
in the story of what we then,

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.711
I'm gonna first tell you
some more of what we found

00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:19.450
because there's a lot more of it

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.110
and it's a lot more clean to present now.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.703
And then, what we did about it.

00:05:27.815 --> 00:05:28.670
First I'll talk about

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.480
the approach we took
to making the Toolkit,

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.340
which is community-based
participatory research,

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.320
which, I assure you, is useful
for more than just research.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.580
Then, I'll go through the
development of the Toolkit

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.610
and what we learned about

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.410
healthcare for autistic
adults from that process.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.500
Then, I'll turn everything
over to Clarissa

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.200
for recommendations, tips, a demonstration

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.403
and some of the tools that
she has also developed here.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.610
We created the Toolkit

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.650
and conducted all the science behind it

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.810
using this community-based
participatory research approach.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.790
I say approach because it's
a way of doing research.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.150
It's not a method like a
survey or an interview.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.810
It was a response to the problems

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:10.643
that marginalized people and communities

00:06:10.643 --> 00:06:15.390
have had with research,
like unethical studies,

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.890
not being included in
research that was about them,

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.470
research methods or results being invalid

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.640
because the researchers didn't understand

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.060
something really important
about the community,

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.820
study results that weren't
important to the community,

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.930
or could even be harmful or stigmatizing.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.850
The idea is to create
an equitable partnership

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.800
between researchers and
members of a community.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.440
And this approach, like I say,

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.980
works outside of research too,

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.430
for example, in person-centered
planning meetings

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.640
or in developing an interactive website

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.783
like the AASPIRE Healthcare Toolkit.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.220
Has nine guiding principles which are:

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.270
to acknowledge the community
as a unit of identity;

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.210
to build on the strengths and
resources in the community;

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.210
to facilitate a collaborative,
equitable partnership

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.720
in all phases of the research;

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.080
to foster co-learning
and capacity building

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.480
among all partners;

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.470
to balance knowledge
generation and intervention

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.920
for the mutual benefit of all partners;

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.470
to attend to both local

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.440
and broader, systems-wide perspectives;

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.660
to develop systems using a
cyclical and iterative approach,

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.229
so you're always reinventing yourselves;

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:25.730
to disseminate results to all partners

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.040
and to involve all
partners in dissemination,

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.060
so that's not just going
into an academic journal;

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.190
and, to commit to long-term processes

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:35.410
and group sustainability,

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:39.190
because it takes a lot of work
to do this at the beginning,

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.529
but there is a really big payoff

00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:43.460
once everybody trusts each other

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.320
and you've got processes that work well.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.680
So, what does this look like in practice?

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.490
Equitable does not mean
everybody does the same thing.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.540
We're not going to insist
that community members

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.640
become statistics masters.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.410
And, we're not going to insist
that non-community academics

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.930
suddenly know what it's like
to have lived experience.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.890
It means that expertise,
power and learning is shared.

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:09.750
So, during all phases, the community

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.410
keeps the research respectful, accessible,

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.550
socially-relevant, relevant
to their community,

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.131
while the academics make sure that it's

00:08:17.131 --> 00:08:20.020
scientifically-sound and
academically-relevant,

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.190
so that when you have results,

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:22.630
people will actually believe them

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.196
when you go to advocate for policy

00:08:24.196 --> 00:08:26.253
or do something with them.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.410
For example, during the development stage,

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.410
the community may ensure that
the study's focus and design

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:36.330
meets what the community
prioritizes and what is helpful,

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.100
while the academics make
sure that it's rigorous and

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.733
going to advance science or
to improve clinical outcomes.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.040
In order to do this effectively,

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.823
process and structure
are really important.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.900
Power sharing is an easy word to throw out

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.070
and a really difficult thing to do.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:00.670
And everybody has to be
actively involved in it.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.730
It means that academics and
people who have more privilege

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:04.948
need to give up the power

00:09:04.948 --> 00:09:07.830
that they are used to
automatically having.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:11.220
Community members also need to take power

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.770
that they may be unused to
having or ever being given.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.380
And trust is really hard to build.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:20.020
So we use a lot of
structures and processes

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.505
to try to help provide
a foundation for that,

00:09:23.505 --> 00:09:25.870
including how to communicate in a way

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.810
that privileges the community.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.940
How to make truly-shared decisions.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.140
How to make the space
safe to give feedback

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.423
and adjust the group
based on that feedback.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.220
How all of these things happen

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.470
will look really different
depending on your group.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.570
I have AASPIRE.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:44.220
I also have a group of young adults

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.240
who have experienced
first-episode psychosis.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.270
I have a broad developmental
disabilities group

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:51.350
that we worked with,

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.300
all of these using this method,

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.770
and what we've done has
looked very, very different

00:09:55.770 --> 00:10:00.290
because of the specific
individuals who are involved.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:01.930
This is a quick look at

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:05.590
some of the strategies that AASPIRE uses.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:07.230
To equalize communication,

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:11.500
we use an email Listserv
and a text-based group chat.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.930
Some people on our team
don't talk or use speech.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.540
Some can't manage phone calls.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.100
We had somebody who was
deaf for a long time.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.650
So that's the place where we found that

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:23.330
everybody has the same communication

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.730
and everyone's
communication needs are met.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.960
And it's, at time, put the
more privileged academics

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.430
in the group as a disadvantage.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.527
I remember Christina early on saying,

00:10:31.527 --> 00:10:33.507
"Now I know what it
feels like to be forced

00:10:33.507 --> 00:10:36.310
"to communicate in a way
that doesn't work well,"

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:39.290
because she was so slow at
typing and she didn't understand

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:41.770
any of the social rules of the text chat

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:43.420
that us, in the community,

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.270
we had been talking to each
other through this for years.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:48.853
And, yeah.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:54.580
- I just wanted to say that this was 2011.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.660
I was invited to my
first AASPIRE text chat

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:58.843
and I was so excited.

00:10:59.797 --> 00:11:02.250
I participated very actively

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.351
and then got the feedback that

00:11:06.351 --> 00:11:08.487
maybe it would be better if I didn't.

00:11:08.487 --> 00:11:09.677
Maybe it would be better if

00:11:09.677 --> 00:11:14.320
I and the other academic partners

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.670
listened and just observed and then

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:20.690
we would have a separate
phone call for the academics

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:22.930
who could speak in the jargon
that we're comfortable in.

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:25.217
And you made it very
comfortable by saying,

00:11:25.217 --> 00:11:27.157
"You know, you have a
way of communicating.

00:11:27.157 --> 00:11:28.187
"You have a way of thinking.

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:30.510
"And that's important to this group, but

00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:33.986
"ne'er the two shall meet (laughs)

00:11:33.986 --> 00:11:35.267
(audience laughing)

00:11:35.267 --> 00:11:38.380
"without specific facilitation."

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:42.280
So, even people who have
a lot of experience,

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.750
who are used to working with
people with disabilities,

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.350
who are used to talking to
people with disabilities,

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.450
this process takes that really seriously,

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:57.390
and makes us relearn what's possible

00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:00.653
in a way that took it to
a really different level.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.643
- We let Clarissa back into
our text chat since then.

00:12:05.643 --> 00:12:10.143
(both laughing and audience laughing)

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.290
- I'm also guilty.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:19.280
Sometimes we've had academics, or jargon,

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.120
be a problem for those
of us who sit on the,

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.480
who wear multiple hats too.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.340
Early on one of our
community members came to me

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.650
and told me she was terrified

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.290
every time she saw an email from me

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:37.290
because it was "so full of
details and sciencey stuff."

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.520
So she suggested a
structured format for emails

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.160
that we have used ever since,

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.100
it's like been a decade now,

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.790
that list very explicitly,
the purpose of this email,

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:51.640
who it's for, what action should be taken,

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.130
what the deadlines are, and
then the details after that,

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:58.700
so that everybody knows
what's expected from them.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.970
And jargon absolutely
needs to not be in anything

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.880
or it needs to, at least, be explained

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.700
because equalizing
communication is, in my opinion,

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.510
the foundation of shared power

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.703
and nothing else can happen without that.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:19.343
For shared decision making we
used this five-finger, oop,

00:13:20.381 --> 00:13:21.923
Am I off a slide?

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:24.680
I'm sorry about that.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.199
We use a five-finger consensus
process for decision making

00:13:29.199 --> 00:13:31.490
where the decision gets
spelled out plainly

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.250
and then everyone indicates:

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.083
one, I love it;

00:13:34.083 --> 00:13:35.040
two, it's fine;

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.050
three, I have questions, which are;

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:40.330
four, I don't like it because
... , but I won't block it;

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.550
and, five, I hate it because
... , and I will block it.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:46.710
And then we discuss any
threes, fours and fives,

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:49.910
and make changes to the idea
potentially based on that

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.060
until everybody gives ones and twos

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.440
or there are unresolvable fives.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.470
Any unresolvable fives,

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.620
So this has really helped us
to make sure that everybody

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.700
has the same amount of
power and decision making

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.260
because everybody has an equal veto.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:08.110
And everybody has an equal
chance to come up with,

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:11.170
to express what might
be getting in the way.

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:15.480
We've had some really
interesting things come of that.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:20.480
On one of my projects, we were
actually using this process

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.770
to decide if we wanted
to use this process.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:28.000
One of the people there
had given it a five.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.730
She really hated it
and didn't wanna do it,

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.880
but because you have to say why,

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.713
She was somebody

00:14:32.713 --> 00:14:36.150
who had been incarcerated
in an institution

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.090
for most of her life

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:39.600
and had been really infantilized

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.110
and treated like a child.

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:42.780
She felt like holding up fingers

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:45.420
was an incredibly childish thing

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.280
and she wanted no part of it.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.300
So, we decided that, instead
of holding up fingers,

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.260
people would say what number they were

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.710
and she was totally fine with it

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.150
and we ended up using it
through the rest of the project.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.983
So there are things that

00:14:56.983 --> 00:14:58.500
you might not understand about people

00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.671
if you don't have some process

00:14:59.671 --> 00:15:02.380
for understanding why they're
making the decisions they are.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.373
So we love this.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.133
We use it.

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:09.660
For feedback, we do a
Keep/Change exercise,

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:10.960
sometimes at the end of meetings

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.730
that helped a lot at the beginning

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:14.730
when we didn't really
know what we were doing.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:16.950
It became less helpful because now

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:19.830
we just wanna keep doing what we're doing.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:22.649
But we do check-ins when
a lot of time has passed

00:15:22.649 --> 00:15:24.390
or there have been changes,

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:27.910
and we've also used some
confidential, external evaluations

00:15:29.174 --> 00:15:31.540
so people can speak more freely.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.403
We try to continuously
improve how we work together.

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:37.590
Accommodations are also at the heart of

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:40.673
equalizing power and making
a true collaboration.

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:46.290
Some of what I talked about
are all accommodations,

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:49.520
but these are some from
some of our other meetings.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.950
We've had a ASL interpreter.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.840
We've done pre-meetings where

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.400
we meet one-on-one with somebody

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.770
to explain what's gonna
be going on in the meeting

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:59.450
so that they have some extra sort of

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:02.363
ability to ask questions
and figure stuff out.

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.210
Personal assistance in meetings.

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:06.630
Sensory accommodations.

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.250
Extra processing time.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:11.000
Things go slower, but they go better.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.510
Alternate formats.

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:15.310
Attending to socio-economic things

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:17.480
like money for childcare or transportation

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.900
can make it accessible.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:24.143
But always ask your collaborators
what works for them.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.560
I'm a researcher so I use
this process in research,

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.790
but it can certainly be
used in other settings.

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:33.883
My project with EASA is a,

00:16:33.883 --> 00:16:35.720
EASA is a program for young adults

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.770
who have experienced
first-episode psychosis

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:40.230
and they have a Young
Adult Leadership Council

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.790
which is the advisory
board to the whole program

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:45.040
and there are some members
of that Advisory Council

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.840
who are also part of my research team.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.780
They liked some of these processes so much

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.310
that they brought them back
to their Advisory Council

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:54.643
and now use them for that.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.763
Also, you can use it to create
products like the Toolkit,

00:16:59.763 --> 00:17:03.080
accessible technology, anything like that.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.590
And, the approach can be applied
to person-centered planning

00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:08.463
or to shared decision making
and healthcare settings.

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:14.660
- As an academic partner of AASPIRE,

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:18.720
I have deep respect for all that work

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.570
that goes into inclusion, real inclusion,

00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:25.510
and accommodations in making sure that

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:29.163
no opinion and no
participation is left behind.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.810
One of my observations is

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:37.590
how the rhythm of the
work is different from

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:41.296
most group processes
that I've been in before,

00:17:41.296 --> 00:17:45.143
where you start often with a general idea

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:51.580
and then drill down into more specifics

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:54.880
and start with a draft and then

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.373
get something that is refined over time.

00:18:00.339 --> 00:18:02.850
It can feel like we're spending

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:06.770
an enormous amount of resources,
an enormous amount of time,

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:09.690
doing that inclusion
and accommodation work.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:13.630
And it can feel nervous that

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:14.960
we're not gonna meet our deadline

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.680
or we're not gonna make our deliverable

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.610
because we're spending so much time

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.280
figuring out all these accommodations.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:26.010
But, there's a lot of
thinking that happens

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:27.970
when you have to explain something

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:30.570
to really, really different people

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.110
and have them all truly understand

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:34.959
and, from the kinds of
feedback and questions

00:18:34.959 --> 00:18:38.267
that you get as you really take that time

00:18:38.267 --> 00:18:41.200
and take that time in your meetings

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.993
to really bring everybody along.

00:18:48.782 --> 00:18:52.350
But then, at the end, when
you've done all that work

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:56.270
and it comes time to really
nail down what you're doing,

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.940
it crystallizes really quickly

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:01.023
and we've met our deadlines
and it's been one of the most,

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:06.070
It's been one of the
most productive projects

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.903
that I've been on.

00:19:06.903 --> 00:19:09.440
We've published quite a bit together.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:13.330
And, when it crystallizes,

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:16.900
because of all that
work, it's really solid.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.090
It really works.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:22.020
And when we study it, it
actually improves people's lives.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:25.050
We nail it because we've
done all that work.

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:27.343
And, so,

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:31.470
it can look messy, it
can make you nervous,

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.230
but stick with it, believe in it,

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:35.583
'cause, in the end, it works.

00:19:39.071 --> 00:19:41.800
- Now I'm gonna go into the specifics of

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.980
the Toolkit development

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.150
and what we learned about
barriers to healthcare

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:49.000
and healthcare experiences
for autistic adults.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.430
The first study we ever did

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:52.660
was a survey on healthcare disparities

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:55.733
between autistic and non-autistic adults.

00:19:55.733 --> 00:19:59.150
One of the measures on
that survey was a 66-item,

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:03.433
yes/no checklist with categories of, oop,

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.273
transportation,

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:12.193
availability and access of
service or system, insurance,

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:15.860
accommodation and access
within facilities,

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.970
social, family and caregiver support,

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:21.280
and individual-level factors,
which were things like

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:25.000
finding the system, medical
system, too confusing, or fear.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.090
And we had 209 autistic participants,

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:30.749
55 non-autistic,

00:20:30.749 --> 00:20:33.200
but who identified as
people with disabilities,

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.940
and 173 non-autistic people

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:39.480
who identified as not having
disabilities, take it.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.120
The autistic participants selected

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.670
both different and greater
barriers to healthcare,

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:47.210
particularly in the areas
of emotional regulations,

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:50.140
patient-provider communication,
sensory sensitivity

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:54.583
and healthcare navigation,
which is no surprise to you all.

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:01.860
The top barrier was fear or anxiety,

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.520
which other groups rated high,

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.980
but just nowhere near to the same amount.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.850
And then the second biggest barrier

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:10.410
was unique to the autistic group,

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:11.470
which was not being able to

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.632
process information quickly enough

00:21:13.632 --> 00:21:17.980
to participate in real-time
discussions and communications

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.223
about health and healthcare
with their providers.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.420
Other barriers were concern about cost,

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:26.300
facilities causing sensory issues,

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.320
and difficulty communicating
with providers.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.990
So we considered accommodations for these

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.000
and many of the other top barriers

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.100
when we were putting together the Toolkit.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.120
We then did semi-structured,
open-ended interviews

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.370
with 39 autistic adults and 16 supporters.

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.287
We wanted to understand
their healthcare experiences

00:21:45.287 --> 00:21:47.640
and how to improve them.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:51.280
We offered in-person, telephone,
email or text chat to try

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.840
to accommodate the broadest
amount of people we could.

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.460
Seven years ago I had preliminary
results from that study,

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:02.283
but here is the totality
of what we've learned.

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:05.840
So, there's a dynamic interplay

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.490
between patient- and
provider-level factors.

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:11.010
It's not like you can just fix
something on the patient side

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:12.680
or fix something on the provider side

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.710
and have everything
magically fall into place

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:15.543
because the two are

00:22:15.543 --> 00:22:17.430
continuously interacting with each other.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.220
And all of that exists
within a healthcare system.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.910
If the healthcare system
can't support people's needs

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.600
then none of that matters.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.410
So, those three factors
in their combination

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:31.210
is what we heard about

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:34.340
leading to people having
greater or lesser success

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.373
in their healthcare interactions.

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:41.410
These are some, in people's own words,

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:43.430
to kind of give a little insight into

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:45.160
what people might be experiencing

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.143
when they come into your offices.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:52.880
Challenges in verbal
communication skills were common

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.500
but differed in nature,
depending on the person.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.460
For example, one supporter described

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.842
her son's literal
interpretation of language.

00:23:00.842 --> 00:23:03.707
"They asked him, 'On a level of one to 10,

00:23:03.707 --> 00:23:05.177
'where is your pain?'

00:23:05.177 --> 00:23:08.900
"He said, 'Um, how do
you weigh your pain?'"

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.927
An autistic participant described,

00:23:12.927 --> 00:23:14.077
"It is always hard for me

00:23:14.077 --> 00:23:16.377
"because I don't have the
words that normal people have

00:23:16.377 --> 00:23:17.797
"to communicate with.

00:23:17.797 --> 00:23:19.937
"I don't always know
how to respond properly

00:23:19.937 --> 00:23:22.477
"to questions from healthcare providers."

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.810
Sensory sensitivities
were, of course, prominent.

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:28.490
Both patients and supporters said

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:31.230
sensory sensitivities impacted
their patients' ability

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.890
to have a healthcare interaction at all.

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:35.696
One participant described,

00:23:35.696 --> 00:23:38.167
"The lights in the office are very bright

00:23:38.167 --> 00:23:40.937
"and it is exacerbated by the white walls.

00:23:40.937 --> 00:23:43.067
"Sometimes the waiting rooms are crowded

00:23:43.067 --> 00:23:44.197
"and I cannot filter out

00:23:44.197 --> 00:23:47.737
"the background of people
talking or shuffling magazines.

00:23:47.737 --> 00:23:48.977
"I feel disoriented by

00:23:48.977 --> 00:23:52.587
"being led down long
hallways to different rooms.

00:23:52.587 --> 00:23:54.837
"I am not able to bring
out my concerns because

00:23:54.837 --> 00:23:55.713
"it is all I can manage

00:23:55.713 --> 00:23:57.787
"to figure out what the doctor is saying

00:23:57.787 --> 00:24:00.397
"so I can respond to his questions.

00:24:00.397 --> 00:24:03.847
"But he refills my usual
meds and I go on my way."

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:10.010
Participants described
challenges with body awareness

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:11.960
as another dimension of sensory

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.140
that is sometimes not thought about.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.417
For example, this participant explained,

00:24:17.417 --> 00:24:19.147
"Like when they ask if pain is shooting

00:24:19.147 --> 00:24:20.507
"or stabbing or burning, it's like,

00:24:20.507 --> 00:24:23.250
"'I don't know, it just feels funny.'"

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:25.307
Another explained, "The problem is,

00:24:25.307 --> 00:24:29.077
"it is difficult for me to
isolate specific sources of pain

00:24:29.077 --> 00:24:31.547
"and identify duration and intensity.

00:24:31.547 --> 00:24:34.317
"It's sort of equivalent to white noise."

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:38.500
Many other known
autism-related characteristics

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.600
affected care, including
patients' need for consistency,

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.980
slow-processing speed, atypical
non-verbal communication

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:49.050
and the executive function
organization stuff.

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:51.377
For example, one participant explained,

00:24:51.377 --> 00:24:52.257
"With my autism,

00:24:52.257 --> 00:24:55.087
"it is very difficult for
me to understand and follow

00:24:55.087 --> 00:24:57.887
"all of the different
appointments and procedures

00:24:57.887 --> 00:24:59.857
"I have to schedule and how to do it.

00:24:59.857 --> 00:25:01.797
"And no one will help
me since, apparently,

00:25:01.797 --> 00:25:04.357
"people magically become
competent at these things

00:25:04.357 --> 00:25:06.257
"before they turn 21."

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.260
Looking now at the provider-level factors

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:16.170
and how those interacted with
those patient-level factors.

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:19.740
Autistic adults and supporters,
almost uniformly, complained

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.400
about providers lack of
knowledge of autism in adults.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.400
So I'm very happy that you are all here.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:27.387
One participant described,

00:25:27.387 --> 00:25:29.477
"I have gotten the
distinct impression that

00:25:29.477 --> 00:25:31.027
"all of the physicians I have seen

00:25:31.027 --> 00:25:33.407
"have no clue what autism means or entails

00:25:33.407 --> 00:25:36.580
"or how that should
change how they treat me."

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.187
Another states, "I thought doctors

00:25:38.187 --> 00:25:40.047
"would understand my autism.

00:25:40.047 --> 00:25:42.067
"I thought saying, 'Well, I have autism,'

00:25:42.067 --> 00:25:43.847
"would be a suitable explanation for

00:25:43.847 --> 00:25:45.937
"why I have age-inappropriate troubles

00:25:45.937 --> 00:25:47.877
"with managing my healthcare,

00:25:47.877 --> 00:25:49.700
"but it's not."

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.630
Similarly, supporters related that

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:54.270
they regularly had to teach
providers about autism,

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:55.530
including reminding them

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:59.380
not to over-attribute behaviors to autism.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:02.457
One said, "People attribute
behaviors to the autism

00:26:02.457 --> 00:26:04.717
"rather than looking for an illness first.

00:26:04.717 --> 00:26:06.147
"'Oh, that's her autism.

00:26:06.147 --> 00:26:07.517
"'She's banging her head against the wall

00:26:07.517 --> 00:26:09.127
"'because that's her autism.'

00:26:09.127 --> 00:26:12.907
"No one thinks, 'Oh, gosh,
maybe she has a migraine.'

00:26:12.907 --> 00:26:15.527
"They forget to realize she
can't verbally express it,

00:26:15.527 --> 00:26:17.707
"so she uses behavior instead."

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:22.010
Participants attributed

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:24.990
many negative experiences with healthcare

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:27.620
to providers having incorrect assumptions.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:30.057
For example, an autistic
participant explained,

00:26:30.057 --> 00:26:31.717
"I've used my Alphasmart

00:26:31.717 --> 00:26:33.494
"which is a portable communication device,

00:26:33.494 --> 00:26:36.557
"when my speech is too slow
or difficult to understand

00:26:36.557 --> 00:26:38.097
"for medical appointments.

00:26:38.097 --> 00:26:39.897
"Some of the doctors
have been really great,

00:26:39.897 --> 00:26:43.077
"but others have acted really
condescending when I used it.

00:26:43.077 --> 00:26:45.737
"Also, immediately assuming
I couldn't be alone,

00:26:45.737 --> 00:26:48.077
"had to have parents there too.

00:26:48.077 --> 00:26:49.327
"So I try to go without

00:26:49.327 --> 00:26:52.390
"even when my speech
is in a poorer shape."

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:54.167
Another related, "Usually when

00:26:54.167 --> 00:26:57.237
"I demonstrate a large
vocabulary or some fundamentals,

00:26:57.237 --> 00:26:59.437
"my needs, especially
around communication,

00:26:59.437 --> 00:27:01.017
"are then ignored.

00:27:01.017 --> 00:27:04.287
"My choice is then, to
pretend to be less intelligent

00:27:04.287 --> 00:27:06.457
"and accept their infantilism,

00:27:06.457 --> 00:27:09.687
"or to be confused,
frustrated and stressed out."

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:14.990
Providers' willingness to allow patients

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:17.230
to communicate in writing really was

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:18.900
one of the reasons that patients felt

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.987
that they received better or worse care.

00:27:22.987 --> 00:27:26.287
"I prefer and find it easier
to communicate in text,

00:27:26.287 --> 00:27:27.777
"but, with every doctor I speak to,

00:27:27.777 --> 00:27:29.877
"they wave away the
note-card and look at me

00:27:29.877 --> 00:27:32.457
"and ask the same question
I have just answered

00:27:32.457 --> 00:27:34.357
"and interpret my confusion as

00:27:34.357 --> 00:27:36.917
"my being non-compliant with the medicine.

00:27:36.917 --> 00:27:38.237
"I wish healthcare providers

00:27:38.237 --> 00:27:40.597
"would read the notes I make for them."

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:46.367
Providers often use to fail
use accessible language.

00:27:46.367 --> 00:27:47.227
"But they talk to him

00:27:47.227 --> 00:27:49.887
"in the same words they'd use
if they were talking to me.

00:27:49.887 --> 00:27:51.077
"If they're gonna talk to him,

00:27:51.077 --> 00:27:54.240
"they need to say it how
he can understand it."

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.640
Failure to communicate
in an accessible way

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.373
often led to decreased patient autonomy.

00:28:00.407 --> 00:28:02.307
"Just because I might
need more information

00:28:02.307 --> 00:28:03.855
"to understand things, it doesn't mean

00:28:03.855 --> 00:28:06.492
"they can or should just
talk to me like a child

00:28:06.492 --> 00:28:09.477
"or leave me without
knowledge of my own health.

00:28:09.477 --> 00:28:11.777
"My body is my body and my experience

00:28:11.777 --> 00:28:14.737
"and my wishes about my
body are mine to make."

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:23.887
Openness to accommodations
really influenced things.

00:28:23.887 --> 00:28:24.977
"And they were very happy to

00:28:24.977 --> 00:28:27.559
"accommodate all of her sensory
and communication needs,

00:28:27.559 --> 00:28:30.857
"including communicating with
her by email ahead of time

00:28:30.857 --> 00:28:33.147
"and giving her descriptions
of who would be there,

00:28:33.147 --> 00:28:35.407
"what the process would
be, how long it would take.

00:28:35.407 --> 00:28:37.057
"I believe they even supplied her with

00:28:37.057 --> 00:28:40.047
"photographs of all of the
staff and their names."

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:44.840
Providers' skill at
incorporating supporters

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.150
also greatly influenced care.

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:49.230
Both patients and supporters describe

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:50.870
decreased patient autonomy

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.650
due to healthcare providers
communicating with supporters

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:55.220
instead of patients.

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.387
One autistic participant explained,

00:28:57.387 --> 00:28:59.277
"The triage person kept speaking to

00:28:59.277 --> 00:29:01.417
"the person who brought
me, rather than to me.

00:29:01.417 --> 00:29:04.490
"The lady could have
spoken directly to me."

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:06.880
There were also examples from
both patients and supporters

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.550
of ineffective care due to providers

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:13.200
not including supporters when
they were needed and desired.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.860
Appropriate supporter involvement

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:18.283
increased the patients'
satisfaction with healthcare.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.690
For example, "[my Mother]
would say the things

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:24.390
or answer the things I don't
know like insurance things,

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:26.337
and I would answer the other things."

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.110
Remember that all of this dynamic

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:31.640
is also being influenced by

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.280
the environmental context
in which it's happening.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.840
And the system-level factors

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.560
really surrounded and influenced

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.790
that interplay of the
patient and the provider.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:42.810
For example, experiences
were often tied to

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:44.220
the availability of supports,

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.620
as well as the complexity
of the healthcare system.

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:48.450
And many positive experiences

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:50.840
had necessitated the
help of family members

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.870
or disability services professionals

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:56.900
and people who weren't
getting sufficient services

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.050
indicated that that was a reason why

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:01.807
they weren't getting as good care.

00:30:01.807 --> 00:30:03.437
"I wish they understood how easy it is

00:30:03.437 --> 00:30:05.947
"to get confused with all
the administrative hoops

00:30:05.947 --> 00:30:08.297
"a patient has to jump
through to get help.

00:30:08.297 --> 00:30:09.987
"It sounds pathetic at my age,

00:30:09.987 --> 00:30:11.687
"but I need someone to hold my hand.

00:30:11.687 --> 00:30:13.287
"I don't know what I am doing,

00:30:13.287 --> 00:30:15.127
"but no one understands that I need that

00:30:15.127 --> 00:30:17.350
"and there's definitely
nobody willing to do it."

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:20.753
I think this goes back to
Finn's paperwork point.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.930
The accessibility of facilities,

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:28.120
of course, are a big deal.

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.310
Really doesn't take a whole lot

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:30.470
to modify things so that

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:33.100
you can meet the needs of
most people on the spectrum.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.650
Right now, these offices are
set up for the physicians.

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:37.853
They are not set up for the patients.

00:30:44.317 --> 00:30:45.950
And then, of course,

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:50.720
there's a discrimination
and stigma about autism,

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.670
which was part of everything.

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:55.090
Some autistic participants
were very hesitant

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:58.557
to disclose their diagnosis
due to fear of discrimination.

00:30:58.557 --> 00:31:00.727
"I'm very careful when
it comes to disclosing

00:31:00.727 --> 00:31:03.887
"my autism diagnosis to
my healthcare providers

00:31:03.887 --> 00:31:06.680
"because I fear it's gonna
affect my healthcare."

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.120
Others worried that providers

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.863
would share common
misconceptions about autism.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:15.870
And, finally, the autistic
participants in our sample

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:18.507
noted challenges related
to other societal issues

00:31:18.507 --> 00:31:20.729
that are well-known to affect health,

00:31:20.729 --> 00:31:23.380
basic self-determinants of health,

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:26.410
which they often attributed to
disability-related challenges

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.593
in obtaining or sustaining employment.

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:34.310
Early on, we also surveyed,

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:37.080
did a brief survey of 129 PCPs

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.140
and found that, while most of them

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:42.548
felt uncomfortable taking care
of people on the spectrum,

00:31:42.548 --> 00:31:43.890
and most of them

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:48.890
had no plans to attend a
CME like this, most of them

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:52.233
would accept an autistic patient
into their practice anyway.

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:55.530
However, they did say that

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:58.210
they would look for
information on the internet,

00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:02.530
that they would read a customized report,

00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:04.870
and that, if a patient
brought something to them,

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:06.800
they would appreciate their effort.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:11.580
So that is really,

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.730
all together, all of those patient parts

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:15.540
and that feedback from physicians,

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:18.443
is what went into the
AASPIRE Healthcare Toolkit.

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:20.930
We developed it collaboratively

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:24.390
using our CBPR process as I described.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:27.970
The content and the form was
based on our study findings

00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:31.530
and from also the insight from

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:34.390
the people with lived
experience on our team.

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:38.493
And that includes
clinical lived experience.

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:44.700
It resulted in a website for
both providers and patients

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:48.930
with worksheets, checklists,
resources, information,

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:51.940
and then the Autism
Healthcare Accommodations Tool

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:56.940
which is a place where
patients, supporters,

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.180
direct-support providers, providers,

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:03.180
can go in and check off
things that help accommodate,

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:06.170
to help remove some of these
barriers that we learned about.

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:07.900
And then there's a computer program

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:10.880
that translates all of
that into doctor-speak,

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.240
and puts it in a format that's
then accessible to doctors

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:17.640
because doctors need accessible formats.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:21.530
I went to see a neurologist
about migraines once

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:24.810
and I brought in a whole
bunch of paperwork on

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:26.510
exactly what my accommodations were

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:28.150
and all of these things about me.

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:29.921
I had an incredibly negative experience

00:33:29.921 --> 00:33:32.990
and I got nothing resolved
and it was terrible.

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:36.360
Christina, who's in internal medicine,

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:39.087
the person who had an office
next to her was saying,

00:33:39.087 --> 00:33:42.157
"You know, gosh, my wife
had this autistic person

00:33:42.157 --> 00:33:44.169
"come into her office
who brought in (laughs)

00:33:44.169 --> 00:33:45.413
(audience laughing)

00:33:45.413 --> 00:33:48.747
"this 10-page volume about everything

00:33:48.747 --> 00:33:50.467
"and my wife was so overwhelmed

00:33:50.467 --> 00:33:53.240
"and she had no idea what to do."

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.690
And that was me, so (laughing)

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:59.150
So our goal here was to take my 10 pages

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:00.380
and to turn it into something

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:04.863
that's not gonna terrify
the neurologist. (laughing)

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:11.900
So after, oh, I guess I should finish up.

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:14.150
I got too excited with my story.

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:16.950
So we did some testing of that.

00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:18.930
We did cognitive interviews
to make sure that

00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:22.910
what we thought, the language,
the lay language, meant

00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:26.650
was also, we had autistic people,

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:28.160
as diverse a range as we could,

00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:30.570
come look at it, tell us
what they thought it said.

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:32.300
And then we tested to make sure

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.990
that it was reliable over time.

00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:37.870
And we did a little
evaluation of it that had

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:40.500
both a numeric quantitative survey

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:41.810
and some write-ins

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:43.550
where people could tell
us what they thought.

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:45.440
One group of participants,

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.370
we did a pre-post intervention design

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:51.510
with the intervention being
using the AHAT and the website.

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:53.740
And it was in just real-life.

00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:56.410
The autistic patients, they
completed the pre-survey

00:34:56.410 --> 00:34:59.120
either directly or with
the help of a supporter.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.240
They used the AHAT

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.720
to create a
personalized-accommodations report

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:03.600
and then they could choose

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:07.740
whether for us to send it
to their provider or not.

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:10.190
Then we gave them free
access to the Toolkit.

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:12.900
And a month later did a post-survey

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.810
and our instruments were
around like, healthcare

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:18.170
self-efficacy,
patient-provider communication,

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:19.760
healthcare utilization.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.360
We had questions about those barriers

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:25.090
from that initial 66 list item.

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:26.830
That's what we were looking at.

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:31.830
We got a pretty diverse group
of participants to take it.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:34.939
170 of them.

00:35:34.939 --> 00:35:38.980
And we really we're
not expecting anything.

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:39.940
It was a month.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:44.470
It was a month of a passive intervention

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:46.760
and we thought we were like just testing

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.260
to make sure people could
answer our measures.

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:53.830
But, we got a really good, first of all,

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:55.710
really good feedback in terms of that

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:57.110
it was easy to understand,

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:59.563
it was important, it was useful,

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.760
that people would recommend
it to friends and providers.

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.520
Providers thought it was useful,

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:08.113
that they would recommend it to patients.

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:12.810
And then, most surprisingly,

00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:16.640
we found that there was actually
a significant reduction in

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:19.523
people's perceptions of
their barriers to healthcare,

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:23.227
an increase in healthcare self-efficacy

00:36:23.227 --> 00:36:25.860
and an increase in
patient-provider communication.

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.907
We were like, "This has to be a mistake.

00:36:27.907 --> 00:36:29.217
"This is just a month."

00:36:30.056 --> 00:36:32.870
But, because we had the write-ins,

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:35.340
we were able to really get some idea

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:38.370
about why this actually made
a difference in people's lives

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:40.330
even though there wasn't time

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:42.260
for them to even see their doctor.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:45.230
And one of the big things
is that it gave a means

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:48.563
for people to clarify and
communicate their needs.

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:52.467
- One of the participants said,

00:36:52.467 --> 00:36:54.767
"Filling out the survey helped me clarify

00:36:54.767 --> 00:36:57.357
"some things which I
was only vaguely aware.

00:36:57.357 --> 00:36:58.977
"It also helped put into words,

00:36:58.977 --> 00:37:00.787
"things I'm unable to communicate

00:37:00.787 --> 00:37:03.177
"because I cannot think
of the right words."

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:09.170
- It was also really validating

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:10.660
to a lot of people who thought

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:13.360
they were the only ones who
were having these experiences

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:16.170
or that they were
somehow weak or deficient

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:18.580
because they were having
their experiences.

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:21.630
So it validated their experience

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:24.633
and empowered them to be
better self-advocates.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.667
- Another participant said,

00:37:27.667 --> 00:37:28.897
"It was validating.

00:37:28.897 --> 00:37:31.057
"Previously I felt that

00:37:31.057 --> 00:37:32.937
"some of the the things I was doing,

00:37:32.937 --> 00:37:36.267
"like bringing support with
me, was a sign of weakness.

00:37:36.267 --> 00:37:39.417
"Now, I view it as a
part of accommodation.

00:37:39.417 --> 00:37:40.887
"It also gave me some ideas

00:37:40.887 --> 00:37:43.097
"of things to try that
I hadn't thought of."

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:52.430
- It also improved self-efficacy

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:54.420
by helping people prepare for visits

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:57.103
and feel solid in what they were doing.

00:37:58.697 --> 00:38:00.027
- "It takes away a lot of

00:38:00.027 --> 00:38:02.677
"my uncertainty about the appointments.

00:38:02.677 --> 00:38:05.117
"Whether I'll bring up
everything I wanna bring up,

00:38:05.117 --> 00:38:08.217
"whether I ask the right
questions about followup care

00:38:08.217 --> 00:38:12.047
"and being prepared for
talking to new doctors.

00:38:12.047 --> 00:38:13.827
"It's a game changer for me."

00:38:17.523 --> 00:38:20.510
- Most did voice enthusiasm

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:22.593
about their effect on the provider.

00:38:24.527 --> 00:38:26.257
- "Y'all sent things to the doctor

00:38:26.257 --> 00:38:28.837
"so maybe this time he'll listen to me."

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:33.390
- However, we did have a minority

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:37.250
who voiced concerns about
their PCPs not appreciating it

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:39.833
or it possibly making things even worse.

00:38:41.287 --> 00:38:45.067
- "When I asked my psychiatrist
to not use air fresheners,

00:38:45.067 --> 00:38:47.877
"she said she had to or
else her office smelled

00:38:47.877 --> 00:38:51.147
"and she acted like it was
a really big burden on her.

00:38:51.147 --> 00:38:53.787
"I think that if I had
handed your nice letter

00:38:53.787 --> 00:38:55.267
"to my physicians they would think

00:38:55.267 --> 00:38:56.987
"I'm asking too much of them.

00:38:56.987 --> 00:38:58.031
"I already stand out.

00:38:58.031 --> 00:39:00.147
"I don't wanna stand out more."

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:08.700
- They also left for us some
examples of actual change

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:11.100
that happened in a month,
which was pretty cool.

00:39:12.487 --> 00:39:14.627
- "I brought a copy of
the accommodation letter

00:39:14.627 --> 00:39:16.487
"in case he had not received it.

00:39:16.487 --> 00:39:20.607
"He had and it was already
scanned and into his computer.

00:39:20.607 --> 00:39:24.137
"He went over it with me and
did what had been recommended.

00:39:24.137 --> 00:39:26.327
"I was reassured that the doctor

00:39:26.327 --> 00:39:28.987
"was taking the accommodation
letter seriously.

00:39:28.987 --> 00:39:31.347
"I felt like some of the
difficulties I experienced

00:39:31.347 --> 00:39:32.897
"were addressed and that
they wouldn't have been

00:39:32.897 --> 00:39:35.477
"had I not made use of
the Healthcare Toolkit."

00:39:36.427 --> 00:39:38.067
"I think the Toolkit validated

00:39:38.067 --> 00:39:40.147
"that my concerns and
my daughter's issues,

00:39:40.147 --> 00:39:42.427
"sensory, behavioral, et cetera,

00:39:42.427 --> 00:39:44.617
"which often presented
during medical appointments,

00:39:44.617 --> 00:39:48.217
"were typical for ASD patients
and should be accommodated."

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.930
- So from the primary care providers,

00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:56.103
most did appreciate the Toolkit's utility.

00:39:58.217 --> 00:39:59.567
- "Extremely helpful.

00:39:59.567 --> 00:40:01.267
"What I needed were specific,

00:40:01.267 --> 00:40:03.157
"but concise, suggestions regarding

00:40:03.157 --> 00:40:05.327
"how to make my patient more comfortable.

00:40:05.327 --> 00:40:06.937
"The report will be in her chart

00:40:06.937 --> 00:40:09.520
"and I will use it as each visit."

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.360
- However, we did have some providers

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:13.247
who just sort of poo-pooed it and said,

00:40:13.247 --> 00:40:14.080
"Oh, I don't need this

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.690
"because I already know
my patient really well,"

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:19.460
which, I don't know, might be the case.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:20.590
And two providers said that

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:22.290
they just didn't have time for it.

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:31.350
I am now going to pass my poor clicking

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:34.440
off to Clarissa who's going to tell you

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:38.503
more about the Toolkit itself
and give you a tour and ...

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:45.500
- So here it is. Use it. (laughs)

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:46.593
Take a picture.

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:52.930
There's a sample of an
accommodation letter.

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:54.110
There's a couple samples of

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:56.540
accommodation letters in your packet

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:59.140
so you can see what that
looks like for the doctors.

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:05.990
Here's what the Toolkit looks like

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:08.860
and how you can use it to improve care.

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:12.090
It's primarily designed to
assist healthcare providers,

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:15.410
patients, and their supporters
who are accessing care.

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:17.390
It's split into two parts.

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:20.570
There's a section targeted at
patients and their supporters

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:23.260
and another part for healthcare providers.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:26.400
It consists of information and worksheets

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.890
and the interactive tool that
we've been talking about,

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:33.000
that helps create the
personalized-accommodation report.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.560
The color themes and the
font sizes can be changed

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.240
to meet user needs and preferences,

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:43.120
as well as an array of
accessibility features.

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.081
It has read-aloud options.

00:41:45.081 --> 00:41:48.050
It's accessible to screen readers.

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:51.730
It has ways to collapse
and simplify information

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:54.250
for less clutter and distraction.

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:57.380
In other words, all
that work that we put in

00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:00.730
to learning how to work
effectively with autistic people,

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:03.890
was built right into the
structure of the tool,

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:06.588
and makes it a very
different kind of website

00:42:06.588 --> 00:42:11.573
than others that are on the market.

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:16.830
The section on Healthcare Providers

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:19.830
includes basic information on autism.

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:21.824
It has tips for providing care,

00:42:21.824 --> 00:42:25.360
discussions of legal and
ethical considerations,

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:28.530
such as how to obtain
informed consent, and

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:32.180
information on medical conditions
and resources and links.

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:36.730
And, again, this is all generated from

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:41.730
this very robust process,
collaborative process,

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:45.320
so very much informed by
people's learned experiences

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:48.543
as well as the academic input.

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.300
The Patients &amp; Supporters section

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:57.740
has information on healthcare,
staying healthy, rights,

00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:59.500
and it has checklists and worksheets

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:02.570
to help people access and
manage their healthcare.

00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:04.700
For example, there are tools to help

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:08.090
walk people through the process
of making an appointment,

00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:10.330
what to bring to an appointment,

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:13.183
and worksheets to help people
describe their symptoms.

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.640
Of course, it has the
personalized-accommodations report

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.173
you can see at the top there.

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.650
When you go into that

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:30.570
personalized-accommodation report tool,

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:35.570
here is an example of the
kinds of questions there are.

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:37.217
So, this question is,

00:43:37.217 --> 00:43:39.237
"What can help you make good decisions

00:43:39.237 --> 00:43:40.620
"about your healthcare?"

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:42.837
And you can pick up to, oh, thanks,

00:43:42.837 --> 00:43:46.350
You can pick up to three choices.

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:49.377
So, possible suggestions
include things like,

00:43:49.377 --> 00:43:51.967
"Give me very blunt and concrete examples

00:43:51.967 --> 00:43:54.227
"of what could happen if I did or did not

00:43:54.227 --> 00:43:56.240
"follow a recommendation."

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:58.357
Or "Let me discuss my choices first

00:43:58.357 --> 00:44:01.470
"with a person I trust and
then come back to you."

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:03.890
I think that's a really important point,

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:06.310
not just from this tool, but in

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:10.860
applying the processes that we
were talking about with Dora

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:14.920
and about how

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:17.730
people may not be able to

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:20.300
participate in a healthcare appointment

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.160
or in a person-centered planning meeting

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:26.650
or in a research group or
another group in real-time.

00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:29.041
And so, being able to step back

00:44:29.041 --> 00:44:32.300
and do some of the work in other settings

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:33.552
can allow people to participate

00:44:33.552 --> 00:44:35.600
rather than just assuming that,

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.530
if they can't participate in real-time,

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:39.470
that they can't participate at all.

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:41.563
I think that's really important.

00:44:41.563 --> 00:44:45.860
Often people are worried that

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:47.228
if they get an accommodation letter,

00:44:47.228 --> 00:44:50.060
it's going to have a lot of
money associated with it,

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:52.640
it's going to be difficult to implement

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.530
or complicated to implement.

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:56.630
Sometimes people need
things that cost money

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:59.150
and sometimes it does take time and effort

00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:00.710
and I don't wanna minimize that,

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:03.470
but a lot of the most effective things

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:05.162
are pretty simple and easy.

00:45:05.162 --> 00:45:06.711
The trick is to know what they are

00:45:06.711 --> 00:45:10.080
and you can actually save a lot of time

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:14.183
and save a lot of money
by getting it right.

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:22.480
The Office of Developmental
Primary Care at UCSF

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.740
isn't a research group,

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:26.730
but we apply many of the same principles

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:29.930
to our clinical and training work.

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:33.040
And, we also partner with stakeholders,

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.810
a variety of stakeholders,
to create resources

00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:40.070
that are also available
free on our website.

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:41.190
There it is up there.

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:42.320
You can visit it. It's free.

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:43.270
It's there for you.

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:46.063
I wanna share some of those resources

00:45:46.063 --> 00:45:49.290
which are complementary to the Toolkit.

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:51.281
For example, we have a whole section

00:45:51.281 --> 00:45:53.750
on advice from self-advocates.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:57.780
So, one-pagers on sensory symptoms,

00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:01.840
on how to work with
people who accompany us

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:03.490
to our medical appointments

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:06.480
written by Melissa Crisp-Cooper here.

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.453
We're honored to have you here today.

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:13.700
We have more specific information

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:18.270
about how to access
resources in California.

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:21.610
The Toolkit for AASPIRE
is a national project,

00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:26.260
whereas our website has
California-specific information.

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:28.510
And, we have information on

00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:30.700
supported healthcare decision-making,

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:33.740
on understanding
aggression and self-injury,

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:37.700
managing meltdowns,
successful community living

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:40.809
and transition and also

00:46:40.809 --> 00:46:44.230
resources on communication
access and much, much more.

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:45.080
There's also

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:51.100
different tracking forms
to track your healthcare,

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:53.730
like seizures or bowel
movements or other things.

00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:55.833
There's a wealth of information there.

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.920
I wanna talk a little bit about

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:03.040
one of our newer resources

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:06.360
which is on communication access.

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:10.730
The most important accommodation
for any appointment

00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:12.113
is communication.

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:16.133
Communication is the
foundation of patient care.

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.210
Everybody communicates.

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:20.173
Find a way!

00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:23.930
Supporters are important
and, with permission,

00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:26.650
can certainly provide a lot of information

00:47:26.650 --> 00:47:28.860
that's helpful to supplement,

00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:31.490
but only a patient can tell you

00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:33.350
about their thoughts, feelings

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:36.490
and internal experiences and motivations.

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:38.530
And I'll tell you a
little story about this.

00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:43.110
I had an autistic patient
who came in with her sister

00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:44.760
who didn't actually
know her all that well,

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:46.630
because her mother had
been providing her care

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:49.390
and her mother passed away, unfortunately,

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:53.730
before she assisted with
making an accommodation letter

00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:54.710
'cause had she done that,

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:56.460
we would have been in better shape.

00:47:57.450 --> 00:48:01.300
But, the sister was very insistent

00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:03.730
that she could not
provide me with a history.

00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:05.180
And she thought something was wrong,

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:06.610
but she didn't know what.

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:10.610
And, she was non-speaking

00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:12.150
and I didn't know how
to communicate with her

00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:14.340
and had no information from her supporter.

00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:17.207
So, I said, "Well, we
don't know what's going on.

00:48:17.207 --> 00:48:18.580
"Let's just try."

00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:20.870
So I just, I didn't know what to do,

00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:22.220
but I just started trying things.

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:23.840
So I sat her in front of my computer

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.610
to see if she'd type, and she did type,

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:27.740
but nothing that I could interpret.

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:31.280
And then I tried giving her choices.

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.160
That didn't work.

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:37.160
I pulled out, I have a
bunch of anatomy pictures,

00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:39.520
and I pulled them out

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.660
and flipped through the anatomy pictures

00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:44.930
to see if she would light
up or point to anything.

00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:48.270
And, I said, "Show me how you say yes,"

00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:49.600
and observed carefully

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:53.650
to see if she would make
a sound or make a motion

00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:55.500
or make an expression that might help me

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.970
to understand how she says yes and no.

00:48:57.970 --> 00:48:59.950
And that didn't work.

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:02.910
So, I just said, "Touch hurt."

00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:05.060
And she took my hand

00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:07.533
and she put it on her
right upper-quadrant,

00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:11.770
and, based solely on that communication,

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:15.283
I ordered a sonogram
and she had gallstones.

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:19.123
It's a really hard diagnosis
to make without a history.

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:22.550
And without her help,

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:23.525
her sister didn't know,

00:49:23.525 --> 00:49:26.923
I would have never made that
diagnosis without her help.

00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:33.862
I wouldn't say that I always have success,

00:49:33.862 --> 00:49:38.862
but my success rate is, and
all of our success rate,

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:39.873
is a lot higher when we try. (laughs)

00:49:39.873 --> 00:49:42.562
(audience laughs)

00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:47.810
And I'm often surprised.

00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:51.194
I'm often skeptical that
my efforts will go anywhere

00:49:51.194 --> 00:49:54.543
and, more often than not, they do.

00:49:54.543 --> 00:49:58.350
Just the effort sends a
message to the patient

00:49:58.350 --> 00:50:00.320
that makes them try harder too.

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.200
So, if you're not trying,

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.810
They're so used to being ignored.

00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:06.580
They're so used to not having
people engage like that

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:08.880
that there's often a lot
of learned helplessness

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.600
and they can actually
communicate a lot better

00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:12.200
than they typically do

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.170
because they don't think
anyone's listening.

00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:15.570
So why would you try

00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:18.510
if you don't think
anyone's paying attention?

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:20.660
And also, without some of that support,

00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:21.817
like, "Touch hurt,"

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:25.630
she might not have thought that
I would have interpret her,

00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:28.990
Maybe she would have thought that,

00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:29.860
she would have been afraid that

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:33.030
I would interpret her taking
my hand and putting it on her

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:35.491
as an act of aggression
or something like that

00:50:35.491 --> 00:50:37.391
and would have been too afraid to try.

00:50:42.381 --> 00:50:44.710
So, we have a tool.

00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:48.040
So, many patients come

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:52.420
without a fluent form of
expressive communication

00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:53.750
available to them.

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:56.730
And, this is one of our newest resources,

00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:58.930
which is a Communication Toolkit,

00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:01.428
that was also developed
in collaboration with

00:51:01.428 --> 00:51:05.070
self-advocates from the
Autistic Self Advocacy Network

00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:06.682
and it includes practical advice

00:51:06.682 --> 00:51:10.610
on how to recognize good
communication supports.

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:14.800
The components of a good
assessment that take into account

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:18.130
sensory, motor, and cognitive impairments.

00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:20.980
It discusses how to choose
an assessment professional

00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:25.480
and how to get supports
and assessments funded.

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:27.133
So, I hope you'll use that.

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:41.940
- Thank you so much for listening to us

00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:43.533
at the very end of the day.

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:47.910
From this work we've learned
that our CBPR process

00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:49.950
has resulted in a highly-accessible

00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:52.480
and usable healthcare toolkit.

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:55.690
It has the potential to
decrease barriers to healthcare,

00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:57.600
improve healthcare self-efficacy

00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:59.713
in patient-provider communication.

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:03.770
We're currently testing it
in some healthcare systems

00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:07.180
because we don't, even
though things got better,

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:10.090
that's not really good efficacy data yet.

00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:13.500
So we're working toward
getting real efficacy data.

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.490
And changes might have been driven by

00:52:15.490 --> 00:52:19.230
changes in self-awareness
and self-advocacy, as well as

00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:24.230
changes by patient and provider
behaviors or attitudes.

00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:27.850
So the implications.

00:52:27.850 --> 00:52:30.670
Please use our toolkits.

00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:33.750
They are available for free here.

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:38.750
The tools may be helpful to
patients with other disabilities

00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:41.760
or even just patients
with low health literacy.

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:45.370
There's a lot of teaching things about

00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:48.113
just how the healthcare
system works on the site.

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:51.480
Healthcare systems should find ways

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:54.980
to incorporate these tools
into their clinical practice.

00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:59.290
And, other groups attempting
to develop stuff of any sort

00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:00.710
from marginalized populations

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:04.923
should consider using a CBPR approach.

00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:09.100
A big thank you to the
AASPIRE team members

00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:12.310
who are really who made
all of this happen.

00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:14.270
To the Autistic Self Advocacy Network,

00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:17.060
who's been our partner
since almost day one.

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:19.330
The Oregon Commission on
Autism Spectrum Disorder

00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:22.000
who was full of physicians

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:25.120
who really helped us get
the letter in a good format.

00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:27.173
All our study participants.

00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:33.280
And, I will, at this point,

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:37.180
just leave the links and the
tools and our contact info up.

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:40.240
We'd love to answer questions
about anything you just heard

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:43.530
or anything you'd like to
ask us from our experience,

00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:45.200
any of my projects.

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:48.923
And I also have a novel
coming out later this spring.

00:53:50.423 --> 00:53:51.256
So, you can,

00:53:51.256 --> 00:53:53.757
science fiction with
a disabled heroine, so

00:53:53.757 --> 00:53:54.590
(audience cheers and applauds)

00:53:54.590 --> 00:53:55.878
you should look forward to that.

00:53:55.878 --> 00:53:59.128
(audience applauding)
