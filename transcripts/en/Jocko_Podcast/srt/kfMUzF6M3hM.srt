1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,020
Our mistakes are nothing new or startling.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,493
[inaudible]

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,920
think about that. Most of the time,

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:14,780
most of the time, think about this. Most
of the time when you make a mistake,

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,480
it's something that you already knew.

6
00:00:17,481 --> 00:00:20,270
You actually know you're making
the mistake when you're making it.

7
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:22,323
Okay?

8
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,140
Here's another thing he says,

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,270
errors spell the difference between
professionalism and mediocrity.

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,080
It's the little things. It's the
little mistakes that you make.

11
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,910
Next thing he thinks says discipline
soldiers are the main ingredient in

12
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:43,580
victory. Well, guess what?

13
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:48,230
The main ingredient in victory
in your life is discipline. Yeah.

14
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,070
All Day. All Day.

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:57,370
He says there's no magic formula or
sweat list's solution by which one can

16
00:00:57,771 --> 00:01:02,690
achieve their goals. I think
he just said, there is no,

17
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,490
there is no shortcut. There is no hack.
There's no sweat list solution. You,

18
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,260
you're gone. I have to work.

19
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,170
Then he says this, no military unit is
ever completely trained. Guess what?

20
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:18,630
Neither are you. Neither am I.

21
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,390
There is always weakness to
work on. Always a lot of them.

22
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,933
Hmm.

23
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,790
He says this in Vietnam, primer combat
is too serious of business to permit.

24
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,580
Easy excuse of even one mistake.

25
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,823
Okay?

26
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,150
Now think about this. Okay? Comments,
too serious of business. Why is that?

27
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,480
It's cause you can die. But guess
what? We're all going to die.

28
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,680
We're all going to die. So why would we,

29
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:56,420
why would we allow ourselves
to make easy, easy excuses?

30
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,930
Why would you allow that?
Hmm? Combat is life and death.

31
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,580
So is life

32
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,520
so you shouldn't allow yourself these
easy excuses. And in the last section

33
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,610
that he, that he talks about that I
read, it can absolutely be applied.

34
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,650
It can absolutely, absolutely be
applied. He says another weakness,

35
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,830
common among junior leaders
is the inaccurate reporting
of the estimate of the

36
00:02:27,471 --> 00:02:28,304
situation.

37
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:33,610
They are either so exaggerated or
Wolff so watered down that they are not

38
00:02:34,101 --> 00:02:34,934
meaningful.

39
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,263
[inaudible].

40
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,580
Now again, if you apply this
to yourself, what you realize

41
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:44,990
[inaudible]

42
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:48,470
is that you got these junior leaders that
they're lying to the chain of command.

43
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:50,990
I mean they're, they're exaggerating
or they're watering things down,

44
00:02:50,991 --> 00:02:52,670
but they're basically lying
to the chain of command.

45
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,000
And how does that translate
to us? We lie to ourselves.

46
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,343
Mm.

47
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,790
That's how it translates
to us. Lie to ourselves.

48
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,050
We don't tell ourselves the way
things really are and when we do that,

49
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,650
then we can't fix our problems.
If we can't fix our problems,

50
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:13,120
we're not going to improve. So we
have to be truthful to ourselves.

51
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,660
Okay?

52
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,260
I have to be truthful to myself.
You have to be truthful to yourself.

53
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,710
You have to stop rationalizing,
stop making excuses.

54
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,570
Stop telling yourself little water down
the assessments of where you're really

55
00:03:26,571 --> 00:03:28,670
at, telling yourself the truth

56
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,690
so that you can get where you want
to go. You can be who you want to be.

57
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:39,730
You can be who you should be,

58
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:46,730
who you should be. When you do
what you know you should do.

59
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:51,410
When you pay attention to the little
things, when you implement discipline,

60
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:57,320
true and unflinching and on mitigated
discipline in your life. When you stop,

61
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,860
when you stop trying to
find a sweat list solution,

62
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,870
when you look for weaknesses to work on,

63
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,080
when you allow no easy
excuses and all that starts,

64
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,430
when you stop lying to yourself,

65
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,550
can you stop lying to yourself?
That's when you can be calm,

66
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,350
who you know you should be.

67
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,500
When you tell yourself the truth about
where you are so you can make sure you

68
00:04:26,661 --> 00:04:29,720
are in the right place, and if
you're not in the right place,

69
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:32,210
that you can get yourself
on the path to get there.

70
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,040
The path of discipline, the path
of hard work, and the path of

71
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,440
truth.
