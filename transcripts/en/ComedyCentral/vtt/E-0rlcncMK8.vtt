00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:01.968
- Have you ever done
crowd work and realized

00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:03.336
in the middle that the
guy is with a prostitute?

00:00:03.369 --> 00:00:04.237
- No, really?

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.638
- I have, I've been like,
"Hello, sir.

00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:06.539
"That's your date?

00:00:06.572 --> 00:00:08.341
"She's looking sparkly.

00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:09.208
"What's your name?

00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:10.076
(laughing)

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:10.743
"Mercedes?

00:00:10.776 --> 00:00:12.345
"Wait a minute.

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:13.746
"I'm moving on."

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:14.647
(laughing)

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.084
(energetic rock music)

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:20.053
- [Nikki] Whoa!

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:21.221
- 'Cause what do you do?

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:22.755
I've also done crowd work
to a pregnant woman smoking

00:00:22.788 --> 00:00:25.224
way before I had, you know, any
authority.

00:00:25.257 --> 00:00:27.060
You gotta be the headliner
to tackle that one.

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:27.894
- Oh yeah.

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:29.295
- The opener can't be like,
"Hello.

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:31.164
"You're giving your fetus
emphysema.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.665
"Let's get this show going!"

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:33.699
- [Nikki] Where were you?

00:00:33.732 --> 00:00:35.134
- "Doctor Demento!"

00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:35.802
(laughing)

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:36.669
Milwaukee.

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:37.536
- And they were smoking?

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.537
First of all, they are smoking
inside.

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:40.640
- It was... Yeah, I mean
I've been doing comedy.

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:41.707
So have you right?

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.574
- [Nikki] Yeah.

00:00:42.608 --> 00:00:43.142
- I mean you've done comedy long
enough

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:44.310
for the smoking inside.

00:00:44.343 --> 00:00:45.311
- [Nikki] Yeah.

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:45.745
- Remember when people
would blow smoke at you?

00:00:45.778 --> 00:00:46.579
- [Nikki] Ugh.

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:47.446
- That was my least favorite
hell.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.514
- Oh, when I used to host at the
Improv,

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:52.385
so this is like 1989, and
you could smoke there,

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:53.786
and I would be there from eight
o'clock

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:56.222
until 1:30 in the morning,
and I would come home,

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:57.857
and it was like I had
five packs of cigarettes.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.093
- That's a great Seinfeld joke,
too.

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:02.195
He goes like, "I secondhand
smoked five packs a day".

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:03.696
Because of, I don't know if he
had five,

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:05.164
but it was essentially five.

00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:07.133
- I sit next to someone on a
plane

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.836
that has smoked, and it's on
their jacket, and I'm coughing.

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.171
- Do you want to get real fancy
pants?

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:12.838
- [Nikki] Yeah.

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:14.107
- If a makeup artist smokes,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.774
- [Nikki] Oh nope.

00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:15.641
- [Judd] Yeah.

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:16.542
- And here come their yellow tar
fingers

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:17.610
right to your eyeball, and
you're like,

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:19.812
"I don't want to go to
flavor country right now."

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:20.680
(laughing)

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:21.681
"Thank you very kindly."

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:22.515
I don't know what that voice is.

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:24.117
- And they get so mad if you
said,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.784
"Can you wash your hands?

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:25.651
"They're kind of stinky."

00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:26.518
- Oh, sure.

00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:27.753
- Enjoy the next 40 minutes of
that.

00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:32.225
- Yeah, I'd rather they just
ate like a sauerkraut sandwich.

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:33.126
- Absolutely.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.060
It's so gross,

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:35.862
and I can't believe we all put
up with it

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:36.863
for so long.

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:37.564
- I know.

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:38.431
Dude, I worked at Bennigan's.

00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:40.266
We used to work in the smoking
section.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:41.667
The Monte Cristo's
already going to kill you.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.871
Do you have to send a pack
of Kools in chasing after.

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:45.839
(laughing)

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:46.940
- I love the concept
of the smoking section

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:49.876
like the smoke didn't reach
the non-smoking section.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.177
- It's like the air section.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.612
"Can I be in the oxygen
section?"

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:53.446
"Well, there's oxygen
coming from over there."

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.214
- I remember smoking on the
plane.

00:01:55.247 --> 00:01:56.249
- Really?

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:57.583
- I remember being a kid.

00:01:57.616 --> 00:01:58.784
- Did you ever smoke, Judd?

00:01:58.817 --> 00:02:02.155
- You know, my mom, when I
was a kid, gave me five bucks

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:05.324
to not smoke when I
was like six years old,

00:02:05.357 --> 00:02:08.161
and for some reason, I
felt like I needed to honor

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:08.995
that agreement.

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:10.263
- That almost just made me tear
up.

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:11.264
I don't know why.

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:13.766
That is so sweet because
that does do something

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:14.634
to you as a kid.

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:15.501
"I'm being paid--

00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:16.435
- It's your job.

00:02:16.468 --> 00:02:17.303
- "For this promise I'm making."

00:02:17.336 --> 00:02:18.604
And $5 as a kid is a lot.

00:02:18.637 --> 00:02:19.572
That's a great system.

00:02:19.605 --> 00:02:22.241
- And she struggled to
quit smoking always.

00:02:22.274 --> 00:02:24.877
She went to this thing when I
was a kid called Smoke Enders.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.445
- My mom went to Smoke Enders.

00:02:26.478 --> 00:02:27.313
- [Judd] Really?

00:02:27.346 --> 00:02:28.180
- Yeah, it worked.

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:29.549
- One of the things, she'd get a
little

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:32.385
like a glass thing,

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:34.420
and she would put all her
cigarette butts in it,

00:02:34.453 --> 00:02:35.588
and there was water in it,

00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:36.622
and it stunk.

00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:37.590
- Yeah.
- Ugh.

00:02:37.623 --> 00:02:38.891
- And then she would
have to try to sniff it

00:02:38.924 --> 00:02:41.694
before she decided to smoke

00:02:41.727 --> 00:02:43.196
to be disgusted by it.

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.863
- Great idea.
- That is a great idea.

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:44.730
- None of it ever worked.

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:45.798
- It didn't?

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:46.666
- No.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:47.567
Oh, never.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.067
- It didn't take.
- She kept smoking?

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:49.268
- She kept smoking

00:02:49.301 --> 00:02:49.935
- Yeah.
- Wow.

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:50.636
She was a Smoke Ender ender.

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:51.637
- [Judd] All the way to the end.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.505
- Wow.

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:53.372
- She was a smoke end?

00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:54.440
- Smoke Ender ender.

00:02:54.473 --> 00:02:56.609
Look, I don't smoke, but
if I could go back in time

00:02:56.642 --> 00:02:58.444
and light up a cigarette on an
airplane,

00:02:58.477 --> 00:02:59.645
I would fucking do it.

00:02:59.678 --> 00:03:00.513
(laughing)

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:01.380
- [Nikki] I mean.

00:03:01.413 --> 00:03:02.348
- I would do it.

00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:03.583
I would get up just like a man
in the 70s.

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:04.650
I'd unbuckle my pants.

00:03:04.683 --> 00:03:06.285
Just for the relaxation.

00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:06.986
- Yeah.

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:07.820
- Just to kind of let it flap.

00:03:07.853 --> 00:03:08.521
Smoke a cigarette.

00:03:08.554 --> 00:03:09.889
Call the stewardess sweetheart.

00:03:09.922 --> 00:03:10.890
Come on!

00:03:10.923 --> 00:03:11.691
(laughing)

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:13.326
- There was like a smoking
section.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.428
Usually, it was like
the back of the plane,

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:17.463
and they'd have like a little
curtain.

00:03:17.496 --> 00:03:18.664
- Really?

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:19.799
- And the assumption that the
smoke wasn't going to just

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:22.368
be in the entire cylinder.
- The lungs of the plane.

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:23.302
Oh, gross.

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:24.704
But I bet when they smoke in
first class.

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:26.706
You can't have a little
section in the back

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:27.874
and not have the primos in the
front.

00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:30.876
- I bet you they had like
half of first class smoking

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:32.578
and half of coach smoking,

00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:34.714
but it was all ridiculous.

00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:36.816
- How could you sleep
if they guy next to you

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.784
was just sucking down a Marlboro
Light?

00:03:38.817 --> 00:03:40.353
- Because it was everywhere.

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:41.020
- [Pete] Yeah, you're right.

00:03:41.053 --> 00:03:41.887
- It was everywhere.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.821
- [Pete] You're right.

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:44.657
- I grew up with parents
who smoked inside,

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.293
and I had chronic sinus
infections as a kid.

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:49.762
I had like a line in my nose
from always going like this

00:03:49.795 --> 00:03:50.730
all the time.

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:51.798
- [Pete] Oh, no.

00:03:51.831 --> 00:03:52.498
- Just one of those kids
that was just constantly,

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:53.799
and we go, "What is going on?

00:03:53.832 --> 00:03:55.301
"What are her allergies?"

00:03:55.334 --> 00:03:56.002
It turns out smoking

00:03:56.035 --> 00:03:57.536
- Yeah.
- Yeah, of course.

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.005
- Duh.
- Cut to me cascading my baby

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:01.741
with a humidifier that
looks like an elephant.

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:02.975
Like we've changed so much.

00:04:03.008 --> 00:04:03.943
- I know, we've changed.

00:04:03.976 --> 00:04:05.611
- Like the idea of being
like, "Hey, Duncan!

00:04:05.644 --> 00:04:06.545
"Get over here.

00:04:06.578 --> 00:04:07.546
"Bring the ashtray."

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:08.914
Like your little five year old.

00:04:08.947 --> 00:04:09.782
"Stay here.

00:04:09.815 --> 00:04:11.017
"Daddy's ashing."

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.385
- And you feel like a, you know.

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:13.453
I'm 34.

00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:16.622
It wasn't like I was a
kid in the 50s when it was

00:04:16.655 --> 00:04:17.456
(laughing)

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.325
they just beat you and blew
smoke.

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:21.794
- "This wasn't in the 50s."
- My parents knew better.

00:04:21.827 --> 00:04:22.728
My parents are progressive.
- "I wasn't working

00:04:22.761 --> 00:04:23.829
"at the GM plant."

00:04:23.862 --> 00:04:27.433
- Yeah, but still, there
were just egregious mistakes

00:04:27.466 --> 00:04:29.835
being made as parents that
they didn't know any better.

00:04:29.868 --> 00:04:30.936
- [Pete] I know, I know.

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:32.471
- My wife was just on a plane,

00:04:32.504 --> 00:04:34.307
and she said she was sitting
across

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.575
from a rabbi

00:04:36.608 --> 00:04:38.411
who was vaping.

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:39.078
(laughing)

00:04:39.111 --> 00:04:39.945
- [Pete] The vaping.

00:04:39.978 --> 00:04:40.646
- On the plane.

00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:41.681
- Matisyahu was on your plane.

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:42.548
(laughing)

00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:43.416
- No way?

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:44.250
Really?

00:04:44.283 --> 00:04:44.884
- Although this was a weird
story

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:45.752
that's not fully related,

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:47.887
but my daughter, Maude, was on a
plane,

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.855
and she was like, "I was
sitting next to this guy,

00:04:49.888 --> 00:04:51.891
"and like everyone kept walking
up to him,

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:53.559
"and asking for his autograph,

00:04:53.592 --> 00:04:55.695
"and I didn't know who it was.

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:57.596
"Who's Mr. T?"

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:58.698
- Hilarious.

00:04:58.731 --> 00:04:59.965
(laughing)

00:04:59.998 --> 00:05:00.832
Hilarious.

00:05:00.866 --> 00:05:02.468
One of the easiest autographs by
the way.

00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:03.536
Three letters.

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:04.237
- Oh, yeah.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.071
- And you don't use that period.

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:06.005
Just like You Up.

00:05:06.038 --> 00:05:07.440
No punctuation.

00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:09.608
"Where we're going, you
don't need punctuation."

00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:10.843
- Who's the most famous people
you've been

00:05:10.876 --> 00:05:11.911
on airplanes with?

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:12.812
- [Nikki] Oh, great question.

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:13.446
- You know I have a good one
about this

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.080
because I got on a plane,

00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:16.782
and Paul Giamatti got on.

00:05:16.815 --> 00:05:18.984
"How bout billions, billions,
billions?"

00:05:19.017 --> 00:05:19.685
- [Judd] Oh, nice.

00:05:19.718 --> 00:05:20.652
- And he sat right next to me,

00:05:20.686 --> 00:05:23.456
then ten minutes later,
Tom Selleck got on.

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:24.123
- Wow.

00:05:24.156 --> 00:05:24.990
- So I'm looking at it.

00:05:25.024 --> 00:05:26.959
He smells like leather and
burgundy.

00:05:26.992 --> 00:05:29.395
And I lean over to Paul
Giamatti, and I go,

00:05:29.428 --> 00:05:30.062
"I'm so sorry.

00:05:30.095 --> 00:05:31.464
"I never do this.

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:32.131
"Is that Tom Selleck?"

00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:34.500
(laughing)

00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:35.368
- Did he laugh?

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:36.669
- Did he love it?

00:05:36.702 --> 00:05:38.437
- "A cha cha."

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:39.505
He did his--

00:05:39.538 --> 00:05:40.873
- Are you the guy who
will talk to Paul Giamatti

00:05:40.906 --> 00:05:41.874
when he sits next to you?

00:05:41.907 --> 00:05:42.942
- No.

00:05:42.975 --> 00:05:44.577
You know, I feel bad, but
that story is not true.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.046
Everything except what I said is
not true.

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:47.913
- Oh, my God.

00:05:47.946 --> 00:05:48.781
You bastard.

00:05:48.814 --> 00:05:49.448
- Oh, no.

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:50.316
- I sat behind Nancy Reagan

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:50.883
once on a plane.
- I appreciate your--

00:05:50.916 --> 00:05:51.717
- But I will tell you

00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:52.651
what was true.
- Oh, Nancy Reagan.

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:54.587
- The reason I confessed it
wasn't true

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.155
was because I was like I was so
determined

00:05:56.188 --> 00:05:58.057
not to talk to Paul Giamatti
even though

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.527
Crashing season 3, January
20, shoots on the same stage

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.063
as Billions, and we have
a lot of the same crew.

00:06:04.096 --> 00:06:05.731
So I knew I had an in.

00:06:05.764 --> 00:06:06.432
- You had an in.

00:06:06.465 --> 00:06:08.134
- But guess who has restraint?

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:09.502
I don't eat cookies after nine,

00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:11.036
and I don't bother Giamatti.

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:11.970
(laughing)

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:13.038
- I was on a plane with Alan
Thicke once,

00:06:13.071 --> 00:06:15.841
and there was an enormous
amount of turbulence,

00:06:15.874 --> 00:06:17.977
and I thought, "I don't
think I'm going to die

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.011
"with Alan Thicke."

00:06:19.044 --> 00:06:20.012
(laughing)

00:06:20.045 --> 00:06:21.180
- And then I wasn't nervous.

00:06:21.213 --> 00:06:23.749
I'm like, "It's not going
to happen with Alan Thicke."

00:06:23.782 --> 00:06:24.450
- That's funny.

00:06:24.483 --> 00:06:25.284
- You just had a feeling that

00:06:25.317 --> 00:06:27.420
that's not how you're going
down.

00:06:27.453 --> 00:06:28.788
- Tarantino had that on a
turbulent plane,

00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:30.055
and he was writing Pulp Fiction.

00:06:30.088 --> 00:06:31.724
He goes, "I haven't finished my
movie."

00:06:31.757 --> 00:06:34.760
- I was on a plane when I was
a kid with Freddie Prinze.

00:06:34.793 --> 00:06:35.694
- Junior?
- Wow.

00:06:35.727 --> 00:06:37.596
- No, the original.

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:39.165
- Did he have a baby with him
though?

00:06:39.198 --> 00:06:40.032
That could have been--

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:41.200
- Was he smoking with unbuckled
pants?

00:06:41.233 --> 00:06:42.034
(laughing)

00:06:42.067 --> 00:06:42.902
"Hey, sweetheart."

00:06:42.935 --> 00:06:43.769
He calls you sweetheart.

00:06:43.802 --> 00:06:44.637
"Hey, sweetheart.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:45.504
"You a fan?"

00:06:45.537 --> 00:06:46.538
- Freddie Prinze.

00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:47.105
And I mean as like a
huge comedy fan early on,

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:48.641
were you freaking out?

00:06:48.674 --> 00:06:49.642
Did you go up to him?

00:06:49.675 --> 00:06:50.610
- Oh, yeah.

00:06:50.643 --> 00:06:51.410
I was little, but he
was a giant star then.

00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:52.511
And there's an episode of
Crashing

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:56.615
that we ended with the
theme to Chico and the Man,

00:06:56.648 --> 00:06:58.651
and it's my favorite
music cue I've ever put.

00:06:58.684 --> 00:06:59.618
- Really?

00:06:59.651 --> 00:07:00.285
- In anything.

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:01.253
- [Nikki] Oh, that's great.

00:07:01.286 --> 00:07:01.887
- And for some reason,
it's just so perfect

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.888
at the end of the episode.

00:07:02.921 --> 00:07:05.458
- Do you guys struggle
with turbulence still

00:07:05.491 --> 00:07:06.192
with all the traveling you do?

00:07:06.225 --> 00:07:07.059
- Yeah.

00:07:07.092 --> 00:07:07.993
I was on a plane.

00:07:08.027 --> 00:07:09.762
I think we're going to crash
every time.

00:07:09.795 --> 00:07:10.830
I was recently on a plane,

00:07:10.863 --> 00:07:11.964
and there was all this
turbulence.

00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:13.899
We were in first class
because HBO was flying us out.

00:07:13.932 --> 00:07:15.234
It was really fancy and nice,

00:07:15.267 --> 00:07:16.669
and the guy next to me,

00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:17.670
I was trying to be good.

00:07:17.703 --> 00:07:18.537
They kept offering us
like ice cream sundaes

00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:20.506
and liquor, and I was trying to
be good

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:21.540
because we were about to shoot.

00:07:21.573 --> 00:07:22.775
I was like, "No, no, I'm good."

00:07:22.808 --> 00:07:24.910
And the guy next to me,
I was hating this guy.

00:07:24.943 --> 00:07:27.746
Whenever I turned down
something, he would take mine.

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:28.547
- He had double ice cream?

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.049
- Yeah, so he had two ice
creams.

00:07:30.082 --> 00:07:31.484
He had two champagnes,

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:32.552
then he got really drunk.

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:35.788
Then he started watching
like Rampage or something.

00:07:35.821 --> 00:07:37.756
He reclined his seat before
takeoff.

00:07:37.789 --> 00:07:38.958
I don't care for that.

00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:40.059
Above the rules.

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:41.293
- No, I hate.

00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:43.596
I hate when you know someone's
going to get told something,

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:44.563
and you're going to have to
witness it.

00:07:44.596 --> 00:07:45.697
- And he wasn't

00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:47.566
because he was passed out
full of dairy and Dewar's,

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:49.735
and he's just breathing in a way

00:07:49.768 --> 00:07:51.604
that I knew he had an apparatus
at home.

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:52.571
(laughing)

00:07:52.604 --> 00:07:53.639
And it's still turbulent.

00:07:53.672 --> 00:07:54.507
He doesn't care.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.575
He's passed out,

00:07:55.608 --> 00:07:56.542
and then he wakes up in
the middle of the flight,

00:07:56.576 --> 00:08:00.913
and unpauses Rampage with his
socked foot,

00:08:00.946 --> 00:08:03.816
and that's when I went, "We can
crash.

00:08:03.849 --> 00:08:05.284
"I will happily die.

00:08:05.317 --> 00:08:07.019
"I will be the Jesus Christ of
this plane.

00:08:07.052 --> 00:08:09.855
"I will die so the world
doesn't have to have this man."

00:08:09.888 --> 00:08:11.123
- I feel that way so often.

00:08:11.156 --> 00:08:14.660
- Just the sound of
his sock on the screen.

00:08:14.693 --> 00:08:16.529
There for the next person.

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:17.997
Smelling like a bowl
full of wet cigarettes.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:18.864
- [Nikki] Disgusting.

00:08:18.897 --> 00:08:19.865
(laughing)

00:08:19.898 --> 00:08:21.567
- That would have made
your mom stop smoking.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.569
This guy, unpausing.

00:08:23.602 --> 00:08:26.105
If he had handed your
mother with his socked foot,

00:08:26.138 --> 00:08:26.806
she wouldn't smoke it.

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:27.807
- My mom did eventually quit.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.744
She went to a nunnery to
like isolate and learn

00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:32.678
to quit smoking.

00:08:32.711 --> 00:08:33.646
- Wow.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:34.346
- And then she also read
the Allen Carr book,

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:34.880
The Easy Way to Stop Smoking.

00:08:34.913 --> 00:08:36.749
- That's a good one.

00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:37.616
Oh, wait.

00:08:37.649 --> 00:08:38.751
I just talked to

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:39.618
(snapping)

00:08:39.652 --> 00:08:40.886
Why am I blanking on his last
name?

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.054
Dan?

00:08:42.087 --> 00:08:42.922
- Soder.
- Soder.

00:08:42.955 --> 00:08:43.756
- Soder.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.658
So Soder told me about that
book.

00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:46.325
- I gave him that book.

00:08:46.358 --> 00:08:47.192
- I know.

00:08:47.225 --> 00:08:48.059
He told me yesterday.

00:08:48.093 --> 00:08:48.593
He was like you gave him that
book.

00:08:48.627 --> 00:08:50.896
I read a book called

00:08:50.929 --> 00:08:53.299
This Naked Mind The Easy
Way to Control Drinking,

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:55.034
and it's like Allen Carr,

00:08:55.067 --> 00:08:55.968
and I quit drinking.

00:08:56.001 --> 00:08:56.835
- Yes.

00:08:56.868 --> 00:08:57.703
I did, too.

00:08:57.736 --> 00:08:58.604
- I just go to hypnotists.

00:08:58.637 --> 00:08:59.271
(laughing)

00:08:59.304 --> 00:08:59.972
- [Nikki] Do you really?

00:09:00.005 --> 00:09:01.006
- I'm all about the hypnotists.

00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:01.874
- Do you really, Judd?

00:09:01.907 --> 00:09:02.575
- Oh, yeah.

00:09:02.608 --> 00:09:03.609
- [Pete] He goes to Dr. Demento.

00:09:03.642 --> 00:09:04.476
- Yeah.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:05.144
- What have you been hypnotized
about?

00:09:05.177 --> 00:09:06.312
- Everything.

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:07.179
- What?

00:09:07.212 --> 00:09:08.047
- My personality.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:08.914
- Really?

00:09:08.947 --> 00:09:09.581
And it's worked?

00:09:09.615 --> 00:09:10.816
- Food, anxiety, everything.

00:09:10.849 --> 00:09:11.517
- Food?

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.185
- "People like your goofy face."

00:09:13.218 --> 00:09:14.053
Like that sort of stuff?

00:09:14.086 --> 00:09:14.987
- Yeah,

00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:16.755
but he gets intense.
- It's a call back.

00:09:16.788 --> 00:09:18.624
- He tries to scare you.
- It didn't even work.

00:09:18.657 --> 00:09:21.827
- He's like, "If you
could make a deal with God

00:09:22.761 --> 00:09:26.332
"and in that deal you would
never get sick

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:29.802
"and you won't die in a
hospital suffering in pain

00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:33.672
"from disease and all you
had to do was eat well,

00:09:33.705 --> 00:09:35.808
"would you make that deal?"

00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:36.742
(laughing)

00:09:36.775 --> 00:09:37.643
- Oh, boy.

00:09:37.676 --> 00:09:39.044
- And then I go straight to
Sprinkles.

00:09:39.077 --> 00:09:40.646
(laughing)

00:09:40.679 --> 00:09:42.748
- You're having the
session in a Sprinkles.

00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:45.184
- I found that the only way
to not be afraid on the plane

00:09:45.217 --> 00:09:47.820
is when I get on, I accept my
own death.

00:09:49.221 --> 00:09:50.022
I swear.

00:09:50.055 --> 00:09:50.889
Every time we're like--

00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:51.724
- Well, that's a good rule for
life.

00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:53.225
- Yeah, I just go, "You know
what?

00:09:53.258 --> 00:09:54.159
"It was a good ride.

00:09:54.192 --> 00:09:55.761
"I think we did good."

00:09:55.794 --> 00:09:56.729
And then we take off,

00:09:56.762 --> 00:09:57.930
and I go, "If there's more,
there's more."

00:09:57.963 --> 00:10:00.299
- What's funny is we're afraid
of being on planes, right,

00:10:00.332 --> 00:10:01.133
because planes might crash,

00:10:01.166 --> 00:10:03.135
but we're all stuck in these
planes.

00:10:03.168 --> 00:10:04.169
You know what I mean?

00:10:04.202 --> 00:10:04.870
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

00:10:04.903 --> 00:10:05.570
- You're never not on a plane.

00:10:05.604 --> 00:10:06.271
Like this could have a failure.

00:10:06.304 --> 00:10:08.307
There's just no engine light.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.775
- This could be hijacked.

00:10:09.808 --> 00:10:10.943
- This is actually a good point,

00:10:10.976 --> 00:10:12.945
making peace and living in the
present.

00:10:12.978 --> 00:10:15.714
I used to get on planes and go,

00:10:15.747 --> 00:10:17.349
it was actually a Bill
Cosby joke unfortunately.

00:10:17.382 --> 00:10:19.351
He used to say, "People."

00:10:19.384 --> 00:10:20.352
I won't do the voice.

00:10:20.385 --> 00:10:22.888
"are afraid to fly, but
when I get on a plane,

00:10:22.921 --> 00:10:23.689
"I don't even hide it.

00:10:23.722 --> 00:10:25.157
"I just go, 'Hope it don't
crash!'"

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.824
Right?

00:10:25.858 --> 00:10:26.792
So I used to get on planes.

00:10:26.825 --> 00:10:27.860
Obviously I've been on
thousands of planes,

00:10:27.893 --> 00:10:29.995
and I used to in my head
go, "Hope it don't crash."

00:10:30.028 --> 00:10:31.230
Just to make the same little
joke.

00:10:31.263 --> 00:10:32.464
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:10:32.498 --> 00:10:34.099
- And now I just go, "I'm
grateful for the present
moment."

00:10:34.132 --> 00:10:35.868
And that really takes it away.

00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:36.669
(sighing)

00:10:36.702 --> 00:10:37.636
Because I'm on a plane right
now.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.805
There's nothing to say,
"You can be scared,

00:10:39.838 --> 00:10:40.606
"or you can appreciate it."

00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:41.607
I'm not trying to frighten
anyone.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.375
I'm trying to make your
breakfast taste better.

00:10:43.408 --> 00:10:44.243
You know what I mean?

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:45.211
You're only breakfast.

00:10:45.244 --> 00:10:47.279
- But I also think that
your body is so soft

00:10:47.312 --> 00:10:49.381
that sometimes I go, "It's
just weird that more things

00:10:49.414 --> 00:10:52.785
don't bump into it and just
cut off a huge hunk of it."

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:53.819
- I know.

00:10:53.852 --> 00:10:54.987
Like Play-Doh.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.222
Like the way that Play-Doh
can be cut with like knives,

00:10:57.255 --> 00:10:58.223
and their shape--

00:10:58.256 --> 00:10:59.692
- I thought you meant
like the philosopher.

00:10:59.725 --> 00:11:00.926
- Ha.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.094
- You're whole life you're just
trying not to get something

00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:04.797
to bump into you and like
lop off a hunk of your head.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:05.664
- [Nikki] Yeah, you're right.

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:06.632
- What if you go back to Ancient
Greece,

00:11:06.665 --> 00:11:07.466
and you're like, "I'm looking
for Plato."

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.534
And they're like, "Oh, over
here."

00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:10.436
And they took you to a
room that's just red clay.

00:11:10.469 --> 00:11:12.037
- I love the smell of fresh
Play-Doh.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:12.905
- [Pete] In the morning.

00:11:12.938 --> 00:11:14.206
- Okay, we're doing--

00:11:14.239 --> 00:11:15.240
- Fresh Play-Doh in the morning.

00:11:15.273 --> 00:11:16.442
Fresh Play-Doh's great.

00:11:16.475 --> 00:11:17.410
- You know what I would like to
request.

00:11:17.443 --> 00:11:18.411
- If my makeup artist played
with Play-Doh

00:11:18.444 --> 00:11:20.779
and did my makeup, it'd
be like, "Stay close.

00:11:20.812 --> 00:11:22.214
"You're my childhood.

00:11:22.247 --> 00:11:23.415
"I love you.

00:11:23.448 --> 00:11:25.284
"Did you have a sauerkraut
sandwich with the other hand?"

00:11:25.317 --> 00:11:27.286
- She's just taking Play-Doh
breaks.

00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:29.021
- OMG.

00:11:29.054 --> 00:11:30.489
Play-Doh cologne.

00:11:30.522 --> 00:11:31.356
Nikki!

00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:32.324
- Why not?

00:11:32.357 --> 00:11:35.027
- I just made a billion
dollar idea for us.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.328
Neither of us have to work ever
again.

00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:37.930
- I want new sneaker cologne.

00:11:37.963 --> 00:11:38.764
- Okay.

00:11:38.797 --> 00:11:39.865
They have that.

00:11:39.898 --> 00:11:42.434
Puff Daddy is definitely
wearing new sneaker cologne.

00:11:42.467 --> 00:11:44.436
I don't know if it's for sale,

00:11:44.469 --> 00:11:45.237
but he's definitely.

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:46.739
Turtle from Entourage is
definitely

00:11:46.772 --> 00:11:48.107
rubbing that on his butt.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:48.974
(swiping)

00:11:49.007 --> 00:11:51.477
(upbeat music)
