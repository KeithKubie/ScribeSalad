00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.820
They say there are no small parts only small
actors.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.770
But in science there are both and these nanostructures
are the SMALLEST parts and they make a huge

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.750
impact.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.309
Hey friends, Trace here, this is DNews.

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.710
The prefix Nano- means something really small…
like 10 to the negative 9 small…

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.220
Point 000-000-001 centimeters.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.599
Nano has been paired with iPods, materials,
bots, optics, and other super clicky topics,

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.480
but though they sound boring, scientists and
engineers are working tirelessly to build

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.090
nanostructures because of the physics advantages
of these tiny construction projects!

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.030
In February of 2016, the journal Nature Materials
published a paper detailing the smallest lattice

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.010
structure ever created by humans.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.470
This is important, because building things
at these tiny scales hack the laws of physics!

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.370
Creations like these are called "metamaterials,"
because even though this is made of a type

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.430
of carbon, it has properties that are way
different than the normal material.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.820
In this case, the strength-to-density ratio
is six times higher than previously created

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.820
materials!

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.110
The engineers and scientists think they could
use this new metamaterial for batteries, or

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.079
other electrochemical purposes.

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:16.799
Look, I know metamaterials are a bit tough
to grasp, but basically they're specific arrangements

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.869
of plastics or metals to take advantage of
a tendency hidden in those elements -- usually

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.079
regarding the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.189
For example, the reason you can see trees
or Beyonce is because they're made of atoms

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:29.850
that weren't specifically arranged.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.100
Light just bounces off them in all directions.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.770
But, with the right design, a metamaterial
could reroute electromagnetic waves around

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.109
an object (called negative refraction) giving
the illusion of invisibility!

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:45.979
It was predicted by Russian physicist Victor
Veselago in the 1960s, and since the founding

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:52.030
of metamaterials as a field, it has been covered
ad nauseum as a possible technological "Harry

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.539
Potter" slash "Predator" invisibility cloak.

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.469
But that's not nearly the most exciting thing.

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:00.860
Imagine a material that shrinks when stretched,
and grows when squeezed.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.130
A 2006 paper in Nature Materials predicted
just that kind of metamaterial.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.520
If scientists figure out how to make it, this
stuff could reverse expectations in Newtonian

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.520
physics!

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.230
Cars could be coated in metamaterials that
push back when compressed during crashes…

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.000
or bridges and buildings could push back against
the wind!

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.040
But that's not all, in Applied Physics Letters,
engineers from Duke found a way to convert

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.150
wayward, unused WiFi or satellite signals
into electricity!

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.180
I mean, technology is just spewing radio waves
in every direction, so why not grab some of

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.180
them?

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.670
According to their paper, the metamaterial
is made of "subwavelength particles" and it

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.540
can harvest up to 7.3 volts using the slight
vibration that it creates.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.590
Saying "subwavelength" is just further illustrating
how small these things are… that new lattice

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.920
I was talking about before?

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.820
The struts are only 1 micrometer long… the
whole structure is only 10 micrometers!

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.150
It's so small -- that each of those struts
are actually SHORTER than the wavelengths

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.970
of some infrared light, and way shorter than
radio!

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.540
Okay, so even though the Duke researchers
don't specify what exactly it's made of, they

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.220
say in their paper that when radio waves hit
this metamaterial, it resonates, or vibrates.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.780
They harvest that vibration and believe it
could power small electronics pretty easily.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.000
Imagine tiny tech that could harvest power
from satellite signals, radio, or wifi from

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
your router...

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.420
Finally, one more: using 3-D printers, researchers
from Virginia Tech created a macro-scale material

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.250
that successfully copied the design of a nanoscale
metamaterial.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.980
They created a cube that has a 400 percent
greater tensile elasticity than normal materials,

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.390
with "minimal weight" and "maximum strength!"

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.440
Think: flexible armors, lightweight vehicles,
and strong-but-light construction materials

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.890
for space!

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.690
All because we were playing around with bits
of carbon under a microscope.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.750
To be clear, scientists are still learning
about how all this works.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.410
I mean, the whole field of metamaterials is
pretty new, so there's still a lot to learn.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.770
But, the lead author on that reverse squeeze
material told New Scientist, "We’ve gone

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.310
almost as far as we can with high-strength
materials…

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.560
The next phase has to be materials that do
completely different things."

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.560
So awesome.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.569
If you love watching things get made, you
should watch 'How It's Made!' on Science channel.

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.600
I love watching it during lunch actually,
I know that's weird.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.380
And you too can up your lunch game by downloading
Science Go!

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.950
On your app store and watch How It's Made
or any other Science Channel show current

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:22.950
or past.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:23.950
Check the link in the description.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.830
If you want to know more about metamaterials
and plasmonics, check out this video from

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.200
a while back explaining more about this crazy
stuff, cause it's crazy.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.710
Does the idea that engineers are creating
things so tiny, you cannot see them with the

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.710
naked eye freak you out?

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.710
