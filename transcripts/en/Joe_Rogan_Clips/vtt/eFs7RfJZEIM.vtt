1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.760
What will happen?
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.080
the biggest controversy in America in terms of transgender people?

3
00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:12.030
Probably the biggest or one of the biggest is competing in sports with

4
00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:15.750
biological women.
That's the biggest one.
Yes.

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.760
If you're asking me for answers on that,
haven't already got them.

6
00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:24.870
I know.
Yeah.
I've got one good one for um,

7
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.120
for washrooms as you call them.
Lemon restaurant,

8
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.970
which is on the urinals as you call him.
He called me,

9
00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:33.330
Ryan was just check them all out and everyone just,

10
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.390
it's all cubicles and we already do that in restaurants.

11
00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:40.640
We already share stuff,
Eh,
the,
the,
the toilets in,
right.

12
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.760
We did it in the airplanes we have now.
By the way,
if you just remove urinals at,

13
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.570
in theaters and places that won't be carrying often than women are queuing

14
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.580
forever and the men are not curing this way.
Everyone shares,

15
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:52.200
everyone behaves around responsibility.

16
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.070
I've heard of it working in a school as well.
There's less bullying in,

17
00:00:56.071 --> 00:01:00.540
in the lose.
So it's that,
it just chuck a regression of technology.

18
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.870
I take it says get the euro,
check it out the window.
Everyone has a cubicle.

19
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.950
Just go to the loo and then use the mirrors and,
and,
and then go away.

20
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.390
It's just everything being for both genders.
Yeah.
You just make it all,

21
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.330
even then we get outside a lot of problems.

22
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.030
Some people will have pushed back on that and have other reasons why they didn't

23
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:18.241
like it.

24
00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:22.320
But women don't want to be in a washroom with men though where they already are

25
00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:25.290
going into.
If they're sharing in the losing the airplane,

26
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:28.830
if they're sharing it in there.
Yeah.
But it'll,
airplane is one,
you know,

27
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:33.330
it's only a strong person to go in there.
I think their,
their concern is there's,

28
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.840
you know,

29
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.980
some men are fucking creeps and some women just want to have a place where they

30
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:42.720
could just be themselves and their makeup and go to the bathroom and wash and

31
00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:47.310
talk amongst other,
I understand that it's just,
I've,
you know,
um,

32
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:49.980
if you think about anything that's going to change anything,

33
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:52.760
that's usually something that won't,
wherever.

34
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.540
The only reason to do this is to accommodate people who are transgender in a way

35
00:01:57.541 --> 00:02:01.140
that it seems like it doesn't,
it doesn't put them in a position where they,

36
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.170
they can be judged because everyone's doing it.
It makes,

37
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.410
well if he stops bullying for in,
you know,
in schools then it's,
it's,

38
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.940
it's a number of things in there that,
that,
that it can make easier.

39
00:02:11.941 --> 00:02:15.090
It just makes a whole,
whole area of things a lot easier.

40
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.760
Do you think it stopped bullying though?
I didn't know what it has gone.
I mean,

41
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.480
I'm just giving you the figures of what kind of asset,

42
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.440
whether it just said that they tried it in the school and the bullying went
down.

43
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.200
She has this girls and his boys together and it's like boys were bullying the

44
00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:30.480
boys or girls will believe the girls,
but if you,
yeah,

45
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.400
so it's trust them all together.
They don't,

46
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.750
it seems so now I just punish the creeps,
which is really what you,
I mean,

47
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:39.320
if someone's being a creep in the bathroom,
the problem is the creep.

48
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.290
It's not the bathroom.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's,
um,
anyway,

49
00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:44.760
so this is a,
you know,

50
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.440
I haven't scientifically proved this with chemicals and a slide rule of
whatever,

51
00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:54.420
but it's an idea that gets to us to a better place and surely we're all

52
00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:58.860
somewhere on the spectrum of something.
So the idea that,
um,

53
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.210
that anyone who is expressing themselves in a different way,

54
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:08.660
that that is a problem.
If you say,
if you take it by just stripe,

55
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.830
if we all went back to how we used to think that there was just men and women

56
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:15.430
and everyone had straight sex,
uh,
even s that sex,
that one,

57
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:18.810
we'll talk about that people,
you know,
Victorian age in your Quiver Victoria now,

58
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.240
no one would talk about that.
That was all horrible day.

59
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.370
Sex was a procreation was there,
the whole idea of everything.

60
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:26.950
So if you,

61
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.180
I'm trying to get out to a practical place where people just go to the loo and

62
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:34.030
behave like adults,
even the kids who have to behave more like adults,

63
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:38.590
which is interesting.
That makes,
that makes sense.
I see what you're saying.
Yeah.

64
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.250
Me.
Yeah.
That is the concern,
right?
Was it,

65
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.800
we have a system in place and someone tries to change the system,

66
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.490
then people get upset that the trends are,
and that always happens.
Yeah.
I mean,

67
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.320
uh,
but also women do queue forever and men don't queue at all.
Cute,
much less.

68
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.950
But this Mexico,
it's Mexico queuing even evens that out.

69
00:03:56.951 --> 00:04:00.890
So everyone just behaves like an echo,
you know,

70
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.210
it's just a toilet.
The Romans used to have it with open plan toilets.

71
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.850
I've seen that.
We have made it into a problem.

72
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:10.780
We have made this a whole psychological problem.
Where's the ramen?

73
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.460
Just sit down there and I have a pool and have a chat.

74
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.520
And once they did make it a problem and categorize people by gender,

75
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.190
then it became this thing.
And now you don't want to change that.
Well,
yeah,

76
00:04:21.191 --> 00:04:21.750
I don't think the,

77
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.280
that they might've had many male and female toilets in the Roman times,

78
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:26.410
but just the fact that they were more open about the idea.

79
00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:29.460
There's bodily functions and it's normal.
And we've,
you know,
back in the,
uh,

80
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.080
before we came in and we were just going out into the woods and the forest and

81
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.050
having a pool and it was just having a food and now we feel it's a big problem

82
00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:39.660
having a period.
We didn't like the fact we haven't,

83
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.460
but we don't want to admit that we have the per,
does the queen ever have a poop?

84
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.260
Maybe never has the attitude be besides the marathon thing?

85
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.970
Has the attitude culturally shifted in the UK is the same way it shifted in

86
00:04:51.971 --> 00:04:54.820
America where people are more,
I think the more,

87
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.930
more and more people are out and a positive.

88
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:02.290
I mean you've basically got two from every grip.

89
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.820
This is ethnic groups is from women.

90
00:05:03.821 --> 00:05:07.120
That's just from any one that it feels slightly out of the loop.

91
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.380
If you can have a pause,

92
00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:11.860
any positive role models that go out there that do other things,
you know,

93
00:05:11.861 --> 00:05:14.980
just something that's nothing to do with sexuality.
You're very good at cooking.

94
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:18.610
You're on television for this tends to be television helps.
Um,

95
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.330
you got sports style,
you're this,
you're that.

96
00:05:20.331 --> 00:05:21.850
They want to those things people say,

97
00:05:21.851 --> 00:05:24.730
well there's a positive role model and they are of a different color or over

98
00:05:24.731 --> 00:05:26.250
different sexuality or their,
you know,

99
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.280
and that just helps everyone adjust their mindset.

100
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.500
And the younger people come through and they,
oh,
that's all they know.

101
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.000
I know about this person offered me like,
you know,
um,

102
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.860
in baseball you see the Bait,
that famous documentary basketball,
the um,

103
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.870
Ken Burns.
Yeah.
The Ken Burns one and that black people after the civil war,

104
00:05:46.871 --> 00:05:50.140
black people were playing baseball.
And there was some guy who was very powerful.

105
00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:53.440
He said there'll be no black people in major leagues at all.

106
00:05:53.441 --> 00:05:56.620
And it was blocked from about 1890,

107
00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.310
something this all the way through to 1950s.

108
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.910
So it was actually happening and then it went backwards.
Yeah.

109
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.560
So there was a positive role mum then.
Well,
they've been,
well,

110
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.270
why over that happen.
Things can go backwards and things go forward.

111
00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:15.920
And I just think if we're trying to get to a world where everyone's living that

112
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:20.030
live,
yeah,
that's really what we need,
right?
Yeah.
Just live and let live,
live.

113
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:22.880
And as long as you're not interfering with other people's lives,
you,

114
00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:25.880
as long as you're not doing something that somehow or another fucks with someone

115
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:29.420
else.
Yeah.
Like who cares?
Why would anyone care?
Yeah.

116
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.780
I mean I think people care because they're unhappy with themselves.

117
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.700
I think that's the only time people care and let my,

118
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.180
my issue with this that I've come across is with athletes.

119
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.030
It's with transgender athletes competing against women,

120
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:48.980
particularly in my field and fighting.
All right.
Um,
there's been,
uh,
some,

121
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.090
there have been at least there was one very vocal case.

122
00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:58.091
One very public case of a transgender athlete who was a male for 30 plus years,

123
00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:01.850
transitioned over for a couple of years,
for two years,
and then started fighting.

124
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:06.560
Women didn't tell them that she used to be a man.
Right.

125
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.340
And it became a giant issue and people were outraged and anger.

126
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:15.170
The women who got beat up or angry cause they got destroyed.
Two of them did.

127
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.370
And then she started,

128
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.850
then she was public about it and then started fighting women that were willing

129
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.230
and new,
you've got to say things up front.
I mean,

130
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.390
I came out that long ago because I wanted to be up front about things.
So yeah,

131
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.990
I don't have the great answers.
There's,
you know,
for,

132
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.040
I don't have the answer for everything,
but yeah,
I can see that from,

133
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.720
one of the interesting things about it is that there are no real answers,

134
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.990
that it's one of those things where you just got to go home.
What do we do here?

135
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.943
And this is,

136
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:44.950
this is what I think one of the more unique things about being a person is that

137
00:07:45.321 --> 00:07:50.321
we have this opportunity to look at this unusual circumstance and communicate

138
00:07:50.601 --> 00:07:51.940
about it and try to figure it out.
