00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It seems like a smart thing to do first would be to go through and try and determine

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
what are the potential sources of error in this experiment.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Well, first, our whole experiment was based on the assumption that the earth is a sphere.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We also used the assumption that the sun's rays arrive at the earth parallel in different locations,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and we justified this by saying that the sun is so far away that its rays must be coming nearly parallel.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Next, we had the fact that the sun's rays were vertical in Syene.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We also had to measure the angle of the sun's rays in Alexandria. This is the angle that we called alpha.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And finally, we are to measure the distance between Syene and Alexandria.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Now, these are the five steps or assumptions that I identified for this problem.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
There could be others that you may have identified,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but these are the ones that I think are most important.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If any of these were incorrect, so for example, if the earth wasn't really a sphere,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
well that would throw off our entire geometry calculation.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Likewise, if the sun's rays didn't arrive exactly in parallel,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
or if they weren't exactly vertical in Syene?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Any problem in any of these steps would of course lead to error, which would

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
propagate through our experiment and show up as an error in our circumference calculation.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Let's go through each of these potential sources of error

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and quantify how much we think it may have contributed to the error of our final calculation.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Step 1, earth is a sphere. It turns out the earth isn't a perfect sphere.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It's actually what's known as an oblate spheroid, which is a much cooler name,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
but all it means is that it's a little fatter around the middle.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
It turns out that this difference is so, so tiny that this one really introduced any actual error

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
into our calculation barely even measurable, so I'm going to call

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
this potential source of error as negligible.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Next, we've seen that the sun's rays arrive parallel which means that the rays would strike Syene,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
actually strike parallel to those striking Alexandria.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It turns out this is not exactly true. The rays are not perfectly parallel.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
For a homework problem, you'll actually calculate how much error this will contribute

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
to our measurement of the circumference or to our calculation of the circumference.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
But, I'll tell you for now that it's negligible.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Next, we had this idea that the sun's rays are arriving vertically in Syene.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Now, this seems like it could be a potential source of error.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Now, let's think of how Eratosthenes came to this conclusion

00:02:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that the sun's rays were perfectly vertical in Syene on the summer solstice.
