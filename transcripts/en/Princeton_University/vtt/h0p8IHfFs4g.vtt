00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.696
RAMONA ROMERO: Good afternoon, Welcome.

00:00:19.696 --> 00:00:23.260
You're a really scary group of people.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.320
Thank you so much

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.220
for being here.
It is great that you came back to the

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.220
University to celebrate the
contributions that women have made to

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:42.150
Princeton and to society. My name is
Ramona Romero and you can take as many

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:51.600
pictures with me as you want okay? Just
no pictures of the justices after a

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.640
couple of minutes. My name is Ramona
Romero and for almost four years I have

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:06.690
been the general counsel of the
University. As a lawyer, as a lawyer it is

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:13.080
a true true honor for me to introduce
three legal superstars, Supreme Court

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:22.770
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Class of 19--

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:33.930
Class of 1976, Justice Elena Kagan Class

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.850
Class of 1981,

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:49.950
and Heather Gerken, Class of 1991, the
recently appointed dean of the Yale Law

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.420
School. As the lawyers in the audience
know, the Supreme Court begins its term

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.820
on the first Monday in October, so we are
particularly grateful to the justices

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:11.479
for having come today during this very,
very busy week. We're also very grateful --

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:20.010
that was unintentional -- we're also
grateful to Dean Gerken, who has also had

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:27.330
an unusually demanding beginning of the
term. This could take a long time guys. So

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:34.050
you know, I first met Dean Gerken a few
years ago when I was new to Princeton

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.050
and she was a University trustee. Based
on our interactions, her unassuming

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.940
manner would give you no clue of her
many accomplishments. After graduating

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.170
from Princeton summa cum laude, she
earned her degree from the University of

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.019
Michigan Law School again with the
highest honors. Following her clerkship

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.299
on the 9th circuit and for Justice
David Souter on the U.S. Supreme Court,

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:05.220
she worked at a law firm for a few years.
A mutual friend who was a colleague of

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.579
hers at the law firm describes her as
phenomenally talented and too good for

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:20.910
the law firm world. Dean Gerken entered
academia in the year 2000, earning tenure

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:28.980
at Harvard and then at Yale. When she was
appointed dean last year, the first woman

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:36.389
to hold that position,

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:43.760
Dean Gerken's predecessor said that
Yale Law School is very lucky to be able

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.430
to draw on the energy, brilliance and
leadership of Heather Gerken. This is a

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.920
time of change in our country and in
legal education, and Heather is perfectly

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.050
suited to take the helm of this
extraordinary place. And I think we've

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:05.810
seen evidence of that already, but lest
you think that Dean Gerken is all

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.819
about legal scholarship, I encourage you
to Google her name after the program's

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:18.889
over, to Google her name and the words
vampire novel. Now on to the toughest

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:24.290
part of my assignment, introducing two
women who really need no introduction,

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:31.280
Justices Sonia Maria Sotomayor and
Elena Kagan. Justice Kagan and Sotomayor

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:43.610
have much in common. Both are from New
York and both -- clock is ticking -- but

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.500
are from New York and both are serious
baseball fans, although they had although

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.000
they do favor different teams and only
one of those teams is doing well.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.360
At Princeton both majored in history, excelled
academically, and graduated with the

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.789
highest honors. Since they left our
campus, both have blazed many trails. For

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:09.680
example, Justice Kagan was the first
female dean of the Harvard Law School

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.930
and she was also the first woman and so
far the only woman to serve as Solicitor

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.160
General of the United States.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.800
Justice Sotomayor is the first and only
Hispanic American ever appointed to the

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.260
U.S. Supreme Court

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.060
and the first and only woman of color to
ever serve on that court. Clock is

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.960
ticking guys. After graduating from
Princeton, Justices Kagan and Sotomayor

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.800
traveled different paths to their
appointments as the third and fourth

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.350
female justices in our nation's history.
Justice Sotomayor, who

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.330
attended Yale Law School, honed her
courtroom skill as a prosecutor in New

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:08.060
York, worked at a law firm, and spent 17
years as a federal trial and appellate

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:13.460
judge before her elevation to the
Supreme Court in 2009. She issued

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.630
hundreds of decisions. However none is
better known than a decision she issued

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.780
enjoining
that an injunction she issued that

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.870
effectively ended a baseball strike that
had forced the cancellation of the 1994

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.930
World Series. As a former baseball Major
League Baseball player testified during

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.169
her confirmation hearing, with one
decision

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:44.990
she brought players and owners back to
the table and rescued the 1995 baseball

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:54.320
season. So you see, putting aside Justice
Oliver Wendell Holmes, who authored a

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.200
mystifying to lawyers Supreme Court
opinion in 1922 that exempted baseball

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.150
from the antitrust laws, I think it is
safe to say the Sonia Sotomayor is the

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.250
only justice in our nation's history who
can take credit for saving the national

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:12.790
pastime.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:23.880
When Justice Sotomayor was nominated to
the Supreme Court New York, district

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.860
attorney Robert Morgenthau 
noted that throughout her career she had

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:36.120
exhibited wisdom, intelligence,
collegiality, and good character. New York

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:41.880
City Mayor Michael Bloomberg praised her
sharp and agile mind, her wealth of

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.740
unique experience, and fact that she
is an independent jurist

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:51.660
who does not fit squarely into an
ideological box. Her appointment was a

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:57.060
particularly joyful and proud moment for
the Hispanic legal community.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:02.130
She was active within our communities
throughout her 17 years on the bench and

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:10.040
was and remains deeply respected and
beloved not only for her accomplishments

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:15.870
but also for her extraordinary
commitment to giving back. As someone

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:21.630
who knows her well said to me recently,
her commitment is authentic. She has

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:26.400
never forgotten her roots in the South
Bronx, prefers Puerto Rican food above

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.210
all others, and means everything she says
and does.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:36.710
She's also, based on my own observations
over the years, one of the most genuine,

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:43.130
gracious, humble, and decent 
people on the planet.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:56.320
Now Justice Kagan, her post-Princeton path to the Supreme Court

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.670
was equally impressive. After she earned
her law degree from Harvard Law School,

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:06.070
she clerk on the Court of Appeals in D.C.
and for Justice Marshall on the U.S.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:11.860
Supreme Court. Following her clerkship,
she ventured ever so briefly into

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:17.260
private practice. Subsequently she taught
at the University of Chicago and at

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:22.570
Harvard, where she later became dean and
served in both the Clinton and Obama

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:28.209
administrations. A mutual friend who
worked with Justice Kagan when she was a

00:09:28.209 --> 00:09:32.950
counselor to President Clinton told me
that she is known as a brilliant jurist

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:37.990
for her talents range far beyond
that. As dean of the Harvard Law School

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:43.240
she was beloved because  she was
approachable and responsive to students

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:50.230
and faculty, and I'm happy to add alumni
to that list. A few years after

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:55.779
she became dean, Justice Kagan
hosted the law school's first-ever reunion

00:09:55.779 --> 00:10:01.779
of Hispanic alumni. A large group of us
met with her. We were determined and I

00:10:01.779 --> 00:10:06.730
mean determined to find out what she
intended to do to correct the law school's

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:13.149
failure to hire Hispanic faculty. Over a
decade later, I still remember how

00:10:13.149 --> 00:10:18.339
impressed I was by the directness and by
the grace and humor with which she

00:10:18.339 --> 00:10:24.130
handled our spirited questioning. Those
qualities including her sense of humor

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:30.040
were apparent in her confirmation
hearing in 2010. There, to quote President

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:35.529
Obama, the members of the Senate
Judiciary Committee got a good sense of

00:10:35.529 --> 00:10:39.700
her judicial philosophy, her commitment
to the rule of law,

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:45.430
her rich understanding of our
Constitution, and of course where she can

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:48.750
be found on Christmas Day.

00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:55.300
Let me conclude by acknowledging
 how fortunate we are that

00:10:55.300 --> 00:11:01.420
these three women have chosen lives of
service and are now in positions, in

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:07.630
positions to influence the evolution of
American law. As Justice Kagan -- As Justice

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:11.769
[inaudible] of the Massachusetts
Supreme Court said during Justice

00:11:11.769 --> 00:11:16.360
Kagan's confirmation hearing, the
presence of women and minorities on a

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:21.550
court has an impact on the overall
decision-making that goes beyond the

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:27.519
opinions of the female or
minority judges themselves. They

00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:33.850
influence how the other judges think
and how they analyze the law. Justice

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:40.630
Sotomayor, Justice Kagan thank you for
your service to the American people and

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:46.029
for being here today to share your
unique experiences and thank you Dean

00:11:46.029 --> 00:11:51.010
Gerken for moderating today's
conversation and for your contributions

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:56.170
to legal scholarship and for your
courage and leadership at this time in

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:59.310
our nation's history.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:59.780
Now, now.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:04.500
HEATHER GERKEN: So it is it is wonderful to be here.
It feels so sustaining to be around so many

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:09.390
women, to hear so many women's voices at
this moment. And so I am just gonna cut

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:13.950
to the chase as I know you do not want
to hear from me. And we have a series of

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:17.640
questions that you have all helped
shape with your own contributions that

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.060
I'm going to ask the justices over the
course of the evening - about their life

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:25.410
here at Princeton, their careers, advice
they'd have for all the young women in

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:30.779
the room. So I'll just get started and
just start with something very short. So

00:13:30.779 --> 00:13:35.130
one of you came from Manhattan and
another came from the Bronx. Why did you

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:39.000
come to Princeton University? And, Chris,
yes, I am setting this up for you so that

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.940
you can put it on the website.
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:53.160
SONIA SOTOMAYOR: Well for me it was my high school 
coach in debate club, and he guided, got guided

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:58.080
to Princeton by one of the teachers at
our high school. We were not a feeder

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:06.959
school and Kenny was the first of our
high school graduates to attend an Ivy

00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:12.720
League school and he came to Princeton
and obviously he didn't flunk out and they took

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:19.440
a chance on me. It is a long story for
those who - I've said it at the first She

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:26.190
Roars, so you may have to listen to that
tape. But suffice it to say, I went to

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:34.560
Harvard and I met an interviewer who was
dressed in a black dress, beautifully

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:41.649
white coffered hair, pearled earrings, a
black and white poodle next to her,

00:14:41.649 --> 00:14:51.129
a red rug oriental rug in a white couch.
Now in my house, all couches had plastic

00:14:51.129 --> 00:15:00.369
on them and you never bought a white
couch because the kids would mess it up.

00:15:00.369 --> 00:15:06.910
I literally ran out of that room. It's
the only time I've run away from

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:14.800
something and left and told the assistant -
ELENA KAGAN: Wait, so you went to Princeton instead?

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:20.139
SOTOMAYOR: I did. I went - [LAUGHTER] 
And I'm going to tell the story of why. I went,

00:15:20.139 --> 00:15:25.480
I tried out Harvard. They were too
radical for me. This is an amazing story.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:31.300
But I came to Princeton and my friend,
who was my friend, and he had a bunch of

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:37.449
other friends that were like him and not
like most Princetonians

00:15:37.449 --> 00:15:48.370
and I got fooled. [LAUGHTER] And that's how I 
ended up here. There is a reason to have posses

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:53.110
around you. For those of you in education,
you know that there are many colleges

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:58.540
who bring kids from similar
neighborhoods if they want to integrate

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:04.720
their schools better because there is a
comfort in meeting people who are more

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:12.759
like you at least at first. I obviously
got used to Princeton but it does take a

00:16:12.759 --> 00:16:16.980
while if you're from a different environment.
GERKEN: Justice Kagan?

00:16:17.529 --> 00:16:22.839
KAGAN: Well I'm not quite sure why I came to
Princeton. Actually first off I want to

00:16:22.839 --> 00:16:26.009
say it's great to be here.
[APPLAUSE, CHEERS]

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:36.280
I haven't been back for a few years, so I
was, I was just saying to Heather and to

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:40.750
Sonia that, you know, Reunions are at the
worst time of year for us. So I haven't, I

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:45.340
haven't made it back to my last couple,
and it's absolutely wonderful to be here

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:50.650
and to be here especially at an event
like this. Give yourselves some applause.

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:58.760
What? [APPLAUSE] Wow. Wow. What a crowd. 
SOTOMAYOR: I would have never

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.300
imagined a crowd like this when I came here. No,

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:07.000
I mean, we were, that I was in the third
year of women, you were in the fifth.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.370
I had many classes where I was the only
woman in the room. To see a gymnasium

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:18.390
filled of alumni and to see all the
women students up there? [APPLAUSE]

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:34.640
KAGAN: So I went to a great public school  in New York, Hunter College High

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:42.740
School. Yeah. Very few people 
went to Princeton from

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:46.910
my high school. [inaudible] It sent a lot of 
people to a lot of Ivy League schools, but but

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:52.970
Princeton was not on the list.
And, but I came down here and I just fell

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:56.240
in love with the place. It was one of
those glorious spring days and the

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:02.300
campus was looking incredibly beautiful.
And you know what basically I kind of

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:06.440
think that people do not know what
they're doing when they're 17 and

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:09.811
they're picking colleges. 
GERKEN: I'm looking at my daughter who's 16.

00:18:09.811 --> 00:18:10.760
KAGAN: Yeah I would love to

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:14.480
be able to say I had a great reason for
coming to Princeton, but mostly it was I

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:18.456
caught it on a really sunny beautiful day.
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:18.456 --> 00:18:21.770
GERKEN: Justice Sotomayor, 
you were just talking a little bit

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:26.120
about the few years after women were
admitted here. You've described

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.600
yourself publicly as a fish out of water
at Princeton. I wonder if you might say a

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.800
little bit more about what that was like.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:38.150
SOTOMAYOR: It's hard to describe to people. 
I might I think my favorite story is a couple of

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:44.870
days into being here. I'm sitting outside
of Dillon Gym and there is a classmate

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:52.250
there who's from Alabama. Yep
and she starts talking to me about how

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:57.820
her great-grandfather had been in
Princeton, her grandfather, her father, and

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:05.390
two of her brothers, and how amazing it
was for her now to join their ranks. And

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:11.150
I am sort of looking at this, and I'm the
first generation going to college in my

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:17.840
family, and I'm thinking how many
generations is that. But coming up to me

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.990
were my roommate, who was a
Mexican-American,

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:25.670
and a Puerto Rican friend, and they were
talking Spanish. And the young woman

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:31.160
standing, next sitting next to me says,
That's why I love this place. It has so

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:37.100
many different people. And I'm looking at
her with her Southern drawl and

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:43.700
thinking, And I thought you were the
different one. But the longer I stayed at

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:48.620
Princeton, the more different I felt
than most of my classmates. Remember I

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:53.900
don't think it's as true today. This
was this this was the most non-northern

00:19:53.900 --> 00:20:00.350
school of the South. That's what it was
most famous for and that environment had

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:07.280
eating clubs and not all the Ivies did
at the time. And it was just opening its

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.600
doors to women, and there were still a
lot of alumni who were not happy with

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:18.160
that state of affairs. And I think most
of the men on campus liked it a lot, but

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:24.140
there were still some who really would
have preferred an all-male college or

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:32.110
university. And so when you feel like a
fish out of water, I don't think you ever

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:39.430
completely get past it. If you want to
know when I finally figured out I belong,

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:43.510
when they made me a trustee.

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:55.299
That's not to say that I didn't identify
as a Princetonian, because I did, and it

00:20:55.299 --> 00:21:02.950
likely was the most influential
experience of my life in terms of

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:10.309
transforming me from the world I came
from into the world I was entering. But

00:21:10.309 --> 00:21:18.830
it I think I said it best when I
accepted a prize at the end of my four

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:26.330
years, which is, We all march to different
drummers and the beauty of a place like

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:32.149
Princeton is to let all of us march to
our own drummers while still being on

00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:39.350
the same parade ground. And so that was
important to me.

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:42.950
GERKEN: So Justice Kagan, I want to ask you a little bit about something

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:47.899
that is so important to students these
days, which is mentorship and  this is

00:21:47.899 --> 00:21:52.250
a little bit personal for me because I
was a junior faculty member worried

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:57.289
about getting tenure, and Justice Kagan
was then Dean Kagan and not only an

00:21:57.289 --> 00:22:01.010
extraordinary dean of Harvard Law School
but managed to be a mentor to me. So I'm

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:03.806
intensely grateful for that and I just
want to -

00:22:03.806 --> 00:22:05.690
KAGAN: I don't really think 
you needed mentorning

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:12.200
GERKEN: You would be surprised. So I
wondered who were who were the most

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:16.640
influential mentors in your career and
and what kind of advice did they give

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.100
you as you moved along?

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.529
KAGAN: Well I think at
Princeton, I'll start with Princeton.

00:22:21.529 --> 00:22:25.640
In Princeton it was my senior thesis
adviser who maybe is here, Sean Wilentz.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:30.559
He's still a history professor here. Okay,
so there he is in the front row because

00:22:30.559 --> 00:22:33.610
he was my senior thesis adviser.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:45.120
And you know some well I did my junior
paper with him, my junior paper

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:48.600
in the spring, and then my senior thesis.
And Sean Wilentz taught me how to write,

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:56.220
which is a useful thing to know. And and
and so I'm I'm forever grateful to him

00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:00.809
for that and for all the advice he gave
me along the way and for convincing me

00:23:00.809 --> 00:23:05.670
that I really didn't want to be a
historian after all.

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:07.200
GERKEN: You wrote him 153 pages.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:13.710
KAGAN: I did yeah. 150 pages on a subject
that was sort of the bane of my

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:19.049
existence as I was going through my
confirmation proceedings, because I wrote

00:23:19.049 --> 00:23:27.360
on the history of the Socialist Party
in New York City, in the early

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:34.049
20th century, and from this everybody
assumed that I must be a socialist.

00:23:34.049 --> 00:23:38.200
And so, and you know -
SOTOMAYOR: She's not?

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.020
KAGAN: This year that's a popular.
This year

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:43.799
This year that's popular. It was not so
popular among many members of the

00:23:43.799 --> 00:23:50.280
Judiciary Committee when I was trying to
get through the process. But you know the

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:54.630
judges I clerked for were 
unbelievable in different ways.

00:23:54.630 --> 00:24:00.690
Judge Mikva was somebody who had
served in all different parts of

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:04.410
government and then he ended up being
really important to my career, not only

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:08.549
because what he taught me when I was a
clerk for him, but because he ended up at

00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:12.059
the White House. And one day I picked up
the phone, I was teaching at the

00:24:12.059 --> 00:24:17.070
University of Chicago at the time, and
and Judge Mikva said come back and work

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:22.110
for me at the White House. So it was my
entry into a place that, you know, I never

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:27.000
expected to be. And I spent four years
there, and it was, it was, it was very

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.480
important for just really all the rest
of my of my career. And Justice Marshall,

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:38.190
it was just an amazing experience
clerking for Justice Marshall, clerking

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:46.380
for one of the icons of American law and
American history. And you know, he -

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:51.650
I guess it was the year that I
spent with him

00:24:51.650 --> 00:25:01.730
that just put into my head, You have to
use what you've been given to - what he

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:06.530
did of course was to promote justice for
more people in more ways than pretty

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:13.210
much anybody else in the legal
profession in his time. And one can

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:20.330
one can never think that one is going to
do that, but but but that's a really

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:22.920
important thing to have in your head as
a goal.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.380
GERKEN: So Justice Sotomayor, may I ask

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:27.800
the same question of you, because you may not
know you have this in common, but both of

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:31.910
you apparently have written
extraordinarily long theses. Seniors out

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:37.310
there get time to get snapping. So Peter
Wynn was your adviser, and he called your

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:43.670
thesis, and I quote, "extremely ambitious
and one of the longest I have ever supervised" but I

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:47.800
wonder if you also might say a few words
about mentors along the way.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:52.910
SOTOMAYOR: I'll approach the question a little
differently, which is how do you pick a

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:59.740
mentor? Well first of all I'm not sure
you pick them. They mostly pick you. And

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:07.030
the way to do that, I think, is to show
them that you're interested in learning.

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:13.370
And it's sort of surprising to put it
that way, but if you don't seek them out

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:19.400
and actually listen to what they're
saying and put it into some sort of

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:24.500
practice, they're not going to think very
highly of you or really be very

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:30.170
interested in working with you. So you
have to demonstrate your ambition

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:37.160
basically. And the way that most people
do that is by working with them in a way

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:42.920
where you're actually showing them that
you're taking their advice to heart and

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:47.750
following through. That's actually the
most important thing. When a professor

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:53.690
talks to you and makes suggestions it's not
enough to say those are nice. What counts

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:59.410
is coming back and actually implementing
those suggestions in a positive way. So

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:04.640
for me with Peter, and I'll say that the
first mentor I had

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:13.460
was Nancy Weiss, later to become Nancy
Malkiel, and she was the first professor

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:19.550
that I went to at office hours. And my
first question is why did you give me a

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:28.700
C on my paper? And she didn't blow me off.
She actually explained why, and I took to

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:37.250
heart her advice and got a B on my
final paper, but then went and found

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:43.700
Peter, who because he taught Latin
American history understood some of my

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:51.260
language difficulties in writing English
from a Spanish background. And so he was

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:57.200
able to help me learn how to write
properly, but every time he gave me

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:03.050
advice, the one thing I needed was my
next paper had to fix that problem. And I

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:06.860
could, you know, you could make a mistake
once, but you shouldn't make it twice. And

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:14.720
so by the time I finished with him four
years later, I began the process of

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:22.220
writing in a way that led me to my law
degree and to being a judge. But when you

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:29.030
go into the workplace, find people who
are doing things that you admire, that

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:34.820
you don't think you can do, because
finding a mentor who is just going to

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:40.760
show you what you know to me is not very
helpful to me. I always look for those

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:48.410
mentors in my workplace that will help
me understand things and learn how to do

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:57.110
things that I don't think I know how to
do. and so picking the two judges you did,

00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:01.280
and I know they had a lot to do in
picking you, obviously, but I'm sure you

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:07.550
had alternatives. They both opened up
different worlds to you and that's what

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:11.570
I've always tried to do with other
mentors throughout my life, to pick

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:16.210
people who can teach me things I'm not
sure that I can do.

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:25.160
KAGAN: Can I just say Professor Weiss did not
give me a very good grade either, so who

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:29.090
knew that we had this in common.

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:34.370
GERKEN: I have a question about
your careers. So Justice Kagan, you were

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:42.230
talking about moving into governement and you know
you made a lot of big jumps in your in

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:46.100
your time, of going into becoming an
academic, going into government, becoming

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.880
a dean, the Solicitor General. I know
Justice Sotomayor, you went from IP

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:55.280
litigator, prosecutor to judge. 
They're quite different leaps to make -

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:59.420
KAGAN: Short attention span.
GERKEN: I was wondering if you might talk

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:02.500
SOTOMAYOR: It's the beauty of 
being a lawyer, by the way.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.780
GERKEN: Right, it's an all purpose degree but I actually do

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:09.410
think that, I mean, whenever I talk to my
1L's, the panic that they have that

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:13.520
they don't know what they want to do in
their first semester, and and you can't

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:17.630
just say to them, you don't even know how
to read a case, in under

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:22.610
four hours, so worry about this later.
But but I think it, I imagine all of

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:26.540
those students here are wondering
whether they really know what they want

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:30.680
to do and whether they're gonna have the
courage to make that jump when they make

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.429
it. So how did you know, Justice Kagan,

00:30:32.429 --> 00:30:33.460
when to make that jump?

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.480
KAGAN: Yeah, so I mean, I did

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:43.460
make a lot of jumps. Before I came to this job,
which has life tenure you know, so I'll

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:48.160
be in this one awhile,
knock wood, but

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:59.490
but basically I changed jobs every four
years or so. And then the in the deanship,

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:05.159
I stayed six years. That was, there was a
lot, so you know, different strokes for

00:31:05.159 --> 00:31:08.279
different folks.
Some people they love just finding one

00:31:08.279 --> 00:31:11.429
thing, and they want to do it for the
rest of their lives and that's

00:31:11.429 --> 00:31:16.620
absolutely fantastic. But for me, the
variety of when you said law allows you

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:21.179
to do that - the variety of things that I
was able to do was really part of the

00:31:21.179 --> 00:31:24.990
fun of putting together a legal career.
And what I always think, and it sounds

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:29.190
like you agree with me, Heather, about
advising law students is that they all

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:33.629
have this kind of plan. And first you
have to do step A and then that leads

00:31:33.629 --> 00:31:37.980
you to step B and that leads you to step
C and God forbid if you should ever step

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:44.009
off the plan. And I found that all the
most fun things that I did in my career

00:31:44.009 --> 00:31:46.567
were mostly the result of serendipity.

00:31:46.567 --> 00:31:49.259
I mean it was keeping your eyes open for

00:31:49.259 --> 00:31:56.759
opportunities for sure, but just like
lucky things cropping up and and having

00:31:56.759 --> 00:32:02.909
the ability to to change direction at a
moment's notice and to say, you know, I

00:32:02.909 --> 00:32:08.789
never thought I would do that but that
sounds really like a lot of fun. And and

00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:12.269
to be and to be able to step off the
plan, maybe to come back on the plan

00:32:12.269 --> 00:32:16.049
maybe not to come back on the plan,
because it leads to another thing that

00:32:16.049 --> 00:32:22.110
you would never have done. So I feel as
though my life had a lot of twists and

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:30.090
turns. And you know just for an example, I
was, there I was, I was dean of a law

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:34.950
school, and I thought for sure my next job
was to leave the law entirely. I thought

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:39.240
I was going to go be a university
president someplace as my next job and

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:45.660
then all of a sudden sort of, here I am
doing this.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:52.420
So you know things work in funny ways
but but but I guess what I would say to

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:59.470
students is just you know be open to
opportunities. Look - things fall into

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:04.810
people's laps that you never expected.
And what you have to do is be

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:10.180
aware that you should grab them.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.200
SOTOMAYOR: I guess I start 
with that question by saying

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:20.580
they're very few, if any, fatal mistakes
in life. You know, you can end up in a

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:25.560
dead-end job. You can. But it doesn't mean
you have to stay there.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:32.770
Lots of people forget that learning is a
lifelong endeavor. I had a mother who

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:39.910
went to college when she was in her late
40s, and she taught me that it's never

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:46.990
too late to retool, never too late to
change directions. So you should explore

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:51.190
your options, think about them a little
bit. But at a certain point you gotta

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:56.770
stop worrying so much. You just gotta
jump in, take a bunch of different

00:33:56.770 --> 00:34:01.720
courses, try courses that you know
nothing about. You may fall in love with

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:08.020
one of them. Go to law school and don't
get pegged in one area of law. Go try

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:12.700
different areas. You may end up, believe
it or not it, it could be shocking to some

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:19.540
of you, liking corporate law. There's a
huge number of wonderful lawyers I know

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:25.660
who are terrific people, very interested
in public service, who go in and out of

00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:30.850
government all the time, who are
corporate lawyers. There is no occupation

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:37.660
or profession that doesn't and can't
give you an avenue to do good work. You

00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:43.090
have to be flexible enough to try new
things, and you have to have the courage

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:49.360
to realize, if you make a wrong choice,
then pick yourself up and move in a

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:55.300
different way. Sometimes people get the
golden handcuffs put on. They're making

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:59.589
so much money they don't want
make a switch. That's a very real

00:34:59.589 --> 00:35:06.470
limitation in life. But that shouldn't be
the excuse for unhappiness, and it

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:12.890
shouldn't be the excuse for saying to
yourself, oh my God, am I gonna make a

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:16.150
mistake? You know, what should I do with
my life?

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:24.069
Do with your life. Live it. Take on
adventures. Try new things and then

00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:29.960
figure out the thing that seems
interesting and give it a go. If it

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:36.160
doesn't work, shift directions. Do
something else. But don't let the panic

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:42.800
take away from the enjoyment of today. Because look at the opportunities you

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:48.310
have in a place like Princeton. It's
amazing everything this place offers you.

00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:55.940
But it won't be valuable unless you're
willing to take chances and do those new

00:35:55.940 --> 00:36:01.160
things that might otherwise scare you.
And the same thing in law school.

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:12.120
[APPLAUSE]  GERKEN: This is a question that is 
really spurred by a conversation I witnessed

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:18.760
today when a woman who is in one of the
early classes practically embraced a

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:23.410
young grad and said, You don't know what
it was like when there were so few women

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:29.020
on this campus. And what it means now to
look around and see how how much it has

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:33.490
changed. And I know that each of you has
been in many situations as of most of

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:37.640
the women I suspect on the older end - not
that you're in any way -

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:41.440
[LAUGHTER]
KAGAN: Good save

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.040
GERKEN: On the more senior end of the

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:48.360
side you both experienced you both experienced
SOTOMAYOR: More experienced.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:51.160
GERKEN: You both experienced that moment when

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:54.250
you're the only woman in the room and
and Justice Kagan and I wonder if I might

00:36:54.250 --> 00:37:00.790
start with you. Um I feel keenly that of
the 194-year history

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:07.540
of my institution only one year has been
helmed by a woman. For me and and I think

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:11.920
you were probably in roughly those same
numbers is the first first woman dean of

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:16.510
Harvard Law School. It was an enormous
moment when that happened and I just

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:22.690
wonder how you thought about occupying
that space and did you feel as a woman

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:25.660
did it feel different? How did it shape
what you did?

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.010
KAGAN: You know when I walked in

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:32.530
when you walked into the dean's office
of my predecessor, he had this big thing

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:38.290
on the wall, which was all the different
deans of Harvard Law School. There were I

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:43.240
think about 13 of them. They all served
remarkably long tenures, and I'm sure

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:47.890
that they, I'm sure that they had much
that was different about them.

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:51.390
But when I looked at this picture

00:37:52.560 --> 00:38:03.250
it was like 13 of the scariest-looking
older men, older white men, whatever, that -

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:14.440
So the first thing I did was I took
that picture down. But you know you you

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:19.540
you do worry. The faculty was yeah - but by
the time I became dean of the law school,

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:24.940
as for you Heather, the student bodies
are about 50/50 but the faculties are

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:30.160
still, they're still not enough women in
them. And and there and they had never

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:35.920
had a woman dean. And you wonder how are
some of these faculty members going to

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:41.200
deal with that? And are going they you
know going to accept a woman as their

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:45.070
boss? It's hard enough when you're dean.
Actually faculty members do not really

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:49.990
think of you with their boss okay? It's a
little bit hard to establish that

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:54.280
yeah, when you need to. And and then when
you're a woman and when you're a younger

00:38:54.280 --> 00:39:01.180
woman, as I was and as you are, and that's
you know it's a hard thing to do. But I

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:05.920
found that in the end, people were very
generous. And I found much more than I

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.060
expected, I thought that they were going
to be more problems, more resistance, than

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:15.000
in fact there were. So I was, I was
actually really grateful to all my colleagues.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.460
GERKEN: The art in my office, it's in
the stained glass. They have all the

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:22.510
dean's names carved and then the stained
glasses are criminal punishments, which

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:26.980
include a woman with the giant leather
harness on her face for talking too much

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:29.520
KAGAN: Woo. 
GERKEN: and a woman being drowned

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.600
as a witch. so I take some pleasure that my

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:37.930
name will be carved on that window. So
Justice Sotomayor, if I might ask you the

00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:46.180
same question.
SOTOMAYOR: I don't that you can

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:52.630
be part of the working world without
having a moment, a story, if not more than

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:58.900
one, about being treated differently
because you're a woman. In one of the

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:04.540
classes I had here at Princeton, the
professor had been giving his lecture

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:09.700
for sure close to 40 years, and every time he

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:14.980
got to the point in his lecture where he
was going to tell an off-color joke he

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:21.550
would stop, he would look at me and try
to fix the joke,

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:26.260
couldn't, and then go to something else,
Okay. And the guys would all look at me

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:32.800
and snicker and laugh but I snickered
and laughed with them, but and there are

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:40.270
more. You can't be a professional
woman even today, whether it's in law and

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:46.510
medicine, in any field, without having a
moment where someone is going to treat

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:53.950
you differently because you're a woman.
It comes down to the guy's poker game

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:58.630
Justice Scalia, Justice Scalia was
involved in. It took him a while to invite

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:04.630
me, and I think they were very happy when
I said no. You know I don't know if you

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:11.680
said yes, but the point is that they're there 
KAGAN: I was never invited actually.

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:16.300
SOTOMAYOR: But I do it in

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:20.950
reverse. We do it in reverse. We have
poker games and haven't invited any of

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:34.510
them. You can't deny it without
minimizing the fact that it can leave

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:42.460
its moments, it can leave scars and
it can affect the way you feel about

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:49.030
some people and your interactions with
them. But I do think Elena is right that

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:53.980
even at the very beginning of my career,
where there were so few women in

00:41:53.980 --> 00:42:00.190
positions of power and I had very few
mentors that I could look to to guide my

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:04.540
development, there were always 
men of goodwill and

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:10.570
that's what I call them even today. Men
who understood that equality had to be

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:14.500
put into practice and 
men who mentored me

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:19.300
and who supported my career and helped
me along. And there are still those

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:30.550
people out there, and so it is I think
important for all of us for women to

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:36.609
understand that no matter how hostile an
environment may seem, you have to look

00:42:36.609 --> 00:42:42.280
around for those people who will come
and stand with you and by you. Because

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:51.490
they are there. And so I guess my point
remains we still have a long way to go,

00:42:51.490 --> 00:43:01.500
parroting an old cigarette ad, but it's
a lot shorter distance than when I started out.

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:06.940
GERKEN: So I wonder if I might turn
a little bit to the court and in the

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:11.590
moment in time in which we find
ourselves, so this is a really difficult

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:15.490
moment in terms of politics with, and
there's an enormous amount of

00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:20.260
polarization and partisanship around. And
the court has always been understood

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:25.540
as a neutral arbiter, and it's an
incredibly important thing but it's hard

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:30.310
these days when when people have trouble
even talking to one another, let alone

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:35.260
having a shared set of facts and
arguments. And I wonder how you think

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:40.930
about your role on the court at this
moment and how you deal with the

00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:45.010
challenge that we all deal with, which is
making sure to be fair to the other side

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:50.230
to see things as they really are, to
check your own views. And Justice Kagan I

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:53.740
wonder if you might just start and talk
a little bit about that.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:55.720
KAGAN: You know, this is

00:43:55.720 --> 00:44:02.470
a really divided time, and part of the
court's strength and and part of the

00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:08.800
court's legitimacy depends on people not
seeing the court in the way that people

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:15.130
see the rest of the governing structures
of this country now. In other words

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:19.300
people thinking of the court as not
politically divided in the same way, as

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:26.510
not an extension of politics, but instead
somehow above the fray, even

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:32.300
if not always and in every case. And it's
an incredibly important thing for the

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:39.260
court to guard, is is is this reputation
of of being fair, of being impartial, of

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:46.550
being neutral, and of not being simply an
extension of the terribly polarized

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:53.030
political process and environment that
we live in. And and you know that this is

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:58.750
a challenge. There -
I think people too often don't realize

00:44:58.750 --> 00:45:05.150
that we agree on a lot. If you look at
the court's caseload as a whole, you'll

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:10.340
find that about half the time we're
unanimous. On another big chunk of the

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:16.310
time, we have very lopsided votes, but
there are some issues, some important

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:21.850
issues that people care about, in which
the court is more closely divided and

00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:29.090
tends to be divided along lines that you
might predict if you looked at who

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:34.250
nominated each of us. I think it's been
an extremely important thing for the

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:40.970
court that, in the last really 30 years,
starting with Justice O'Connor and and

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:47.120
continuing with Justice Kennedy, there
has been a person who people who found

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:52.910
the center, or people couldn't predict in
that sort of way. And that's enabled the

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:59.270
court to look as though it was not owned
by one side or another and and was

00:45:59.270 --> 00:46:08.300
indeed impartial and neutral and fair.
And it's not so clear that, you know, I

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:17.180
think going forward that sort of middle
position, you know, it's not so clear

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:25.280
whether we'll have it. And that puts, I
think all of us need to be aware of that,

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:35.060
every single one of us, and to realize
how precious the court's legitimacy is.

00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:39.109
You know, we don't need, we don't have an
army and we don't have

00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:46.069
any money and the only way we get people
to do what we say that they should do is

00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:52.220
because people respect us and respect
our fairness. And I think especially in

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:57.140
this time where the rest of the
political environment is so divided,

00:46:57.140 --> 00:47:03.920
every single one of us has an obligation
to think about what it is that provides

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:09.890
the court with its legitimacy and has
you know to think about how we can be

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:15.380
not so politically divided as some of
the other political institutions in the

00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:25.960
nation.
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:36.589
SOTOMAYOR:I'd agree fully with everything 
Elena's saying. I think it's important to explain

00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:46.280
to people often that part of the
politicization of the court has come

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:56.299
about because our political parties have
adopted the academic discussions that

00:47:56.299 --> 00:48:04.069
judges were having for the longest time
about how to interpret laws of the

00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:11.290
Constitution. And these were legal
discussions centered around originalism.

00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:16.640
Do you interpret the Constitution
according to what you discern the

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:23.829
Founding Fathers would have done or
according to the plain meaning of words?

00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:32.599
Versus people who believed and still
believe that originalism has general

00:48:32.599 --> 00:48:38.510
principles but that, like our society
today, our Founding Fathers were never

00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:42.230
unanimous about what they thought the
answer should be.

00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:49.280
And they wrote very broad terms to let
generations that follow give those words

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:56.809
meaning. And so you've got these two sets
of, between originalist and other people,

00:48:56.809 --> 00:49:04.040
and you've got plain meaning and people
who say no word is plain, because every

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:09.140
word has to be read in context and
context shades the meaning of everything.

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:20.240
And so those academic discussions have
often led to outcomes that some people

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:28.430
can predic, not always but some. And when
the political parties adopted that

00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:35.480
language as their own, they've now
superimposed that on the court.

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:42.050
So originalists get identified as the
choice of a certain group of politicians,

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:46.160
not originalists, 
the choice of another group of a

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:52.730
different party. And I think that that
institutionally has hurt the court a lot

00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:59.540
and may continue to do so. I do think
that there are structures within the

00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:06.890
court, not the least of which is our
modern understanding among, I believe now

00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:14.450
we're eight justices, eight justices that
we have to rise above partisanship in

00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:20.300
our personal relationships. That we have
to treat each other with respect and

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:29.869
dignity and with a sense of amicability
that the rest of the world doesn't often

00:50:29.869 --> 00:50:35.340
share. Elena's relationship with Justice
Scalia is well-known.

00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:38.040
KAGAN: Even though he didn't 
invite me to his poker game.

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:42.600
SOTOMAYOR: I know.
KAGAN: And apparently did you.

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:49.940
SOTOMAYOR: But you went hunting with him, 
and I never would, but and and that same

00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:58.910
friendship, by the way with Ruth, and and
there Neil Gorsuch and I are doing a lot

00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:03.790
of work together in promoting civic
education in the United States and so

00:51:03.790 --> 00:51:07.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:15.380
I think that our openness about
respecting one another is an example

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:23.300
that's important for us to both maintain
and promote. Whether and how we can

00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:29.810
accommodate the differences in our
judicial approaches is a much more

00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:37.760
difficult question. As on some things as
Justice Ginsberg once said, It's hard.

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:44.600
It's a compromise on fundamental
Constitutional principles and a lot of

00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:51.620
those things are what lead to the 5-4
decisions that the public seems to think

00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:59.090
are divisive, but we do manage to agree
on lots of things. And to the extent we

00:51:59.090 --> 00:52:07.700
can avoid ruling in such expansive ways
as to foreclose continued conversation, I

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:13.550
think we have a chance of holding on to
our legitimacy. As Elena says, though,

00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:20.080
we're each going to have to think about
how to do that and how to implement and

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:28.380
support our institutional reputation.
GERKEN: So this follows nicely on one of the

00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:30.700
questions from the audience, because I

00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:33.140
am struck, you know. I read your 5-4

00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:37.880
opinions. You are fierce lawyers. You know
sometimes when you're reading the, hit her

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:42.440
again hit it again. You know it's really,
the lawyer in me is so impressed with

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:49.040
it's hard-hitting, it's frank. You know when
you disagree, you you disagree in a in a

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:54.650
respectful but powerful way. And then I
know how collegial you all are with one

00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:57.350
another when you walk off that bench. 
I think that's something that most people

00:52:57.350 --> 00:53:01.610
don't see and don't know. And and Justice Kagan I wonder if you might talk a little

00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:07.010
bit about what are the rituals of
respect that exist inside the court. Is

00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:11.060
it the deliberative process? What is it
that you do that enables you to do

00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:14.270
something that almost no one else is
able to do at this moment in time, which

00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:18.590
is to be friends with the people with
whom you disagree fiercely?

00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:21.200
KAGAN: Well I'll say first of all 
that I think that there is a little

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:26.020
bit of self-interest going on here,
because we live in this this this this

00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:31.520
world where it's just a nine of us. We
are the consummate repeat players. Every

00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:38.330
case, it's going to be the same nine of
us. And if you hold grudges, or if you you

00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:42.320
know have a bad relationship with one of
your colleagues, then in the next case

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:47.650
and in the next case and in the next
case, you have a not much of a chance of

00:53:47.650 --> 00:53:51.440
persuading that colleague to come along
with what you think is the right thing

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:56.750
to do. So so we all have a kind of vested
interest in having good relations with

00:53:56.750 --> 00:54:01.490
each other, and I think that that's part
of what maintains our good behavior. But

00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:04.580
I will say that I think that it's it's
it's something more than that. And I

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:07.730
don't think it's necessary - if you look
at the history of the Supreme Court,

00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:11.890
there are some parts of the court's
history where people had completely

00:54:11.890 --> 00:54:18.770
pathological relationships, where they
wouldn't talk with each other, where one

00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:23.180
person walked into a room and another
person would walk out. And we don't have

00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:25.267
any of that. We actually -

00:54:25.267 --> 00:54:30.050
SOTOMAYOR: Read "Scorpions"
by Noah Feldman. It's a wonderful read

00:54:30.050 --> 00:54:35.800
even for non-lawyers, and it we'll talk
about that, one of those periods in our history.

00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:39.920
KAGAN: Absolutely. And we are very much
not like that. I think we all get along

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:46.400
genuinely very well. I think we we we all
believe that everybody is operating in

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:52.670
good faith around the table, even if we
disagree strongly with them. You know so

00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:56.570
what what what what accounts for that
I'm not sure. I think partly it's

00:54:56.570 --> 00:55:01.790
personalities. I think that the the chief
justice is very good about setting the

00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:10.160
tone that for the entire institution. We
have lunch all the time. Now this might

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:15.050
seem it's a little thing, but every time
we have arguments, and every time we meet

00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:20.870
in conference to talk about cases, we
always follow that by with a lunch

00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:25.370
together in the justices dining room.
And there are rules about, you can't talk

00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:30.410
about work, you can't talk about cases,
you can so we got to know a lot about

00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:34.400
you know each other's families.
Or we talk about books or movies or

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:39.440
sports, or you know various things, and
you know it just 
SOTOMAYOR: We tell bad jokes

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:45.800
KAGAN: We tell bad jokes. I won't say 
which of our colleagues are sort of the

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:54.620
Masters of the bad jokes okay. It's
neither of the two of us, but you know we

00:55:54.620 --> 00:56:02.000
laugh, we groan, and I think that those
kinds of I don't know whether to

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:08.210
call lunch an institutional
arrangement, but sort of do help to keep

00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:12.020
things a little bit lighter than they
might otherwise be. So you know we do get

00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:17.930
annoyed with each other sometimes, and as
the year goes by the annoyances tend to

00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:21.530
add up a little bit. So I've always
thought that, much as in the academic

00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:25.130
environment, one of the great things
about really getting along with each

00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:30.800
other is that we get to escape each
other in the summers. And you you know,

00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:35.480
you you escape each other. You you're
away from people and you actually, when

00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:39.410
you when you come back, you realize how
much you miss them and how much you like

00:56:39.410 --> 00:56:48.020
them and how much you appreciate them.
SOTOMAYOR: How I do it in life generally is I try

00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:54.920
to find the good in every person. If you
start from the proposition that there is

00:56:54.920 --> 00:57:04.040
something good in everybody, it's a lot
easier to get along with them,

00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:15.800
even when you disagree vehemently.
And so for me, I tell people often who don't

00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:23.000
know, Justice Clarence Thomas knows every
employee in our building, and not only

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:29.120
knows their names, but he knows all their
family members. If someone gets ill, he's

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:34.580
the first one to reach out and offer help.

00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:41.339
He is exceedingly caring 
whenever anyone, myself I can

00:57:41.339 --> 00:57:45.539
speak for myself, but I know he does it
with everybody. If you're ill, if you've

00:57:45.539 --> 00:57:51.989
had someone die in your family, his are
the first flowers that arrive. It's the

00:57:51.989 --> 00:57:56.009
first call that's made 
to see if you're okay.

00:57:56.009 --> 00:58:05.009
He and I I don't think voted together on
hardly anything, but I know that inside

00:58:05.009 --> 00:58:08.869
of him there is a goodness 
that I can admire.

00:58:08.869 --> 00:58:18.599
Might disagree with him on everything
else, but I think if you can approach

00:58:18.599 --> 00:58:23.549
people in that way and understand that a
difference of opinion doesn't

00:58:23.549 --> 00:58:31.589
necessarily brand you an evil person,
there's more space to talk, there's more

00:58:31.589 --> 00:58:42.989
space to engage, and certainly more space
for willingness to compromise. And you

00:58:42.989 --> 00:58:50.759
know the master of that was probably
Tony Kennedy. Tony Kennedy I think spent

00:58:50.759 --> 00:58:56.669
all of his time trying to find the best
in his colleagues and I think that's why

00:58:56.669 --> 00:59:00.680
he could find middle ground so often.

00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:04.799
GERKEN: One of the things that is
so striking about your opinions and

00:59:04.799 --> 00:59:09.809
particularly your dissents is that they
speak to people who don't have law

00:59:09.809 --> 00:59:14.069
degrees. So law can be very technical.
When judges write, they often write quite

00:59:14.069 --> 00:59:21.299
abstractly, but you two are both able to
crystallize issues in a way that's

00:59:21.299 --> 00:59:24.659
accessible to people who are reading the
newspaper. I actually think in some ways

00:59:24.659 --> 00:59:28.709
you share that with Justice Scalia, that
you're able to read it and understand

00:59:28.709 --> 00:59:33.779
the stakes and it's very powerful.
I wonder, especially when you're writing

00:59:33.779 --> 00:59:39.269
dissents, how do you think about uses of
emotion, how do you think

00:59:39.269 --> 00:59:43.829
about that crisp phrase that's you know
is gonna be in the front page of the New

00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:46.160
York Times?
How do you think about when to do it,

00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:49.999
when to play that card and when not to
play that card? And I ask you in

00:59:49.999 --> 00:59:52.460
particular because there is some
possibility that you may be dissenting

00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:57.980
more often in the future, and so I wonder
you know if you imagine yourselves as

00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:03.200
lawyers, as justices, but also as
dissenters, how do you how do you think

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:08.119
about how you write the opinion and and
when to play this sort of one of those

01:00:08.119 --> 01:00:11.450
cards? And Justice Sotomayor, I wonder if
I might talk to you because I know you

01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:15.619
know sometimes you speak quite
personally, even emotionally, in some of

01:00:15.619 --> 01:00:18.859
your dissents. And I wonder if you might
talk about when you think about doing

01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:28.400
that and why. 
SOTOMAYOR: I lost two cases in a row

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:32.660
early in my career as a prosecutor and I

01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:37.700
went to my supervisor, and he sat down
and he said how did you present your

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:42.619
case, cases? And I went through it and he
said, My

01:00:42.619 --> 01:00:54.410
that's so logical. That's why you lost.
You didn't convince the jury that it was

01:00:54.410 --> 01:01:03.259
their obligation to convict. And I looked
at him and I said what? And he said, you

01:01:03.259 --> 01:01:11.509
know jurors are human beings who don't
want to pass judgment on another person,

01:01:11.509 --> 01:01:19.579
and it's very hard for them to say that
person is guilty or to imagine that

01:01:19.579 --> 01:01:26.210
maybe that person is going to go to jail.
And when you're presenting your case, you

01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:33.109
have to not only convince them that this
is what the evidence proves, but that

01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:40.819
it's also their obligation to convict. He
said that to me and I did not lose

01:01:40.819 --> 01:01:46.819
another case and I think I tried 30
cases after that. I had a couple of hung

01:01:46.819 --> 01:01:55.930
juries and I'd had a couple of less than
the top charges, but I never lost another.

01:01:55.930 --> 01:02:06.020
Now it doesn't mean I when I write that
way you have to marshal the evidence. You

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:16.760
have to prove the case. But you have to
convince a reader of the moral justice

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:24.620
in your position. And I think that it's
not every case requires that. You know

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:32.360
we've got more than 50% of cases that
that we agree upon, and I if I wrote that

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:38.990
way for all 50 of those, I'd never get a
unanimous court again. But we do because

01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:45.080
we write in certain ways when you have,
you're trying to draw more votes. But

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:51.950
when there is something that you
understand to be fundamental and if you

01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:58.400
want to have people understand your
position and what you're arguing, then I

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:06.760
do think that explaining it in a way
that people can feel is critical. I

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:12.020
probably don't do it more than once or
twice a year, because it has to be that

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:20.150
fundamental case that people need to
understand and need to understand that

01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:33.230
the choice is right under the law. And so
for me it's not hard to come to those

01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:39.560
moments. I do think that writing so
people understand your cases or your

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:44.690
position is always important. Writing the
most complex case in simple ways is

01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:50.000
terribly important but I will tell you
even though we work hard at that, I bet

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.960
the majority of people never read a
Supreme Court case.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:59.610
They read the the quips in the New York
Times. They read summaries in some other

01:03:59.610 --> 01:04:06.210
form. If I were to ask this room how
many of you have read a Supreme Court

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:14.250
case cover to cover, I bet that
two-thirds of you never have. And so you

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:19.770
do it in the hopes that the person who
does pick it up will understand and in

01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:24.990
the hope that if what you're explaining
can touch people, that they will read more

01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:28.200
than they normally do.
GERKEN: Justice Kagan, I wonder if I

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:31.920
might ask you the same question. There was
a First Amendment case this year where

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:39.360
you wrote extremely powerful dissent and
crystallized a set of cases and as they

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:43.380
were moving through, and when when we all
read that phrase "the weaponization of

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:47.910
the First Amendment" it was it was
something that everyone in the academy

01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:51.420
stood up and listened, and all the lawyers
stood up and listened. It was really

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:55.530
powerful, because we knew you don't do
that often. And I just wonder, how did you

01:04:55.530 --> 01:04:59.900
think about, without being too specific
about any case, how do you think about this?

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:02.640
KAGAN: Right, you don't do it often and you
can't do it often for just the reasons

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:06.840
that Justice Sotomayor said, is you know,
there are different kinds of dissents.

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:10.050
There are dissents where you think
that the majority has gotten it wrong,

01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:14.850
and you think, you know, I should say that
there's another way to understand this

01:05:14.850 --> 01:05:18.180
question, but in the next case, in the
next case, in the next case, you're going

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:22.620
going to go along with the majority's
position. You've had your say, now it's

01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:28.230
time to to join the precedent that's
been created and nothing about your

01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:34.740
dissent in a case like that ought to be
you know, so so powerful. Right? You

01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:39.630
should try to tell people why you're
right, but it's not, the

01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:43.620
world doesn't depend on it. But every
once in a while, you you see a case which

01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:47.850
seems - sometimes these cases they stand
in for bigger issues. It's not just the

01:05:47.850 --> 01:05:52.950
case itself. It's what you fear the case
signifies for the future. It's what, it's

01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:57.300
it's the case, and the next case, and the
next case, and you can see how the court

01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:02.280
is going down a road that you think is
profoundly dangerous, and and then you

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:06.030
have to say so, and you have to say what
you find dangerous about it and why you

01:06:06.030 --> 01:06:09.390
think that there that there is this danger.

01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:16.440
And and you know, in an attempt, if not
now, then next year or next year, or the

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:22.130
year after that, or 10 years or 20 years,
you know to get people to reevaluate

01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:26.610
where that, what the court has done and
where the court is going. And those

01:06:26.610 --> 01:06:29.580
dissents have to be written in a
different way if you're really speaking

01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:33.930
to the next generation and if you're
saying here's what the court has done

01:06:33.930 --> 01:06:41.790
wrong and here's how we you know need
to reverse this, I mean you got up your

01:06:41.790 --> 01:06:48.330
rhetoric a little bit. Now I tend not to,
I think like some of the opinions that

01:06:48.330 --> 01:06:57.060
Sonia has written that are emotional are
really powerful, but I tend not to try to

01:06:57.060 --> 01:07:03.870
get people to feel things, but I it's
just sort of not the way I write, but but

01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:10.680
but I want them to think they have
gotten it so wrong.

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:18.270
And so I guess I guess maybe to feel
that, to feel to feel that their logic,

01:07:18.270 --> 01:07:26.640
that their legal analysis, their use of
precedent, that and their, you know, that

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:38.940
their selection of fundamental legal
principles is is just really wrong.

01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:40.680
SOTOMAYOR: We are very different.

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:43.300
KAGAN: So that's what you
try to do, what I try to do.

01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:44.760
GERKEN: I wonder if I might ask you a little bit about

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:47.660
being a first. There was only four women who have

01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:53.640
worn this robe. I remember when Justice
Ginsburg joined the court, and she was up

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:58.680
there with Justice O'Connor, and one of
the advocates mixed them up, even though

01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:03.630
I'll just say, they really don't look
anything alike, different politics

01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:07.620
different different accents, everything
you could ask for. And so yeah there's a

01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:11.340
lot of studies about what happens with
women on the bench, do they get

01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:16.050
interrupted more, how do counsel treat
them, do they mix them up for one another,

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:21.870
and I wonder when you have, when you
put that robe on, do you feel it? Do you

01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:26.400
feel that gap or are you un-self-conscious about your gender?

01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:30.080
I'm just curious about how you how you inhabit
that role, maybe Justice Kagan?

01:08:30.090 --> 01:08:33.900
KAGAN: I really don't feel it on the bench.
There have actually been these these these

01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:38.400
studies recently that have surprised me,
because they're so not in keeping with

01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:44.850
my experience of it there. And the
studies they insist that the women on

01:08:44.850 --> 01:08:49.290
the bench, and particularly the two of us,
get interrupted more than our male

01:08:49.290 --> 01:08:56.190
colleagues still, in a way that you know
in lots of other parts of my life, that

01:08:56.190 --> 01:09:01.440
has struck me as a common experience,
that women get interrupted more than men

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:05.870
do, that women have an idea and nobody
really responds to it and then a man

01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:12.740
repeats the idea and everybody says, Wow,
that is amazing.

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:20.070
But I have to say that on the bench I
think that those statistics about

01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:24.600
interruption have much more to do with
the fact that there's, that Sonia and I

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:28.950
are relatively junior justices and that
there is a practice of, if two people

01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:32.490
start talking at the same time, which is
often the case at the court because

01:09:32.490 --> 01:09:37.020
there are a lot of talkers on the court,
and and and so the moment you see a

01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:41.520
sort of pause, you jump, two people jump
in, and one of them has to step back. And

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:46.350
I think we tend to step back a little
bit because we're junior justices, but my

01:09:46.350 --> 01:09:52.770
sense of the bench now is, you know, there
are three women on the bench and Justice

01:09:52.770 --> 01:09:56.640
Sotomayor and I sit on opposite sides of
the bench, and Justice Ginsburg sits in

01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:02.610
the middle. None of us are shrinking
violets. We all, you know, ask lots of

01:10:02.610 --> 01:10:09.840
questions. We all can give lawyers a good
run for their money, and I think if you

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:14.250
come to the Supreme Court, it's like wow
there are these women's voices from all

01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:18.510
over the place, from this side and that
side, in the center, and and they're just

01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:26.700
kind of coming at you. And it seems to me
we don't take a backseat role.

01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:30.040
SOTOMAYOR: I was just gonna say that I don't disbelieve

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:34.980
the statistics. 
I accept them as true. I

01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:41.640
think the difference is that not one of
us three are shrinking violets, and we

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:44.540
just don't care.
[APPLAUSE]

01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:57.040
Because of it and because I think we
just accept it and just move on from

01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:02.110
there, and it doesn't stop us from doing
whatever we think we need to do, or

01:11:02.110 --> 01:11:06.430
getting a clarification to a question we
think is important, that it really

01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:15.060
doesn't affect us. You know it was Ruth
who at a public event not so long ago

01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:20.830
said and this may be true for her for a
slightly different reason, Justice

01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:27.760
Ginsberg speaks very softly and it's
sometimes very hard to hear her, but she

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:33.700
said that there were moments where she
would say something and go around the

01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:38.530
table and some male in our group would
say something and it was a great idea

01:11:38.530 --> 01:11:43.330
coming from him and not her. Whether
that's because of the softness of her

01:11:43.330 --> 01:11:50.140
tone or gender dynamics in place it's
hard to tell, but I do think it does

01:11:50.140 --> 01:12:00.190
happen, and but I do think that given the
nature of the court and the fact that we

01:12:00.190 --> 01:12:06.310
all understand that we're one among nine
and that our votes are equal in that

01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:11.160
respect, that it doesn't affect us as
much.

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.380
GERKEN: So it's a great job you have so I

01:12:13.390 --> 01:12:18.340
know you won't be complaining, but but it
does require you to give things up. You

01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:21.340
know the different roles require
different things of you. I mean Justice

01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:24.340
Kagan, I remember speaking to you just
after you become Solicitor General and

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:29.170
you'd left running this giant law school.
You have this extraordinary law school,

01:12:29.170 --> 01:12:33.490
this massive operation, and students,
faculty, alumni, all these things and and

01:12:33.490 --> 01:12:38.800
I remember you said the phone doesn't
ring that much when you were SG, and I

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:42.580
imagine you both now are in a completely
different role than you've been before.

01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:46.450
So I wonder as you think what is it that
you'd given up, what is it what are the

01:12:46.450 --> 01:12:49.930
things you can't do, the things that you
can't say, that you would have done in an

01:12:49.930 --> 01:12:56.500
instant at some other point because
you're both reasonably blunt. So I'm curious.

01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:58.800
KAGAN: The phone doesn't ring. I track my jobs

01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:03.360
in terms of emails received. I used to,
when I was dean, used to get 400

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:07.170
500 emails a day, and then when
I was Solicitor General, I got about 40.

01:13:07.170 --> 01:13:17.100
And now, when I get an email, it is such
an exciting moment in my life. I don't know.

01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:20.910
You know you know different different
different jobs have different

01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:26.040
constraints that go along with them. And
and I've been in other jobs too where I

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:31.230
haven't been able to to do whatever I
wanted to do or to say whatever I

01:13:31.230 --> 01:13:36.920
wanted to say. You're a dean. I mean my
view of the deanship was that as to

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:41.460
various issues that my students and my
faculty and my alumni were very divided

01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:45.900
on that my job was to trying to be
neutral and and to play it straight. And

01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:55.260
and so I think I'm I'm used to feeling
that there are some, every job has, what

01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:59.520
goes along with the job is some set of
constraints. This is what you can't do

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:03.960
and still be able to do your job
effectively and well and according to

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:11.730
the ethical rules of the job or or that
will allow you to serve the goals of the

01:14:11.730 --> 01:14:17.910
job. And so this job doesn't feel all
that different to me from others in that

01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:24.570
respect. That sure there's a lot of stuff that I can't 
talk in public about. There's some stuff that I feel

01:14:24.570 --> 01:14:31.860
as though I shouldn't even really think
about, but I think that's that's true

01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:34.448
most things in the world.

01:14:34.448 --> 01:14:39.210
SOTOMAYOR: I don't disagree with 
the basic point but I do

01:14:39.210 --> 01:14:47.550
think that, more than the other jobs I
had, and I was a judge for 17 years

01:14:47.550 --> 01:14:56.420
before this, first of all I won't wear
shorts anymore.

01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:02.360
You do have to be careful about what you
wear, which when I was a judge before it

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:06.320
people would never think of taking a
picture of me when I walked around my

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:13.360
neighborhood. Now that I'm a justice they
would and they do. I'm careful at beaches.

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:21.800
You know, I, but that also goes to my
conversation in public. When I was a

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:25.969
regular judge, whatever that means but
when I was a judge on the court of

01:15:25.969 --> 01:15:31.849
appeals and on the district court, I
could go and express an opinion to a

01:15:31.849 --> 01:15:43.219
friend privately and never had to fear
that it would go public. That's not quite

01:15:43.219 --> 01:15:50.260
the same today and not because I don't
think my friends intend to spread

01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:57.920
private comments, but they inadvertently
might say something to a friend who then

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:04.190
will report it publicly. And that sort
of thing makes you much more guarded

01:16:04.190 --> 01:16:11.210
than I ever thought I had to be before.
And even when you tell jokes, people take

01:16:11.210 --> 01:16:17.719
them seriously. You you get stuff back
and calls from the press, did you say

01:16:17.719 --> 01:16:27.770
this and you go what? There
is, you give up quite a bit of public

01:16:27.770 --> 01:16:35.030
life and being open and blunt but it
also I think to some degree makes you

01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:39.780
more guarded even in your private life.

01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:44.140
GERKEN: So now I'm goint to ask about your private life, since a lot of the questions wanted to just know

01:16:44.150 --> 01:16:50.389
just this one simple question, what on
earth do you do for fun and and if I

01:16:50.389 --> 01:16:54.690
just may ask my own version of it, which
of you is a better poker player?

01:16:54.690 --> 01:17:00.180
KAGAN: She is! 
SOTOMAYOR: That's really,

01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:06.719
we both like poker. We
have fun with that. I love food and I

01:17:06.719 --> 01:17:12.870
love going to great restaurants. I have
champagne and beer tastes, so I can go

01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:17.520
very high-end and I can go to dives, and
I love both of them.

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:22.230
I do bicycle ride when I'm not injured.
This year you know has been a bad year

01:17:22.230 --> 01:17:28.890
for me, and I like spending time with my
friends. I like cooking. I like you know

01:17:28.890 --> 01:17:35.820
just laughing about things that's not my
work. So I do have fun. Actually this is

01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:40.739
fun. I don't I don't -
Elena and I work together, we're in

01:17:40.739 --> 01:17:44.460
conference together, we're in the court
together, but it's rare that we have a

01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:49.960
plane ride here together or just a few
hours just to pass the time.

01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:53.240
KAGAN: Sometimes we go out for a meal. 
The two of us definitely know more restaurants in

01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:56.620
Washington D.C. than any of our colleagues -

01:17:56.620 --> 01:17:59.090
SOTOMAYOR: Put together, yeah, we
do, we do.

01:17:59.090 --> 01:18:03.100
So I know you read a lot.

01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:06.040
KAGAN: I read a lot. I
go to movies.

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:09.620
SOTOMAYOR: That I don't do as much.

01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:17.240
KAGAN: Try to do some exercise every once in
a while, see friends, normal things. And

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:20.870
actually you know what, it affects your
life a lot less than you might think, at

01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:26.810
least for me. I think Sonia's a little
bit more recognized than I am, or maybe a

01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:33.890
lot more recognized, because her face is
on the cover of all of these books, but I

01:18:33.890 --> 01:18:39.350
find for me that as long as I put on a
hat and sunglasses, so so in the winter

01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:44.780
it's a little bit weird, you know, to put
on the sunglasses, but I could do most

01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:51.110
things without without making a scene.
You know, sometimes I'll be aware, I'll be

01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:55.250
in a restaurant and I'll be, you know,
people will be like over there, you know,

01:18:55.250 --> 01:18:59.900
but Washington D.C. has its share of
public officials. and I think people

01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:05.380
don't get all that terribly excited
about seeing another one. And,

01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:10.060
you know, for the most part, we live very
normal lives.

01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:12.320
GERKEN: Alright, this is just a quick one.

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:15.280
If this we're not your, the job of your
destiny, what would be the job of your

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:18.460
destiny, if you could just pick any job
other than this one that you have, what

01:19:18.469 --> 01:19:20.620
would you do? 
KAGAN: That you really want to do?

01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:21.860
GERKEN: That you really want to do.
KAGAN: Even if you have none

01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:24.240
of the talents? 
GERKEN: None of the talents. You can

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:28.680
trapeze artist if you want to pick it. What would you do?

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:32.860
SOTOMAYOR: Oh you're gonna have to answer that. No I'll tell you why I'm in my

01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:39.050
perfect position, but I don't mean as a
Supreme Court justice. I loved being a

01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:43.130
lawyer, I loved being a district court
judge, circuit court judge. I love being a

01:19:43.130 --> 01:19:51.739
Supreme Court justice. The law was my
dream and I have always been happy in my

01:19:51.739 --> 01:19:57.909
life in my life. There really wasn't
anything that I could aspire to be like

01:19:57.909 --> 01:20:07.719
that except maybe a salsa dancer.
You know, because I couldn't do it and

01:20:07.719 --> 01:20:13.190
because even now I do it, but I don't do
it with the natural grace that I would

01:20:13.190 --> 01:20:21.260
love if I could have found that talent. I
would have been Rita Moreno on stage, you

01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:23.863
know, something like that, yeah.

01:20:23.863 --> 01:20:32.200
KAGAN: I think I'd be Serena Williams or something.
[LAUGHTER]

01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:36.440
but but then I doubt that she'd still be
doing it at my age, so I'm glad I have

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:39.300
this job instead.
[LAUGHTER]

01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:44.900
SOTOMAYOR: Think of Billie Jean King. How old was she when she played Bobby Riggs?

01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:50.360
KAGAN: Definitely younger than I am now.
[LAUGHTER]

01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:53.480
GERKEN: I'm going to say the one thing that's gonna 
displease everyone in this room, which is this is

01:20:53.480 --> 01:21:00.180
our last question, and so I wonder if I
just might ask you a question about the

01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:04.020
effect that Princeton had on you. I mean
this is a place where we all came to

01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:08.520
grow up. We all began our professional
lives. We have a set of memories. I'm

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:12.810
struck Justice Sotomayor, when I came
back as trustees, how embedded it was

01:21:12.810 --> 01:21:17.240
even just in the physical layout of the
place, that memories just flooded back to

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:24.560
me, and so I wonder as you look back, what
has stuck with you from Princeton.

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:32.840
SOTOMAYOR: It easier for me to answer this, because 
it was so transformational for me, and it

01:21:32.850 --> 01:21:40.050
affected my entire existing life then
and everything that has come since.

01:21:40.050 --> 01:21:46.640
It opened the door to opportunity for me in
a way that I never imagined, even when I

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:54.590
accepted attending Princeton. I tell a
story in my book of my mother and I

01:21:54.590 --> 01:21:59.940
shopping for a raincoat that I could
bring with me to Princeton. And we were

01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:08.940
shopping in the South Bronx's most famous
shopping area, at Alexander's for those

01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:18.750
of those - it was a little less than
Macy's, lot less, but we were treated with

01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:22.489
such awe by the salespeople
when I told them I was attending

01:22:22.489 --> 01:22:28.980
Princeton. And as we walked out my mother
looked at me and said, what have you

01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:32.349
gotten us into now?

01:22:32.349 --> 01:22:40.599
And I didn't know. I didn't really
understand what it meant to come to a

01:22:40.599 --> 01:22:46.599
place like Princeton and all of the
changes that it would create in me. How

01:22:46.599 --> 01:22:51.639
much I would grow up, not just in my
writing skills and my thinking skills,

01:22:51.639 --> 01:22:56.440
but in my life skills, getting along with
people who were so vastly different from

01:22:56.440 --> 01:23:04.119
me. And so that gift is one I treasure. It is

01:23:04.119 --> 01:23:19.780
my enduring, my enduring gift from
Princeton. And so it took lots of years

01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:25.000
to be convinced to become a trustee,
because I was so busy in my life, and

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:31.810
when I finally did I was so glad I had.
And it's my hope that more women in this

01:23:31.810 --> 01:23:37.690
room will aspire to that, because it's
still important to have women trustees

01:23:37.690 --> 01:23:47.619
who want to participate actively in in
growing this institution more but that

01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:53.080
is my most enduring gift, who I became.

01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:55.380
KAGAN: Well, I feel as though I got the best

01:23:55.380 --> 01:24:00.180
education in Princeton, and I made the
best friends, so part of what I got out

01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:03.790
of Princeton is a set of friends whom I
keep in touch with and who are really

01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:14.560
important to me however many years later.
How many years later is it? It's coming up there.

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:16.739
SOTOMAYOR: More for me.

01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:22.540
KAGAN: And I got this great education where
people really forced me to to think

01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:27.130
about issues and problems in not
simple-minded ways, and to keep pushing

01:24:27.130 --> 01:24:30.660
the envelope, and to keep challenging
myself, and to keep thinking about

01:24:30.670 --> 01:24:34.570
different points of view, and to keep
wondering whether I had gotten it right,

01:24:34.570 --> 01:24:41.590
or whether there was more to think about.
And that's something that is is has been

01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:43.885
enormously helpful throughout my career.

01:24:43.885 --> 01:24:46.179
GERKEN: I know I know that everyone in this room

01:24:46.179 --> 01:24:49.480
feels like the debt goes the other way,
so I would just ask the audience to join

01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:52.720
me in thanking the justices for being here.

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:55.740
[APPLAUSE]

01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:41.380
please join me in thinking the justices
again and I have a request if you please

01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:47.400
will stay seated as they leave the adwin
gym that would be terrific thank you

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:08.149
what

01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:18.820
I'm sorry

01:26:19.330 --> 01:26:24.770
after the justices have left the room
that conference participants can begin

01:26:24.770 --> 01:26:30.140
to go to dinner and the members of the
community who are not registered at the

01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:36.910
conference can please go downstairs and
exit thank you so much for being here
