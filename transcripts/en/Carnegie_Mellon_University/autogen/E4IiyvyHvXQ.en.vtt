however if you looked at our master plan

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870
however if you looked at our master plan
 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.170
however if you looked at our master plan
that we were dealing with in 2010 our

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180
that we were dealing with in 2010 our
 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.060
that we were dealing with in 2010 our
master plan had different ideas our

sitting there in the middle of it and so
 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.790
sitting there in the middle of it and so
we really needed to kind of start

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800
we really needed to kind of start
 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.970

master plan accordingly and next thing
 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.300
master plan accordingly and next thing
you know while we have the temper quad

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:13.310
you know while we have the temper quad
 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.430
you know while we have the temper quad
which we're very excited now this is the

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440
which we're very excited now this is the
 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.590
which we're very excited now this is the
first building in it of course the

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:17.600
first building in it of course the
 

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.150

with this is our idea and if this was

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:22.460
with this is our idea and if this was
 

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.610
with this is our idea and if this was
for you Brian of our building seed and

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:20.490
the Thomas Jefferson's UVA Academical
 

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:23.840
the Thomas Jefferson's UVA Academical
village and I think it was ray Lane just

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:23.850
village and I think it was ray Lane just
 

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:25.730
village and I think it was ray Lane just
jumped in and saved my skin he jumped in

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:25.740
jumped in and saved my skin he jumped in
 

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:29.060
jumped in and saved my skin he jumped in
said yes that's the best building and

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:29.070
said yes that's the best building and
 

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:33.530
said yes that's the best building and
and campus space in the country so so we

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:33.540
and campus space in the country so so we
 

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:39.620
and campus space in the country so so we
weren't fired so what one thing about

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:39.630
weren't fired so what one thing about
 

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:42.160
weren't fired so what one thing about
interconnectedness that I think is

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:42.170
interconnectedness that I think is
 

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:44.570
interconnectedness that I think is
special about this project and relates

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:44.580
special about this project and relates
 

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:47.150
special about this project and relates
to things above and Ralph and others

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:47.160
to things above and Ralph and others
 

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.210
to things above and Ralph and others
have been saying is that it it exists

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:50.220
have been saying is that it it exists
 

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:53.740
have been saying is that it it exists
within a set of almost nesting scale so

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:53.750
within a set of almost nesting scale so
 

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:56.420
within a set of almost nesting scale so
literally to the scale of the region to

the scale of the campus to the scale of
 

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:03.800
the scale of the campus to the scale of
the groups of various sizes to you know

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:03.810
the groups of various sizes to you know
 

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:05.690
the groups of various sizes to you know
all the way from a thousand people in an

all the way from a thousand people in an
 

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.970
all the way from a thousand people in an
event like what we just add down to one

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:07.980
event like what we just add down to one
 

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:10.160
event like what we just add down to one
or two people looking for a quiet place

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:10.170
or two people looking for a quiet place
 

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:13.970
or two people looking for a quiet place
and a retreat and we also had a very

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:13.980
and a retreat and we also had a very
 

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:15.950
and a retreat and we also had a very
interesting situation of I think we're

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960
interesting situation of I think we're
 

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.660
interesting situation of I think we're
out at one point you said there were 16

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:17.670
out at one point you said there were 16
 

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:20.720
out at one point you said there were 16
prime constituents or something like

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:20.730
prime constituents or something like
 

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:25.100
prime constituents or something like
that but what made it not only exciting

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:25.110
that but what made it not only exciting
 

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:28.250
that but what made it not only exciting
but relief allowed us collectively to be

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:28.260
but relief allowed us collectively to be
 

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:31.250
but relief allowed us collectively to be
successful is that we fairly quickly

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:31.260
successful is that we fairly quickly
 

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:35.360
successful is that we fairly quickly
developed what we think of as a kind of

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:35.370
developed what we think of as a kind of
 

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:38.990
developed what we think of as a kind of
high performance team in which everybody

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000
high performance team in which everybody
 

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.870
high performance team in which everybody
felt empowered to say sometimes

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:41.880
felt empowered to say sometimes
 

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.720
felt empowered to say sometimes
difficult things and to challenge each

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:44.730
difficult things and to challenge each
 

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:47.780
difficult things and to challenge each
other without losing a sense of

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:47.790
other without losing a sense of
 

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:49.550

collegiality and respect for each other

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:49.560
collegiality and respect for each other
 

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.470
collegiality and respect for each other
and that helped us enormously because

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480
and that helped us enormously because
 

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.480
and that helped us enormously because

keeping a teams together I might get in
trouble for saying that but and then we

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:46.890
trouble for saying that but and then we
 

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:50.690
trouble for saying that but and then we
had a design review for it with people

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:50.700
had a design review for it with people
 

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.730
had a design review for it with people
like John Carter and Vivienne loftiness

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:52.740

one thing that we felt was very
 

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:39.380
one thing that we felt was very
important was that any building that can
