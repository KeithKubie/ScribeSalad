00:00:01.495 --> 00:00:02.702
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.702 --> 00:00:04.723
is start thinking about the position

00:00:04.723 --> 00:00:08.299
of an object traveling in one dimension.

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:10.226
And to get our bearings there,

00:00:10.226 --> 00:00:13.105
I'm going to introduce a few ideas.

00:00:13.105 --> 00:00:16.605
So the first idea is that of displacement.

00:00:17.912 --> 00:00:20.628
So you might use that
word in everyday language,

00:00:20.628 --> 00:00:24.135
and it literally means
your change in position,

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:26.135
your change in position.

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:31.263
Now a related idea that
sometimes get confused

00:00:31.263 --> 00:00:33.957
with displacement is a notion of

00:00:33.957 --> 00:00:35.457
distance traveled.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.135
You might say well doesn't that,

00:00:39.135 --> 00:00:41.549
isn't that just the same
thing as change in position?

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:44.104
And you will see shortly, no, it isn't

00:00:44.104 --> 00:00:45.892
always the same thing.

00:00:45.892 --> 00:00:50.025
The distance traveled, this
is the total length of path,

00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:51.025
total length

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:53.551
of path.

00:00:54.808 --> 00:00:56.596
So what are we talking about?

00:00:56.596 --> 00:00:58.221
Well let's say, and
we're going to introduce

00:00:58.221 --> 00:00:59.940
a little bit of calculus now,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.399
let's say that we have a
particle's velocity function.

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.743
And so let's say our velocity
as a function of time

00:01:06.743 --> 00:01:08.826
is equal to five minus t.

00:01:09.785 --> 00:01:12.502
Now this is a one-dimensional
velocity function.

00:01:12.502 --> 00:01:14.127
Let's say it's just
telling us our velocity

00:01:14.127 --> 00:01:15.799
in the horizontal direction.

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.610
And oftentimes when
something's one dimension,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.513
people forget well that too
can be a vector quantity.

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:22.463
In fact this velocity is a vector quantity

00:01:22.463 --> 00:01:25.482
because you could think
of it if it's positive

00:01:25.482 --> 00:01:26.782
it's moving to the right,

00:01:26.782 --> 00:01:28.570
and if it's negative
it's moving to the left.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.126
So it has a direction.

00:01:30.126 --> 00:01:32.796
And so sometimes you will see
a vector quantity like this

00:01:32.796 --> 00:01:34.352
have a little arrow on it,

00:01:34.352 --> 00:01:37.092
or you will see it bolded,

00:01:37.092 --> 00:01:39.414
or you will see it bolded like that.

00:01:39.414 --> 00:01:40.969
I like to write an arrow in,

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:42.920
although that's not
always the convention used

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.986
in different classes.

00:01:44.986 --> 00:01:47.007
Now let's plot what this velocity function

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:48.260
actually looks like,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.677
and I did that ahead of time.

00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:53.624
So you can see here,

00:01:53.624 --> 00:01:56.248
at time equals zero, let's
say time is in seconds,

00:01:56.248 --> 00:01:58.988
and our velocity's in meters per second.

00:01:58.988 --> 00:02:01.031
So this is meters per
second right over here,

00:02:01.031 --> 00:02:03.191
and this is seconds on this axis.

00:02:03.191 --> 00:02:05.374
At exactly time zero,

00:02:05.374 --> 00:02:09.089
this object is traveling
at five meters per second.

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:11.179
We can say to the right, it has a velocity

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:13.965
of positive five meters per second.

00:02:13.965 --> 00:02:17.959
But then it keeps decelerating
at a constant rate,

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.723
so five seconds into it,

00:02:19.723 --> 00:02:21.349
right at five seconds,

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.439
the particle has no velocity,

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:25.598
and then it starts
having negative velocity,

00:02:25.598 --> 00:02:27.943
which you could interpret as

00:02:27.943 --> 00:02:30.265
moving to the left.

00:02:30.265 --> 00:02:31.751
So let's think about a few things.

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:34.189
First let's think about
what is the displacement

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:36.522
over the first five seconds,

00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:40.224
over first

00:02:41.991 --> 00:02:43.074
five seconds?

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.239
Well we've seen already multiple times,

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.863
if you wanna find the change in quantity,

00:02:49.863 --> 00:02:53.880
you can take the integral
of the rate function of it.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.479
And so velocity is actually
the rate of displacement

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:58.826
is one way to think about it.

00:02:58.826 --> 00:03:00.869
So displacement over
the first five seconds,

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:02.564
we can take the integral

00:03:02.564 --> 00:03:04.306
from zero to five,

00:03:04.306 --> 00:03:05.769
zero to five,

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.719
of our velocity function,

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.598
of our velocity function.

00:03:10.598 --> 00:03:12.433
Just like that.

00:03:12.433 --> 00:03:15.103
And we can even calculate
this really fast.

00:03:15.103 --> 00:03:18.632
That would just be this
area right over here,

00:03:18.632 --> 00:03:20.420
which we can just use a
little bit of geometry.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.998
This is a five by five triangle,

00:03:22.998 --> 00:03:25.506
so five times five is 25, times 1/2,

00:03:25.506 --> 00:03:28.687
remember area of a triangle's
1/2 base times height.

00:03:28.687 --> 00:03:31.020
So this is going to be 12.5,

00:03:32.402 --> 00:03:34.260
and let's see this is going
to be meters per second

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.580
times seconds, so 12.5 meters.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.297
So that's the change in position

00:03:40.297 --> 00:03:43.547
for that particle over
the first five seconds.

00:03:43.547 --> 00:03:44.755
Wherever it started,

00:03:44.755 --> 00:03:47.959
it's now going to be 12.5
meters to the right of it,

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.769
assuming that positive is to the right.

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.184
Now what about over,

00:03:53.184 --> 00:03:54.351
over the first

00:03:55.924 --> 00:03:57.294
10 seconds?

00:03:57.294 --> 00:03:58.501
Now this gets interesting,

00:03:58.501 --> 00:04:00.312
and I encourage you to pause
your video and think about it.

00:04:00.312 --> 00:04:04.027
What would be the displacement
over the first 10 seconds?

00:04:04.027 --> 00:04:05.699
Well we would just do the same thing,

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:08.032
the integral from zero to 10

00:04:09.298 --> 00:04:11.574
of our velocity function,

00:04:11.574 --> 00:04:15.614
our one-dimensional velocity function, dt.

00:04:15.614 --> 00:04:18.285
And so that would be the area from here

00:04:18.285 --> 00:04:21.164
all the way to right over there.

00:04:21.164 --> 00:04:23.161
So this entire area.

00:04:23.161 --> 00:04:24.415
But you might appreciate,

00:04:24.415 --> 00:04:26.435
when you're taking a definite integral,

00:04:26.435 --> 00:04:29.035
if we are below the t-axis

00:04:29.035 --> 00:04:30.661
and above the function like this,

00:04:30.661 --> 00:04:32.333
this is gonna be negative area.

00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:34.422
And in fact this area and this area

00:04:34.422 --> 00:04:36.303
are going to exactly cancel out,

00:04:36.303 --> 00:04:39.740
and you're going to get zero meters.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.876
Now you might be saying how can that be?

00:04:41.876 --> 00:04:43.246
After 10 seconds how do we,

00:04:43.246 --> 00:04:46.474
what why is our displacement
only zero meters?

00:04:46.474 --> 00:04:48.563
This particle's been
moving the entire time.

00:04:48.563 --> 00:04:50.723
Well remember what's going on.

00:04:50.723 --> 00:04:53.858
The first five seconds,
it's moving to the right,

00:04:53.858 --> 00:04:55.181
it's decelerating the whole time,

00:04:55.181 --> 00:04:56.969
and then right at five seconds,

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:00.406
it has gone 12.5 meters to the right.

00:05:00.406 --> 00:05:03.540
But then it starts, it's velocity
starts becoming negative,

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.582
and the particle starts
moving to the left.

00:05:06.582 --> 00:05:08.393
And so over the next five seconds,

00:05:08.393 --> 00:05:11.319
it actually moves 12.5 meters to the left,

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:14.221
and then these two things net out.

00:05:14.221 --> 00:05:17.890
So the particle has gone
over 10 seconds 12.5 meters

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.119
to the right and then
12.5 meters to the left,

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:24.252
and so its change in
position is zero meters.

00:05:24.252 --> 00:05:26.180
It has not changed.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.387
Now you might start,

00:05:27.387 --> 00:05:29.105
you might start to be appreciating

00:05:29.105 --> 00:05:30.638
what the difference between displacement

00:05:30.638 --> 00:05:32.681
and distance traveled is.

00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:34.353
So distance,

00:05:34.353 --> 00:05:36.489
if you're talking about
your total length of path,

00:05:36.489 --> 00:05:39.067
you don't care as much about direction.

00:05:39.067 --> 00:05:40.924
And so instead of thinking about velocity,

00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:43.757
what we would do is think about speed.

00:05:43.757 --> 00:05:44.840
And speed is,

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.310
you could view

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.771
in this case, especially in
this one-dimensional case,

00:05:49.771 --> 00:05:54.392
this is equal to the
absolute value of velocity.

00:05:54.392 --> 00:05:56.482
Later on when we do multiple dimensions,

00:05:56.482 --> 00:05:59.733
it would be the magnitude
of the velocity function,

00:05:59.733 --> 00:06:01.729
which is what the absolute function,

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:03.564
which is what the absolute
value function does,

00:06:03.564 --> 00:06:05.236
in one dimension.

00:06:05.236 --> 00:06:07.697
So what would this look
like if we plotted it?

00:06:07.697 --> 00:06:10.948
Well the absolute value
of the velocity function

00:06:10.948 --> 00:06:13.502
would just look like that.

00:06:13.502 --> 00:06:15.615
And so if you want the distance,

00:06:15.615 --> 00:06:18.773
you would find, the distance
traveled I should say,

00:06:18.773 --> 00:06:21.466
you would find the integral
over the appropriate

00:06:21.466 --> 00:06:25.530
change in time of the speed
function right over here,

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.039
which we have graphed.

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:30.706
So notice, if we want
the distance traveled,

00:06:31.567 --> 00:06:33.355
so I'll just say I'll write it out,

00:06:33.355 --> 00:06:34.772
distance traveled

00:06:36.768 --> 00:06:38.768
over first five seconds,

00:06:40.576 --> 00:06:42.898
first five seconds,

00:06:42.898 --> 00:06:44.036
what would it be?

00:06:44.036 --> 00:06:46.846
Well it would be the
integral from zero to five

00:06:46.846 --> 00:06:49.888
of the absolute value of
our velocity function,

00:06:49.888 --> 00:06:52.837
which is you can just view
it as our speed function

00:06:52.837 --> 00:06:54.926
right over here, dt.

00:06:54.926 --> 00:06:57.248
And so it would be this area,

00:06:57.248 --> 00:07:00.708
which we already know to be 12.5 meters.

00:07:00.708 --> 00:07:02.566
So for the first five seconds,

00:07:02.566 --> 00:07:05.561
your distance and
displacement are consistent.

00:07:05.561 --> 00:07:08.208
Well that's because you have in this case

00:07:08.208 --> 00:07:10.135
the velocity function is positive,

00:07:10.135 --> 00:07:12.574
so the absolute value of it
is still going to be positive.

00:07:12.574 --> 00:07:15.639
But if you think about over

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:17.635
the first 10 seconds, your distance,

00:07:17.635 --> 00:07:18.552
10 seconds,

00:07:19.934 --> 00:07:21.002
what is it going to be?

00:07:21.002 --> 00:07:22.883
Pause the video and try to think about it.

00:07:22.883 --> 00:07:25.205
Well that's gonna be the
integral from zero to 10

00:07:25.205 --> 00:07:28.293
of the absolute value of
our velocity function,

00:07:28.293 --> 00:07:31.080
which is going to be equal to what?

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.634
It's going to be this area plus this area

00:07:33.634 --> 00:07:35.793
right over here.

00:07:35.793 --> 00:07:39.091
So plus this area right over here.

00:07:39.091 --> 00:07:42.504
And so this is going to
five times five times 1/2

00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:44.594
plus five times five times 1/2,

00:07:44.594 --> 00:07:47.177
which is going to be 25 meters.

00:07:48.657 --> 00:07:51.467
The particle has gone
12.5 meters to the right,

00:07:51.467 --> 00:07:54.486
and then it goes back
12.5 meters to the left.

00:07:54.486 --> 00:07:58.410
Your displacement, your net
change in position is a zero,

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.662
but the total length of path traveled

00:08:00.662 --> 00:08:01.745
is 25 meters.
