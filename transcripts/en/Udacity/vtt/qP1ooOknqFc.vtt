00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.240
All right, lines A and D existed in the original file.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.000
And there still in both Jake and Rachel's versions.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.600
So will mark those as yes.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.650
Now let's think about all these B's.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.730
Both Jake and Rachel probably had reasons for

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.430
changing it to what they did, but we don't know which one was right.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.900
The two of them will probably need to get together to discuss which one

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.770
should go in the final version.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.290
As for line B itself, you could argue that since both Jake and

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.950
Rachel modified this line, it should definitely be removed.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.950
You could also argue that after discussing their changes,

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.440
they might just decide that they want to keep the original after all.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.170
So let's mark this as unknown.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.980
Both of these are reasonable answers.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.780
The important thing to notice is that we're not sure which version of B

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.340
should be present in the final file.
