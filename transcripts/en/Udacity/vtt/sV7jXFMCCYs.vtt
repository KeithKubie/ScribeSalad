00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.104
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So now we've seen several curves that look like this and several equations

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:08.427
that have forms similar to this one. So it's important that we talk about what

00:00:08.427 --> 00:00:12.259
each of these really are. This kind of curve is called a parabola, and a

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.722
parabola is a curve that's produced by equations that have certain features. So

00:00:16.722 --> 00:00:21.126
let's talk about what those features are. The equation that produces any

00:00:21.126 --> 00:00:26.340
parabola can be written in what's called the standard form for the equation of a

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.423
parabola, y equals Ax squared plus Bx plus C. Now in this equation, A, B, and C

00:00:31.423 --> 00:00:36.777
are all constants, and there's one more important restriction. A, this first

00:00:36.777 --> 00:00:41.854
coefficient, is not allowed to be equal to 0. But why not? That is what I would

00:00:41.854 --> 00:00:46.235
like you to tell me in this quiz. Why do you think A can't equal 0? If that

00:00:46.235 --> 00:00:50.992
happened, would that stretch the parabola? Would it shift the parabola? Would it

00:00:50.992 --> 00:00:55.421
flip the parabola upside down? Would the graph, instead of a parabola, become a

00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:59.423
vertical line? Would it be a straight line instead? Or would the graph

00:00:59.423 --> 00:01:03.906
completely disappear? Pick the explanation down here that you think is the best

00:01:03.906 --> 00:01:04.418
choice.
