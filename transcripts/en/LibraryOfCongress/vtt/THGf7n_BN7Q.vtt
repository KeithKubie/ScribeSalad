&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.560
&gt;&gt; Francisco Macias: Good
afternoon and welcome.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.320
I'm Francisco Macias from
the Law Library of Congress.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.500
We have had a wonderful
series of events in observance

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.370
of Hispanic Heritage Month.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.960
And I want to thank
all my colleagues

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.260
for all the work they have done

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.740
to make 2016 another successful
celebration of our heritage.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.830
Today, I believe, we are
in for a special treat.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.220
In observance of Hispanic
Heritage Month,

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.770
our special guest is the
award-winning Filipino-American

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.330
writer, Jon Pineda.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.800
Because now Hispanic Heritage
Month could ever be complete

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.730
without talking a little
bit about the Philippines.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.990
He is the author of five books.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.130
His novel, <i>Apology </i>won the
Milkweed National Fiction Prize

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.240
and his memoir, <i>Sleep
in Me </i>made the Barnes

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.820
and Noble Discover Great
New Writer selection.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.240
His poetic voice captured in the
following collections, <i>Birthmark </i>,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.430
winner of the Crab Orchard
Award Series Open Competition,

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.430
<i>The Translator's Diary </i>, winner
of the Green Rose Prize in Poetry

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.750
and <i>Little Anodynes </i>recently named
a finalist for the 2016 Library

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.950
of Virginia Literary
Award in Poetry.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.710
A core faculty member in
the low-residency Master

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.450
of Fine Arts Program at Queens
University of Charlotte,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.680
Jon is Assistant Professor
of English at the University

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.260
of Mary Washington and has twice
served on the teaching faculty

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.820
for the Kundiman Asian-American
Poets Retreat held

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.240
at Fordham University.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.460
Of his work, Oliver dela Paz
stated regardless of the distance,

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.160
Jon Pineda's resolute and lyrical
language traverses the spectrum

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.000
of human conditions and eases
our lonely and troubled selves

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.700
into the possibility of joy.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.220
A special note of thanks goes to
Baily Slaughter for bringing Jon

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.080
and his work to our attention.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.940
And now we leave Jon in the
capable hands of our colleague,

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.870
Roberto Salazar, a senior
program specialist from the Office

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.910
of Equal Employment Opportunity
and Diversity Programs.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.510
And now, please join me
in welcoming Jon Pineda.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.040
[ Applause ]

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.340
&gt;&gt; Roberto Salazar:
Thank you, Francisco.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.640
Good afternoon.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.350
Welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.760
Our program's title
today, Filipino-Americans,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.000
the other Asian Americans.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.480
When it comes to labels of
identity, we have a tendency

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.310
to assume things about
others, don't we?

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.010
That means that what is it that you
think other Americans should know

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.230
about Filipino-Americans?

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.970
&gt;&gt; Jon Pineda: Yeah, I -- well,
one of the things when I think

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.570
about Filipino-Americans, the first
thing I think of is the family,

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.870
the way in which

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.830
so many Filipino-American
families are very welcoming

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.480
and very generous.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.500
And, you know, this
isn't by any means,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.460
it doesn't make them
an exceptional group.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.540
I think there are other
cultures that do the same thing.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.990
But Filipino-American families that
I grew up around, they have lots

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.670
of big parties, lots of
"lumpia," lots of "pancit,"

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.710
chicken "adobo," "bibingka,"
you name it.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.720
And extended friends
were brought in,

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.590
treated in some ways
as relatives as well.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.410
But as far as Filipino-Americans
in terms of their imprint

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.760
on American society, I think
it's exciting when you think

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:05.790
about how early they made
their presence known here

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.710
in the United States.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.000
There's the mention of the
course of the 16th century

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.890
where the Filipino Americans had
come over to California and Spain

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.100
but after that, they're the first
Asian settlement, I believe,

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.470
was in 1763 and it was the St.
Marlowe fishing village which is

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.760
in just south of New
Orleans in Louisiana.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.710 position:56%
And it was there for almost a little
more than 150 years that it was able

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.980
to remain intact until it was
destroyed by a hurricane in 1915.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.570
So the Filipino presence in
the United States is, you know,

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.910 position:56%
has been here and then I should also
note that there were different waves

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.730
of Filipino-American or Filipino
immigration to the United States.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.620
And so, if you meet
a Filipino, it's --

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.790
you know, the first
thing I'll ask is, "Oh,

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.100
you know, where are you from?"

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.630
Like in the islands, because the
islands, there are 7000 islands

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.990
in the archipelago and there
are over 120, I believe,

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.590 position:56%
languages spoken in the Philippines.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.280
So you can -- I have seen this.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.500
I've been in situations
where a number

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.880
of Filipinos are getting together

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.690
and they're not necessarily
fully understanding each other

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.720
because they speak
different dialects

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.270 position:56%
or they speak different languages
but yet someone who would, you know,

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.140
kind of see them might visually
think that they're somewhat,

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.380
you know, cohesive in
the way that they look.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.920 position:56%
But actually, they're from different
regions in the Philippines.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.530
So my father is from
the island of Luzon.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.420
He's a Pampangan and grew
up kind of north of Manila.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.260
There are Filipinos,
let's say, from Mindanao

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.440 position:56%
and the dialect they speak my father
wouldn't be able to understand.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.120
So that would be one of the things
that I would offer is to say

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.530
that it's a small country,
the Philippines,

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:09.010
but within that country, there's a
very large community of diversity

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.300
that exists because
of the archipelago.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.080 position:56%
That translates when you think about
the immigration to the United States

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:25.810
with let's say the "Manong"
generation in the 1915 or 1920s

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.720
or so, the laborers that had come

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.560
to the United States
from the Ilocano region.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.490
And typically settled
in California or Hawaii.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.130
You know, this portion

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.580
of the Philippines has a
large connection there.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.330
But then on the East Coast, a lot

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.250
of Filipinos came over
after World War II.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:54.180
So with Filipinos and their having
fought in World War II especially

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.690 position:56%
because of the Japanese
occupation, I have an uncle who died

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.340
in the Bataan Death March.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.250
You know, it's something that --
like, when you really are looking

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.780
at the waves of immigration of
the Filipinos here, there --

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.690
you can point to different regions
and then you can also look at kind

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:19.630 position:56%
of a class system as well that you
know, the recent wave of immigration

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.020
from the Philippines being
healthcare workers, doctors

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.450
and nurses but prior when
the Filipinos came in

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.340 position:56%
and I would say maybe the third wave

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.290
after World War II,
they joined the Navy.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.320
And my father came here
because of the Navy.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.100
He was allowed to join the Navy
when he was still in the islands

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.790
and then transfer here and
then went through the rigors

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.130
in order to become a citizen.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:49.060
So that would probably be the
first thing is just to say

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:54.390
that it's very diverse in
the scope of the community

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:58.370
of Filipino-Americans but at the
same time, it's also very tightknit

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.590
and a welcoming community too.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:03.110
&gt;&gt; Roberto Salazar: You
touched on this in your comment

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:06.930
and that is the imprint of
Filipinos in the United States.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:11.230
It's certainly not a new imprint,
dating back to the 16th century.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:15.550
In fact, it was 1587,
October 18th of 1587

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:19.470
that the first Filipino
mariners came,

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:23.500
became the first recorded Asians,
if you will, that came to America

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:28.100
on board what was then the Spanish
galleon named Nuestra Senora de

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.930
Esperanza which as I
understand was under the command

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:36.570
of Pedro de Unamuno at
Moral Bay, California.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.770
This was a time, of course, that
then in 1587 when California

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:44.930
and in fact, the Philippines were
part of the kingdom of New Spain

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:49.010
and so that certainly is a
significant historical moment

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.640
for Filipino-Americans.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.320
I imagine there are
other moments of pride

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.470 position:56%
for the Filipino-American community.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.040
What are some of those
moments that come to your mind?

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.610
&gt;&gt; Jon Pineda: Well,
when I was growing up,

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.510
my dad would talk about
Roman Gabriel.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:08.810
And Roman Gabriel was the MVP
of the NFL back in the late '60s

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:12.560
and he was mestizo and so
that was the first time

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.580
that in some ways the
Filipino-Americans in --

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.650
well at least in the NFL, that
here is this major accomplishment

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.040
that came forth.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:28.050
But you know, there are also
multiple situations in sports.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.750
You know, I think of that.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:34.950
But there are also wonderful
political leaders that have --

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:39.980
I grew up in Virginia Beach, the
north of Virginia Beach area.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:44.900
So that was -- I always
saw Filipinos.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.430
And then when I moved away from
that area, I didn't see Filipinos.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:51.270
So I got to come to find
out that there were --

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:55.900 position:56%
I think when I was growing up there,
there were over 30,000 Filipino

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.040
or Filipino-Americans living
in that area at the time.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.710
I'm sure it's much larger now.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:07.680
But so I was kind of
insulated in that way.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.240
But since then, there have been
city council members, you know,

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.350
House of Representatives -- those
are the ways in which, you know,

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:22.670
other cultures have made a positive
impact on the American society.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.590
Another major thing that's
occurred in the last --

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:34.270
I guess in the last 15 years -- 12
to 15 years is that with Kundiman,

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:41.430
in the introduction, you know,
the greatest introduction is

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:45.770 position:56%
that Kundiman is an
Asian-American literary organization

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.680
that was started by two
Filipino-American writers,

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.780
Sarah Gambito and Joseph Legaspi

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.940
who are now starting
to get lots of acclaim.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.240
They're in New York.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:11:00.140
And what they did is they were
able to create a community

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.480
of Filipino-American writers
who were winning prizes.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.550
A number of us were starting to
kind of get our work out there

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:11.420
and they brought us together to
be mentors for the next generation

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:17.490
of writers who were or are coming
up and not having to think,

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.760
am I allowed to write about this?

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.070
They're just writing
about their experiences.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:26.440
When I was first starting and
writing about being part Filipino,

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.580
there was a part of me
that felt as you know,

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.640 position:56%
I wondered could I write about this.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:36.160
And which, you know, was just
kind of showing just my lack

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.800
of I would say maybe even
courage as a writer, you know.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.070
I needed to kind of
come to that on my own

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:48.590
but Kundiman has stepped
forward and since then fellows

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:54.110
from that program have won the Walt
Whitman Award which is, you know,

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:55.550
from the Academy of American Poets.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.810
It's the best first book
by an American poet.

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:03.770
They've won these national
prizes, the National Poetry Series.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:09.540
These are the kinds of forays
into American into kind of the --

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:14.440
the venerated American literature.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.120
I also would say that the
Filipino-Americans were making a

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.880
major, major impact.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.950 position:56%
And they're becoming professors at
other universities and they are able

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:27.250
to kind of spread this knowledge.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:32.210
So that, for me, has been an
unbelievably amazing impact

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:35.580
because these are our novelists
and our poets and, you know,

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.670
our fiction writers, our
creative nonfiction writers.

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:39.840
These are -- these are
the people that are

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.690
in language humanizing the culture

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:46.090
for a larger majority
in the readership.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:50.520
And I find that fascinating
and inspiring.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.210
And when I mentioned kind of my
lack of courage, it wasn't so much

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:59.330
that I was fearful of not, you
know, of having any kind of fear

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.020
but of not being able to
write about something.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:08.230 position:56%
I just didn't -- I didn't have
models for writing about being half.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:12.360
There were no books
written by mestizo poets

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.890 position:56%
who were directly addressing that
or at least models that I had found.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:21.300
And some of my Filipino-American
writer friends would just say,

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.550
well then, you write it.

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:24.980
What are you waiting for?

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.540
You write it.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.340
And I said, "Oh, yeah.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.640
That makes sense.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.940
Yeah, I'll write it."

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.390
And so now it becomes, you know,
we become part of that literature.

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:37.750
So I think that has
been a huge impact.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.180
&gt;&gt; Roberto Salazar: And
indeed, you've been one

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.930
of the groundbreakers
in that regard as well.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.260
So let's talk about your writing
and your creative experience.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.790 position:56%
How has that been reflected perhaps?

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.640
You know, how has it
been reflected --

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.410
your experiences of
Filipino-American

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:55.480
and what influences that
had in your creativity?

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.890
&gt;&gt; Jon Pineda: It's had
a lot when I would go

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.430
to these Filipino gatherings
when I was very young.

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:06.460
We, at the time, were one of the
only families who were mixed,

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:11.050
who were mestizo and I remember
just kind of walking around

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:15.120
and I would just hear
different languages.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.850
You know, sometimes,
you would hear Spanish.

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:18.150
Sometimes you would hear Tagalog.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.150
Sometimes you would
hear, you know, Visayan.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:24.390
I mean, not that I speak these
languages with any kind of fluency

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:26.390
but I could recognize
certain things.

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:29.470
And so this attention to
language grafted on --

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:32.300
grafted on me in a very early age.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:37.910
Now mix in that, that my mom was
raised on a farm in North Carolina

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:42.820
and very much from a rural
background in northeastern

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:45.540
of Carolina dialect so
there was also a way

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.220
in which I was understanding
that speakers

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:53.740
of English given their regional
differences bring other kinds

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.080
of focus.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.230
You know, they use
language differently

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.820
and so I've always loved that.

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:05.120
I've always been fascinated
by the ability to communicate

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.260
and then striving to
make these connections

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:13.140
between perhaps disparate
communities.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:18.140
In my situation, I was -- and
with writing, I've always found

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:21.640
that I can have my
intention, you know,

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.620
and that kind of begins
how I start writing.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.980
But it's actually once I put
the language on the page,

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:33.330
once I have the words there then
I need to revise and see if I'm,

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.950
you know, building the image
in a way that feels accessible.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:39.130
It's not over-intellectualized.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:42.310
It's not, you know, preening.

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:46.520
It's not, you know, it's due -- I
want my poems to do certain things

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.210
but most importantly,
I want my poems

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:51.860
to have communion with the reader.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:58.840
So I think my Filipino background
with the Catholic Church, it --

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:03.120 position:56%
you know, we Filipino-Americans
have a very interesting relationship

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.420
with Catholicism.

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:08.220
Not different from
other colonized areas

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:12.620
that also have Catholicism
kind of placed on them.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:18.540
But a love for saints, a love for
these narratives of sacrifice.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.250
That was something that
growing up, I heard a lot about.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.600
My dad would tell me stories about
and he would smile as he would talk

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.820
about these elderly women in
his village that would crawl

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:34.380 position:56%
to the church on their knees and he
just really thought that was amazing

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.430
like in terms of the
faith that they had.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:39.700
And so that was something
that impressed me.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:46.040
Another thing has been the
way in which by being mestizo,

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:53.160 position:56%
I feel as if I am one foot in one
world and one foot in another world.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.490
But I'm never fully in one.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:17:00.710
So when I'm with my Filipino
friends, my writing friends,

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:03.510
you know, who perhaps
might, you know,

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:10.350 position:56%
have parents that are full Filipinos
and you know, [inaudible] this idea.

00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:11.780
I'm other.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.970
I'm part of the group and I'm not.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:19.470
Same goes for my friends
that might not be Filipino.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:23.770 position:56%
So I think that also informs my
creativity that I understand that --

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:33.930
that alone, I have it, a different
relationship with the temporal

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:39.120
and what's transient, what
stays, what's permanent.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:44.460
I'm not as interested in
dominating the idea of time.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:48.610
I'm much more interested in
allowing for the sense of flux.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:51.380
I'm much more interested
in hybridity.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:55.560
I love experimentation
in the hybrid forms.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.910
And identity is -- I'm
less interested in trying

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:02.660
to harken back to a tradition.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:06.310 position:56%
I'll acknowledge a tradition but I'm
more interested in moving forward

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:09.960
to where, you know, I
bring everything forward.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:17.250
And that requires in some ways,
a relinquishing of the self.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:20.120
I think as a writer
that's very important.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:24.500
And so my own mestizo experience

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:29.110
in some ways is kind of
prepared me for that.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.410
&gt;&gt; Roberto Salazar: Yes.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:31.710
That almost sounds
as if you've been --

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:35.040
you've maintained this outsider
looking in perspective of sorts.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.340
&gt;&gt; Jon Pineda: Yes.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:38.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roberto Salazar: While not
losing your identity in the culture.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.300
You touched on certainly what I
consider to be one of the impacts

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.650
of Spain on the Philippines,
Catholicism.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.540
You touched on the fact that
the Philippines was part

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.100
of New Spain in the 16th century.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.130
No doubt, there were many
other impacts that Spain had

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:56.010
on the Philippines and Filipinos.

00:18:56.010 --> 00:19:00.450 position:56%
What are some of those impacts that
carry through today that are evident

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.090
in Filipino and Filipino-American
culture that you've observed?

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:06.320
&gt;&gt; Jon Pineda: Well, yes --
the impact of Spain, I think,

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:10.440
is still present in the
names, in the language.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:17.960
In Tagalog, you can find words
that aren't spelled the same way

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:23.110
as perhaps in Spanish but you
can -- when you hear the word,

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:24.640
it's almost as if an American

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:30.030
who doesn't speak Spanish was
phonetically writing Spanish

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:35.140
and then you see that word
and it's a Tagalog word.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:39.150
That's something that kind of
sits there and ghosts its way

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:41.070
through the Filipino culture.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:45.170
I find that that Spain is very
much a ghost in the language.

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:52.640
It's also this -- the way in
which the islands were colonized

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:57.070
and remained colonized
for over 300 years.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:06.420
They -- there is this interesting
situation and the Tagalogs

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:13.250
that were the native culture
that was present in the islands

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:21.890
when Spain arrived, the Tagalogs
already had a written script.

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:25.270
They already had a
literature that they were --

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:27.880
you know, they had a language.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.620
And that I believe
there's a written script.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.980
You'll hear it referenced as
Alibata which I think is incorrect.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:42.930 position:56%
I think that that's been somehow
the term that's favored is Baybayin,

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:46.190
I think is the pronunciation.

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:49.550
And the script, it's
an ancient script.

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:53.500
And so, you know, when I
think about the way that Spain

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:58.430
with the colonizing coming
forward and taking the culture

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:02.300
that was there and molding it
in a way into the framework

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:11.460 position:56%
of Catholicism, for instance, in the
Filipino history there is a term,

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:16.620
"babaylan" the shaman or priestess.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:27.220
That they were very much a
part of the Filipino culture

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.810
at the time before Spain.

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:34.990
And so this idea of the
matriarch was in effect present.

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:38.940
So when you talk to
Filipinos, Filipino-Americans

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:45.510
about their faith, many will talk
about Mary -- the novena for Mary,

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:52.910 position:56%
you know, the Virgin Mary very much,
you know, woven into that portion

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.200 position:56%
of the Filipino-American experience.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:00.030
I mean, my father when he
relocated to Mobile, Alabama --

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:03.230
he became friends with the
local priest and the first thing

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:07.330
that he asked was, you know,
do you have a novena for Mary?

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:09.270
And the priest was
like, no, we don't.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:11.640
And my dad like worked
with them to set this up

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:15.580
and suddenly my dad said all these
Filipinos came out, you know,

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:19.210
from nearby because they
heard about the novena

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:20.940
and they wanted to
be a part of this.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:25.390
So that's how I kind of -- that's
how I see Spain still being woven

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:30.920
into the cultures that
it's very much, you know,

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:37.860 position:56%
the identity of faith for those who,
you know, who practice, it's there.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:41.530
The food, you know, the
empanadas, the different --

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:44.450
and when you even look at --
again, I look at "lumpia,"

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:45.990
I look at the egg roll
and I still think

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:47.620
of like a tamale or
something, you know.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:53.530
It's some kind of way in which
-- so this mix -- it makes sense.

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:57.210
The Philippines was colonized
not from continental Spain

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:59.940
but from New Spain, from Mexico.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.100
And so to have -- and
because of that --

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:08.770
the Manila-Acapulco route with the
silver that was being moved back

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.170
and forth -- I mean, we're
talking hundreds of years.

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:13.500
And so that's, you know,
it would make sense

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:20.000
that there would be these
intersections of culture,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.680
whether it be language,
or religion, or food.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roberto Salazar: Aside from that
colonization, the fact still remains

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:33.670 position:56%
that there is an ancestral Asian
culture that prevails and certainly,

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:37.180
you know, manifests itself
and then assume, I suspect.

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:41.930
How was that seen evident in
today's Filipino-American culture,

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:43.850
that ancestral?

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:48.910
&gt;&gt; Jon Pineda: You know, I -- it's
something that I feel when I talk

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:50.880
with my writer friends about this,

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:56.330
I think that this generation
is looking back

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:58.530
and trying to find that.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:03.920
It's not anything, I would say,
that stands kind of at the fore.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:08.130
It's more that a lot of my
writer friends are returning

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:11.100
so that the script that I
had mentioned is something

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:15.170
that Sarah Gambito from Kundiman
had brought to my attention.

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:19.140
And we were sitting around
talking about this very thing.

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.410
And she said, you know, do
you know about this script?

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:23.190
And she was, you know, sharing it

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:28.170
with other Filipino-American
writers and we hadn't.

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:29.470
We didn't know.

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:33.300
And so this was a way that
this was being presented.

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:38.590
In the same discussions, we've
also talked about the mythology

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:46.500
and these creation stories
that the -- I'm trying to --

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.910
"Maganda," the first woman,
beautiful then I guess

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:53.340
that was the word for beautiful
and "Malakas," I think is the word

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.410
for strength -- I think
was the first man.

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:58.310
And they emerged from
a shoot of bamboo.

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:01.230
I could be totally wrong but
this was like -- yes, so there --

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:08.100
so we've been -- our writers
have really embraced the idea

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.970
of these creation myths as it
relates to the Philippines,

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:15.370
as it relates to trying to
bring a voice to something

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:18.200
that perhaps has been tamped down.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.880
I mean, that's an identity

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:25.020
that I could understand the
colonizer not wanting to, you know,

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:28.920
to have these stories
be so pervasive

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:33.090
because that allows
for you know, unity.

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:37.090
It allows for these ways on which
people can look back and say, oh,

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:40.060
we all believe this one
thing that we all agree

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.700
that this one thing exists.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:47.640 position:56%
Kundiman, just even the word itself,
the "kundiman" is a love song

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:53.160
that was, you know, that one
would write for a beloved.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:57.720
But it was also veiled
in a way that was kind

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.880
of the love for the country.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:04.390
So when you had these, the
"kundiman" being you know,

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:08.540
one would sing this, the colonizer
didn't know it was really kind

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.690
of harkening back to
the love of the country.

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:16.500
It's kind of a coded way
to speak about these things

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.640
in the face of oppression.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:22.340
And that's how, I think,
the writers now

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.690
from this generation are
using the kundiman --

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:33.000
let's say the full umbrella of
the "kundiman" as this opportunity

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.350
to say, you know, of course
we're American so we get --

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:40.460
you know, we have these
freedoms but we're also wanting,

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.850
we're talking about our identities.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:45.170
Now, we're also wanting to kind
of go back and try to understand,

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:48.050
to contextualize some of the things

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:51.680
that perhaps we should have
known but then we don't know.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.980
&gt;&gt; Roberto Salazar:
You've been immersed

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.510
in this for some time obviously.

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:58.860
How does all of this manifest in
itself in your personal experience,

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.220
your personal American experience?

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:07.390 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jon Pineda: Yes, it has been --
it's been exciting because I feel --

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:10.040
I feel like I, you know,
was part of this club

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:13.240
that no one told me the
rules and no one, you know,

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.550
told me the password to get into.

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:19.050
But yet, they said, why haven't
you been here this whole time?

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:23.260
You know, this way in which
I'm looking inward and trying

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:29.040
to understanding one, you
know, my place like what --

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:35.300
from what authority can I
express myself and still be part

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:39.190 position:56%
of the Filipino-American experience?

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:44.360
I'm fascinated by the
islands and as well

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.990
as the diversity of the islands.

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:52.140
I sense even outside
or looking in at times

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.730 position:56%
that there are regional differences.

00:27:54.730 --> 00:28:04.460
There are -- there are ways in
which there's contention based

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:06.770
on whether you're from
the north or the south.

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:08.710 position:56%
There, you can now make disparities.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:10.710
There are all these
things that kind of,

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:12.790 position:56%
as for any country that's out there.

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:17.900
And so that, I think, carries it
over for those who've immigrated

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:22.060
to the States and then they set
up communities here and there.

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:25.500
And so depending on where you're
from, you have some of this bias.

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:31.780
As an outside looking in, I
feel like I'm able to, one,

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:38.510
study it in a way that isn't,
you know, it's not with contempt.

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:40.920
I mean, I'm studying
it with open eyes

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.740
and I'm very much interested
in them.

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:49.020
And I feel like the more I learn
about the Filipino experience,

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:56.150
the more I answer my own questions
of my Filipino-American experience.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:29:01.440
And I've sensed that as we
continue on as a country

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:06.810
and as we assimilate, you know,
even more in these constructs

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:11.500 position:56%
of hybridity come forward that we'll
have, you know, another generation

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:15.870
like for instance, my children
that are a quarter Filipino are,

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:20.350
you know, what does that mean
for them in their experience?

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:25.290
It doesn't make them any less, you
know, in claiming that heritage

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:30.930
in the same way that I have
other parts of my heritage

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:32.230
that I'm still learning about.

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:36.140
Like on my grandmother's
side in the Philippines,

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:40.630
her family can trace
lineage back to Spain.

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:45.410
And the name, Nunez, is one
that's part of our family.

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:50.930
But I've yet to fully, you
know, discover what that means.

00:29:50.930 --> 00:30:01.650
And so I think this idea that the
culture has to remain static is one

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:07.530
that I personally,
I've never felt the --

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:12.750
I've never felt the
strength of that.

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.730
I've always -- I've always
derived strength from the fact

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:23.600
that it's shifting, moving and it
exposes itself in different forms.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.990
And so, I'm very much interested
in that and in my poetics

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:30.280
as well is interested in my life.

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:31.580
&gt;&gt; Roberto Salazar: And of course,

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.100 position:56%
we recognize that Filipino-Americans
are not part

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:36.150
of the dominant culture in America.

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:37.720
And when I say dominant culture,

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.210
I'm talking about the
predominant culture

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:45.330 position:56%
which in America is typically white,
heterosexual male, Christian, right?

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:48.810
That being said then what
do you perceive as some

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:53.740
of the greatest challenges that
Filipino-Americans face culturally,

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:59.530 position:56%
if you will, in terms of identity
within that broader American mosaic?

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:03.640
&gt;&gt; Jon Pineda: Well, I will
say that the communities

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:09.140 position:56%
that I've encountered in Pensacola,
Florida, in the Virginia Beach area,

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:16.790
in out west in Oakland in
California, others in Seattle

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:21.080
in Washington -- that they're --
yes, they're divided regionally

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:25.550 position:56%
and perhaps those particular
immigrant communities are, you know,

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:30.070 position:56%
can kind of point to those
regional differences in the islands.

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:37.790
But as a whole, my feeling is
that there is so much pride

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:44.330
and the younger generations that
are creating these cultural clubs

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:48.000
at the university level,
at the high school level,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.430
the community level
that they're there.

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:53.360
They're out there and you --

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:56.150
it doesn't take much to find
the dance competition somewhere

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:58.260
where Filipinos are
setting up something

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:01.190
or a hip hop, you know, venue.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:08.460 position:56%
Something where that -- so I think
the younger generation is not moving

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:12.060
away from the traditions.

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:15.360
I think they're just --
they're keeping them close,

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.300
but at the same time, they're
forging ahead in this idea

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:24.030
of you know, what does it mean to
be a Filipino-American right now.

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:26.810
Very different than what
it meant in the '70s

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:29.490
and '80s when I was growing up.

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:35.380
Now there's clearly more education
in the "Manong" generation

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:41.480
of the difficulties that the
prior generations endured.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:46.560
Much more education and much more
attention and that's exciting.

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:53.790
I think that embracing the
history and at the same time,

00:32:53.790 --> 00:33:00.640 position:56%
expressing individuality which might
potentially mean a Filipino-American

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:04.350
that doesn't necessarily look
like a typical Filipino-American.

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:06.330
I mean, being open to this.

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:09.190
This is how the culture
will survive.

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:15.420
It's having that vision in some
ways of the mestizo that, you know,

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:19.120
one foot in one world, one
foot in the other world.

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.280
But the difference in some ways
that the new generation will have

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:28.010
that I didn't is that they'll never
ask the question, can I do this?

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:31.120
Like, it will be this is what I do.

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.020
And I'm excited by that.

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:38.170
That, to me, I find
extremely inspiring

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:40.370
and it's an empowering thing.

00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:43.520
And I think about my --
again, my own children.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.240
I have a son, we have
a son and a daughter.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:49.130
And I love the idea
that they'll be able

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:52.480
to embrace their Filipino
heritage and at the same time,

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:56.630
not question whether
they're allowed to or not.

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:58.220
&gt;&gt; Roberto Salazar: That's
a [inaudible] perspective.

00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.640
Those are the softball questions.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:00.940
Let's get to the tough questions.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:02.240
&gt;&gt; Jon Pineda: All right.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.540
All right, let's do it.

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:04.840
&gt;&gt; Roberto Salazar: Let's reach
out to our audience and invite you

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.880
to ask any questions you may have.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.290
&gt;&gt; I have one here.

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:12.670
I have Filipino friend.

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:16.780
She used to live in Cavite City.

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:20.580
And she said that the main
[inaudible] hero called Enrico Jose

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:25.140
-- can you explain about
that country's holiday?

00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:26.930
&gt;&gt; Jon Pineda: Enrico
Jose, I'm not familiar.

00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:29.160
Yeah, I know Jose Rizal?

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:31.070
&gt;&gt; Rizal, yeah, Jose Rizal.

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:32.370
&gt;&gt; Jon Pineda: Oh, okay.

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:40.220
So yeah -- so Jose Rizal was part
of the "Illustrado" generation

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:45.000
in the Philippines
which were the middle

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.180
to upper middle class Filipinos

00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:52.960
that would send their children
to Europe for education.

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:58.510
So Rizal went to Spain,
as a matter of fact,

00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:02.940
and studied to become
an ophthalmologist.

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:08.950
He was executed before the start
of the Filipino-American War.

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:12.350
He was executed, I believe in 1896.

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:16.070
He had written a piece -- or he
had written a number of works.

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:19.090
One in particular,
<i>Noli Me Tangere </i>,

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:24.400
is a novel that in some
ways was an indictment

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.300
on the friars -- on
the Spanish friars.

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:32.820
He was seen as someone that
would disrupt the population

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:39.420
and give a voice to the Filipinos
in a way that Spain didn't want.

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:44.680
So what they did is they
made Filipinos execute Rizal.

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:50.520
But were, you know, like I think
that what the way it's explained is

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.080
that if the executioners
didn't kill Rizal,

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:55.980
the executioners would
have been killed.

00:35:55.980 --> 00:36:00.620
So he was gunned down
and he's a national hero.

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:04.870
Yes and so, but that novel in
particular is the one that a lot

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:09.350
of Filipinos look to as here is
this Filipino that stepped forward

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:14.720
to criticize the treatment of
the Filipinos by corrupt Spain.

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.020
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:18.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roberto Salazar: Other questions?

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:25.860
&gt;&gt; You talked about
not really having

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:30.890
like Filipino writer
models growing up.

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:34.330
How do you feel about
being one of those models

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:37.750
for the next generation of writers?

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:39.050
&gt;&gt; Roberto Salazar: So just,

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:45.660
if I could just capture the
question for our camera.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:52.130
The question is about how
you feel about being one

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:58.170 position:56%
of those model writers since you
didn't have those models growing up?

00:36:58.170 --> 00:36:59.470
&gt;&gt; Jon Pineda: I love it.

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:03.350
I do. It's something
that's it's a responsibility

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:04.650
that I don't take lightly.

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:06.930
I mean, I write constantly.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:12.430
And I think about, you know, when
I'm publishing work, where one,

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:15.580
as an artist, I don't -- I'm
not thinking, you know --

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:20.420
is this going to be good for
the Filipino-American community?

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:26.420
Is this going to be good for
the Filipino presence in here?

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:28.580
I'm not thinking about that.

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:32.790
What I am doing though is I'm
trying to be honest as an artist.

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:36.320
And if I'm being honest as
an artist then by default,

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:40.020
I feel like it would
be important, you know,

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.180
to be part of the conversations.

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:46.000
As I was -- in our graduate
school, I was able to meet

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.460
and then find models of
Filipino-American writers.

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:54.710
There's so many that I adore.

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:59.280
But at the time, yeah,
growing up, I didn't have it.

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:09.110
And so that's exciting to give
-- to give that gift for sure.

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:14.610
And just even like, you know, on
the way up here, my son had said,

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:20.270
"Your books are in the
Library of Congress."

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:22.000
He said, "Yeah, they are."

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.760
He's like that's pretty
cool [laughter].

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.040
It is cool.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.340
And that's kind of what, you know,

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:32.850
what it's all about in some ways
is that, you know, I'm here.

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:35.100
Not me like we're here
and, you know,

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:38.860
no different than the other writers
that are trying to speak honestly

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:41.340
about their identity, about
difficulties, about a number

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:42.640
of obstacles in terms
of what it means,

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:43.940
let's say to be an American today.

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:45.240
And so to have a place, you know,
at the conversation is exciting

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.540
and I would hope, very much
hope that any inspiration

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:47.840
that I could offer would get those
younger writers there faster,

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.140
you know, to save them time.

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:50.440
So they don't have to kind
of seek out the models.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.740
The models are there.

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:54.040
They can, you know,
write their books.

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:09.460
&gt;&gt; I have a question
about [inaudible] in terms

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:19.280
of having a chance to go back and
if you have, have you had a chance

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:23.330 position:56%
to talk with other writers, Filipino
writers and [inaudible] writing?

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:24.630
&gt;&gt; Jon Pineda: Great question.

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:25.930
I've not gone at all.

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:28.710
And we were supposed
to go a while back

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:33.170
and then life got in
the way a little bit.

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:38.690 position:56%
My dad goes back often and as a
matter of fact, I was just contacted

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:42.200
by a first cousin I've never met.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:46.940
And we've started kind of trading
some letters back and forth.

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:50.490
I'm surrounded by Filipino-American
writers.

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:53.390
Most of the Filipino-American
writers that are writing today,

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:55.510
I've either met or I'm friends
with and these are friendships

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:57.010
that go back now maybe 15
years -- if not 20 years.

00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:58.480
I mean, when I was
in graduate school.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:02.730
So I'm always seeking
out that community

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:07.200
and we share work with each other.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:11.140
And you know, they'll
send me their manuscripts

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:12.640 position:56%
when they're working on their books.

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:16.190
I just finished reading
this beautiful manuscript

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:19.440
by Joseph Legaspi and
it comes out next year.

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.880
It's called "Threshold."

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:24.900
Joseph is a wonderful
poet up in New York.

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:28.270
And his first book
has already been out.

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:33.820
But here's the exciting thing is
that when I met this community,

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:36.530
our books hadn't come out yet.

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:41.420
And so for years, we
would help each other.

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:42.720
And we were reading each other.

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:45.090
We were talking, meeting
at conferences.

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:51.160
We were -- we thought -- I don't
think we ever said this out loud.

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:54.330
But we thought -- I know I did.

00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:56.800
I know in the way they
spoke about their work

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.470
that it seemed like
this was the case.

00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:01.630
I think we thought we were
doing something very important

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:06.750
without saying, This is going to
-- this is going to be important.

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:09.970
And so over the years,
what's happened is

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:13.950
that these writers have all
been publishing lots of books.

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:19.540
So Oliver dela Paz, who's
mentioned in the introduction,

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:21.700
is a dear friend of mine.

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:28.430
And he wrote the foreword to <i>Little
Anodynes </i>and there are a number

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:32.040
of Sarah Gambito, [Inaudible]
Navarro, Pat Rosal,

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:36.660
Barbara Jane Reyes -- these
are all writers that have gone

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:38.830
on to win national prizes.

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:44.390
And I love that we have this
portion of the community.

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:52.020
I don't have -- I have a
pull to the Philippines

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:56.250
for curiosity, to be
there on the land.

00:41:56.250 --> 00:42:01.150
But the Philippines that
exists for me is very ethereal.

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:06.510
It's a Philippines that is it's
in my "ninang," my godmother

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:08.880 position:56%
from Virginia Beach then her family.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:12.900
It's in, you know, the
stories my father has told me.

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:18.390
It's in having met so many
Filipino-American writers that we,

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:23.570
in some ways, have built our kind
of free-floating country of ideas.

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:24.980
So it's there.

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:27.880
I do want to go at
some point and many

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:31.380
of my friends have
gone on Fulbright's.

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:36.420 position:56%
So I'm on a tenure track [laughter]
-- assistant professorship right now

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.440
so I have to kind of see that
all the way through first.

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:44.840
But once sabbatical is in the
air, maybe I'll try to get there.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.420
That is on -- it is on my list.

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:52.790
And I remember, I spent a semester
in Italy and I recall talking

00:42:52.790 --> 00:43:00.490
to my dad and kind of -- we were
talking and I told him that,

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:05.890
"You know, I'm sorry
that I'm in Italy."

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:09.020
Like there was a way in which
I had found a way to get

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:14.010
out of the country but I
didn't go to the country.

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:19.650
And, you know, his take has always
been, you'll get there one day.

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:24.220
But the way that my career has
been, my poetics and my writing,

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:32.470 position:56%
it doesn't center around needing the
country to authenticate my voice.

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:37.740
My voice is more about the mestizo
experience being rooted here

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:59.700
as an American and it's separate.

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:18.540 position:56%
But I, you know, totally want to go.

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:19.840
Thank you.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:21.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roberto Salazar: Other questions?

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:23.810
Yes.

00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:25.290
&gt;&gt; I have two questions.

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:31.110
You mentioned earlier that
your father was in the Navy

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:36.070
and that a large number of
Filipinos joined the Navy

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:38.020
and came to the United States.

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:41.340
Now that the Navy base is closed,
has that impacted the influx

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:46.150
of Filipinos from [inaudible]
to the United States?

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:50.340
And the second question is how
important do you think it is

00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:54.550
to teach children the language to
maintain that tie to the culture?

00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:57.720
&gt;&gt; Jon Pineda: So with
the first question,

00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:00.070
I believe that it has impacted

00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:03.680
without a doubt the American
presence in the Philippines.

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:09.130 position:56%
As far as changing the wave of
immigration, I think legislation did

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:15.090
that because even in post-World War
II and opening the doors to a lot

00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:21.510
of Filipinos to join the U.S.
Navy, there was still, I believe,

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:26.380
a number of around 50, no more

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:30.040
than 50 Filipino immigrants
coming in per year?

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:37.520
And then after 30 years of that, I
think, some more legislation came

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:41.510
to then allow for families
to join and things like that.

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:44.740
So I still feel that Filipinos
are coming via the U.S. Navy

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:48.500 position:56%
but probably not in the numbers that
they were when my father was coming

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:52.060
in which was the late
'60s and the '70s.

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:57.530
There was also a way in which
Filipinos weren't allowed

00:45:57.530 --> 00:46:03.710
to hold positions of leadership
in the Navy until, I believe,

00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:07.340
after the early to late
-- the early to mid '70s.

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:13.980
So if you were in the U.S. Navy
as a Filipino, you probably worked

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:19.330
as a steward or in the
mess hall to some extent.

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:24.760
My father, I'm sure, began
in that way but was able

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:30.890
to become a senior chief in supply.

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:36.860 position:56%
So he kind of went a different
route but he was in for a long time.

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:40.560
He was in for almost 30 years.

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:47.730
But the U.S. Navy has been
a tremendous opportunity

00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:53.290
for bringing Filipinos here because
of the bases here and the States.

00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:58.860
You can go to Norfolk right now

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:06.050
and find a huge Filipino-American
population there that the --

00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:13.240
perhaps the grandfather of those
families came in to the U.S. Navy

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:20.380
and now the next generation
might be in healthcare or more,

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:23.030
let's say, a professional path.

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:27.870
As far as teaching the language
and for that language to a child

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:33.200
in order to have ties
to the culture,

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:36.440
I think it's very important.

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:44.010
I've -- I talk a little
bit about this in my memoir

00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:48.590
because my parents
divorced when I was 10.

00:47:48.590 --> 00:47:54.010 position:56%
And I remember growing up and having
my dad speak Tagalog in the house

00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:59.770
and then suddenly, he was gone.

00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:02.040
And I lost that connection.

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:04.080
And it didn't take
long to just lose it.

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:07.280
There was a way in
which I could hear,

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:11.110
I could still kind of
hear certain words.

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:16.210
But even then, it wasn't
as if I was fully fluent.

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:23.840
But I had a very strong sense
that this was who I was,

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:26.370
like a portion of who I was.

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:30.370
And then so I found myself
like seeking out, you know,

00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:35.800 position:56%
go calling him and talking to him
and then later, as a teenager living

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:40.780
with him, going to live with him.

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:50.290
But my dad -- my dad really wanted
me to embrace being an American

00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:55.150
in a way that you know, I
think to some it might sound

00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:58.110
as though he was -- he was
trying to turn his back

00:48:58.110 --> 00:49:03.240
on his Filipino heritage
and he wasn't.

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.590
I think he wanted,
he had a lot of pride

00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:08.870
that his children didn't
speak with his accent.

00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:10.320
And so I understand that.

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:14.310
I think there was, you know,
my dad's first name is Romulo

00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:19.870 position:56%
and when he joined the U.S. Navy,
the first thing his officer said is,

00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:21.910
"You're Lou from now on."

00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:23.210
Yeah [laughter].

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:24.510
We're not saying Romulo.

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:25.810
You're Lou.

00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:27.110
And so, you know, that
kind of truncated way

00:49:27.110 --> 00:49:28.410
that language functioned for him

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:29.710
and now he's suddenly
lesser of who he was.

00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:31.010
I think that did something to him
that is probably not exceptional

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:32.310
to the way other immigrants
have faced these kinds

00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:33.610
of similar obstacles except that
he didn't resent this journey

00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:34.910
because it provided for his family.

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:36.210
It also opened up numerous
opportunities

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:37.510
that he wouldn't have never
had in the Philippines.

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:38.810
But we still, like I -- you know,

00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:40.110
the beauty of the Rosetta Stone
-- do you know what it is?

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:41.410
I have this Tagalog Rosetta Stone
program that I've listened to

00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:42.710
and have gone through
here and there.

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:44.010
And I'm still trying
to like relearn things.

00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:45.310
And then I'll say something to
my dad and my dad will laugh.

00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:46.610
And he's like, you sound like
an American speaking Tagalog.

00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:47.910
And I'm like, that's exactly
what you wanted, right?

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:49.210
Yeah [laughter].

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:50.510
This is what -- yeah, here it is.

00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:51.810
But we can have fun with that.

00:49:51.810 --> 00:49:53.110
But I'd noticed that
like with our kids,

00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:54.410 position:56%
they've shown a huge interest in it.

00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:55.710 position:56%
So they still have him as a resource
but then we're hoping, you know,

00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:57.010
as time goes on, these other
communities will kind of emerge too

00:49:57.010 --> 00:49:58.310
so that they'll have access
to these Filipino-American

00:49:58.310 --> 00:49:59.610
communities elsewhere.

00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:00.910
When we go -- the food is
very much a part of our lives.

00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:02.210
I can cook it from scratch,
you know, "pan de sal,"

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:03.510
the "pancit," you know, "lumpia."

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:04.810
I'm brushing the wrappers.

00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:06.110
I'm teaching, you know, the kids
how to like paint on batter on so

00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:07.410
that it comes up like, you
know, like paper almost.

00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:08.710
So that's ingrained in us.

00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:12.580
But I think it's because I had that
initial connection with language

00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:18.470
and I hope that I'll be able to
[inaudible] this kind of carryon

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:22.220
with my kids like they're
interested in [inaudible].

00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:23.710
&gt;&gt; Roberto Salazar: You have
some of your works with you?

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:25.530
Do you have a favorite?

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:29.560
&gt;&gt; Jon Pineda: Oh, I know
-- this is the trick.

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:30.860
Yeah, yeah.

00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:32.160
&gt;&gt; Roberto Salazar: Yeah.

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.460
&gt;&gt; Jon Pineda: I don't
have a favorite.

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:34.760
It's not -- well, I, no --

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.060
the favorite is always the
book I haven't written.

00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:37.360
Like it's the book that
I'm like working on, yeah.

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:42.620
But no, I do -- there are some that
are -- you know, there are a few --

00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:44.710
would you mind if I read?

00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:46.010
&gt;&gt; Roberto Salazar: No, please do.

00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:47.310
&gt;&gt; Jon Pineda: Okay, yeah.

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:53.090
Okay so this is poem that opens
<i>Birthmark </i>, my first collection.

00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:55.970
The poem is "Matamis."

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:06.550
Matamis -- one summer in Pensacola,
I held an orange this way.

00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:11.370
Flesh hiding beneath the texture
of the rind and slipped my thumbs

00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:16.160
into its core and folded
it open like a book.

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:19.750
When I held out the halves, the
juice seemed to trace the veins

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:25.930
in my arms as it dripped down to my
elbows and darkened spots of sand.

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:28.170
We were sitting on the beach then.

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:32.600
The sun, spheres of
light within each piece.

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:37.330
I remember thinking in Tagalog
the word, "matamis" is sweet

00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:40.920
in English though I
did not say it for fear

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:43.880
of mispronouncing the language.

00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:49.230
Instead, I finished the fruit and
offered nothing except my silence.

00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:54.220
And my father who pried apart
another piece, breaking the globe

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:58.610
in two, offered me half
meaning everything.

00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:06.370
&gt;&gt; Roberto Salazar: I'm checking.

00:52:06.370 --> 00:52:07.670
If you want, you [inaudible]?

00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:10.710
&gt;&gt; Jon Pineda: I meant to, okay.

00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:12.450
Let's see [laughter].

00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:14.370
This is always a good
one because in this,

00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:17.560
the speaker has hair [laughter].

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:20.850
This is "Wrestling."

00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:25.270
Before the season, we
were already pissed.

00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:27.610
Our bodies tightening around ribs.

00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:32.090
Our eyes like panthers
sinking in the shadows.

00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:37.160
We had given up food, sweat until
the air around us was heavy.

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:41.300
The only thing we cared
about was winning.

00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:45.100
At our first match, I wrestled
a guy I had met summers ago

00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:50.200
at a Filipino gathering, some
First Communion or baptism.

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:54.520
By a manmade lake separating the
neighborhood in two where most

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:58.840
of the children had wandered, a
few of the boys pinned my shoulders

00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:02.590
against the tree while
one punched me.

00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:07.050
I could say it was because
I was only half, a mestizo.

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:09.360
But that would be too easy.

00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:13.360
We were just boys,
happy in our anger.

00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:17.280
When they let me go, their
eyes clouded as the lake.

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:19.350
I didn't say a word.

00:53:19.350 --> 00:53:24.390
Years later, when I pulled the one
who had punched me down on the mat,

00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:29.070
I watched the clock as I locked
the breath inside his throat.

00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:30.900
He could have been my brother.

00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:34.160
His hair the same coarse
black strands.

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:37.690
His face filled with my shadow.

00:53:37.690 --> 00:53:40.940
I held him there in
front of everyone.

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:45.340
&gt;&gt; Roberto Salazar: Jon Pineda,

00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:48.600
trailblazing the Filipino-American
narrative.

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:49.930
Thank you so much for
sharing with us.

00:53:49.930 --> 00:53:51.730
&gt;&gt; Jon Pineda: Thank you so much.

00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:56.380
[ Applause ]

00:53:56.380 --> 00:54:00.030

of the Library of Congress.
