KATE HARRIS: Hi.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.300
I'm Kate Harris, and I am a
mobile product manager that

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.180
focuses on Android at the "New
York Times." And I'm with--

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.440
FARRAH ASSIR: Hi.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.760
I'm Farrah Assir.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.150
I work on our Android App.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.650
I'm a designer.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.240
KATE HARRIS: We were actually
on Android pretty early.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.070
Our first app debuted in 2010.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.010
But I think we, like many
other publishers and

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.190
developers, were very rushed
to get something out there.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.530
And we took what we knew, which
was iOS at the time, and

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.160
tried to make it work
on Android.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.370
When Google came out with the
design principles with Android

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.500
4.0, we were very excited.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.700
And we decided that that was the
right time to completely

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.510
rehaul what we had and embrace
the new principles and

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.420
relaunch our app.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.120
In response, we recommitted
to Android, I'd say.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.620
FARRAH ASSIR: Yeah.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.920
And I think our goal was to
make it more intuitive for

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.920
Android users.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.480
And I think that worked.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.200
KATE HARRIS: After a lot of work
in September we were able

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.610
to relaunch our phone app.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.330
And then quickly after, in
December, we launched our

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.190
responsive app, which took our
phone app and scaled it up so

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.580
it looked great on 7-inch
tablets and 10-inch tablets.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.530
And so this is what our old
article looked like.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.430
And here's our new article.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.725
And Farrah can actually tap into
the lead photo and enter

00:01:21.725 --> 00:01:23.520
a slideshow.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.970
So it's a much more interactive
article

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.350
representation.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.980
Just by looking at our list of
articles in our old app, which

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.910
Farrah is holding on the left,
and comparing it with our new

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.880
and improved list of articles
on the right, you can see

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.310
visually just how striking
the differences are.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.430
FARRAH ASSIR: Well, it
was interesting.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.470
Having those constraints in
place actually helped us focus

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.050
and push our ideas a little
further, kind of thinking

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.900
differently than we would have
if we just had blue skies.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.440
So it was good to have those
suggestions or guidelines and

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.960
be able to think about
how to make it our

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.090
own app within those.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.900
And I think they help a
lot with usability.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.910
Android users are familiar
with these patterns.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.710
And we were able to work
them in and still

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.750
make them our own.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.240
Another great thing about the
redesign was the way we used

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.960
image varieties and just
optimized for the device that

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.970
the user is on.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.080
So if you look at the tablet,
we have these big, beautiful

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.930
images that show off
our photography.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.430
And then if you look at it on
the phone, we take into

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.810
consideration conserving data
and performance, so we load a

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.030
smaller image there.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.870
I think how we made this app
feel like the "New York Times"

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.590
had a lot to do with
typography.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.690
So we were able to integrate
our custom

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.480
typefaces and our colors.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.430
And the way that we mix
typefaces together makes it

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.400
feel like the "New
York Times."

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.650
KATE HARRIS: One thing that's
great about the Google Play

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.810
store is it allows us to move
quicker with new releases.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.400
So now we're actually launching
features on Android

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.450
first, before we roll them out
on our other platforms.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.330
So some of the features that
have debuted first on Android

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.430
are text-to-speech, and
also comments was

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.690
rolled out on Android.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.310
And it's something that we're
actively working on on our

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.180
other platforms, because
our users were so

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.750
engaged with the content.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.320
So we're continually working
to improve the app.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.300
Last week, we just
released search,

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.360
which is very exciting.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.470
Users can search locally on
the device and also search

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.990
from the website.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.380
We've seen incredible
growth, actually.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.070
Since we relaunched the phone
app, our monthly unique users

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.280
have gone up over 200%.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.280
And since we launched the
responsive app, expanding to

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.700
tablet, our tablet numbers
have increased by 500%
