00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.320
With the Sochi Winter Olympic games just around
the corner, athletes will be competing for

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.870
bronze, silver and gold...or will they? The
winners will actually receive a gold medal

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.430
made almost entirely of sterling silver. This
first place medal will be practically identical

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.080
to the silver medal, except it must be covered
in at least 6 grams of pure gold. In fact,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.840
it was in the year 1912 that the last solid
gold medal was handed out. The current bronze

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.269
medal is made of a metal alloy composed of
mostly copper and tin - potentially valued

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:37.370
at only $4. Meanwhile, athletes who win first
place on February, 15th, 2014, will receive

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.670
"cosmic medals" which are gold medals embedded
with fragments of the super bolide meteor

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.340
which exploded over Chelyabinsk Russia exactly
one year ago.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.340
But gold medals weren't always awarded to
champions. At the Games of the I Olympiad

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.559
in 1896, winners received a silver medal along
with an olive branch. The runner up got a

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.690
bronze medal with third place finishers receiving
nothing. China also received nothing at the

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.269
olympics for a long period of time, with their
first olympic medal coming in 1984.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.300
And while the Olympians may train in gynasiums,
the word gymnasium actually comes from the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.899
greek word "gymnos" meaning naked. So it's
no surprise that ancient greeks competing

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.360
in the olympics were completely nude. Nudity
would be hard to pull off at the winter olympics

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.380
though, which occurred for the first time
in 1924 in (SHAMONEY) Chamonix, France.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.270
Shortly after this date, in 1936, The Olympics
were broadcast on television for the first

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.039
time. Held in Berlin Germany, during the Nazi
regime, the fuzzy black and white images replaced

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:36.080
conventional radio coverage, drawing an estimated
audience of 150,000 viewers.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.489
Though as the Olympics grows older, some olympians
seem to be getting younger; the youngest ever

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:45.080
olympic medal winner was Dimitrios Loundras,
who was awarded a bronze medal in gymnastics

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.220
at the age of 10. On the other hand the oldest
olympic medal winner was Oscar Swahn, who

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.640
won an olympic silver medal in shooting at
the age of 72.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.069
The first snowboarding olympic event was held
in Nagano in 1998. It was Canadian Ross Rebagliati

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.660
who infamously took home the first gold medal
ever in this event. In a scandal, he lost

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.700
his medal the next day because nanograms of
marijuana were found in his body. Claiming

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.440
the cause was second hand smoke at the time,
Ross is now entering the medical marijuana

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.860
business with his first cannabis cafe opening
in Whistler entitled Ross' Gold.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.920
Mix that gold with the blue, red, green, and
black rings - and white background - and you

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.590
get the Olympic logo, representing the colours
of every countries flag in the world. Unlike

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.530
the two cancelled Winter Olympics during World
War II, it's a reminder of our international

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.000
communities consistently coming together.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.400
And because of all the excitement surrounding
the Olympics, we've decided to release a video

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.810
every single day, starting this Thursday,
February 6th for 19 days straight. Can't wait?

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.360
Our amazing partners at the CBC already have
5 of the videos up now, for you to binge on!

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.510
Just head to cbc.ca/olympics/sciencesays to
watch them before anyone else - there's a

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.460
clickable link in the description below!

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.960
That's right, we'll be looking at your burning
questions like why we get nervous, does sex

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.430
affect athletic performance, the ideal Olympic
diet, and more. It's a science blitz!

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.760
But we also want to know YOUR questions for
this special series! Use the hashtag #ScienceSays

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.650
