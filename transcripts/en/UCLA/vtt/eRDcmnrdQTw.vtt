00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.800
As California taxpayers, you invest in UCLA.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.940
So, we thought you'd like to know what happens to your money.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.050
UCLA is world-renowned for teaching, research, and service, and its healthcare enterprise

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.280
is one of the nation's best.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:24.780
With 45,000 students and 43,000 full and part-time
employees, UCLA is a big university.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.480
Among our staff and alumni, you'll find 14
Nobel laureates, 13 MacArthur fellows,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.260
nine National Medal of Science winners.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.720
Not to mention Pulitzer Prize, Oscar, Emmy and Golden Globe Award recipients.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:47.040
UCLA was ranked the top public institution by U.S. News &amp; World Report, and the best value by Forbes.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.400
One-third of our students are first in their
families to go to college.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.860
We have high transfer rates and offer supportive
programs so Californians can be successful and graduate.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.320
Where else does your money go?

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.799
Well, right back into the California economy.

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:16.450
During 2016-17, UCLA's economic impact on the California economy was $11.06 billion.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:23.259
UCLA supported over 72,700 full-time jobs
in California.

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:31.909
24 startups were formed using UCLA technology,
creating more jobs and encouraging more spending.

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.350
Since 2000, startup valuations built on UCLA's
tech total $33 billion.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.899
This is all not to mention that the college
degree earned by its students will help them

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.060
make more money in their lifetimes, adding
to California's growth since most UCLA students

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.049
remain in the state.

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:56.739
We're grateful for every dollar received,
and hope that you see that an investment in

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:03.630
UCLA pays dividends to all of us in the City
of Los Angeles, Southern California, and across

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.979
the great state of California.
