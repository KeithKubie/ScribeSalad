Hello everyone, I'm Sushil Bharati from Nepal.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.720
Hello my name is Chris Marchand.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.600
My name is Srinivasan, I'm from Bangalore, India.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.439
My name is Abbas Jaffary, I'm an adjunct mathematics
instructor at Morraine Valley Community College.

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.930
I first learned about OCW when I was in high
school. And I remembered looking at it and

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.590
just thinking about how great all of MIT's
classes seemed.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.530
I have seen news about OpenCourseWare in the
internet. Then I fell in love with it.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.370
My first reaction when I read about OCW was...wow
it can't be true. It's too good to be true

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.579
as a matter of fact.

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.410
The resources online, you'd be amazed at what
kids would be interested in learning if you

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.120
just show them a little bit about prime numbers
or areas or tangent lines.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.469
When I first realized that the MIT course
content was free for students i was like...wow

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:04.739
this is amazing.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.110
You can't put a value on the lectures, because
it's just absolutely invaluable.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.819
And it was something that really just made me want
to go to MIT.

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:17.969
I've always admired MIT as an institution
and I said okay this is what the kids over

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:22.080
there are doing, this is what instructors
are doing. We can all do this, just pay attention,

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.340
look at what's going on.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.000
Thank you MIT.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.490
For opening your books.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.200
For opening your doors.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.000
For opening your hearts.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.170
I am course 6.867 Machine Learning.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.910
I am course 1801.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.540
I am 18.06 Linear Algebra.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.680
You may not know me.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.080
I know you may not know me.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.940
But I am your student.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.200
But I am your student.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.980
And you are my professor.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.400
And you are my professor.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.600
So thank you.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.600
