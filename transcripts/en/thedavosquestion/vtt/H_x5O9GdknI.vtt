00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:07.649
Buyelwa: I'm not confident that the global
economics will recover in 2009.

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.170
Especially given that the process of the problem
is still unfolding.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.220
And we don't know when it will end, so it
is not possible to predict that by the end

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.570
of 2009 we'll gave solved all the problems.
But also, we still need to get to the root

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:30.400
of the problem, and analyze what the problem
is so that we can be able to come up with

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.101
actions.
But you can look up to the minds of Soros,

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:40.800
George Soros and other minds that can help
us with the situation.
