00:00:13.623 --> 00:00:15.079
So two guys walk into a bar.

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.708
Really?

00:00:15.708 --> 00:00:16.794
No, seriously.

00:00:16.794 --> 00:00:18.364
Two guys walk into a bar,

00:00:18.364 --> 00:00:19.760
an ice cream bar:

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.697
Dave, a physicist working on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN,

00:00:23.697 --> 00:00:26.010
the European laboratory for particle physics,

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.704
and Steve, a blues singer.

00:00:28.704 --> 00:00:30.249
"Dave, how's it going?"

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:32.282
"Steve, good to see you!"

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:34.310
"Two scoops of chocolate almond for me."

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.522
"Vanilla shake."

00:00:35.522 --> 00:00:38.129
"Hey, I just saw something about the LHC on TV.

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.733
You guys found bozo in your detector?"

00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:42.073
"Well, not exactly.

00:00:42.073 --> 00:00:43.400
We found a boson,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.244
probably the Higgs boson."

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:46.245
"What's that?"

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:47.480
"It's a particle."

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.619
"Don't you find particles all the time?"

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:51.241
"Yes, but this one means

00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:53.763
that the Higgs field might really exist."

00:00:53.763 --> 00:00:55.528
"Field? What field?"

00:00:55.528 --> 00:00:57.000
"The Higgs field.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.793
It's named after Peter Higgs,

00:00:58.793 --> 00:01:01.170
although many others contributed to the idea.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.921
It isn't a field, like where you grow corn,

00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:07.302
but a hypothetical, invisible kind of force field

00:01:07.302 --> 00:01:09.220
that pervades the whole universe."

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.571
"Hmmmm, okay.

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.433
If it pervades the whole universe,

00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:15.065
how come I've never seen it?

00:01:15.065 --> 00:01:17.358
That's a bit strange."

00:01:17.358 --> 00:01:19.443
"Well, actually, it's not that strange.

00:01:19.443 --> 00:01:21.277
Think of the air around us.

00:01:21.277 --> 00:01:23.233
We can't see it or smell it.

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:25.319
Well, perhaps in some places we can.

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:29.581
But we can detect its presence with sophisticated equipment,

00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:31.748
like our own bodies.

00:01:31.748 --> 00:01:34.370
So the fact that we can't see something

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.336
just makes it a bit harder to determine

00:01:36.336 --> 00:01:38.274
whether its really there or not."

00:01:38.274 --> 00:01:40.417
"Alright, go on."

00:01:40.417 --> 00:01:43.795
"So, we believe this Higgs field is all around us,

00:01:43.795 --> 00:01:45.340
everywhere in the universe.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.806
And what it does is rather special -

00:01:47.806 --> 00:01:50.636
it gives mass to elementary particles."

00:01:50.636 --> 00:01:52.554
"What's an elementary particle?"

00:01:52.554 --> 00:01:54.690
"An elementary particle is what we call

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.068
particles that have no structure,

00:01:57.068 --> 00:01:58.895
they can't be divided,

00:01:58.895 --> 00:02:01.653
they're the basic building blocks of the universe."

00:02:01.653 --> 00:02:03.199
"I thought those were atoms."

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:07.035
"Well, atoms are actually made of smaller components,

00:02:07.035 --> 00:02:09.447
protons, neutrons, and electrons.

00:02:09.447 --> 00:02:12.450
While electrons are fundamental particles,

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.827
neutrons and protons are not.

00:02:14.827 --> 00:02:18.539
They are made up of other fundamental particles called quarks."

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:19.999
"Sounds like Russian dolls.

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:21.623
Does it ever end?"

00:02:21.623 --> 00:02:23.544
"Actually, we don't really know.

00:02:23.544 --> 00:02:25.171
But our current understanding

00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:27.882
is called the Standard Model.

00:02:27.882 --> 00:02:30.945
In it, there are two types of fundamental particles:

00:02:30.945 --> 00:02:33.554
the fermions, that make up matter,

00:02:33.554 --> 00:02:36.731
and the bosons, that carry forces.

00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:38.942
We often order these particles

00:02:38.942 --> 00:02:41.979
according to their properties, such as mass.

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:44.460
We can measure the masses of the particles,

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.208
but we never really knew where this mass came from

00:02:48.208 --> 00:02:50.950
or why they have the masses they do."

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.283
"So how does this Higgs field thing explain mass?"

00:02:54.283 --> 00:02:57.453
"Well, when a particle passes through the Higgs field,

00:02:57.453 --> 00:03:00.373
it interacts and gets mass.

00:03:00.373 --> 00:03:03.341
The more it interacts, the more mass it has."

00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:05.795
"OK, I kind of get that, but is it really that important?

00:03:05.795 --> 00:03:07.797
I mean, what if there were no Higgs field?"

00:03:07.797 --> 00:03:09.257
"If there were no Higgs field,

00:03:09.257 --> 00:03:11.467
the world wouldn't exist at all.

00:03:11.467 --> 00:03:14.637
There would be no stars, no planets, no air, no anything,

00:03:14.637 --> 00:03:17.723
not even that spoon or the ice cream you're eating."

00:03:17.723 --> 00:03:18.808
"Oh, that would be bad.

00:03:18.808 --> 00:03:22.437
Okay, but where does this Higgs boson fit into things?"

00:03:22.437 --> 00:03:24.680
"Alright, now, you see the cherry in my shake?"

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.729
"Can I have it?"

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:29.449
"No, not yet. We have to use it as an analogy first."

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:31.911
"Oh, right, the cherry's the Higgs boson."

00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:33.781
"No, not quite.

00:03:33.781 --> 00:03:38.585
The cherry is a particle moving through the Higgs field, the shake.

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:41.335
The shake gives the cherry its mass."

00:03:41.335 --> 00:03:45.828
"I get it. Okay, so the molecules of the shake are the Higgs bosons!"

00:03:45.828 --> 00:03:47.738
"Well, you're getting closer.

00:03:47.738 --> 00:03:50.717
It takes an excitation of the Higgs field

00:03:50.717 --> 00:03:53.183
to produce the Higgs boson.

00:03:53.183 --> 00:03:55.599
So, for example, if I were to add energy

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.397
by, say, dropping this cherry in the shake,"

00:03:58.397 --> 00:03:59.820
"Ah, then the drops that spill on the bar

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.608
are the Higgs bosons."

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:07.117
"Almost! The splash itself is the Higgs boson."

00:04:07.117 --> 00:04:09.558
"Are you serious?"

00:04:09.558 --> 00:04:12.777
"Well, that's what quantum mechanics teaches us.

00:04:12.777 --> 00:04:17.799
In fact, all particles are excitations of fields."

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.328
"Okay, right. Well, I kind of see why you like particle physics,

00:04:21.328 --> 00:04:23.035
it's quite cool,

00:04:23.035 --> 00:04:25.332
strange, but cool."

00:04:25.332 --> 00:04:27.430
"Yeah, you could call it a bit strange,

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.711
it's not like everyday life.

00:04:29.711 --> 00:04:34.883
The Higgs boson is an excitation of the Higgs field.

00:04:34.883 --> 00:04:36.885
By finding the Higgs boson,

00:04:36.885 --> 00:04:40.234
we know that the Higgs field exists."

00:04:40.234 --> 00:04:41.979
"Right. So now you found it,

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.017
we know this Higgs field exists.

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:45.185
You must be done.

00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:47.812
Is there anything left of particle physics?"

00:04:47.812 --> 00:04:50.653
"Actually, we've just begun.

00:04:50.653 --> 00:04:53.619
It's a bit like, you know, when Columbus thought

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:56.399
he had found a new route to India.

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:59.199
He'd, indeed, found something new,

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.535
but not quite what he was expecting.

00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:05.413
So, first, we need to make sure that the boson we found

00:05:05.413 --> 00:05:08.250
is actually the Higgs boson.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.302
It seems to fit, but we need to measure

00:05:10.302 --> 00:05:12.462
its properties to be sure."

00:05:12.462 --> 00:05:13.399
"How'd you do that?"

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:15.396
"Take a lot more data.

00:05:15.396 --> 00:05:18.885
This new boson lives for only a very short time

00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:20.513
before it breaks down or decays

00:05:20.513 --> 00:05:23.378
into lighter, more stable particles.

00:05:23.378 --> 00:05:24.773
By measuring these particles,

00:05:24.773 --> 00:05:27.651
you learn about the properties of the boson."

00:05:27.651 --> 00:05:29.816
"And what exactly are you looking for?"

00:05:29.816 --> 00:05:32.915
"Well, the Standard Model predicts how often

00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:35.440
and in what ways the Higgs boson would decay

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.000
to the various, lighter particles.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.711
So we want to see if the particle we have found

00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:43.494
is the one predicted by the Standard Model

00:05:43.494 --> 00:05:46.918
or if it fits into other possible theoretical models."

00:05:46.918 --> 00:05:48.924
"And if it fits a different model?"

00:05:48.924 --> 00:05:51.548
"That would be even more exciting!

00:05:51.548 --> 00:05:54.634
In fact, that's how science advances.

00:05:54.634 --> 00:05:57.470
We replace old models with new ones

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.191
if they better explain our observations."

00:06:00.191 --> 00:06:03.310
"Right, so it seems like finding this Higgs boson

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.562
gives a direction for exploration,

00:06:05.562 --> 00:06:08.189
a bit like that Columbus guy heading west."

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:11.893
"Exactly! And this is really just the beginning."
