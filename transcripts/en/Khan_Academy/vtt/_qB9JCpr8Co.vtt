00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.110
Problem 38.

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.080
In the drawing below, the figure
formed by the squares

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.650
with sides that are labeled x,
y, and z is a right triangle.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.680
So the figure, so it's
a right triangle.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.990
And then they ask us, which
equation is true for all

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.350
values of x, y, and z?

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.870
So really, they're just trying
to see if you remember the

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.190
Pythagorean Theorem.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.980
And that just tells us that if
we have a right triangle, that

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.050
the sum of the squares of the
two smaller sides, so x

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.440
squared plus y squared, is
going to be equal to the

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.240
square of the longest side, or
the side that's opposite the

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.010
right angle.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.260
Or we also call that
the hypotenuse.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.890
So that's equal to z squared.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.420
That's what the Pythagorean
Theorem tells us.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.120
And so if we look down here,
only one of those match what I

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.670
just wrote down, are kind
of my restatement of the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.090
Pythagorean Theorem.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.570
x squared plus y squared
is equal to z squared.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.350
And that's this one right
there, choice B.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.100
Next problem.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.260
Problem 39.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.340
A clothing company created the
following diagram for a vest.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.410
So I guess this is somehow a
vest. Maybe it's half of the

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.830
vest, because I don't see how
I could put that on me.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.550
To show the other side of the
vest-- OK, right, so this was

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:38.180
half of the vest-- the company
will reflect the drawing

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.630
across the y-axis.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.270
What will be the coordinates
of C after the reflection?

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.350
So when they say reflection,
they mean, literally, just

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.860
take the image of this and
you flip it over onto the

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.820
right-hand side.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.260
So I could draw it out,
and draw it in blue.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.550
So if I take the reflection,
this line right here is at

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.210
negative 1.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.270
It's 1 to the left
of the y-axis.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.220
So when I take its reflection,
I would draw it right here, 1

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.520
to the right of the y-axis.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.580
This line down here, it goes
from 1 to the left all the way

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.140
to 4 to the left.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.370
On this side, it's going to go
from 1 to the right all the

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.610
way to 4 to the right.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.470
I could keep doing it.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.180
This segment right here, FE,
when I flip it, will become

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.850
this segment right here.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.800
This segment, DE, right here,
will become this segment.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.190
It'll just look something like
this when I go onto that side.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.210
And then C, right here, is 2
to the left of the y-axis.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.710
So C over here will be 2 to
the right of the y-axis.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.630
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.130
So the vest is going to look
something like this.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.030
And then of course, it just
dips down like that.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.230
So that's the right-hand
side of the vest.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.240
But they want to know what
are the coordinates of C?

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.330
So this is C, and this is the
C after the reflection.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.120
Maybe I could call it C prime.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.440
And so its coordinates are--
its x-coordinate is 2.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.830
And we're 2 to the right;
before, we were 2 to the left,

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.970
at minus 2.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.770
And its y-coordinate is
going to be the same,

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.530
it's going to be 7.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.320
2, 7.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.065
So that is choice A.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.960
I'll do it in the next video.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.870
Well, there's only two problems
in this video.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.590
So let me go to the next page.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.880
Number 40.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.920
What is the area, in
square units, of

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.540
trapezoid QRST shown below?

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.276
So we need to figure out
the area of this.

00:03:40.276 --> 00:03:42.190
And they actually even
give us a formula.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.090
They gave us the formula
for this trapezoid.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:52.810
So they're calling it 1/2 times
the height, times base 1

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.150
plus base 2.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.980
So essentially, just to give you
an intuition of where this

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.410
comes from, you're essentially
saying, what's the average

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.360
width of this trapezoid?

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.195
So you take 1/2 times the sum of
this guy and that guy, and

00:04:05.195 --> 00:04:06.830
that gives you the
average width.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.640
And then you multiply that
times the height.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.450
So just applying this formula,
it is 1/2 times my height-- my

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.500
height is 8-- times base 1,
let's call this base 1, 20.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.320
Plus base 2.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.980
Base 2 is this 6 right there.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.200
So I have 1/2 times 8,
which is 4, times 26.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:36.000
And 4 times 26 is equal
to 104 square units.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.310
So that's that right there.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.570
So they're really just
testing whether you

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.750
can apply this formula.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.020
Whether you can recognize what's
the height and what are

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.750
the two bases.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.230
Problem 41.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.670
One millimeter is.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.450
Well, here they're just seeing
if you remember your units.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.360
Let me write it this way.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.510
Deci is equal to 1/10.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.930
Centi is equal to 1/100.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:10.030
And then milli is
equal to 1/1000.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.200
So one millimeter is
1/1000 of a meter.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.710
They're just making sure you
remember your metric prefixes.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.030
Problem 42.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:30.650
In the diagram below,
hexagon LMNPQR is

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.195
congruent to hexagon STUVWX.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.780
Congruent just means all the
sides are equal and all the

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.690
measures of their angles
are also equal.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.920
So they say, which side is
the same length as MN?

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.140
So this is MN right there, and
we want to know what side is

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.900
the same length as that.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.930
So let me make sure
that they're not

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:57.900
trying to confuse us.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:04.570
So they start here, they
say LMNPQR, and

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:05.820
then they say STUVWX.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.010
So they're not confusing us.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.490
These points do correspond.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.100
S corresponds to L, M
corresponds to T, and so

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.370
forth and so on.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.780
So this segment is going to be
congruent to that segment

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.590
right there.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.510
Segment TU.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.020
So MN is the same
length as TU.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.800
That is choice B.
