00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.320
We're asked to subtract all
of this craziness over here.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.430
And it looks daunting.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.029
But if we really just
focus, it actually

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.560
should be pretty straightforward
to subtract and simplify

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.490
this thing.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.220
Because right from the get-go,
I have 4 times the fourth root

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.915
of 81x to the fifth.

00:00:16.915 --> 00:00:18.290
And from that, I
want to subtract

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.180
2 times the fourth root
of 81x to the fifth.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.180
And so you really can just say,
look, I have four of something.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.530
And then the something
I'll just circle in yellow.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.440
I have four of this--
it could be lemons.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.110
I have four of
these things, and I

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.870
want to subtract
two of these things.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.770
These are the exact same things.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.980
They're the fourth root
of 81x to the fifth.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.920
So if I have four lemons and
I want to subtract two lemons,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.780
I'm going to have
two lemons left over.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.780
Or if I have four of this
thing, and I take away

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.470
two of this thing,
I'm going to have

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.830
two of these things left over.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.000
So these terms right over
here simplify to 2 times

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.520
the fourth root of
81x to the fifth.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.793
And I got this 2 just by
subtracting the coefficients.

00:01:02.793 --> 00:01:04.459
Four of something
minus two of something

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.300
is equal to two
of that something.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.790
And then that, of
course, we still

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.040
have this minus the regular
principal square root

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.200
of x to the third.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.680
Now I want to try to
simplify what's inside

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.482
of these under the radical
sign so that we can,

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:24.440
in this example, actually
take the fourth root,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.240
and over here actually take,
maybe, a principal square root.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.447
So first of all, let's
see if 81 is something

00:01:32.447 --> 00:01:34.030
to the fourth power,
or at least could

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.490
be factored into
something that is

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.760
a something to the fourth power.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.560
So 81, if we do prime
factorization, is 3 times 27.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.920
27 is 3 times 9.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.810
And 9 is 3 times 3.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.570
So 81 is exactly 3
times 3 times 3 times 3.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.485
So 81 actually is 3 to
the fourth power, which

00:01:52.485 --> 00:01:53.860
is convenient
because we're going

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.320
to be taking the
fourth root of that.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.457
And then x to the fifth
we can write as a product.

00:01:59.457 --> 00:02:01.540
Let me write it over here
so it doesn't get messy.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.080
So I'm going to write what's
under the radical as 3

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.389
to the fourth power times x
to the fourth power times x.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.790
x to the fourth times x
is x to the fifth power.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.170
And I'm taking the fourth
root of all of this.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.500
And taking the fourth root
of all of this-- that's

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.375
the same thing as taking
the fourth root of this,

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:23.470
as taking the
fourth root of this.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.790
And I'm going to
want to skip steps.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.740
So I'm taking the fourth root
of all of it right over there.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.810
And of course, I
have a 2 out front.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.350
And then x to the third could
be written as x squared times x.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.920
So it's minus the
principal square root

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.307
of x squared times x.

00:02:41.307 --> 00:02:43.640
And I broke it up like this
because this right over here

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.820
is a perfect square.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.550
Now, how can we simplify
this a little bit?

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.550
And you're probably getting
used to the pattern.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.410
This is the same thing as the
fourth root of 3 to the fourth,

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.350
times the fourth root
of x to the fourth,

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.300
times the fourth root of x.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.380
So let's just skip
straight to that.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.939
So what is the fourth root?

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:04.855
I could write it-- let
me write it explicitly,

00:03:04.855 --> 00:03:06.938
although you wouldn't have
to necessarily do this.

00:03:06.938 --> 00:03:12.570
This is the same thing as the
fourth root of 3 to the fourth,

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.080
times the fourth root
of x to the fourth,

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.370
times the fourth root of x.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.510
And 2 is being multiplied
times all of that.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.570
And then this over here is
minus the principal square root

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.160
of x squared, times the
principal square root of x.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.380
And so if we try to
simplify it, the fourth root

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.080
of 3 to the fourth
power is just 3.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.070
So we get a 3 there.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.650
The fourth root of x
to the fourth power

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.110
is just going to be x.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.044
Actually, I just
reminded myself,

00:03:50.044 --> 00:03:51.210
we have to be careful there.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.440
It is not just x, because
what if x is negative?

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.500
If x is negative, then
x to the fourth power

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.150
is going to be a positive value.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.410
And when you take the
fourth-- remember,

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.868
this is the fourth
principal root--

00:04:00.868 --> 00:04:03.260
you're going to get the
positive version of x.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.200
Or really, you're going to
get the absolute value of x.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.080
So here, you're
going to be getting

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.460
the absolute value of x.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.590
Although, well, you
could make an argument

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.170
that x needs to be positive
if this thing is going

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.095
to be well-defined
in the real numbers,

00:04:21.095 --> 00:04:23.470
because then what's under the
radical has to be positive.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.760
But let's just go with
this for right now.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.860
And then we have the
fourth root of x.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.750
And then over here, the
principal square root

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.670
of x squared, by
the same logic, is

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.310
going to be the
absolute value of x.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.630
And then this is just the
principal square root of x.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.020
So let's multiply
everything out.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.410
We have 2 times 3 times
the absolute value of x.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.040
So 2 times 3 is 6,
times the absolute value

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:56.400
of x, times the principal
fourth root of x, I should say,

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.860
minus we took out the
absolute value of x, times

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.430
the principal root of x.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.360
And we can't do any
more subtracting.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.140
Just because you have to
realize this is a fourth root.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.650
This is a regular square
root, principal square root.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.510
If these were the
same root, then maybe

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.910
we could simplify this
a little bit more.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.380
And so then we are all done.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.170
And we have fully simplified it.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.390
And if you make the
assumption that this

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.380
is defined for real numbers.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.210
So that the domain
over here, what

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.150
has to be under these
radicals, has to be positive,

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.757
actually, in every
one of these cases.

00:05:28.757 --> 00:05:30.340
And if they need to
be positive, we're

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.298
not going to be dealing
with imaginary numbers.

00:05:32.298 --> 00:05:33.740
All of these need
to be positive.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.250
Their domains are x has to be
greater than or equal to 0,

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.333
then you could assume that
the absolute value of x

00:05:38.333 --> 00:05:39.330
is the same as x.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.780
But I'll just stick
it right here.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.490
If you restrict the
domain, you could

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.190
get rid of the
absolute value signs.
