00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.850
So now you understand
the basics of ARIA,

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.590
how it plays with native HTML semantics,
and

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.390
how it can be used to perform fairly
major surgery on the accessibility tree

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.310
as well as changing the semantics
of a single element.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.020
To wrap up our whirlwind tour of ARIA,
we're going to take a look at how we

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.710
can use it to convey
time-sensitive information and

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.650
a deeper look at exactly what it means
to add an ARIA role to an element.
