00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.430
Ming: Good afternoon, my friends. We are deeply
honored today to be in the presence of one

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.610
of the greatest living Tibetan Masters, the
very venerable Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche. So,

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.380
when I first heard about the very venerable,
I wondered to myself, how is it like to be

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.830
the guy who is only slightly venerable?

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:21.830
[audience laughing]

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.679
Ming: And then I realized that guy is me.

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:25.990
[laughing]

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:34.630
But joke aside. Mingyur Rinpoche is, I think,
a great gem in the world. Rinpoche is a traditionally

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:41.940
trained Meditation Master with impeccable
credentials. He spent many years of his childhood

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.190
in strict retreat, and at a tender age of
17, he was invited to be a teacher at an important

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.320
three year retreat.
At the same time, Rinpoche speaks English,

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.170
he understands the modern world, and he has
a life long interest in western science and

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:07.399
psychology. He volunteered himself as a test
subject for cutting edge studies in neuroscience,

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:14.060
and for that he calls himself, I quote, a
"short red guinea pig." That's very funny,

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.829
funny guy. Uh, Rinpoche is the author of a
number one New York Times Best Seller, "The

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.719
Joy of Living", which is the book I recommend
to all my friends. It is the best meditation

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:32.079
book that I know of. He's also the author
of two other books, "Joyful Wisdom" and "Ziji:

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:36.640
The Puppy Who Learned to Meditate."
In real life as you might have noticed by

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.759
now Rinpoche's very funny, and he possesses
the rare ability to present ancient wisdom

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.700
in a way that is engaging and humorous. I
think we are very lucky to have him, and with

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.420
that please welcome our friend the very venerable
Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:02.369
[audience applauding]

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:18.780
Rinpoche: Thank you Ming. You're great introduction,
you're very kind.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.569
[audience laughing]

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:21.920
And good looking.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.920
[audience laughing]

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:35.129
Rinpoche: Good looking, that's true. And,
I'm very happy to be here. Welcome everyone

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.400
and
hmmmm

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.420
Now I've forgotten my talk.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.569
[audience laughing]

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:56.900
Rinpoche: No, joking. I'd like to begin with
my own story about how I found meditation

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:07.620
and the meditation has helped for my life.
Can you see me? Should I stand up? Doesn't

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.129
make change here.

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.599
[audience laughing]

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:24.680
Rinpoche: Little better. Okay, better? When
I was nine, eight years old I was developed

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:37.439
panic disorder, panic. You know panic? Good.
And then I was looking for solution to deal

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:48.939
my panic, to get rid of my panic. I hate my
panic. I have panic of panic. And then my

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:57.760
grandfather and my father were great meditation
teachers. Especially my father, so when I

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:08.430
look at him, wow, he's nice, meditating. Calm,
peace, peaceful, and I want to learn meditation.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:15.760
And one day I ran, I run from my house, and
ran to the cave because near my house there's

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.900
cave. My village, my hometown in Nepal is
northern part of Nepal, right middle of the

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:29.090
Himalayas, Himalayan Mountains. And we have
many caves, I went in cave, and sit there

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:36.690
pretending meditate, and although I have no
idea about meditation. And just sit there,

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:44.210
you know, sleep, you know, move around, you
know. And my grandmother thought I lost, and

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.740
she's very worried. And she called the Village
people and everybody now looking, looking

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:56.430
up, looking me. And then later she found me,
she said, "Don't do that next time." I don't

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:04.419
listen to her. I did, And I ran to the cave
again. And later I get permission from her.

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:10.560
But when I was nine years old I really wanted
to learn meditation from my father, but I'm

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:20.449
very shy to ask him directly. Afraid, I have
fear, shy to ask him, but I approach my mother.

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:29.310
My mom to ask my father on behalf of me, and
my father was very happy. He kindly accept

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:36.729
my request and taught me meditation.
But although I like the idea of meditation,

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:44.400
but I don't like the practice of meditation.
I am very lazy boy. You know, I feel very

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:52.539
boring sit there, you know. And then that
doesn't change my panic, because I'm not meditating.

00:05:52.539 --> 00:06:01.850
And I have panic about strangers, you know
strangers? And snowstorm, during the winter,

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:11.750
we have big snowstorm, and summertime we have
thunder-thunderstorm. Thunderstorm? Then when

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:20.860
I was 13 years old I was in India place called,
Palpung Sherab Ling Monastery, and there's

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:26.320
a traditional three year retreat going to
start for three years, and I really wanted

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:34.380
to join in the retreat because then I thought
I can meditate, because the retreat for three

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:41.199
years. And I joined three year retreat, the
first-year of retreat my panic got worse,

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:55.440
stronger. And-because I'm lazy, not busy,
but lazy. Then I thought okay, I'm so unhappy

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:03.860
because my panic gets stronger. And one day
I asked question to myself, still I have two

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:09.860
more years to go, so do you really want to
spend two more years like this unhappy with

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:16.620
the panic, or do you really want to learn
meditation with my panic. And I make decision

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:24.080
that yes, I am going to learn, I'm going to
practice meditation with my panic. And I sat

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.830
in my room for three days. It's in the retreat,
the retreat for three years, you know.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:36.960
We have religious center and 15 of us together,
and everybody has individual room, and every

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:43.030
day we join together practice together for
two-three hours, group practice. And I didn't

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:51.289
join for group practice, today. My room alone
for three ah three days. And after that my

00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:59.750
panic was gone. Why? I try to make friends
with my panic. And I use my panic as support

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:05.470
for my meditation.
What I found is there's two ways to make your

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:13.259
panic bigger and stronger. And no matter what
I call "yessir" and "Hey, get out." Do you

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:22.129
know "yessir"? What is the meaning of that
"yessir"? Yeah/No? How many of yes? Raise

00:08:22.129 --> 00:08:24.870
your hands?

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.610
[audience laughing]

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:35.800
And "Hey, get out"? You know that; if so raise
your hand? Good.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.729
[audience laughing]

00:08:37.729 --> 00:08:45.440
Rinpoche: Okay, anyway. The meaning is "yessir",
the meaning is you believe-I believe in my

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:52.420
panic. What about panic, tells you message,
you say, "yessir." Problem? yessir? terrible?

00:08:52.420 --> 00:09:01.500
yessir? Here's problem, there's problem, everywhere
is problem. Miserable. Terrible. yessir. yesir.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:07.230
And you totally believe.
And second "Hey, get out" is you don't like

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:14.411
your panic. And you have panic of panic, fear
of panic. You try to fight with the panic.

00:09:14.411 --> 00:09:22.480
If you say "yessir" to panic, and the panic
become your boss, bad boss, not the good boss.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:32.230
Maybe some of boss are here, you know, I'm
not saying all the boss are bad. I decide

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:40.610
if the panic become your boss then you're
not in peace. If you hate panic, if you try

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:47.600
to reject the panic, fight with the panic,
panic become your enemy. As it becomes your

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:57.180
enemy or your boss both cases not sort of
nice, yeah, do you think so? And do you have

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:09.010
any other possibility? Do you have any third
option? Do you think of any anyway? You can

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:18.410
say anything. Make friends with your panic.
Do you agree? How many of you agree? Hmm,

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.991
that's good. How? How to make friends?

00:10:21.991 --> 00:10:33.970
Pardon? Talk to it. Talk to panic? Have conversation
with panic: hello, how are you? What are you

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:35.209
doing?-something like that?

00:10:35.209 --> 00:10:36.209
[laughing]

00:10:36.209 --> 00:10:37.690
Would you like tea and coffee?

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:39.780
[laughing]

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:48.420
Rinpoche: Okay, yes you can make friends,
no problem. But how to make friends you have

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:54.529
to know the right method, the right technique.
How to make friends. Just thinking that I

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:58.690
have to make friends with my panic doesn't
work, you know. I have to make friends with

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:02.170
my panic, FRIENDS.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:03.860
[audiencelaughing]

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:12.630
Rinpoche: And that makes another stress sometimes,
you know. But just having idea that I want

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:19.639
to make friends with my panic, only the idea,
it helps a lot for you. You begin to accept

00:11:19.639 --> 00:11:25.450
the panic. Okay.
How to make friends with panic for me is meditation.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:35.300
Okay, I will tell you good meditation the
next session. Um, this way, because of my

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:42.000
meditation and I make friends with my panic,
and panic become one of the best friend for

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.160
me and one of the best teacher for me. But
unfortunately after three days later the panic

00:11:49.160 --> 00:12:02.570
was gone. So now I miss my friend, but one
of my best friend's gone, but I have some

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:07.279
other friends, you know. I have plenty of
friends.

00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:13.519
There's not panic, but there's another problem,
another obstacles, and another problems. So

00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:21.230
you can find friends everywhere, because problems
are everywhere. They are international. They

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:28.329
don't have any visa to come, and they don't
have to need any special obligation, they

00:12:28.329 --> 00:12:35.040
are transparent everywhere they can go this
way. What I found another problem...

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.700
[audience laughing]

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:49.190
I press yes, okay, okay.
And uh. What I found is any other problem

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:56.769
I can make friends through meditation. You
can, make, you can use air support for your

00:12:56.769 --> 00:13:06.209
meditation become your friends and then I
feel very happy. But my happiness is not like-he-he-he,

00:13:06.209 --> 00:13:11.240
you know, some kind of that style, I mean
that kind of happiness, but more like, how

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:22.070
to say it, contentment. More like joyful.
It's continued, especially when I facing problem

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:29.540
that makes me more happy. Everything is good;
everything is under control, no problem, no

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:35.920
obstacle, no meditation. Mind lost, here and
there, but soon as there's a problem, challenge,

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:45.460
and good for me. I can, I can meditate.
I met one time in Yosemite Park. You know

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:52.550
Yosemite Park, near here, yeah? There's one
rock climber and he'd been to Nepal climb,

00:13:52.550 --> 00:14:00.050
climb the rocks. And when he saw me because
I wear the robe he said namaste. I said namaste.

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:08.639
Namaste is Nepali-Nepali language to say "Hi."
And he say are you Buddhist Monk? I say yes.

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:15.389
And I ask him how you know namaste? He said
I went to Nepal and climb in the mountains.

00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:21.360
And he said tomorrow I'm going to climb this
mountain, and I asked him how long take? Five-six

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:28.370
days. Wow and how you do that? He said I have
to bring the tent, some kind of narrow tent

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:33.449
with the waters, food. And I ask him is it
danger? He said yes, maybe. I may die on the

00:14:33.449 --> 00:14:41.340
way if this bad storm comes. And I ask do
you have fear? He said yes, but I like fear.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.650
I thought wow.

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:44.650
[laughing]

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:58.930
That's good; anyway, that's why the idea here
is once you can make really friends with problems,

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:05.850
then the problem become support for your meditation,
your awareness, your happiness. But it not

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:11.970
sort of easy, yeah. It's easy to say, but
difficult to done. But anyway, um, there's

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:20.070
way to do that.
Okay, let's finish about how I come to meditation,

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:26.200
and how meditation help for my life.
Now, I want to say little bit about being

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:34.910
guinea pig. As Ming told you that I am guinea
pig, yeah. And normally I say I'm a red guinea

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:43.300
pig. Have you saw guinea pig? How big? This
big, yeah? It's white, white color, yeah?

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:49.010
But I'm red. Maybe you also little red.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:56.630
And I have been to different universities
like Berkeley, Berkeley University, Harvard,

00:15:56.630 --> 00:16:07.450
and especially in Madison, University of Wisconsin.
And they have study about what they call "Long-term

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:13.829
meditator's brain". They study about that,
and I'm one of the first guinea pig. And not

00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:23.120
only me, so far they study with 21 long-term
meditators, those who meditate 10,000 of hours,

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:28.610
you know. That's what they call long-term
meditators and they put me in the big machine.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:36.449
Machine what they call FMRI, it's very big.
Normally I describe it as like, shape of white

00:16:36.449 --> 00:16:37.449
coffin.

00:16:37.449 --> 00:16:38.649
[audience laughing]

00:16:38.649 --> 00:16:45.580
Rinpoche: And inside the temperature is very
cold. It has to be cold and there's very strong

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:53.740
magnetic power, you know. If you have some
iron with you then you just fly, boom. You

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:59.769
have to take out everything. And there's some
kind of tongue coming out. Machine like my

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:04.200
head, you know, very big. it shape of white
coffin there's some kind of tongue coming

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:11.910
out. And I have to lying down on the tongue
and pretend it's like corpse. You know, corpse.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:24.780
Corpse not cups. Because I can not move my
body, I have to remain still, and they put,

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:31.911
what they call, some kind of foam here and
bite guard. Something which is, I had to chews

00:17:31.911 --> 00:17:39.690
in my mouth, and they put in cold-water become
freeze, yeah. Become hard, and I chews again

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:46.280
and screw up with the machine, screw-screw
to. Because I cannot move my head, I have

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:52.690
big earphone here. And then they put me inside
the machine. Looks like you're going into

00:17:52.690 --> 00:18:01.060
the tunnel, tunnel. Dark, cold tunnel, you
know, very noisy, like siren, siren. Du-du-du-du-du-du

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:09.160
very noisy, and then I have to spend inside
the machine two hours, one and a half hours,

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:14.840
something like that and I have to meditate.
And there's three meditation techniques, what

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:24.050
they call: open present, concentration, loving
kindness and compassion meditation. Three.

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:29.300
And the scientists in the next room having
coffee, you know.

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:35.270
Eating hamburgers and they have microphone-microphone.
And through microphone they say-please meditate

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:36.820
on compassion for 90 seconds.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.370
[audience laughing]

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:51.890
Rinpoche: Stop compassion. Meditate compassion
again. Say-on and off. Compassion- not compassion-compassion-not

00:18:51.890 --> 00:19:01.890
compassion, and then while I'm meditating
they send terrible noise, baby crying, and

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:12.850
children screaming. And show bloody image
also the operation, the image, makes you more

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:22.270
fearful. And then open present again, you
know, 90 seconds. And concentrate.

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:28.740
First machine was very narrow, no-good. But
now they got better machine, every five year

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:33.040
they update the machine. First machine was
very narrow, I've been there four, four times,

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:44.180
you know. And they say concentrate on something.
I can not find focus and I cross my eyes.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:49.650
And one of the biggest problems is sometimes
I get itchy, you know itchy. And I can not

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:56.790
scratch, you know, because my hands are here
and what I do is just like this, you know.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:20:04.530
I don't know what the result in the machine,
you know. And should I tell you the result?

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:13.840
It's depressing. They told me I'm totally
crazy, and I was so depressed for three years.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.780
No-no, I'm just joking.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:21.980
They didn't told me I'm crazy, but they told
me first they thought something wrong with

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:26.771
the machine, because behaved in the brain
is very high something like that and they

00:20:26.771 --> 00:20:32.620
change the how do the calculates style. I've
been there so I have to go again and again

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:42.970
and not only me there's 20, 20 other meditators.
And what I found is by being a guinea pig,

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:47.010
a discussion with the scientists. I found
three important things,

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:53.920
First, is what they call neural plasticity.
Have you heard of neural plasticity? If so

00:20:53.920 --> 00:21:02.430
raise your hand. Good. The meaning of neural
plasticity is your brain has capable of change

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:14.040
and there's potential and you can change even
reorganize. The brain has capable of reorganize

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:19.180
itself, you know many things. Fourteen, 13
years before neuroscientists didn't believe

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:27.980
that so if you are born with unhappy you're
done, the rest of your life will be unhappy.

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:36.520
But now they say no. It's like what they say
this idea is out a window, out a window. It's

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:42.810
like even if you're born with unhappy you
can change into a happy person and not just

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:47.260
that you can. There is many things; I will
tell you later.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:52.850
Okay now second important point is: one of
the best ways to change your brain behave

00:21:52.850 --> 00:22:07.210
from negative to positive is meditation. Special
the accuracy, accuracy and no side effect,

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:16.470
meditation is the best. And until now no medicine,
no drug can not replace [inaudible] meditation.

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:25.120
And then also pretty cheap, yeah. Not so the
expensive. And it's not just transforming

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:33.000
your brain, and it's very important it's good
for your physical body, good for developing

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.990
your immune system and blood circulation,
heart disease, many different things, of course,

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:44.720
good for stress reduction, yeah. They give
us what they call; they have some kind of

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:53.920
like chemical produce blisters, blister you
know? And we have to meditate and after meditating,

00:22:53.920 --> 00:23:01.620
and they know that, some kind of, it effects
your cells, good for immune system. Cells

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:11.210
really heal rapidly, heals very, very you
know , good. And they also did with the test

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:21.450
with people who do physical exercise, eating
good food. That's control group, and, oh,

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:34.840
another thing is what they call clarity.
Clarity test, they put us in the machine,

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:40.050
this is, I think, third-year I've been there
third-year and they give me some kind of monitor,

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:47.470
and I have to change my compassion. I have
to make my compassion stronger-stronger-stronger

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:55.920
and I push button like 5-6-7-9-10, and I have
to decrease my compassion. Slowly, slowly

00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:08.180
now 4-3-2-1-0 compassion, you know. And what
they found is in the machine for me it looked

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:15.170
like stock market. When you look at the screen,
you know the screen, the stock market's like

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:22.600
this, yeah? There's two line like this, and
one line is what happening in your brain;

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:29.530
second line is your description. The meditator's
description and these two are matched. And

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:35.940
when they test with the novice, when they
say, okay I have 9% of compassion, but what

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:43.620
happen in your brain has zero compassion,
this is different. And the second thing is,

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:49.430
another interesting is, this is new one I
think. They make some kind of like, maybe

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:55.760
I'm not going to tell you this one. This is
very brand new. I think better they, soon

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:05.660
it will come out in the papers.
Okay, so anyway. Three important point, yeah?

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:14.920
I add one more number four. Number four is
a good for your life. Why? Because it's good

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:23.650
for your mind become calm and peaceful, happy,
and good for your body. And that's why it

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:33.750
good for your life, yeah. Of course, yeah.
Okay, now this is my two important things:

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:39.880
one is with science and one is with my own
experience. Now I would like to share you

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:48.720
a little bit meditation, okay. And for that
there's two important things:

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:55.881
One is your physical body posture. And for
that you have to keep your spine straight,

00:25:55.881 --> 00:26:04.090
and if you have problem with your spine you
can use chair against two chair. Keep your

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:12.850
spine straight.
And second is relax your muscles in your body,

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:27.890
just relax. Please close your eyes and now
just relax your body and please feel your

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:36.990
body, be aware of your body. And be aware
of energy in your body. There's some kind

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:49.960
of like gravity and weight in your body. Mind
and body together. And just relax; please

00:26:49.960 --> 00:27:07.980
relax muscles in your face, ear, shoulder,
back and stomach, arms and legs. Just relax.

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:16.470
100% relaxed, not 200% relaxed.

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:27.830
Why I say 100% relax, because you just stress
as like natural, normal. You can have tightness,

00:27:27.830 --> 00:28:01.380
tension, stress, every thing allowed. Tight
okay. Tensions okay. Just relax.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:25.140
Okay, that's two important thing with your
body. One is keeping your spine straight,

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:30.880
and another thing is relax your muscles in
your body. And it's true relative to your

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.061
body.
Okay, now that's finished and next one is,

00:28:35.061 --> 00:28:40.110
I would like to teach you how to relax your
mind.

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:48.120
And for this is not meditation. First I'm
not going to teach you meditation, and I will

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:55.460
teach you how to relax. It's okay? Do you
want to learn how to relax?

00:28:55.460 --> 00:29:05.920
Okay. How many of you learn meditation before?
Raise your hand. Okay. Good. Now, even if

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:12.680
you know how to meditate, don't meditate here,
okay. With this next practice don't meditate,

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:23.940
just relax your mind. And how to relax, you
have day off Saturday, Sunday's day off, yeah.

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:36.060
You work Saturday, Sunday or not? No. What
time you finish? Five or 11, 5 p.m. 6 p.m.

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:47.110
Pardon, to 7, okay. Friday night, Friday afternoon,
after you finish your work you feel pretty

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:55.211
happy, yeah. Okay, now I finish my job, Mmm
Mmm. This is Friday and tomorrow I have two

00:29:55.211 --> 00:30:03.230
days day off, how wonderful, and you leave
from the office, go back to your home, apartment,

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:10.200
whatever. And you have a small bag, yeah.
Bring your small bag, and as you, soon as

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:18.230
you arrive at your home and you put your bag
somewhere else and rest on nice chair in your

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:22.981
living room with big, deep breathing.

00:30:22.981 --> 00:30:27.850
[exhales]

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:33.761
And you just rest, yeah. Good, rest like that,
not now, not now, later. I will tell you.

00:30:33.761 --> 00:30:41.960
Just relax. Don't meditate, because you're
not meditating besides noise okay. We have

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:47.251
some noise around here. Okay, no problem.
You can rest with the noise, yeah. You can

00:30:47.251 --> 00:30:53.520
even rest in the subway, in a bus, in the-
you know- watching movie you can rest some

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.700
time, yeah.

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:55.700
[laughing]

00:30:55.700 --> 00:31:00.950
Rinpoche: Although there's big noise, so,
just relax. Don't meditate right now. And

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:07.360
another example is: maybe you do physical
exercise jogging or swimming. I saw you have

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:13.940
some kind of swimming pool with a machine,
yeah. You swim but you get nowhere. You swim

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:20.550
in that kind swimming pool or any swimming
pool maybe- 20 minutes, half an hour. After

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:26.521
you finish your swim, you're pretty happy,
yeah? You finish your exercise, but your body

00:31:26.521 --> 00:31:34.870
a little bit tired. I need my rest again,
That's one. And do you have any other examples?

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:39.081
Do we want to share? How to rest? Normally
what you do in your life?

00:31:39.081 --> 00:31:40.720
male#1: Sleep.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:44.000
Rinpoche: Pardon? Sleep, okay.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.280
female #1: Drink tea.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:56.420
Rinpoche: Drink tea, and coffee, how about?
Okay. Now we are going to practice this together.

00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:08.110
Again just keep your spine straight, little
bit straight, and relax the muscles in your

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:19.270
body, and please rest your mind as it is.
And you're going to do one deep breathing.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:30.150
And after exhale at the same time your mind
rests, okay. Please breath in,

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:31.530
[inhale]

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:34.300
let go.

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.690
[exhale]

00:32:35.690 --> 00:33:17.520
And rest your mind as well.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:28.040
Of course you can not rest too long. Why you
forgot to rest. Your mind already in the cafe

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:38.820
area drinking coffee. That's okay. You can
rest, but this is not meditation, you can

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:47.400
have thoughts. If you not forgot resting that's
okay. Your mind can rest only for a few seconds

00:33:47.400 --> 00:34:18.530
and forget the rest.
But you can come back in?

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:28.580
Okay. That's finished now. How was it? Do
we feel little bit relaxed? If so raise your

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:42.980
hand. Okay, that's good. And now, I'm going
to tell you one secret. Do we want to know?

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:47.290
The secret is that was meditation.

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:49.060
[laughing]

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:57.650
Rinpoche: What you did right now that was
meditation. Why? Non-meditation is the best

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:06.820
meditation. Real meditation, you don't have
to meditate. So, you just really rest your

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:16.840
mind as it is, and there's awareness. There's
mindfulness just so you not forgot to rest.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:24.340
Although there is no special object of meditation,
no special focus. But maybe focus is awareness.

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:36.170
Awareness resting into awareness. Not get
lost, not meditation. Two things: not getting

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:46.060
lost, not meditation. Just being, just being
there, being present. Not too long only for

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:56.260
few seconds. And you forgot you're in the
pizza restaurant and eating pizza. Oh I'm

00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:03.170
suppose to resting here, how come? You know,
you can come back in, rest. And that's what

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:08.330
we call, this meditation we call "open present".
The scientists, you know, they test in the

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:20.130
FMRI, it's open present. And it's really good
for body, good for mind, and to make your

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:32.160
mind calm and peaceful. Do you want to try
again? Okay. Try one more. Same style, just

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:41.110
rest. Please keep your meditation posture,
relax your muscles, and please strech your

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:49.560
mind as it is. If you want to use deep breathing,
also okay. Only one time.

00:36:49.560 --> 00:38:06.540
[silence, meditating]

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:12.630
Okay. Now finish. How was it?

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:21.800
Now I will ask you question. We did this exercise
two times, yeah. One before you know the secret,

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:29.190
and this one after you knowing the secret.
So, which one you like more? First one or

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:35.770
second one? First one more, raise your hand.
Both is good. Okay. First one- if you like

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:41.680
first one more that mean something wrong with
you. Not like that. Or second time more then

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:45.360
there is something wrong with you. Not like
that, okay. Both is good. First if you like

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:55.840
it more, first raise your hand, okay. Second
time more raise your hand, okay. Why? Because

00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:04.120
this tells you little bit of your personality.
Because first time you like more means second

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:10.210
time you're a little bit tight. Why? You know
the secret. You think this is meditation.

00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:20.740
Wow, I'm practicing in the best meditation.
Do I have this awareness or what ever you

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:28.070
know. Do I loss, do I have no meditation and
not get lost. Part of this not, you know,

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:37.210
how can I tell I'm in the meditation or not?
I have pretty good experience the firsttime,

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:43.110
but I need that same kind of experience right
now here. But I think I can not have. What

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:49.840
happened here? That's like your-you?re how
you say-thinking. Worry about the quality

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:57.890
of meditation. It's like for this kind of
people, if you are this category, don't worry.

00:39:57.890 --> 00:40:06.950
Don't worry about result of meditation. Good
meditation okay; bad meditation is okay; right

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:13.900
meditation's okay; wrong meditation's okay.
What ever happens, happens. Okay, who cares?

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:22.569
Just rest. And you don't have to know, is
this meditation or not, it's just rest. Don't

00:40:22.569 --> 00:40:31.040
know really about awareness or not awareness,
distraction or not distraction. Okay.

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:36.031
And people who like second time more means
normally you need some kind of guide, because

00:40:36.031 --> 00:40:40.600
first time you were a little bit confused.
I come here to learn meditation, you know.

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:48.400
This guy said "rest". But how to rest. You
a little bit confused, you know, just resting

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:54.860
or meditation or?
And the second time you know more, better

00:40:54.860 --> 00:41:04.180
so you can rest. So, you like second time
more. So that some kind of, how to say? And

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:09.550
second time you need a little guide. But if
you like both, then it's okay, no problem.

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:15.070
If you don't like both, it means this meditation
technique is not suitable for you. That's

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:22.190
why, there's many different personality, different
mentality. One meditation technique can not

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:28.730
help for everybody. So one medicine can not
cure all the disease, yeah. If you don't like

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:35.341
this both, don't worry also. Okay and that's
why this meditation technique's so easy, so

00:41:35.341 --> 00:41:40.310
simple, so nice, but there's one problem.
Should I tell you problem?

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:48.250
Okay, why I say so simple, so easy? Because
you don't have to meditate, yeah. You just

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:56.460
sit there doing nothing. By doing nothing
you're doing something good. So, that's the-

00:41:56.460 --> 00:42:04.800
wonderful. But the problem is too easy. That's
the problem. If it is too easy you can not

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:08.370
believe, because too close to you, you can
not see it.

00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:16.180
There's some kind of card here, yeah. Huh,
interesting. If you bring this card close

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:21.470
to your eyes, you can not see it, too close.
So you don?t think, I think this is not the

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:29.100
best meditation, you know. If this is the
best meditation then I have to change totally

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:35.650
my mentality or something, but I don't have
those. This sounds are so normal, so simple,

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:42.720
so ordinary, you know. So you sometime can
not believe. So if you think this is too simple

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:49.840
problem, I have another meditation technique
which is a little bit difficult.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:56.680
I told you when I was young, I escaped from
my house and went to the cave, yeah. Do remember?

00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:04.080
I went to the cave and pretended meditating.
I found one meditation technique by myself.

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:15.430
What we call Mental Recitation. Say something
in your mind. Because in my hometown everybody

00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:22.800
knows different kind of like, mantras, pray,
many things. And I choose one of-of them and

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:31.960
say it in my mind. Hello, yeah. I choose one
of them and say it in my mind. And later when

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:38.050
I was nine year old. Nine years old. I asked
my father is that meditation or not. My father

00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:52.240
say yes. And I was so happy. So maybe I will
teach you. And you can choose one word, anything

00:43:52.240 --> 00:44:02.060
peace. You know peace yeah? And you can choose
the word peace and say it in your mind. Don't

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:15.930
use your lips and tongues. Just in you mind
say, peace, peace, peace. Close your lips

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:16.930
like this.

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:22.510
If you do like this, looks crazy. Peace, peace,
peace.

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:30.450
Try again. You want to try?
Okay, Again keep your meditation posture,

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:41.090
and relax your body and mind and please say
peace. You don't have to worry about meaning

00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:46.730
of peace. Just say this in your mind. When
you say this in your mind, you have concentration,

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:50.510
you have awareness, you have mindfulness.
That's why you're inmeditation.

00:44:50.510 --> 00:45:26.830
[silence, meditating]

00:45:26.830 --> 00:46:03.150
Okay. Hello.

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:18.430
Okay, how was it? How many of you liked this
meditation? Okay, you can apply these meditations

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:25.030
in your walk in your life. Everywhere any
time. For example- if you want to make some

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:34.590
plans, complicated, very serious engineer
or design or anything. First you can meditate

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:44.270
and then let think, and then think and rest
your mind into meditation and think and rest

00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:50.230
into meditation That's good for your thinking
also, you have become more creative and your

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:54.780
idea become more clear. Because normally,
too many thoughts many things. You can not

00:46:54.780 --> 00:47:03.550
find idea more clear. And also good for meditations,
you can use as alternate: think-meditate-think-meditate-

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:08.910
You can apply meditation everyway anytime.
Thank you, and do you have any questions?

00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:14.730
I think people have to come to microphone,
yeah. If you have question you can come to

00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:15.730
microphone.

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:40.660
male#1: I'm curious, when you think about
technology and Google and Facebook. Is there

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:46.290
a way that technology can help us improve
our minds and our happiness as well or is

00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:48.390
that a negative thing?

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:58.410
Rinpoche: You can use true form for practice
meditation for example- one of my friend have

00:47:58.410 --> 00:48:07.430
iPod? And they put some message awareness,
peace, love, and compassion. They put that

00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:15.210
message, and they're sending their own message
to them. Ping. You know, look oh, awareness,

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:23.620
oh great, yes awareness. Become reminder,
you know. Or you can use as monitor, about

00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:29.690
your experience, you know, to many different
things. And while you play computer you can

00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:32.790
meditate also. You can meditate everywhere
anytime.

00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:40.960
One time I was looking on the television,
I saw this advertisement, this is not our

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:48.970
meditation, this is a company, one of the
brand of the mobile phone company. They said,

00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:54.780
"You can us this every where anytime, even
in the mountain." I change a little bit. You

00:48:54.780 --> 00:49:04.810
can meditate everywhere anytime, even in the
city.

00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:10.160
And also, good for Google, especial Google,
to learning more knowledge on meditation,

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:15.610
you know. If you want to learn more about
meditation, Google, you know. Oh!

00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:18.340
[laughing]
Rinpoche: I use Google also.

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:33.990
female #1: Hi, thanks for coming. So, I've
been learning a bit about meditation and it's

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:39.400
been very helpful for me so far. I tend to
be one of the always busy, rather-stressed

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:44.340
people,
but in general I have a happy outlook.

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:51.740
You know, I like, ever-changing series of
problems. I have a friend who I would like

00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:59.760
him to try meditation or be happy or that
kind of stuff. My current approach is to just

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:04.920
do it and hopefully to show him,
you know, through the changes in my own life,

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:09.210
but it's not like we really get to see each
other that often. I can't do it on a daily

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:15.360
basis with him. Bring him in that way. What
are you thoughts on, without going evangelical,

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:21.480
sort of, spreading the either the energy or
the practice to other people, maybe people

00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:25.300
who are more resistant at first.
Because unless they make that decision themselves,

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:26.440
currently, you know, they're not gonna--

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:27.440
Rinpoche: Right.

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:28.830
female #1: --really buy it. What are your
thoughts on that?

00:50:28.830 --> 00:50:33.110
Rinpoche: Yeah, I think what you?re doing
is good, but actually you can share your own

00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:41.840
experience, your own story, experience. And
you just want communication and special, because

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:48.040
many people they not- they don't know what's
the value of meditation. Especially when you

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:54.330
are facing problem, then does really helps,
the meditation. This idea of meditation as

00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:58.010
very soft, very gentle, but when you are really
facing problems, can be

00:50:58.010 --> 00:51:04.250
very strong. It's really good for you. That's,
right. This you can share with him. Your own

00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:12.160
experience, stories, and maybe books. And
maybe, Google. And there's many online program

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:16.660
also, how to learn meditations, you know.
Even you don?t have to come to a different

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:19.870
place, but you can stay in your home and learn
all sorts of things.

00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:21.111
female #1: Okay, thank you.

00:51:21.111 --> 00:51:31.050
male #2: Hello. So, I'm a personal trainer
here.

00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:32.050
Rinpoche: Yes.

00:51:32.050 --> 00:51:33.480
male #2: I work with athletes?

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:34.480
Rinpoche: Athletes, yes.

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:39.420
male #2: --yeah, and one of the things the
things that's a concept in like sports psychology

00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:40.960
is getting into flow states.

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:42.870
Rinpoche: Flow, flow state mmm, hmm.

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:47.970
male #2: Yeah, it's kind of a state of being
where you're almost so present that you lose

00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:52.610
the sense of time, almost lose the sense of
self, because you're so in the moment. You

00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:57.860
know, what are your thoughts or techniques
on those kinds of things is my first question.

00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:05.120
Second one is, guided visualization, guided
meditation, what are your thoughts on that?

00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:12.171
Rinpoche: Yes. That I think important is for
example, if you have so much concentration,

00:52:12.171 --> 00:52:20.510
whatever, and if you recognize awareness,
what we call essence of meditation is- recognize

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:32.150
awareness- for example, if you rest, normally
you're resting almost like unconsciously,

00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:39.850
but this time you rest, rest with consciously.
So, the sense of awareness there, but if you

00:52:39.850 --> 00:52:46.869
use sound as support for meditation, normally
just sound, but now you know you listen to

00:52:46.869 --> 00:52:51.941
sound. So with the meditation is you know
you listen to sound, normally just sound.

00:52:51.941 --> 00:52:58.390
It's like if you doing- what about the physical
exercise, meditation also really good for

00:52:58.390 --> 00:53:06.030
help concentration with exercise. Being, I
mean, when you do physical exercise you're

00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:14.590
aware of awareness and then you do exercise.
That's become meditation and then it's not

00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:21.650
completely lost in that. The sense of center.
You have center, you have peace, but sometime

00:53:21.650 --> 00:53:27.090
your concentration together. But only concentration
no recognize awareness then you're lost in

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:34.810
that. Then you lost time and can only see
one aspect, you don't see other aspect. And

00:53:34.810 --> 00:53:39.340
another thing is visualization.
I think visualization is very, very important

00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:45.369
in the meditation also because, especially
what we call, we are; my meditation style

00:53:45.369 --> 00:53:52.440
is Tibetan meditation style. In Tibetan meditation
we use a lot of visualization, imagination

00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:59.351
as part of meditation. What we call using
imagination as path. Path, path, you know

00:53:59.351 --> 00:54:05.940
path means practice and because we are using
imagination actually. Without imagination,

00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:12.390
we can not make plans; you can not remember
what your past story, where you come from,

00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:20.080
where you're going. If you don't use imagination
you don't know how, so using imagination with

00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:21.490
awareness is really good I think.

00:54:21.490 --> 00:54:30.400
male #2: So you are saying it's okay when
your, let's say meditating, not just say sitting

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.970
still, but even if your moving?

00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:34.280
Rinpoche: Of course, of course-

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:35.280
male #2: you're doing some activity that you
can still be in meditation and?

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:37.250
Rinpoche: Yes, everywhere, any times.

00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:40.380
male #2: Cool.

00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:44.070
Rinpoche: Have time? One last question.

00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:54.470
male #3: Hi. I was wondering what you thoughts
are on dreaming and, you know, using dreams

00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:57.230
for meditating, and do you meditate in your
dreams?

00:54:57.230 --> 00:55:03.030
Rinpoche: Yes, dream meditation. There are
two kinds of meditation: Sleeping meditation

00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:08.941
and dream meditation. Sleeping meditation
doesn't have dream and the dream meditation

00:55:08.941 --> 00:55:18.040
has dream. Most important for dream meditation
is lucid dream. You recognize your dream,

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:22.492
once you recognize your dream you can play
with dream. You can do many thing in the dream.

00:55:22.492 --> 00:55:26.620
You can meditate, you can fly, you can walk
in the ocean without sinking, you can jump

00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:33.300
in the fire it can not burn you, you can go
to the top of this Midlife- the tallest building

00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:40.390
in San Francisco, what is it called? Trans-American
whatever and you can jump and you can not

00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:46.340
broke your leg. It's like this is the first
step, and the second step is change your body.

00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:55.470
Change into bird, bird to fish. And you can
see change into bird also. And then third

00:55:55.470 --> 00:56:02.300
step you're coming from dream world to real
world. Dream body in the dream you have dream

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:06.430
body, dream sense, you can see your dream
body- I mean you can see your real body, you're

00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:15.910
sleeping there. [snoring sound] you know.
And fourth step is- only when you learn third

00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:21.090
step then you can receive teaching about 4th
level.

00:56:21.090 --> 00:56:22.811
male#3: Thank you.

00:56:22.811 --> 00:56:31.700
Rinpoche: Thank you very much to here, Ming,
and organize here in Google. And I am very

00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:33.230
happy to be here. Thank you very much.

00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:33.700
[audience applauding]
