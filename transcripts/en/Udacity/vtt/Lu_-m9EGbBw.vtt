00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And this is a tricky one, but the keywords are used when describing

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
the moon's Jupiter where predictable and regular.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Predictable means Galileo could make a chart or some catalogue of the times

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
when each of these moons were supposed to let's say go behind the planet Jupiter.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If we're looking at the zoomed in version of Jupiter, we could tell when this transit occurred

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
because the moon will go from being visible to no longer visible when it passed behind the planet,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and it didn't matter if you're observing over here in Italy or may be over here

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
somewhere in Africa let's say--this would happen at the exact same time.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It doesn't matter if you're Galileo here in Italy or some sailor out in the ocean.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You would've observed this transit to occur at the exact same time.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So if you knew for instance that this occurred at 8 o'clock in Italian time, this sailor could immediately

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
get a reference for what time it was back at home.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
By comparing that with their own clock, they could determine their longitude.

00:00:50.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Seems pretty brainy right?
