00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.060
This is a very 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.259
poor country and we're 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.799
right here in the middle

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:14.029
of the richest country in all of Africa.

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:15.959
2.2 million people,

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.369
a third of all the adults are living with HIV

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:20.519
and the mountains

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:25.979
are where a lot of people live.

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:27.470
This is the most

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.359
challenging situation I've ever been in.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.359
First of all you can only get there by airplane.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.430
Secondly

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.300
the nature of the disease patterns

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.030
we've just never dealt

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.690
with a country before that has 30% 
of its adults living with HIV

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.230
that just complicates everything.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.140
tuberculosis, now we know drug-resistant tuberculosis
is a major

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.880
major problem.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.290
We just started doing what we've always done
which is to try to bring

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.299
good people who've had experience in delivering
health care very

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.660
for settings,

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.820
"ok, next Monday"

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.270
hiring lot of local people

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.640
and then working with them to try to

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.500
dramatically upgrade the quality

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.790
of services

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.140
thirty years old

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.450
newly diagnosed HIV today comes in chronic
diarrhea

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.870
and also acute hearing loss.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.640
So on Wednesday she lost her ability to hear.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.110
You know we were very lucky because one of
our most experienced doctors to Jennifer Furin

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.560
volunteered to come and lead the team

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.290
So I think at this point

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.520
that lady needs to move out,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.940
when she's ready to go she needs to be admitted
and the usual.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.220
So I left a note in the bucana.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.289
It really takes a person like Jen 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.450
with her extraordinary background

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.580
but also the fact that she received such great training
at Harvard medical school

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.320
to Brigham Women's Hospital,

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.820
she's bringing all those things here with her.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.850
she should get some

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.410
Ceftriaxone, 2 grams

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.450
She should get started on TB treatment,

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.489
and high dose Fluconazole, and with the hearing loss, 
I can't think of anything other than meningitis

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.459
that this could be. And we should start her on Prednisone.

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.329
so let me just put a note in for

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:17.689
the medical officer.

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:22.569
The fact that things have developed and grown
so quickly here is a

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.499
fantastic testament to Jennifer, to Jonas Rigodon 
one of our physicians who came

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:29.139
from Haiti

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:31.289
" It is ok mam, almost finished" 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:33.099
Jonas was trained

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.249
in the Partners in Health method

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:38.759
in the clinics in Haiti. He is another 
extremely accomplished individual,

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:42.739
he studied for two years in Belgium, speaks
French fluidly, he speaks English fluently,

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.429
speaks Haitian Creole,

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:45.629
and he's now here

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.860
working with Jen to develop these
critical services that

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.199
you know I think

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:52.159
is as good as any in Africa.

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:52.879
"Exactly, there is no real confidentiality

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.079
but the patient is excited also to come to 
see doctor because they are sick

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.179
and they need help, they come to get help.

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:05.349
but we are improving everything, as you can 
the new clinic right here,

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.149
and fiscal control and everything, 
everything is getting better after a few months.

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:12.170
these are places that have never had a primary
health care system

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.289
so

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:16.420
a lot of the kids have never have vaccinations,

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.699
and there's no such thing as such thing as a regular doctor
in fact until we came in

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.169
there was no such thing as a medical record. In other
words

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.999
if you're really sick and about to drop
dead you come to the clinic

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:30.179
and they try to do something or other and they
ask you pay

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:33.199
and if you can't pay and you can't do anything, you die.

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:38.119
And so a lot of these places are known
as places where you go to die

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:42.529
as opposed to places and that reach out 
to you to keep you healthy

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:46.689
Now, that's what we're trying to do here. "you
know I think the painful feet are probably 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:48.559
nutritional and HIV neuropathy

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:51.159
I mean that's how I would put

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:54.519
this story together

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:55.619
although it could be wrong

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:58.819
and the reason that we're going to have her stay 
is so that you guys can watch her

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:00.829
when I go to the Brigham,

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:06.719
there's a hundred doctors on the floor I'm on, and if I 
forget to do something properly, somebody else picks it up

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:09.969
so in some ways this job is very stressful because

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:15.039
if I forget to do something for her it could
mean the difference between her life and death as well.

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:18.039
They don't suppose one can expect to know the

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:24.139
joy of saving a life plan if one isn't expected to
also know the pain of losing one.

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.759
So that's what we do here.

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:28.029
we're not giving in to the poverty 

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:30.360
and inequality

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.869
and the terrible conditions here.

00:04:31.869 --> 00:04:34.520
Our goal has always been

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.590
that all the fruits of the extraordinary labors
of people

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.770
in hospitals in the laboratories making new
tools that have just transformed medicine

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.919
our conviction always has been

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.649
that everyone on the face of the earth

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:48.669
deserves to have access to those things

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.409
and of we want to train

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:52.469
the next clowder of Jennifer Furins 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:53.900
"he's too skinny"

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.360
who will be able to go to all corners of the
Earth

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.469
to deliver these kinds of tools

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:01.809
"you should come and see us"
