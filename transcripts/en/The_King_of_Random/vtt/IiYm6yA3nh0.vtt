[Captions by Y Translator]
In this video, we're going to look
at what happens if you gather together

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.940
a whole lot of nail polish
and throw it on a stove.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:14.860
[Music]

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.840
We've tried something
similar to this twice before,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.100
once with superglue,
and once with whiteout correction fluid

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.500
and we had different results.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.600
Those were both flammable liquids,
but they didn't react the same way.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.900
So, maybe today we'll find out
if the nail polish reacts more

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.700
like the super glue
or more like the white out.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.700
The plan is simple,
we're going to empty

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.180
all 48 of these bottles into our pot,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.400
turn on the heat,
and watch what happens.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.700
Now, these do have
a warning on them.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.860
They're flammable.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.180
How flammable we're talking here,
we've got a rock

00:00:43.422 --> 00:00:44.800
and we've got some nail polish,

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.900
heat some on,
and hit it with a torch.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.100
Oh, your fingernails look
just lovely today, Mr. Rock.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.500
I don't know what
girls talk about on

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.360
they're getting the nails done.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.980
[Music]

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.020
Well, didn't do a whole lot.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.600
Looked like it may be caught
on fire for a second there,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.000
then just went out.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.340
Try and puddle up a little
bit more of it this time.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.800
[Music]

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.300
All right.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.022
There we go.

00:01:17.472 --> 00:01:18.800
Now that's burning on its own.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.260
[Music]

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.200
And it went out.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.800
I would say that is less flammable
than the white out,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.200
but still flammable, clearly.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.400
So, it is flammable,
and I think we need

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.020
to see what happens if we try and get rid
of all of the solvents and liquids

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.060
in that by heating them up on this pot.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.200
So now, we get to empty 48 bottles
of nail polish into this pot.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.052
There's not a lot
in each one of these.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.420
But, there is a small metal ball
used for mixing the nail polish up.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.040
I'm not going to dig
those out with my finger.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.900
So we're just going to have a pot
full of a lot of nail polish

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.242
and probably 48 small metal beads.

00:01:56.242 --> 00:02:26.580
[Music]

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.800
We've got our pot
full of nail polish

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.000
and it's not all the way full,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
but that is the most
full of nail polish

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.182
I have ever seen anything.

00:02:34.832 --> 00:02:36.672
Going to set that down
on our burner.

00:02:37.842 --> 00:02:38.400
Light it up.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.400
We're going to start on low.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.862
See what happens.

00:02:41.322 --> 00:02:50.040
[Music]

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.112
That is on low,
can't really see it but...

00:02:55.502 --> 00:02:57.542
See, that does light
this grass on.

00:02:58.792 --> 00:03:01.242
Now, we see what the heat does
to the nail polish.

00:03:01.242 --> 00:03:08.320
[Music]

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.520
I think we're starting
to get a couple of bubbles.

00:03:11.382 --> 00:03:13.102
Bubbling around the edges as well.

00:03:13.102 --> 00:03:17.220
[Music]

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.000
Does have a little bit
of a skin on top of it.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.352
Maybe not quite so much
as the whiteout did but some.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:42.220
[Music]

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.900
Pull more of the skin back
because I really like seeing

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.700
the bubbling action.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.520
And how its kind
of mixing the colors

00:03:50.162 --> 00:03:51.312
everywhere there's not a skin.

00:03:52.222 --> 00:03:54.700
All of these colors around the edge
are getting a little bit muddled

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.400
and darker and slightly muddy colored,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.600
and I don't know if that's
because they're mixing

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.300
with other colors as they boil,

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.320
or something about the chemical
process of being heated up

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.360
is actually causing
them to change colors.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.880
Got a skin forming again.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.940
I just got a whiff
of that that's potent.

00:04:13.742 --> 00:04:15.400
Never liked the smell
of nail polish.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.420
[Music]

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.120
The fumes are invisible.

00:04:21.122 --> 00:04:25.520
[Music]

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.220
I'm going to try turning up
the heat a little bit.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.400
We actually now have a pretty
uniformly boiling substance here.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.000
There's bubbles coming
up all through it.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.800
It's not really got much
of a film anymore.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.522
I think the heat may have made
that all breakup,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.280
and our color is becoming more
and more uniform all the way through,

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.100
it's not there yet,

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.362
we've still definitely
got a pinker bit over here,

00:04:48.892 --> 00:04:50.520
some bluer over here,

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.100
little bit of orange tint there,
and pretty muddled in the middle,

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.120
and then there's
these little bits on top.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.780
I think that's just sort
of the remnants of the skin,

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.300
and some other colors that
aren't mixing quite as much.

00:05:03.002 --> 00:05:05.380
Ooh, sticking the stick down
onto the bottom,

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.432
there's some thicker gunky substance
that's already formed down there.

00:05:10.432 --> 00:05:13.400
[Music]

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.000
Doesn't look like anything
because it gets coated

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.100
on its way up.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.640
But, up here very much liquid.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.800
And some down on the bottom,
it's got like, a skin.

00:05:22.802 --> 00:05:24.780
[Music]

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.242
It's on fire.

00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:32.940
[Music]

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.200
Well, we've seen this reaction
before we hit a flash point.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.700
It just got so hot
that it ignited.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.800
It's possible
that some fumes did make it.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.500
I don't know how
it would go down.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.100
But you know, they might have
gone over the side and sort of

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.800
acted as a channel from the flames
underneath up onto the top.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:06:09.200
[Music]

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.200
Hmm...

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.900
[Music]

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.360
Well...

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.660
That didn't work so great.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:23.880
[Music]

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.420
That's some kind
of vapor right there.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:40.020
[Music]

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.980
It does reignite easily,
quite easily.

00:06:43.022 --> 00:06:44.892
Now the surface
of it is just burning.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:55.840
[Music]

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.620
Apparently, the vapors
coming off are flammable.

00:06:59.302 --> 00:07:00.042
Nifty.

00:07:00.042 --> 00:07:10.560
[Music]

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.380
Random helpful tip:

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.400
Coating the bottom of metal containers
in your shower with nail polish

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.172
can help prevent them from
leaving rust marks in your shower.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:38.040
[Music]

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.160
There we go.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:46.900
[Music]

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.660
Well, there you go.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.700
This is nail polish.

00:07:53.622 --> 00:07:57.400
Pretty much, all of the
liquid burned right out of it,

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:02.502
and it just a solid biscuit left over.

00:08:02.502 --> 00:08:06.460
[Music]

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:11.200
I gotta say, I do not recommend boiling
and lighting on fire large batches

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.440
of nail polish at once.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.800
That's just a bad plan.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.500
Don't do it.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:20.100
Wow, there's so much left like,
very little actually burned away.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.500
I feel like we have
almost the same mass.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.932
Obviously something was lost.

00:08:24.542 --> 00:08:27.100
But it looks like we have
quite a bit left here.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.300
All of the bright vibrant nail
polish colors are gone.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.240
It's just charcoal colored.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.600
It's what happens
when you burn stuff.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.000
There's some of the bright
vibrant colors left over,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.460
just on my hand.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.520
That is some of the coolest
looking trash I've ever seen.

00:08:43.322 --> 00:08:45.600
All right guys, time
for more question and answer.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.800
We've got some good questions
that you guys have sent in.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.800
We'll see if we can give
you some answers for them.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:54.320
Preston Hawkins @fat2slow
wants to know,

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.060
is there a myth you would try
with @Donttrythis.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.200
Now, that's Adam Savage
from MythBusters.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.200
That's his Twitter handle.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.400
So, he's asking if there are
any myths we would like to try

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.540
with Adam Savage.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.000
The answer is that,
we'd be happy to try

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.100
out anything with him.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.300
We've got some fun larger scale
experiments that we'd like to do,

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.600
maybe some explosions.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.800
I imagine he's still got some contacts
in that part of the world.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.780
He is an extremely busy person,

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.500
so getting on his schedule
might be kind of difficult.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.600
But if you would like
to see us do something

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.900
with Adam Savage formerly of Mythbusters,

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.500
currently of the YouTube channel,
tested, where they do some really

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.400
cool amazing stuff,
you should check them out.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.600
You can let them know,
leave some comments,

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.832
maybe tweet at him and if you would
like to see us work together.

00:09:33.242 --> 00:09:35.180
Then, maybe you guys
can make that happen,

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.900
and I'm sure we can come up
with a lot of really

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.760
cool fun experiments to try.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.012
There are always more myths
in the world that need testing and busting.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.000
That's it for today,
but the fun is not over.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.900
That box at the top will take you
to our last video,

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.000
you should check that one out.

00:09:48.052 --> 00:09:50.300
The box at the bottom will
show you what YouTube thinks

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.620
you should be checking out next.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.400
And this bomb in the middle
will subscribe to the channel

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.200
and that way you never
miss out on the fun.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.400
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we'll see the next one.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.880
Talk to you then.
