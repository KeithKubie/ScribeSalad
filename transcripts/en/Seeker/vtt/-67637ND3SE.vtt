00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.550
Testosterone is the quintessential male hormone,
and it supposedly makes men more manly, right?

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.580
Sure, but females have testosterone too.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:18.100
What do they do with it?

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.070
Testosterone is a sex hormone produced in
the adrenal glands, ovaries and testes.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.910
We commonly associate it with men, as it's
necessary for the production of sperm, but,

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.189
according to the journal Maturitas it's the
most abundant sex steroid in women throughout

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.189
their lifespan.

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:37.590
In cisgender populations, men have 10 times
MORE testosterone in their body than women,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.940
pushing around 4 to 10mg of the hormone per
day through their bloodstreams.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.020
Testosterone is recognized by the general
population but not well understood, and even

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.110
scientists haven't mastered it yet.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.600
Those commercials calling for people with
"low T" to talk to their doctors are crazytown!

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.809
According to the British Medical Journal only
0.1 percent of men in their forties have low-T.

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.310
So why do people care?

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.700
Because we think of it as the hormone for
masculinity.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.210
High testosterone is equated with manliness
and mating success -- though interestingly

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.860
it's not associated with actual attractiveness.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.650
In one study testing testosterone on female
behavior, women who only believed they'd received

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.140
it behaved more aggressively toward other
women.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.970
Most people learned in sex ed that, testosterone
production kicks in during male puberty when

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.900
the pituitary gland at the base of the brain
begins releasing luteinizing hormone, or LH;

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.659
and follicle-stimulating hormone FSH -- together
they tell the testes to make testosterone

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.440
causing development of the penis and testes,
larger muscles, deeper voices, increased height,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.440
and so on.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.369
But in females, 50 percent of their T comes
from their ovaries and adrenal gland throughout

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.380
their lives; the rest is naturally converted
from base androgens to testosterone elsewhere

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.100
in the body as needed.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.440
Androgens are sort of like the building blocks
of hormones like estrogen and testosterone.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.850
Testosterone is the skeleton key to SO MUCH
in our bodies, and the levels in each and

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.229
every person varies.

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.420
Testosterone naturally fluctuates throughout
the day, and over our lifetimes.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.700
Levels usually peak in the morning and drop
throughout the day.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:17.040
In men they peak during puberty, lowering
by 1-2 percent a year after 40, but, female

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.630
testosterone production is less well understood
overall; which can cause all sorts of issues.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.450
It seems to help grow healthy bones, but upping
intake can cause blood clots, cancers and

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.250
other deadly issues in all humans.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.400
Successful athletes often have more testosterone,
with some women with the highest natural levels

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.050
topping men with the lowest natural levels.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.660
A single study found 13.7 percent of women
found testosterone levels higher than the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.560
female average in athletes, and when the International
Olympic Committee tested the female athletic

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.180
population of the 2011 Daegu, South Korea
World Championships they found some women

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:02.950
(1.5 to 4.7 percent) at the lowest MALE levels;
while 1.8 percent of the men were within the

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.710
typical female range!

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.040
As women enter menopause, testosterone production
halts, perhaps to lower libido, but we donâ€™t

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.290
really know why.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.380
Female testosterone has been connected with
female body shape, fertility and physical

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.879
changes, athletic abilities, making women
nicer to others to gain social standing...

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:25.459
it's even been associated with ladies crying
to release it.

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.700
Another study found women taking testosterone
were more opinionated and less productive

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.890
while in groups -- focusing more on themselves,
and yet another study found testosterone boosted

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.690
lady libidoooo -- but study participants were
also on antidepressants.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.709
So again, testosterone isn't well understood;
and even though we know more about it with

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.269
men, we're still kind of bumbling.

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.150
There's not even a strong connection between
testosterone and physical violence; but if

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.819
you ask the average person they'd say there
is.

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.709
What we do know, is testosterone prepares
the body to respond to competition, sexuality,

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.840
and challenges to social status -- but outside
of that, science gets nebulous.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.380
Ultimately, there doesn't seem to be an exact
number that's right for everyone.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.930
Do you have a science question?

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.940
Want to know about something?

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:42.050
