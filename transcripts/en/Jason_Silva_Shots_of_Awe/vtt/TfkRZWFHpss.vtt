00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.345
You know, I love this
idea of radical openness,

00:00:04.345 --> 00:00:06.000
the free exchange
of information,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.605
the free flow of ideas, creating
spaces in which ideas can have

00:00:09.605 --> 00:00:11.840
sex, as Matt Ridley talks about.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.090
And this is huge because it
turns out that ideas are just

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.395
as real as the
neurons they inhabit,

00:00:17.395 --> 00:00:18.906
as James Gleick tells us.

00:00:18.906 --> 00:00:21.790
A new kingdom rises
above the biosphere.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.110
Denizens of this
kingdom are ideas,

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.940
because ideas have retained some
of the properties of organisms,

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:28.570
it turns out.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.380
They leap from brain to brain.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.890
They compete for the limited
resources of our attention.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.300
They have infectivity.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.830
They have spreading power.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.700
They are, what
Richard Dawkins calls,

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.220
the new replicators, born
from the primordial soup

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.830
of human culture.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.850
Their vector of
transmission is language

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.900
and electronic communication.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.260
And though ideas are
made of nucleic acid,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.760
they have achieved more
evolutionary change

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.096
and at a rate that leaves the
old gene panting far behind.

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:56.720
You know, Ray Kurzweil
says our ability

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.745
to create virtual
models in our heads,

00:00:58.745 --> 00:01:01.010
combined with our
modest-looking thumbs,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.470
was sufficient to usher in the
secondary force of evolution

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.629
called technology.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.410
And it will continue,
until the entire universe

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.170
is at our fingertips.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.360
This is unbelievable stuff.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.250
It speaks to the telescopic
nature of evolutionary change,

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.730
more change in
the last 100 years

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.470
than in the last billion years.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.630
Terrance McKenna actually
wrote, "from the moment

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.500
that human beings
invented language,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.440
biological evolution
essentially ceased,

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.500
and evolution became a cultural
epigenetic phenomenon."

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.200
Now, we take in matter
of low organization,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.770
we put it through
our mental filters,

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.110
and we extrude it in the form
of space shuttles and iPhones.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.070
You know, the
imaginary foundation

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.860
tells us that what
imagination does

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.860
is it allows us to conceive
of delightful future

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.750
possibilities, pick
the most amazing one,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.960
and pull the present
forward to meet it.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.817
Imagine how
impoverished this world

00:01:45.817 --> 00:01:47.400
would have been, if
we hadn't invented

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.840
the technology of the oil
painting in time for Van Gogh,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.964
or the technology of the
musical instrument in time

00:01:51.964 --> 00:01:55.360
for Beethoven and Mozart
to unfurl through it.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.134
With the revolutions
in biotechnology

00:01:57.134 --> 00:01:59.300
and nanotechnology, the
free exchange of information

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.040
is allowing us to conceive
of radical new things.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.775
Freeman Dyson says,
in the future,

00:02:03.775 --> 00:02:06.000
a new generation of artists
will be writing genomes

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.242
with the fluency that Blake
and Byron wrote verses.

00:02:09.242 --> 00:02:11.070
"What is great in
man," said Nietzsche,

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.240
"is that he is a
bridge and not an end."

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.340
"We're on a trajectory smack
in the middle between born

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.150
and and the made,"
wrote Kevin Kelly.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.880
And so radical
openness, it's huge.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.330
It's a universe of possibility.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.045
It's gray infused by color.

00:02:25.045 --> 00:02:26.690
It's the invisible revealed.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.230
It's the mundane
blown away by awe.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.100
We need to cultivate
radical openness

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.705
as a way of participating
and accelerating evolution.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.340
Wow.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:48.228
