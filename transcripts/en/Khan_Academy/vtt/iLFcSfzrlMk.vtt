00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.590
In the last video, we
give a bit of an overview

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.769
of potassium-argon dating.

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:07.060
In this video, I want to go
through a concrete example.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.434
And it'll get a
little bit mathy,

00:00:08.434 --> 00:00:10.220
usually involving a
little bit of algebra

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.210
or a little bit of
exponential decay,

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.710
but to really show you how
you can actually figure out

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.950
the age of some volcanic
rock using this technique,

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.440
using a little bit
of mathematics.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.330
So we know that anything that is
experiencing radioactive decay,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.600
it's experiencing
exponential decay.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.452
And we know that there's
a generalized way

00:00:28.452 --> 00:00:29.160
to describe that.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.590
And we go into
more depth and kind

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.470
of prove it in other
Khan Academy videos.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.940
But we know that the amount
as a function of time--

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.390
so if we say N is the amount
of a radioactive sample we have

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.191
at some time-- we know that's
equal to the initial amount we

00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:44.690
have.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.830
We'll call that N sub 0, times
e to the negative kt-- where

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.570
this constant is particular
to that thing's half-life.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.170
In order to do this for the
example of potassium-40,

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.670
we know that when time
is 1.25 billion years,

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.680
that the amount we have left
is half of our initial amount.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.940
So let's write it that way.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.756
So let's say we start with
N0, whatever that might be.

00:01:11.756 --> 00:01:13.930
It might be 1 gram,
kilogram, 5 grams-- whatever

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.220
it might be-- whatever
we start with,

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.890
we take e to the negative
k times 1.25 billion years.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.730
That's the half-life
of potassium-40.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.300
So 1.25 billion years.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.900
We know, after that long,
that half of the sample

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.010
will be left.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.399
So we will have 1/2 N0 left.

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:33.940
Whatever we started
with, we're going

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.210
to have half left after
1.25 billion years.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.710
Divide both sides by N0.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.650
And then to solve
for k, we can take

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.720
the natural log of both sides.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.349
So you get the
natural log of 1/2--

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:49.890
we don't have that
N0 there anymore--

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.200
is equal to the natural
log of this thing.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.340
The natural log is
just saying-- to what

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.250
power do I have to
raise e to get e

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.900
to the negative k
times 1.25 billion?

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.600
So the natural log of this--
the power they'd have to raise e

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.870
to to get to e to the negative
k times 1.25 billion--

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.229
is just negative k
times 1.25 billion.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.520
Or I could write it as negative
1.25-- let me write times-- 10

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.380
to the ninth k.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.620
That's the same thing
as 1.25 billion.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.220
We have our negative
sign, and we have our k.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.660
And then, to solve for k,
we can divide both sides

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.480
by negative 1.25 billion.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.780
And so we get k.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.330
And I'll just flip
the sides here.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:39.250
k is equal to the natural log
of 1/2 times negative 1.25 times

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.294
10 to the ninth power.

00:02:40.294 --> 00:02:41.835
And what we can do
is we can multiply

00:02:41.835 --> 00:02:43.150
the negative times the top.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.640
Or you could view
it as multiplying

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.840
the numerator and the
denominator by a negative

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.710
so that a negative
shows up at the top.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.760
And so we could make this
as over 1.25 times 10

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.420
to the ninth.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.940
It's just 1.25 billion.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.544
Let me write it over here
in a different color.

00:02:59.544 --> 00:03:02.210
The negative natural log-- well,
I could just write it this way.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.274
If I have a natural log of
b-- we know from our logarithm

00:03:06.274 --> 00:03:07.690
properties, this
is the same thing

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.860
as the natural log
of b to the a power.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.310
So the negative
natural log of 1/2

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.230
is the same thing as
the natural log of 1/2

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.990
to the negative 1 power.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.507
And so this is the same thing.

00:03:19.507 --> 00:03:21.090
Anything to the
negative power is just

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.170
its multiplicative inverse.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.670
So this is just the
natural log of 2.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.580
So negative natural
log of 1 half

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.080
is just the natural
log of 2 over here.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.180
So we were able to
figure out our k.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.870
It's essentially
the natural log of 2

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.670
over the half-life
of the substance.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.170
So we could actually
generalize this

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.020
if we were talking about some
other radioactive substance.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.380
And now let's think
about a situation--

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.590
now that we've figured out a k--
let's think about a situation

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.290
where we find in some
sample-- so let's say

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.350
the potassium that we
find is 1 milligram.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.690
I'm just going to
make up these numbers.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:57.753
And usually, these
aren't measured directly,

00:03:57.753 --> 00:03:59.700
and you really care about
the relative amounts.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.730
But let's say you were
able to figure out

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.117
the potassium is 1 milligram.

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:03.950
And let's say that the
argon-- actually, I'm

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.510
going to say the
potassium-40 found,

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.490
and let's say the
argon-40 found--

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:15.660
let's say it is 0.01 milligram.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.700
So how can we use this
information-- in what we just

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.040
figured out here, which is
derived from the half-life--

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.400
to figure out how old this
sample right over here?

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.600
How do we figure out
how old this sample

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.230
is right over there?

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.200
Well, what we need
to figure out--

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.000
we know that n, the
amount we were left with,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.010
is this thing right over here.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.155
So we know that we're
left with 1 milligram.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.020
And that's going to be equal
to some initial amount--

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.590
when we use both
of this information

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.760
to figure that initial
amount out-- times e

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.630
to the negative kt.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.770
And we know what k is.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.020
And we'll figure it out later.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.324
So k is this thing
right over here.

00:05:01.324 --> 00:05:03.490
So we need to figure out
what our initial amount is.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.520
We know what k is, and
then we can solve for t.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.339
How old is this sample?

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:09.880
And to figure out
our initial amount,

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:16.490
we just have to remember that
for every argon-40 we see,

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:23.320
that must have decayed from--
when you have potassium-40,

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.730
when it decays, 11% decays into
argon-40 and the rest-- 89%--

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.050
decays into calcium-40.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.600
We saw that in the last video.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.774
So however much argon-40, that
is 11% of the decay product.

00:05:35.774 --> 00:05:37.690
So if you want to think
about the total number

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.500
of potassium-40s
that have decayed

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.265
since this was kind
of stuck in the lava.

00:05:44.265 --> 00:05:46.390
And we learned that anything
that was there before,

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.340
any argon-40 that
was there before

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.620
would have been able to
get out of the liquid lava

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.240
before it froze or
before it hardened.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.520
So to figure out how
much potassium-40 this

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.930
is derived from, we
just divide it by 11%.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:07.910
So maybe I could say k initial--
the potassium-40 initial-- is

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.990
going to be equal to the amount
of potassium 40 we have today--

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.650
1 milligram-- plus the
amount of potassium-40

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.280
we needed to get this
amount of argon-40.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.520
We have this amount of
argon-40-- 0.01 milligrams.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.890
And that number of milligrams
there, it's really just 11%

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.440
of the original potassium-40
that it had to come from.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.090
The rest of it turned
into calcium-40.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.460
So we divide it by 11% or 0.11.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.531
And this isn't the exact number,
but it'll get the general idea.

00:06:40.531 --> 00:06:42.030
And so our initial--
which is really

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.154
this thing right over here.

00:06:43.154 --> 00:06:46.220
I could call this N0.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.269
This is going to
be equal to-- and I

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:49.810
won't do any of the
math-- so we have

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:55.180
1 milligram we have left is
equal to 1 milligram-- which

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:04.160
is what we found-- plus
0.01 milligram over 0.11.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:10.170
And then, all of that
times e to the negative kt.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:11.950
And what you see
here is, when we

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.875
want to solve for t--
assuming we know k,

00:07:13.875 --> 00:07:17.770
and we do know k now-- that
really, the absolute amount

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:18.490
doesn't matter.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.390
What actually
matters is the ratio.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.200
Because if we're
solving for t, you

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.050
want to divide both
sides of this equation

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.950
by this quantity
right over here.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.280
So you get this side--
the left-hand side--

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.030
divide both sides.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.150
You get 1 milligram over
this quantity-- I'll write it

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.940
in blue-- over this
quantity is going

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.550
to be 1 plus-- I'm just
going to assume, actually,

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.760
that the units here
are milligrams.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.760
So you get 1 over
this quantity, which

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:48.530
is 1 plus 0.01 over the 11%.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.460
That is equal to e
to the negative kt.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.360
And then, if you
want to solve for t,

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.550
you want to take the
natural log of both sides.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.762
This is equal right over here.

00:08:00.762 --> 00:08:02.720
You want to take the
natural log of both sides.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.260
So you get the natural
log of 1 over 1

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:14.232
plus 0.01 over 0.11 or 11%
is equal to negative kt.

00:08:14.232 --> 00:08:16.190
And then, to solve for
t, you divide both sides

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.210
by negative k.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:18.370
So I'll write it over here.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.911
And you can see, this a little
bit cumbersome mathematically,

00:08:20.911 --> 00:08:22.260
but we're getting to the answer.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:31.330
So we got the natural log of
1 over 1 plus 0.01 over 0.11

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.450
over negative k.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:34.897
Well, what is negative k?

00:08:34.897 --> 00:08:37.480
We're just dividing both sides
of this equation by negative k.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.039
Negative k is the
negative of this

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:45.540
over the negative natural
log of 2 over 1.25 times

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:46.302
10 to the ninth.

00:08:46.302 --> 00:08:48.260
And now, we can get our
calculator out and just

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.927
solve for what this time is.

00:08:49.927 --> 00:08:51.760
And it's going to be
in years because that's

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.640
how we figured
out this constant.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.860
So let's get my handy TI-85.

00:08:59.409 --> 00:09:00.450
First, I'll do this part.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:09.820
So this is 1 divided by 1
plus 0.01 divided by 0.11.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.160
So that's this part
right over here.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.040
That gives us that number.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.990
And then, we want to take
the natural log of that.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:21.400
So let's take the natural
log of our previous answer.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.245
So it's the natural
log of 0.9166667.

00:09:24.245 --> 00:09:27.960
It gives us negative 0.087.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.160
So that's this
numerator over here.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.510
And we're going to divide that.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.880
So this number is our
numerator right over here.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:38.040
We're going to divide
that by the negative--

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:45.240
I'll use parentheses carefully--
the negative natural log of 2--

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:55.360
that's that there-- divided
by 1.25 times 10 to the ninth.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.440
So it's negative natural
log of 2 divided by 1.25.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.650
E9 means times 10 to the ninth.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:02.930
And I closed both parentheses.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:04.590
And now, we need our drum roll.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:08.750
So this should give
us our t in years.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.310
Let's see how many--
this is thousands,

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:16.830
so it's 3,000-- so we
get 156 million or 156.9

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.130
million years if we round.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:26.839
So this is approximately a
157-million-year-old sample.

00:10:26.839 --> 00:10:29.380
So the whole point of this-- I
know the math was a little bit

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.930
involved, but it's something
that you would actually

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.510
see in a pre-calculus
class or an algebra 2 class

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.146
when you're studying
exponential growth and decay.

00:10:36.146 --> 00:10:37.770
But the whole point
I wanted to do this

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.130
is to show you that it's
not some crazy voodoo here.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.760
And, you know, Sal, gave this
very high-level explanation,

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.176
and then, you say,
oh, well, there

00:10:44.176 --> 00:10:46.430
must be some super difficult
mathematics after that.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:47.888
The mathematics
really is something

00:10:47.888 --> 00:10:50.280
that you would see
in high school.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.740
If you saw a sample that
had this ratio of argon-40

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.500
to potassium-40,
you would actually

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.512
be able to do that high
school mathematics.

00:10:58.512 --> 00:11:00.595
You would be able to do
that to figure out this is

00:11:00.595 --> 00:11:06.610
a 157-million-year-old
sample of volcanic rock.
