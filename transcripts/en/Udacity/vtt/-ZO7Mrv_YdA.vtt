If everything swapped in frame we would expect to get a gene that's actually

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:10.070
a fusion of the two gene products. Making one single protein that's a fusion

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.790
of pieces of both of them. We wouldn't expect to get two separate proteins.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.810
And as long as everything's in frame, we wouldn't expect to get no protein.
