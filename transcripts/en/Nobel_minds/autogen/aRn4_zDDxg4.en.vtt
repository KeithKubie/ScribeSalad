but in invention price and in this type
of price we really emphasize the

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:04.180
of price we really emphasize the
 

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.960
of price we really emphasize the
usefulness of the of the invention and

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:06.970
usefulness of the of the invention and
 

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:11.400
usefulness of the of the invention and
this is the case in this case do we have

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:11.410
this is the case in this case do we have
 

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:18.379
this is the case in this case do we have
some more questions
