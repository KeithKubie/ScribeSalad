(gentle fun music)

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:47.520
- Welcome to A Conversation With History.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.300
I'm Harry Kreisler of the Institute

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.000
of International Studies.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.220
Our guest today is
Harriet Mayor Fulbright,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.220
who is the Harvest
distinguished woman lecturer

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.460
on the Berkeley campus this semester.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.990
And she is a co-founder of

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:09.010
the Harriet Mayor Fulbright College.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.570
She served in the Clinton Administration

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.270
as executive director
of President Clinton's

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.850
committee on the arts and the humanities.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.980
And she has been an unofficial ambassador

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.423
for the Fulbright Program.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.100
Mrs. Fulbright, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.090
- Thank you so much, I'm glad to be here.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.740
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.960
- I was born in New York City.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.960
My father was a, on the
business end of Time Magazine,

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.010
and he was constantly opening new offices.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.023
So we did a fair amount of moving.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.180
- And looking back, how did your parents

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.800
shape your thinking about the world?

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.410
- They shaped it fundamentally
because my father

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.750
really strongly believed in
connections around the world

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.623
as the only way we were
going to be saved, in fact.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.450
So there was constant conversation,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.973
even when I was little,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.460
about other parts of the world.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.460
And in fact he sent me to
Latin America when I was 15.

00:02:17.518 --> 00:02:19.540
- And what about your
mother, what was her--

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.030
- My mother was unfortunately killed

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.900
in a skiing accident when I was 12.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.750
And that was very hard on the
family as you can imagine.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.663
I was the oldest of
four, and I was only 12.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.020
But he did marry a couple of years later,

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.190
a wonderful woman, who is still alive

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.870
and who became an integral
part of our family.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.520
- Did you wind up
traveling with your father

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.330
or living abroad when you
were still very young?

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.120
- Yes, he was actually,

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.740
his home was physically moved to places.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.170
We started in New York,
moved to Philadelphia.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.453
During the second world
war we lived in Washington.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.820
Then he moved to Europe, Paris.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.990
By that time I was not, I was in college

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.280
and I wasn't with the family all the time,

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.460
but yes, I obviously
visited him as he moved.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.120
- And where did you do
your undergraduate work?

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.350
- My undergraduate work
was at Radcliffe College,

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.620
and graduated from there.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.130
- And what did you major in?

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.790
- International relations.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.270
- And did you do a study abroad,

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.950
or did they have study abroad then?

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.950
- It was a very narrow and
difficult type of program,

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.320
so no, I did not study abroad, there,

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.430
and didn't feel particularly the need to

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.430
since my (laughs) family was
educating me in that fashion.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.430
- And so, out of college, what
career choice did you make?

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.660
Or is, is that when you,
when did you have this,

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.660
your first living abroad,
education abroad experience?

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.050
- That was, I guess, when I (sighs)

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.090
I was in my 20s, I believe.

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.900
I lived for two years in the Soviet Union.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.597
And that was quite an
extraordinary experience.

00:04:23.597 --> 00:04:26.663
- And this would have been,
what years approximately?

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.130
- In 19', let's see, in the 1950s.

00:04:33.887 --> 00:04:37.330
- In the 1950's, and what was that like,

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.560
cause that must have been

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.414
at the height of the cold war and--

00:04:40.414 --> 00:04:41.327
- [Harriet] It was the
height of the cold war.

00:04:41.327 --> 00:04:42.780
- What, were you afraid?

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.820
- I wasn't afraid, I was frustrated.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.500
I knew we were going, this
was with my first husband,

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.980
and I knew we were going to live there.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.470
And so I studied Russian very hard.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.680
And I'm pretty good at languages,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.120
so when I got there I could
make normal conversation.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.650
I traveled to keep my sanity,

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.070
and some of those travels
were quite extraordinary,

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.907
and made me realize that this
regime's days were numbered.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.690
- And was there a lot of interaction with

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.303
the people of the Soviet Union?

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.610
- Only surreptitiously.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.920
There was one time when
I took a trip to Tashkent

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.080
to visit schools, and at one
point the student teachers,

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.630
when I tried to leave that afternoon,

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.647
went to the principal and said,

00:05:37.647 --> 00:05:39.407
"We have to show that we're polite.

00:05:39.407 --> 00:05:43.150
"We have to escort her back to her hotel."

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.450
And as soon as I got to the sidewalk,

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.279
they said, "Where do
you really want to go?"

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:49.420
(both laughing)

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.810
And it was an incredible evening.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.770
- So the beginnings of
the dissident movement

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.980
were apparent to anybody
who talked to the people.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.700
- Yes, and it was clear
that there was no way

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.880
that it could last, because
at the end of that evening,

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.880
one of the young men, pulled
out this Time Magazine,

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.800
and smoothed it out,
and there was a picture

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.100
of an apartment building,
American apartment building.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.420
He said, "You see that picture?"

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.150
And I said, "Yes."

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.550
And he said, "You see
what the name of it is?"

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.543
And it, I, it was an apartment building

00:06:24.543 --> 00:06:26.210
that was marked slums.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.387
He said, "To us, that's a
nice apartment building.

00:06:29.387 --> 00:06:31.850
"What else are they lying to us about?"

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.083
I thought, oh boy, deep trouble.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.270
- So now, when was your

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.425
education abroad experience in Columbia?

00:06:43.425 --> 00:06:47.330
Was that--
- That was when I was only 15.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.810
And I was in high school, of course.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.680
And I spent three solid months in Bogota,

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.140
and went to the Gimnasio Femenino.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:02.140
And that was in order to
not just improve my Spanish,

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.200
but to realize how very different life

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.300
was in other countries.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.290
- And so in both cases, you
acquired some language skills.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:12.530
- Oh yes.
- [Harry] Yeah.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.600
- Oh yes, I spoke Russian
and I did speak Spanish, yes.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.600
- And and so, did this, shall we say,

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.690
get you the foreign
travel, foreign education

00:07:26.944 --> 00:07:29.960
abroad bug very early?
- Oh yes.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.863
- So you wanted to do more and so on.

00:07:31.863 --> 00:07:34.010
- [Harriet] Yes.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:38.520
- And what were you doing after
you graduated from college

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.417
beyond going to these--

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:43.590
- Well at that point
- [Harry] Places?

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.086
- My first husband was a
foreign service officer.

00:07:46.086 --> 00:07:46.919
- [Harry] I see.

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:50.680
- So after two years in Washington,

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.480
we moved and I spent two years in Korea,

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.600
and I immediately went
to try to find work.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.760
And I taught English and creative writing

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.633
at Ewha Womens University.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.080
- Which is in Korea?

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.620
- Yes, South Korea.
- [Harry] Right.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.060
- Yes, in Seoul.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.450
- [ Harry] So you were
building up quite a portfolio

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.290
at a very young age.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:14.123
- Right.

00:08:14.123 --> 00:08:15.750
- Did you learn Korean then?

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.060
- Oh yes.
- [Harry] Some Korean.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.950
- I did, yes, I worked at it very hard.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:23.810
I hate being in a place where
I don't know what's going on.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.930
I can't, you know.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:28.960
- And Korea must have been
a very different place

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:29.793
back then.
- [Harriet] Primitive.

00:08:29.793 --> 00:08:32.273
Cause there was still a dictatorship.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.970
- Actually, Syngman Rhee had just fled

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:42.970
to Hawaii when I arrived,
and they were thrilled

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.990
with their newfound freedom.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:52.440
And I did get a job at the Korea Times,

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.670
which was their English language paper,

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.740
and I corrected their English.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:02.260
- And, but the economic
miracle had not occurred then.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:06.550
- No, no, they were just
beginning to get off their feet

00:09:07.732 --> 00:09:08.923
and beginning to build.

00:09:10.813 --> 00:09:14.840
- I'm curious, what your
conclusion then and now is

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.320
about what the skills required

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:23.220
for being an education abroad student.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.200
Obviously language.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.600
- But you also have to have an open mind.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.780
The open mind is equally as
important as the language.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:37.780
Because, perhaps it's not
quite so different now

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:43.150
because we are, you know,
communication is so extraordinary.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.020
I'll never forget one of
the first conversations

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:52.020
I had in the school in Bogota
when I was able to converse.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.150
They asked me why I didn't do this

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.110
at the beginning of every class.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.110
And I said because I'm not a
Catholic, I'm a Protestant,

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:04.377
and they looked at me, and they said,

00:10:04.377 --> 00:10:07.200
"Oh, do you believe in God?"

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.323
You know, the ignorance on
both sides was just enormous.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:17.170
- So, at one level being
abroad for the first time

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:19.500
is disorienting.
- [Harriet] True.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:24.090
- And so it requires navigation

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.090
- [Harriet] Correct.
- of your environment.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:31.090
And I guess, I'm curious
about the emotional side.

00:10:33.207 --> 00:10:35.971
In the beginning, you're
intimidated, I guess.

00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:38.283
You're taken aback.

00:10:39.662 --> 00:10:44.000
But then as you learn to
respect what you're seeing.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.150
Does that--
- That does change.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.983
- [Harry] You evolve.
- Completely.

00:10:46.983 --> 00:10:48.520
- [Harry] You evolve.
- Yes.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:53.520
I think maybe intimidated,
is a little strong.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:11:00.340
I think you realize that you
have to watch what you say

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.830
because it could be so
easily misinterpreted.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.320
And you're trying to make connections,

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.300
and so you're asking more questions.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.180
- Cautious, cautious.
- [Harriet] Yes.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.630
You're very cautious
- Cautious.

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:12.300
- Exactly.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:17.300
- And is it by getting to
know people, making friends,

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:23.300
interacting both socially and
whatever you're doing there

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:27.600
that you find their humanity?

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.340
- You find their humanity.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.600
- [Harry] And your own I guess.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.240
- And your own, and you
find that their differences

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.713
are not threatening,
but simply differences.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:43.540
- And so, what, is it better to come

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.280
with the language skills, or

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.130
when you're immersed in a society,

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:50.280
can you just pick that up?

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:55.200
- I think you have to have a
modicum of language skills.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.450
I think you have to
have a way of, at least

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:03.280
stumbling through
introductions and connections.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.873
Because otherwise what
are you, just a post.

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:11.710
- And in the case of, while
you were young in Bogota,

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.570
you were a little older
in the Soviet Union.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.310
In both cases, had you been exposed

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:20.969
to the history or the culture.

00:12:20.969 --> 00:12:23.180
- I exposed myself.
- [Harry] Before you got--

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:24.150
- Yes.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.870
- [Harry] But before you actually went?

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.490
- Yes, yes.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.580
- And was there a lotta difference

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.370
from what you read in the books

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.870
to what you were experiencing?

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.100
- Not that much, the
books were pretty good

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.790
about describing what society was like,

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:46.370
and what their modes of living were.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:49.670
- What about the temperament of a person

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:53.323
who aspires to be a
foreign exchange student,

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:55.680
both then and now?

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.480
I guess now it's easier.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.570
- Much easier.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:02.657
- But when you were doing
it, this foreign territory,

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:03.940
was really foreign territory.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:07.130
- [Harriet] It was totally
foreign, it was totally foreign.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:09.930
- So what is required?

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.040
- [Harriet] An open mind.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:11.873
- Open mind.

00:13:11.873 --> 00:13:16.840
- And a willingness to ask
all kinds of questions.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:21.510
And a willingness to give of yourself,

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:25.670
and realize that sometimes
you might be misunderstood.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.150
But that's what it is, a misunderstanding.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.100
It's not hostility.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:35.100
- But, so then, in your
time, it was about courage.

00:13:37.022 --> 00:13:37.913
Courage, is that the right word?

00:13:37.913 --> 00:13:39.450
- I guess that's a good word.

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:40.283
- [Harry] Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:13:40.283 --> 00:13:43.790
- [Harry] Patience?
- Patience was essential.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.870
Of yourself as well as others.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:50.100
- Right, and did you then
experience a lot of frustration?

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.230
- Of course, yes.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:56.193
- Now, to what extent do you think,

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.070
now we'll talk about
foreign exchange generally

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:05.070
in a minute but, do you think
from your own experience,

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:08.940
it would have made you
a better negotiator?

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.780
Because people are always talking about

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:15.040
knowing your adversary, or
knowing the person you have,

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.230
do you agree with that,
based on that experience?

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:19.480
- Yes, I think so.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:24.480
And not only patience but a
large amount of understanding

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.210
because a lot of the
hostility of people who come

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:34.400
from foreign lands is
simply they don't understand

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.320
where they're coming from.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.530
- Now when you went, you were American.

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:40.363
- [Harriet] Oh, Yes.

00:14:40.363 --> 00:14:42.970
- America was all-powerful.

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:43.803
- [Harriet] Yes.
- In the world.

00:14:43.803 --> 00:14:47.020
How did that, do you think in retrospect,

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:50.100
impacted the way you were received?

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.210
In other words, did, I guess in a way,

00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.480
discovering your humanity for the other

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.340
made it a step toward better understanding

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.350
in the United States, a little step.

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:11.287
- I think that when, when we got talking

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:19.730
and they realized that I
really did know something

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:23.410
and respected their society, then I became

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:26.750
a human being rather than an American.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.973
And that made a huge difference.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:33.038
- And would they, they would ask you,

00:15:33.038 --> 00:15:35.550
you used the example
of the apartment house

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.140
in Time Magazine.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.340
So there must have been
a stream of questions.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.173
- Definitely.

00:15:41.173 --> 00:15:43.340
- [Harry] Coming at you about movies,

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.020
about restaurants.
- Yes.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.202
- [Harry] About all sorts of things.

00:15:46.202 --> 00:15:51.202
- Yes, yes, and I welcomed
them because, you know,

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.590
and admitted, you know, our shortcomings,

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:00.060
which, Lord knows, we had then

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.613
and every country still does.

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.880
- And, of course now,
a student goes abroad,

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:12.880
and they can Skype their family back home.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:18.640
They can use a computer and
use face time and so on.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.230
But that was a very different world.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.240
You were there, and you were there.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.073
- [Harriet] That's correct.

00:16:23.073 --> 00:16:24.750
- So was it all letter writing back home?

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.280
- It was all letter writing.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.010
There was nothing else,
I mean computers, no.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:31.793
They didn't operate that way.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:37.400
So we'd always add lag time (chuckles)

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:42.400
- Now, later in life, you married
Senator William Fulbright.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:43.953
- [Harriet] That's right.

00:16:43.953 --> 00:16:47.363
- And let's talk about him,

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:54.210
as a political leader, a
distinguished statesman,

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.890
before we talk about his political and--

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:58.723
- [Harriet] Okay.

00:16:58.723 --> 00:17:02.500
- Talk a little about him
as a personality because

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:09.480
he's obviously a very
important historical figure

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:13.570
in the consciousness and
the history of this country.

00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:15.620
- He was an amazing human being.

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:19.030
And I met him because of the
fact that two friends of mine

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:22.140
knew that I had just
come off an important job

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.167
at the National Gallery, and they said,

00:17:25.167 --> 00:17:27.977
"This is going to be
really different, Harriet,

00:17:27.977 --> 00:17:30.477
"but it's equally important.

00:17:30.477 --> 00:17:34.007
"We want you to start
an alumni association

00:17:34.007 --> 00:17:35.910
"for the Fulbright Program."

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:40.840
And it was a huge job because, you know,

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.300
there were records, thousands of records

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.710
that I had to gather from
separate colleges and so forth.

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:51.710
But it was an idea whose time
was really, had really come.

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.910
People welcomed it, and so,

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:59.840
my job was trying to keep up with

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:04.350
the enthusiastic responses
that were coming in.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.770
- And this is how you
met Senator Fulbright?

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:07.790
- Of course.
- [Harry] Right.

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:12.240
- And he was so pleased
that this was happening.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:17.240
- And was he a, he obviously was a very,

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:22.780
he was both a political
leader, a statesman,

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.910
but he was also something
of an intellectual.

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:26.860
- He was a tremendous intellectual.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.490
He'd had a Rhodes Scholarship.

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:32.450
He'd spent at least two years in England.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:36.220
And the Rhodes set up these tutorials.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.760
He was working with one
particular professor, McCallum,

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.460
at Oxford, and it was intense.

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:47.530
He told me it was the most intense

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:50.420
educational experience that he'd ever had.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:55.030
- And so he was born
and raised in Arkansas,

00:18:55.030 --> 00:19:00.030
and then he, as a young
man, was a Rhodes Scholar.

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.270
This would have been in the '30s?

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:07.000
- That's right, Yes.
- [Harry] Yeah, yeah.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
- And he traveled, obviously,
by train to New York City,

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:16.130
in order to catch a boat,

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.930
and New York shocked him to the core.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.150
He never got over that (laughs).

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:25.540
- Because he was from--
- [Harriet] Fayetteville.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:26.870
- Yeah, so
(Harriet laughing)

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:28.430
- I was looking for the word.

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:31.531
So he had been raised
in a provincial setting.

00:19:31.531 --> 00:19:35.650
- Definitely, I mean,
the houses in his city

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:38.600
at that time were two stories, you know?

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.433
- [Harry] Right.

00:19:39.433 --> 00:19:43.520
- And there he arrived at
this extraordinary city,

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:48.520
that was full of noise and
rushing and eight million people.

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:50.320
- And do you know how he happened to apply

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.660
for the Rhodes--

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.950
- Yes, it was in his senior year.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:55.290
He was a very good student.

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:57.250
- And he was a student at
the University of Arkansas?

00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:00.807
- Arkansas, and his English
professor came and said,

00:20:00.807 --> 00:20:02.931
"What are you gonna do when you leave?"

00:20:02.931 --> 00:20:04.770
"Well, I don't know."

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:08.420
And so he said, "You should
apply for a Rhodes Scholarship."

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:09.647
And he looked into it and he said,

00:20:09.647 --> 00:20:10.950
"Well, that's interesting."

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:12.700
And he talked to his
family and they thought

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:13.900
it was a wonderful idea.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.973
He had a wonderful mother,
especially his father died early.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.363
And, so he applied and he got it.

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:26.410
- And so, and then when he
came, he came back to Arkansas.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.700
- Yes.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:30.533
- [Harry] Let me ask you this--

00:20:30.533 --> 00:20:31.930
- But it was a hiatus.

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:35.350
He came back and landed in Washington.

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:36.183
- [Harry] I see.

00:20:36.183 --> 00:20:39.760
- And he met a very attractive young lady

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.290
and decided he wanted to
spend a little time here.

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:47.290
So he applied for a job,
and became a professor there

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:50.957
for a couple of years before going back.

00:20:50.957 --> 00:20:52.560
- And his field was history?

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.940
Or Government?

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.210
- It's constitutional law.

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:56.360
- Constitutional law.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:00.850
So did he get the law
degree as a Rhodes Scholar?

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.610
Or did he come back and do that?

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:05.860
- Came back and did that in Washington.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.730
- [Harry] I see, and where did he do that?

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:08.620
- George Washington University.

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:10.460
- [Harry] George Washington
University, okay.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.621
- That's where he got his law degree.

00:21:11.621 --> 00:21:15.310
- So, and, but then he
went back to Arkansas.

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:16.143
- [Harriet] Yes, he did.

00:21:16.143 --> 00:21:16.976
- And became--

00:21:16.976 --> 00:21:18.648
- A professor.
- [Harry] President of the--

00:21:18.648 --> 00:21:22.630
- But first a professor,
and then president.

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:27.360
- Right, and was that for two years.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.193
- [Harriet] Yes.

00:21:28.193 --> 00:21:31.910
- And then he ran for
the Senate, was that--

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:36.910
- No, he ran for an
office in the legislature.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
He actually had a former
student of his come to him

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:46.810
who was the representative for Arkansas,

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:48.720
for that district in Arkansas,

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.157
and he said to Fulbright,

00:21:51.157 --> 00:21:56.037
"You always told us that
democracy won't work

00:21:56.037 --> 00:21:58.497
"unless the best and the
brightest run for office.

00:21:58.497 --> 00:22:02.917
"Now I'm gonna make you put
your money where your mouth is.

00:22:02.917 --> 00:22:05.477
"You are gonna have to take my office,

00:22:05.477 --> 00:22:08.487
"or run for my office,
because I'm leaving it

00:22:08.487 --> 00:22:09.940
"at the end of this term."

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.880
And he thought about it, and
he went to his wife Betty,

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.870
and they agreed, and he ran for it

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:18.930
and he got the office as a legislator.

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:20.147
Within a year--

00:22:20.147 --> 00:22:21.990
- And that is to the National Congress?

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:23.440
- To the National Congress.
- [Harry] Right.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.460
- He was in the House of Representatives.

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:30.460
And within a year, the Senate,

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:35.450
one of the two Senate
offices was about to open

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:37.970
because the senator said
he was not going to run

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:39.770
in the next election.

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:44.230
And immediately a man that
Fulbright had no respect for

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:47.670
said he was going to run
for that Senate seat.

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:49.127
He thought, "I can't let that happen.

00:22:49.127 --> 00:22:50.900
"I can't work under that man."

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.740
So he ran for the Senate
seat and he got it.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.590
So he was only for one year in the House.

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:59.430
- Now, we're gonna talk
about his contribution

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:01.960
to international education.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:06.320
But I think I wanna first start with his

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:11.090
role as a visionary with
regard to US foreign policy

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.010
and America's role in the world.

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:16.280
We'll get to the international
education part in a moment.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:21.280
So, his situation was
complicated in the sense

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:25.570
that he came from a southern state,

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:29.920
and to get re-elected, he
was not in the forefront

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.296
on civil rights.

00:23:31.296 --> 00:23:34.460
- (laughs) He had to
stay in the background,

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.650
or he wouldn't have been re-elected.

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:38.440
Back then that was the case.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.283
- And so his personal views
must have been very different

00:23:41.283 --> 00:23:44.620
from what he had to do as a politician.

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:47.180
Now he ultimately becomes chairman

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:49.079
of the foreign relations committee.

00:23:49.079 --> 00:23:54.079
And his expertise is really
on international relations,

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.251
and that's really where--

00:23:55.251 --> 00:23:56.151
- Exactly correct.

00:23:56.151 --> 00:23:58.453
- He made his mark.

00:23:59.384 --> 00:24:00.533
His vision,

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:08.030
His vision was one in which
he saw that America and the US

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:14.730
had to restrain itself,
because it had so much power.

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:18.840
- Had to restrain itself
in terms of the power part.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.400
But had to reach out a great deal

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.230
in terms of international relations.

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:28.610
Because this was, this is a huge country

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:30.970
with water on two sides.

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:34.330
And so it's not as if
you're living in Europe

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:36.143
and saying, oh yes, you know,

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:39.570
if it's Tuesday this must be Belgium,

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:41.730
and next I'm gonna drive four hours

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:43.630
and be in another country.

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:47.213
And the mentality is hugely different.

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:53.210
- And his, did he ever talk to you about

00:24:54.272 --> 00:24:59.160
his role with regard to opposing
the Vietnam war and those--

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.943
- Oh, it killed him, yes.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:05.380
- And when you say killed
him, in what sense?

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.250
'Cause he was so frustrated?

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:08.110
- Yes.

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:09.608
- [Harry] That in other words his vision.

00:25:09.608 --> 00:25:10.441
- Yes.

00:25:10.441 --> 00:25:12.820
- Told him that this
was all wrong and so on.

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.410
- [Harriet] That's right, that's correct.

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:19.970
- And did he,

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:22.080
he kept at it and he,

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:27.080
the Fulbright hearings
of course are one of the,

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:30.380
it's really where the establishment

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:34.900
embraces the consciousness
of the people in the street

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.090
who are opposing the war.

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:39.510
- And he had to do that so, so carefully.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:41.860
- Yeah, in what sense, I mean--

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:46.860
- Well, in the sense that he
couldn't come blasting out

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:51.580
with, you know, criticisms and feelings

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.450
of what we really should be doing.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:55.180
He had to do it by questioning.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:58.310
He had to do it by
holding infinite hearings

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:03.460
in the Senate, and bringing young people,

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.333
John Kerry being one of them,

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:11.180
to talk about, you know, views on--

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:15.630
- So in other words, he was very conscious

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:18.010
of the need for a discovery process.

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:19.357
- [Harriet] Correct, correct, yes.

00:26:19.357 --> 00:26:23.390
- And so through questioning and so on,

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:27.229
I guess his Oxford education
must have really helped him.

00:26:27.229 --> 00:26:28.280
- Tremendous.
- [Harry] Yeah.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.980
- I don't think he could
have done that without it.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:34.353
- Now did that affect
him at home in Arkansas?

00:26:35.496 --> 00:26:38.533
Was Arkansas such a provincial place that,

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:45.150
in a way, this public vision
for America's global role

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.690
had a negative impact in Arkansas?

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:53.740
- It had an initial negative impact,

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:57.803
but again, he was always
reaching out to his own state.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.260
And I'll never forget a
letter that he received

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:08.417
fairly far into the process which said,

00:27:08.417 --> 00:27:09.953
"I never voted for you.

00:27:09.953 --> 00:27:14.953
'I'd never lost an
opportunity to denigrate you.

00:27:15.717 --> 00:27:20.220
"But, I'm slowly beginning to realize

00:27:21.317 --> 00:27:25.107
"the real profound understanding you have

00:27:25.107 --> 00:27:27.180
"and the rightness of your position."

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:31.653
And he said, "Make no mistake, my friend.

00:27:32.617 --> 00:27:37.617
"When we all meet our
maker and others come

00:27:37.697 --> 00:27:39.557
"and we'll be standing our shoulders,

00:27:39.557 --> 00:27:41.537
"the person standing on your shoulders

00:27:41.537 --> 00:27:43.610
"will be a little higher than others."

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:46.113
And I thought that was a beautiful letter.

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:51.400
- As a Fulbright ambassador,
later in your career,

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.860
you had the opportunity to visit Vietnam.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:00.760
Not with the senator, but
talk about that experience

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:05.813
and the recognition you were given.

00:28:07.692 --> 00:28:09.970
- And I hasten to add I was an unofficial,

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:12.990
I didn't have that title, but I was

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:14.820
an unofficial ambassador, you might say.

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.820
And it was an extraordinary experience

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:19.870
because I was greeted with open arms

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:22.060
because of the senator's work.

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:25.370
And I went to classrooms and spoke to them

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:26.650
and got wonderful.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:30.760
But at one point I was
sitting with a group

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:34.200
describing certain things, and suddenly

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:39.200
down the steps came this
little, very energetic man

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:43.480
and he sat next to me and
he grabbed my shoulders

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:46.557
and he kissed me on both
cheeks, and he said,

00:28:46.557 --> 00:28:49.247
"Senator Fulbright, he was the only one

00:28:49.247 --> 00:28:52.740
"who understood the Vietnamese people."

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.553
And it was General Giap.

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:57.862
- Who was the architect of the Vietnam--

00:28:57.862 --> 00:28:58.695
- [Harriet] Exactly.

00:28:58.695 --> 00:28:59.840
- War on the Vietnamese side.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.090
- [Harriet] Exactly.

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:01.923
- Yes.

00:29:01.923 --> 00:29:03.510
- [Harry] That must have been a moving--

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:05.300
- It was amazing.
- Experience.

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.420
And he just recently passed away.

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:08.910
- Yes, he did, yes he did.

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:10.773
He was an extraordinary man.

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:14.633
- Back to the Congress,

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:20.140
this courageous stand by Senator Fulbright

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.980
really affected his relationship
with President Johnson,

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:27.300
who I think he had been close
to in an earlier period.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.133
- [Harriet] Yes.

00:29:28.133 --> 00:29:32.637
- And actually sponsored the
Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:34.943
- [Harriet] Right.

00:29:34.943 --> 00:29:37.670
- But then he came to realize that he

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:39.400
had been had by the president.

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.920
- That's correct, yes.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.910
- [Harry] So their relation soured then.

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:44.690
- It very much soured, yes.

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:47.150
- And what about his fellow congressmen?

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:50.370
I mean, was this an educational process

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:52.470
for his fellow Senators, also?

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:54.900
- Some of them, yes, and some of them

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:58.280
spoke to him privately, but publicly they,

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:01.720
they had to keep their
distance, that's very true.

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:06.080
- So what were, when you would talk

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.900
to Senator Fulbright about this,

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:12.900
what was his overall lesson
learned from that experience?

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:16.580
- Lesson for himself?

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.280
- [Harry] Yeah, for himself, yeah.

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:24.320
- It was, I think a
lesson that he basically,

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.580
deep down understood
even before, you know,

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:30.890
it was happening, but it was

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:35.890
just that people have to,

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:42.280
people have to understand
changes in the world

00:30:43.798 --> 00:30:48.798
in a very slow, deliberative
and educational way.

00:30:48.904 --> 00:30:51.560
You can't suddenly have an epiphany

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.883
and expect other people to follow.

00:30:54.809 --> 00:30:59.809
- Now the other vision that
Fulbright brought to the table

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:05.410
came from his Rhodes Scholar experience.

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:08.243
That is, he came to see the importance.

00:31:09.831 --> 00:31:10.664
On the one end--
- Yes.

00:31:10.664 --> 00:31:12.418
- He saw the military power wasn't

00:31:12.418 --> 00:31:15.523
the end all and be all,
but on the other hand,

00:31:17.607 --> 00:31:21.160
what we now call soft power,
international education

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:25.850
was an instrument for
enhancing America's power

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:27.160
and changing the world.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.600
- That is correct, and
during the second world war,

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.763
toward the end of the second world war,

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:36.370
he was in Congress by that time,

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:39.827
and he said, he stopped and he thought,

00:31:39.827 --> 00:31:42.447
"Why are we in a world war

00:31:42.447 --> 00:31:45.227
"within two generations of the first?

00:31:45.227 --> 00:31:48.760
"This is insanity, this
is self-destruction."

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.190
And in deeply thinking about it,

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:57.140
and through his experiences
as Rhodes Scholar

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:01.200
and world traveler, he
realized it has to do

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.410
with basic misunderstanding
and lack of knowledge

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:08.137
of other people, and
how do we overcome that?

00:32:08.137 --> 00:32:11.700
And that was his legislation creating

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.610
the Fulbright scholarship,
that's why it happened.

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:16.155
- And this was very early.

00:32:16.155 --> 00:32:16.988
- [Harriet] Oh, yes.

00:32:16.988 --> 00:32:18.977
- This would have been in the 40s?

00:32:18.977 --> 00:32:20.480
- [Harriet] - '46 was when the--

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.760
- So he was in Congress?

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:25.240
- Yes, he was, and '46 was when the first

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:31.770
legislation was signed to
establish this scholarship

00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:36.250
and he, he was a very wiley politician,

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:41.050
because that piece of legislation
had no money attached.

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:42.920
And so,
(both laugh)

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.300
when it went through people looked,

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:48.861
other Congressmen looked,
no money, oh who cares.

00:32:48.861 --> 00:32:51.270
And so immediately it passed.

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:54.400
Then he said, "How am
I going to pay for it?"

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:58.780
And a few months later
coming across his desk

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:03.020
was a piece of legislation allowing for,

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.420
or actually promoting the sale of

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:10.160
all the amazing amounts
of, not just munitions,

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:13.020
but jeeps and medical
supplies, etc., etc.,

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:16.083
that were lying all over the
world where we were fighting.

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:21.190
And it was, we were going to sell it

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:23.633
to the country where it lay.

00:33:25.522 --> 00:33:27.010
And he thought, "I've got it."

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:29.300
And at the bottom of that
piece of legislation,

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:33.167
he wrote, "These funds shall be limited

00:33:33.167 --> 00:33:38.167
"to the underwriting of
the international education

00:33:38.837 --> 00:33:40.230
"exchange program."

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:44.410
And that was the beginning
of how we paid for it.

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:49.410
- So it's a case where, in one sense,

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.720
people didn't know what
he was doing (chuckles).

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.306
- No, and he was very happy (laughs).

00:33:54.306 --> 00:33:58.670
- So it was kind of
under the table, covert,

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:00.563
whatever the word is.

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:05.220
- So true, and six months after that,

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.780
you know after that passed
and it was all in place

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:10.080
and there was nothing that
could be done to change it

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.920
without really uproar,
a senator came to him

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.147
and shook his finger in
his face and he said,

00:34:16.147 --> 00:34:19.577
"Young man, if I had
known what you were up to

00:34:19.577 --> 00:34:22.507
"I would have put it so fast to stop.

00:34:22.507 --> 00:34:26.047
"Don't you realize how horrible it is

00:34:26.047 --> 00:34:29.037
"to expose our fine young boys and girls

00:34:29.037 --> 00:34:32.577
"to those dangerous foreign isms."

00:34:34.864 --> 00:34:37.680
- And was the original conception

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.660
sending American abroad, Americans abroad?

00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:41.493
- That's right, Fulbright.

00:34:41.493 --> 00:34:44.590
- But not yet bringing foreigners here.

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:45.870
- That's correct.
- [Harry] Right.

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:48.510
- That came when everybody realized

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:51.003
what the tremendous benefit it was.

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:57.840
- Fulbright's idea was that,

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:02.840
if you go abroad, and you
experience these cultures,

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:08.830
that, on the one hand, the
other country's citizen

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:15.710
will gain a kind of respect and affection

00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:18.676
for America and American mores,

00:35:18.676 --> 00:35:23.390
and on the other hand, the American will

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:25.050
learn about the foreign country

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:26.830
and come back as a teacher or--

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:31.150
- Yes, and realize that the
differences are not evil

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:36.150
or wrong, they're differences.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.900
And that we can live with them.

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.330
And as a matter of fact,
if we do live with them,

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:44.563
we become better people.

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:50.220
- And so how many years
has the Fulbright program

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:51.740
been in existence?

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:54.967
- Well the first legislation
was signed in '46.

00:35:54.967 --> 00:35:58.520
- And the first Fellows were in '47?

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:03.520
- In '48, the first Fellows
went in both directions,

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:06.313
to the east and to the west.

00:36:10.563 --> 00:36:13.820
- Was it only academics and professors?

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:15.610
- At that time.
- At that time.

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:18.420
And from all disciplines?
- [Harriet] Yes.

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:19.800
- From all disciplines.
- [Harriet] Yes.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.200
- And then when did the
program evolve into one

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.103
that would bring foreigners here?

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:31.540
- That actually was a few years later

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.550
when other countries realized

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:36.850
what a tremendous benefit it was

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:41.850
and they began to offer to
contribute to the program

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:44.290
in their country.

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:47.810
And I think by this
time it's something like

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:50.560
14 different countries actually contribute

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:54.240
more than half the funds necessary

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:57.890
for the Fulbright
program in their country.

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:00.450
- And you mentioned earlier that

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:03.370
when you became involved
with the Fulbright program,

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:07.010
it was, part of your job was building

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:11.920
a historical record of all of the Fellows.

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:15.240
- First the Americans.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.870
- What were the numbers like, I mean,

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:21.590
over the years,
approximately how many people

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:24.100
have participated in this program.

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:27.190
- Oh Lord, when I was doing
it, which was years ago,

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:30.450
it was over 300,000, so
obviously the number,

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:34.100
I haven't kept up with the exact figures.

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:37.310
But it's probably more than
half a million by this time

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:42.310
- Right, and presumably the
sale of the military goods

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:44.690
expired,
- [Harriet] Oh yes.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:46.600
- Sometime shortly that--

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.990
- They expired about seven or eight years,

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:51.030
six, seven, eight years after that.

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:54.200
- Right, and at that
point, was the Congress

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.333
willing to fund it?

00:37:55.333 --> 00:37:57.950
- Yes, yes, by that time
they really understood

00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:59.580
what the benefits were.

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:04.480
- So this became an instrument
of American soft power--

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.313
- [Harriet] Correct.

00:38:05.313 --> 00:38:06.640
- At the height of the
cold war, cause this--

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.473
- [Harriet] Correct.

00:38:07.473 --> 00:38:09.843
- Really started before the cold war,

00:38:13.037 --> 00:38:14.870
at the very beginning.

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:25.433
What did Fulbright see as
his greatest achievement?

00:38:27.031 --> 00:38:30.440
Both the foreign policy vision that he

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:32.950
brought to the table, and this?

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:35.520
Or was this his favorite child?

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.370
- I think this was his favorite child.

00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:39.610
Yes, it really was.

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:43.264
- Did he often meet with the
Fulbright Fellows themselves?

00:38:43.264 --> 00:38:47.500
- Yeah, he did, and he
loved sitting around

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:48.463
a table with them.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.960
That was a real pleasure because

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.920
he got real conversation from them.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.913
- Now in the Clinton administration,

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:04.980
you were the chairman of the arts council.

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:08.070
- It was the arts and
humanities, yes it was the--

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:11.220
- And in that program the goal was

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:16.220
to bring private foundations
and the private sector

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:21.200
together with government
to support the arts

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.110
and the humanities.

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:25.700
- When I was there it was strictly

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.440
through the United States.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:31.890
I talked about an international,

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:35.380
but I was too busy trying to (chuckles)

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:37.970
get the United States.

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:39.720
I just talked about it.

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.900
Subsequently, they not
only talked about it,

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.803
they did begin to spread
their wings abroad.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:53.410
- To what extent has that knowledge

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:55.230
been applied to the Fulbright.

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:58.210
In other words, is there private support

00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:02.380
in the United States for
Fulbright fellowships.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:06.000
Or is the only source of new funding

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.410
the countries themselves?

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:09.560
- No, there is some private, especially

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.720
through colleges and universities

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:16.630
who understand what, what a
tremendous benefit it is, yes.

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:21.630
- Now, the world that, which you were

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:26.560
a foreign exchange student, and the world

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.830
where Fulbright's vision was founded

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:34.830
is a different world than
the world that we have today.

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:37.083
- [Harriet] Totally.

00:40:37.083 --> 00:40:40.210
- On the one hand, there's
a decline of American power,

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:41.973
the rise of the others.

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:45.950
And on the other hand, there is

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:49.820
the diversity that we have on a campus

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:53.653
like Berkeley, and really
now all universities are

00:40:55.310 --> 00:41:00.003
so diverse that often the
Anglo-Saxon population,

00:41:01.303 --> 00:41:03.150
- That's right.
- [Harry] Is a minority.

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:05.180
- [Harry] Among minorities.
- Yes.

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:06.563
- Basically and so on.

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:12.410
Students who go abroad can
Skype, can do face time,

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:15.010
can send emails.

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:20.010
So does this suggest that
the Fulbright program

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.750
has to change, and in what
ways would it have to change?

00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:26.750
- I don't think so, you know.

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:31.750
I think that, and furthermore
the Fulbright program

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:35.980
started changing from the
time that it was first

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:40.160
instituted because of
the fact that there was

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:44.250
interest and therefore
interest in getting involved

00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:46.653
in it as well from other countries,

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:52.680
and in supporting the program
through their own funding.

00:41:55.184 --> 00:41:58.030
So it's been a constant evolution.

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:01.770
It's not just a sudden change.

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:05.740
- And so do you see any new goals

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:08.010
for international education?

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:12.550
I mean, in other words, is the vision one

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:15.910
that remains resilient?

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:19.000
Or have there been major adaptions

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.090
by the Fulbright program?

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:23.260
- Oh, I think that the adaptions

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:26.510
are not so much on the fundamental level,

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:30.140
but on the addition of, for instance,

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:33.583
disciplines that didn't even
exist when it first began,

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:38.340
exchanges with countries that

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:40.910
also perhaps didn't exist, or certainly

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:43.980
were not part of an
international community.

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:48.160
That's where the constant change comes.

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:51.740
- What does, what happens
to, I assume there's

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.450
still Congressional funding.

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:54.720
- Oh yes.
- Yeah.

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:59.550
So what happens in a
world where the vision

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:07.270
of a faction of a party is
so narrow, so provincial,

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:13.900
that if this faction were
running the State of Arkansas,

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:20.370
back when Senator
Fulbright went to Oxford.

00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:21.800
They wouldn't let him go.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.760
Because in other words,
he would ,(laughing)

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.630
as one of the best and the brightest,

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:29.620
he would be tainted by
what he might experience.

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:32.703
I mean, it's a very different,

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:39.930
I mean it's not the entire
environment in the Congress.

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:41.220
But it--
- Definitely, yeah.

00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:45.770
- A faction that has used its veto power

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:50.770
to, in some distorted way,
impose its vision on the country.

00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:56.660
- But I don't think that
the international education

00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:59.750
is something that they have focused on.

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:01.913
- [Harry] Yet.
- Yet, you're quite right.

00:44:03.363 --> 00:44:05.560
If they do, I'm gonna start getting up

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:07.230
on a soap box (laughs).
- [Harry] Right.

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:12.230
- But it's not, for them,
it's not important enough

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.643
to start trying to block.

00:44:17.481 --> 00:44:20.760
- What would Senator Fulbright
think of all of this?

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:25.760
If he were now on the
one hand, he was aware

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:29.730
of people in his own
district, in his own state

00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:34.410
who basically he couldn't
confront on certain issues.

00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:38.311
But (chuckles) it's almost obvious.

00:44:38.311 --> 00:44:42.110
But is there some particular perspective

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:45.690
that he would bring that,
knowing him so well and so on?

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:49.770
- Well, there's one
little story that I think

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:52.990
I need to tell you because a lot of this

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:57.600
he treated with humor, in trying to.

00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:00.740
And that was he was sitting
with one of his constituents

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:04.600
and they were talking about
the venal and horrible

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:09.600
and Satanic influences of those Commies,

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:13.070
and how awful it was and what we've gotta

00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:14.413
do something about it.

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:19.850
At that point Fulbright looked
at him, and then he got up.

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:21.240
And he said, "Commies?"

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.485
And he started looking
under the furniture.

00:45:23.485 --> 00:45:24.330
(laughing)

00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:27.460
And he said, "Commies, where are they?"

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:29.710
(laughing)

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.600
- It must be very hard

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.900
for somebody like Senator Fulbright,

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:42.663
who's also a politician in some sense,

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:48.773
part of his constituency is,

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:53.410
he's able to see so much more

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:57.804
than the narrowest, most provincial,

00:45:57.804 --> 00:45:58.670
- Um hmm.

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:03.670
- Visionaries in his own,
how did he deal with that?

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:08.700
I mean, is it, you obviously
try to bring them along.

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:11.800
As you said, he tried
to bring along senators

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:15.100
to his vision of the Vietnam war.

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:20.100
But, he must have developed
a remarkable set of skills.

00:46:21.186 --> 00:46:26.170
- I think those skills
were factual material.

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:30.050
Now, when he'd get these barrages at him,

00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:34.027
he'd say, "Now what harm
have they really done?

00:46:34.027 --> 00:46:38.870
"What are they focusing on
that is hitting at our hearts?"

00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:42.250
And then he would describe
the fact that they weren't.

00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:44.980
- That is the Congress.
- Very specifically.

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:47.210
Not just Commies, but other people

00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:48.670
who were trying to--

00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:53.260
- So it's a question of
going back to his role

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:56.894
as an educator, to sort
of focus on the facts.

00:46:56.894 --> 00:47:01.070
What is the reality
versus what are bad ideas

00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:02.870
about the reality?
- [Harriet] Yes.

00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:06.470
- And he tried to do it gently.

00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:11.470
He was never a proponent
of hitting a person

00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:15.560
square in the face.

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:17.520
- So he lived his educational philosophy.

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:19.047
- Yes he did, yes he really did.

00:47:19.047 --> 00:47:21.890
- Now he, President Clinton awarded him

00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:23.580
the medal of freedom.

00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:24.430
- [Harriet] That's correct.

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:28.510
- And this must have
been a moving occasion.

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:33.510
- Oh amazing, yes obviously I
attended and it was amazing,

00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:37.180
and it was very emotional
for both of them.

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:39.560
- Now, and Clinton had
worked for him, right,

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:41.739
in his office and his (mumbles) office.

00:47:41.739 --> 00:47:42.572
- That's correct.

00:47:42.572 --> 00:47:44.300
- [Harry] And they didn't agree
about everything back then.

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:48.460
- It was so funny, they didn't.

00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:51.833
But he was, he would do whatever he could,

00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:56.520
not only to help in the
offices, but to be close to him.

00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:00.850
And so he immediately
offered to be his driver.

00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:04.100
And he would drive him
to his various meetings

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:07.823
around the city, or, if it was here.

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:12.170
And he would talk as he was driving.

00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:14.730
And I remember one time Bill smiling

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:18.317
and talking about one time when he said,

00:48:18.317 --> 00:48:21.547
"Young man, you might be
really good at politics,

00:48:21.547 --> 00:48:23.017
"but you are a lousy driver.

00:48:23.017 --> 00:48:26.267
"Do you realize the sun is
on the wrong side of this car

00:48:26.267 --> 00:48:27.491
"for where we're going?"

00:48:27.491 --> 00:48:29.700
(laughing)

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:32.830
- So Clinton was already politicking.

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:34.058
- Oh he was.
- [Harry] Yeah.

00:48:34.058 --> 00:48:35.190
- Oh he was.

00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:37.115
- So climbing up into the light.

00:48:37.115 --> 00:48:40.770
So looking back at your
career, your experiences

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:45.770
with the Fulbright program,
what advice would you

00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:49.820
give students as they're
preparing for their future?

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:53.300
- I would say that an
international experience

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:55.493
is more important than ever.

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:03.670
Also higher education is
more important than ever.

00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:08.670
So nowadays, a BA is more and more often

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:14.613
not the last degree that you
need, it is a higher one.

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:21.210
- What do you see as
the inspirational story

00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:24.673
of Senator Fulbright that
they should be aware of?

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:28.020
- That's a really interesting question,

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:30.770
'cause there are so many stories (laughs).

00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:33.530
- But the big picture, account of him.

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:37.871
I mean, it's about courage and knowledge

00:49:37.871 --> 00:49:40.450
and fighting the good fight.

00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:42.820
- Fighting the good fight without,

00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:47.820
without fight-ing, but educating.

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:51.400
- That's important.

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:52.730
- Yes.

00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:54.833
- And that's what he was trying
to do in the Vietnam era.

00:49:54.833 --> 00:49:56.740
- That's exactly correct, yes.

00:49:56.740 --> 00:50:01.740
- Well, Mrs. Fulbright, I
wanna thank you very much

00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:06.409
for coming on our program, and for being

00:50:06.409 --> 00:50:10.893
the first harver, Harv-est lecturer,

00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:13.770
for distinguished women.

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:16.080
- I can't thank you enough for having me.

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.510
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:20.853
for this Conversation With History.

00:50:22.093 --> 00:50:25.010
(gentle fun music)
