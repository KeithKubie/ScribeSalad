LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to the Googleplex.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.170
This is an incredible place
with lots of great stuff being

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.960
worked on every single day.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.950
Before I worked here,
I always wondered

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.240
what it'd be like to
come to the Googleplex,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.680
meet up with a Googler,
have coffee with them

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.220
and just chat about what
they do, how they do it,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.430
and why they do.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.602
And today, we're going
to do exactly that.

00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:24.060
Welcome to "Coffee
with a Googler."

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.940
I'm Laurence Moroney.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.620
And today, I'm really honored
to speak with Timothy Jordan.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.750
And Timothy works with
ubiquitous computing

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:30.490
here at Google.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.130
And it's a really
interesting turn

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.670
of phrase--
ubiquitous computing.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.270
Could you tell us, really,
what does that mean?

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.230
What's it all about?

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.450
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So
it's more complex

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.190
sounding than it
actually is, right?

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.810
Ubiquitous computing is kind of
the combination of wearables,

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.220
and living room, and
Auto, internet of things.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.280
However, I like the term
"ubiquitous computing"

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.470
because we're trying to help
developers be successful

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.880
not just on individual platforms
but across all platforms.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.240
That is to say, maybe
implement a wearable strategy

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.090
with their app but also have
it available on the phones

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.680
so that the user can
use their app wherever

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.744
it makes sense for them.

00:01:04.744 --> 00:01:05.660
LAURENCE MORONEY: Mhm.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.710
Now, the term "ubiquitous" seems
to suggest that the computing

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.710
platform is spreading to
whole new interesting areas

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.570
beyond the phone, beyond
the watch, and maybe Glass.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.449
What kind of things are you
seeing compute happening?

00:01:17.449 --> 00:01:19.240
TIMOTHY JORDAN: The
different form factors.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.380
You mentioned watch, TV,
Google Cast, Android TV.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.920
There's also Android
Auto, and we just

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.200
recently released Beacons,
which we should talk about.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.120
And internet of
things more generally

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.450
is just on the other
side of the horizon.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.000
And this is Brillo
and Weave, which

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.960
we talked about at
Google I/O, which

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.002
enables embedded devices
and all kinds of things.

00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:44.334
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah, I'm
looking forward to my fridge

00:01:44.334 --> 00:01:45.300
being able to compute.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.520
Tell me when the milk goes sour.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.394
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:01:48.394 --> 00:01:51.954
You know, I mean, that's-- those
kinds of examples have been

00:01:51.954 --> 00:01:54.120
the conversation that the
industry has used to drive

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.350
forward like general
thought, and like protocols,

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.550
interoperability, though there
are sort of more practical

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.590
needs that users have today.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.934
It's simple stuff
like I want to be

00:02:05.934 --> 00:02:07.725
able to go running
without taking my phone.

00:02:07.725 --> 00:02:08.080
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.229
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And I'd like
to have that run tracked,

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.850
and I'd like to be able
to listen to music.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.970
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yep.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.620
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And you can do
that today with Android Wear,

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.390
right?

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.565
And that's something
that you ask a user,

00:02:16.565 --> 00:02:18.407
and like, yes,
absolutely I want that.

00:02:18.407 --> 00:02:20.490
And those are things that
we should first address.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.850
The milk thing,
you know, it's hit

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.820
or miss whether
people actually care

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.030
about getting additional
information around it.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.360
LAURENCE MORONEY: I just
changed to black coffee

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.730
because my milk keeps going off.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.352
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
[CHUCKLES] I'm sorry.

00:02:31.352 --> 00:02:33.310
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
you mentioned beacons.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.143
I keep going to bacon
because of the fridge,

00:02:35.143 --> 00:02:36.980
but you mentioned
beacons earlier on.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.260
Tell me like what's
the thing with beacons?

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.610
I mean, what's what makes it
so interesting and special?

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.550
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's a
really good question right?

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.216
Because we've been
talking about beacons

00:02:44.216 --> 00:02:46.360
as an industry for
years, and it's

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.590
this simple idea
of there's a thing

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.939
that has information
associated with it.

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:53.480
However, the
conversation seems to be

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.570
around retail or conferences
almost exclusively.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.290
But it turns out beacons have
a vast number of applications

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.795
centered around the one idea--
beacon are about context.

00:03:03.795 --> 00:03:04.670
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.586
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Right?

00:03:05.586 --> 00:03:09.930
It's the idea that you could
make the user experience better

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.490
by making it more
efficient and yet

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.300
have the same value by
being able to short circuit

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.230
the context.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.496
Traditionally, users have
to tell you where they're at

00:03:17.496 --> 00:03:19.120
or what they're doing
to be able to get

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.290
the information they need.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.560
But with beacons, you
can get that information

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.650
from the environment and then
just take the user directly

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.520
to their value.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.520
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Now you've explained

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.990
a little bit in
some of your videos

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.874
about like a bus stop scenario.

00:03:30.874 --> 00:03:32.540
Could you tell us a
bit more about that?

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.870
How does that work?

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.140
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah, you
can imagine the user gets

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.890
to their bus stop.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.790
Now a bus app today
might mean that they

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.505
have to load up the app and
say OK, I'm at this bus stop.

00:03:42.505 --> 00:03:44.380
Even if it has location,
it's like is the one

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.770
across the street or this one?

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.811
LAURENCE MORONEY: Really
sensitive location, too.

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:48.920
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Right?

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.880
And they have probably
only a few routes

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.650
that they travel
per day, but the app

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.340
doesn't know that
unless they actually

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.790
tell it these are the
routes that I care about.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.330
Well, with beacons,
the app could sense

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.590
which bus stop they're at.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.860
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:01.776
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Right?

00:04:01.776 --> 00:04:05.090
The signal attenuation will
give them very fine information

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.250
on the location, but then
the buses they get on

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.420
could also have beacons.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.190
Beacons don't have
to stay in place.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.990
And that adds
additional context.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.740
So now when they get
to their bus stop,

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.600
there's a notification
waiting for them telling them

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.790
that that route is late, that
they can take the express.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:19.959
LAURENCE MORONEY: Ah cool.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.880
Or maybe the express is
running late so it's better

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.510
to take the local.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.010
Who knows?

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.520
Yeah.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.310
So, OK, cool.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.750
So now when it comes to
developing for beacons,

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.440
there must be so much diversity.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.820
And how do we make sure
that there's a great user

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.170
experience across them all?

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.544
TIMOTHY JORDAN: There's a few
things to pay attention to.

00:04:35.544 --> 00:04:37.000
First off is the beacon format.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.480
Now, this is what we released.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.610
It's called Eddystone.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.950
This is an open flexible
format that's extensible.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.850
And it's really important
for manufacturers

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.266
to know about it
so they can build

00:04:46.266 --> 00:04:47.924
in that compatibility
in their beacons,

00:04:47.924 --> 00:04:49.340
which they've
already done, right?

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.000
There's a lot of hardware
beacons out there today

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.850
that have Eddystone built in.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.770
And it's important
for app developers

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.395
to know about so that when they
acquire beacons and deploy them

00:04:58.395 --> 00:04:59.894
that they can make
sure that they're

00:04:59.894 --> 00:05:01.310
compatible with Eddystone.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.730
Then there's the
Proximity Beacon API,

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.020
and this is where developers
can register their beacons

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.330
and associate data.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.550
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.080
TIMOTHY JORDAN: This
beacon means this thing.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.570
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.280
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And you can
even attach JSON, right?

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.040
Like it's pretty
flexible the data

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.770
that you can associate
with that beacon.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.530
And then finally,
there's the Nearby API,

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.930
and this is what
you use in your app

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.520
to be able to cite and get
data for those beacons.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.350
And it's a subscription thing.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.850
The developer can
just say, hey, I'm

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.391
interested in these
kinds of beacons,

00:05:30.391 --> 00:05:32.890
and then when one of
those beacons is nearby,

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.800
Nearby will inform the app,
giving them the data that's

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.930
associated with it.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:37.210
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.334
Now so there's a lot for
a developer to learn here,

00:05:39.334 --> 00:05:41.557
and I believe you've
recently launched a course--

00:05:41.557 --> 00:05:42.390
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.770
LAURENCE MORONEY:
--for developers

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.405
to learn about
ubiquitous computing.

00:05:44.405 --> 00:05:46.530
TIMOTHY JORDAN: For all
about ubiquitous computing.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.279
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
all about ubiquitous.

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:49.080
I like that phrase.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.180
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
This is on Udacity,

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.390
and it teaches developers
some information

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.265
about ubiquitous computing
in general, right?

00:05:56.265 --> 00:05:59.710
The big ideas that we've
been talking about, but also

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.540
design paradigms and
technical specifics

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.382
on Android Wear, Google Cast,
Android TV, and Android Auto.

00:06:06.382 --> 00:06:07.340
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.500
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So
it's a great place

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.280
if you're already
an Android developer

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.820
and you understand
building for the phone,

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.340
and you want to
get into building

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.090
for some of these other
platforms as well.

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.030
It's a great place to start.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.120
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And like developers

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.490
can just go and access the
materials, all the videos, all

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.570
that kind of thing for free.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.900
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's right.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:22.150
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.539
So it's like--
it's not like it's

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:24.830
going to be an expensive thing.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.230
If you've got time, go learn.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.140
And this is a great new
frontier for developers, right?

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.560
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Yeah, and Udacity

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.750
is a great place for
anybody around the globe

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.480
to start engaging
with this material

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.897
but also we're having an event
this fall in San Francisco.

00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:38.646
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yep,
I heard about this.

00:06:38.646 --> 00:06:39.430
Tell us about it.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.330
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
So we really want

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.290
to have a conversation with
developers and with our friends

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.200
across industry,
across companies

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.580
about ubiquitous computing,
about wearables, living

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.820
room, Auto, about
internet of things, right?

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.760
Because a big
component of this is

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.290
making that service available
anywhere that it makes sense,

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:56.640
right?

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.681
So we really want to talk
about interoperability,

00:06:58.681 --> 00:07:01.040
we might want to talk about
platforms and standards.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.782
And so we're gathering that
conversation together here

00:07:03.782 --> 00:07:04.490
in San Francisco.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.610
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool
I look forward to it.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:07.687
So thank you, Timothy.

00:07:07.687 --> 00:07:08.520
This has been great.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.610
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank you.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:10.700
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So thanks everybody

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.600
for watching this episode
of "Coffee with a Googler,"

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.070
and I hope you
learned a little bit,

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.361
or I hope you learned a lot
about ubiquitous computing.

00:07:16.361 --> 00:07:19.410
And Timothy, it's been
fabulous having you as a guest.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:20.880
Take a look in the
link underneath.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.250
We'll have a link to the
conference or to the summit

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.800
that Timothy had
actually mentioned,

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.334
so that you can
register for that.

00:07:27.334 --> 00:07:29.750
And we'll also put a link down
there to the Udacity course

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.230
so you can go-- you can sign
on, and you can take a look

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.230
at learning how to do
ubiquitous computing

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.170
and develop for the
ubiquitous computing

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.239
platform for yourself.

00:07:37.239 --> 00:07:39.030
If you've any questions
for me or if you've

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.863
any questions for
Timothy, please leave them

00:07:40.863 --> 00:07:41.852
in the comments below.

00:07:41.852 --> 00:07:44.060
And if you want to watch
any more of the great videos

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.976
that we have on the
Google Developers channel,
