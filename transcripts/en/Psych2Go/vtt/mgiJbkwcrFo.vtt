00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.320
Media often depicts jealousy in a very outward manner with demonstrations such as:

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.756
unhealthy obsessions, possessiveness, and inappropriate ways of acting out.

00:00:15.756 --> 00:00:18.920
But, what about jealousy that is subtle and hard to read?

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.720
Introverts, for instance, are naturally more mysterious by nature

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.469
because they tend to internalize their thoughts, and feelings rather than being an open book.

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.039
This makes it hard to tell whether or not an introvert is jealous

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.260
So what are some effective strategies to read them?

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.979
Here are five signs an introvert is jealous.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.069
One: They want to be just like you.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.920
Although having someone copy you might seem flattering initially. There's more to that underneath the surface

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.140
According to psychotherapist Robby Ludwig

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.659
Displaying copycat tendencies is a phase someone goes through to develop their individuality.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.005
However, Ludwig states that

00:00:56.005 --> 00:01:02.540
"If the phase lasts too long then it can be an indicator that the person is missing an essential core of who they are."

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.160
To make up for this emptiness, and lack of strong sense of self

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:12.769
they end up trying to be someone else hoping to fill the void that lies within them.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:20.149
The copycat tendencies she speaks of is more intense than just following a fashion trend, or engaging in activities that are considered culturally hip or cool.

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:25.399
If an introvert is jealous, they are more naturally inclined to internalize the Green Monster.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:32.269
Instead of being outward and upfront about it, they may admire you from afar and copy your work or lifestyle.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.390
Ludwig states that extreme copying reveals the individual's low self-esteem. An inferiority complex.

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.690
Celebrities get copied all the time, because people have a tendency to idolize famous individuals.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.839
Thanks to media portraying their lives as glamorous and exciting.

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.659
But when your friend or co-worker copies you it may feel like a betrayal more than a compliment.

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.568
Two: They give you false praise.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.729
This one is subtle because how can you tell the difference between false praise, and authentic praise?

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.328
Especially if you're dealing with someone who was a master at acting.

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:13.339
Introverts can be naturally passive in their nature, and may not give out compliments that much but when they do they often mean it.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.269
A jealous introvert on the other hand will mean the opposite of what they say if they give you praise.

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.389
To figure out whether they were giving you a true compliment try to hear the subtle differences in their tone as they speak.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.239
Jealous introverts will try to come off as sincere because the last thing they want to do is reveal their true feelings.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.359
According to psychologist Leon Salter,

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:39.268
"Exploitative praisers know exactly how to raise your confidence with the intention of benefiting themselves in the long run."

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.679
"They will be calculating with their compliments and go out of their way to support or validate your viewpoints to win your favor and attention."

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.839
They do this because they want to get in your good side only to use it to help them get ahead in life

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.539
Three: They become competitive

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.480
According to psychologist Melanie Greenberg,

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.800
"People who are generally competitive are either insecure or arrogant and want to prove their superiority."

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.239
If you catch an introvert who isn't typically competitive, but start to notice that they want to compete with you.

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:14.219
Whether it's for that job promotion dream home, or even an ideal relationship.

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.069
Chances are they are jealous of you.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:24.569
They see your life as something that they want for themselves, but instead of just mimicking it they want to be better than you.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.470
Sometimes the competition may not always be so obvious though.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.849
You might not even realize they are competing with you until you notice that everything

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:38.369
you've worked hard for and gained in your life is suddenly being compared back-to-back with their own accomplishments.

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.289
This may be casually slipped in dinner conversations at a social gathering, or big events

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.659
and then you realize they were aiming for an upgrade in their image rather than actually being your friend.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.379
Four: They avoid you when things are going well for you

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:58.499
When you share good news with them instead of celebrating your happiness together, you may find that they retreat.

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:06.209
instead of making a loud scene about their insecurities, jealous introverts can create more distance. and shut down on communication.

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:11.579
If you're in a relationship with a jealous introvert rather than being honest about their feelings

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:18.750
They may quietly sulk when they feel threatened by the successful networking you're doing, or your job promotion that will result in you moving further away.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.639
They'll blow hot and cold with you causing confusion to start with in you.

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:29.699
They do this because it's their way of feeling like they're in control when they refuse to disclose their true feelings with you.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.219
They may also purposely leave you in the dark without providing answers for their lack of engagement.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.640
Because they aren't ready to accept their own jealousy.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.439
In fact, sometimes a jealous introvert may not even be aware that they are jealous

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.210
Especially if they're prone to rationalizing their feelings instead of embracing them.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.710
Five: They try to give you advice that might seem like good ideas

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.580
But in reality only benefit them and make them feel important

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.409
This kind of behavior can be incredibly hurtful once you figure out that they're doing this.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:08.399
It might seem like they're genuinely looking out for you. Especially, if you consider them a best friend who always gives sound advice.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.200
You might have always considered them a shoulder you can lean and cry on in times of trouble.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:20.070
But, then you realize down the road that all the advice they were giving you wasn't even for your own personal growth and well-being

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.320
but a way for them to have the upper hand.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.850
Introverts can generally be great advice givers because they often take the time to observe the world without participating.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.880
They are also more naturally inclined to think things through instead of impulsively acting out.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:42.840
A jealous introvert however, will have different intentions. They want to feel needed by you because it boosts their self-esteem

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:49.770
So they'll give you bad advice that influences you to make a decision that will keep you running back to them for more advice.
