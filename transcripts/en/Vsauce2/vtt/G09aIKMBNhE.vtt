00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.760
Vsauce!

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.760
Kevin here.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.230
At the Metropolitan Museum Of Art in New York
City.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.460
Visited by a record 6.3 million people last
year to look at a rotating collection of over

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.010
1.5 million pieces ranging from Mesopotamian
cylinder seals to King Henry VIII’s personal

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.010
armor.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:28.420
20% of the total collection, 306,353 items
were collected by one person, Jefferson Burdick.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.550
But why would he do that?

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.789
Why do people collect things?

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:40.609
Autographs, Barf bags, Cards, Dolls, Erasers,
Fabergé Eggs, Gum, Hair, Ink, Jokers, Knives,

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:47.269
Lunch boxes, Miniature Chairs, Nails, Oil,
Perfume bottles, Quilts, Rocks, Soap, Toothbrushes,

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:52.110
Umbrella covers, Video Games, Wine labels,
X-men, Yo-Yos, Zippos.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.969
What is a collection?

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.270
Is it just acquiring stuff, or is it a carefully
selected, curated assembly around a particular

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.270
theme?

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.100
Is your memory a collection of thoughts?

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.680
Is living just collecting memories?

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.150
Are your thoughts a collection of you?

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.180
Well, maybe.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.920
But Psychoanalyst Werner Muensterberger defined
a collection as, “the selecting, gathering,

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.820
and keeping of objects of subjective value.”

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.350
For Jefferson R. Burdick, it was cards.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.630
Born in 1900, Burdick grew up with the dawn
of photography and mass-printed illustrations,

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.610
with halftone printing technology allowing
for the reproduction of complex images.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.830
Picture cards were inserted into consumer
products, like pouches of tobacco, to bolster

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.060
brand awareness.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.800
A generation before television beamed moving
pictures into the living room, Burdick and

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.480
his friends were captivated by the brilliantly
colored chromolithographs printed on thin

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.950
cardboard stock . Saying, “Practically every
small boy saved these kinds of cards.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.420
We made our dads use certain brands whether
they liked them or not.”

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.740
The most popular icons to grace product insert
cards came from baseball, a game that took

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.090
the United States by storm in the wake of
the Civil War.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.379
By the 1900’s, America’s cities fielded
teams to play a game that helped unify a divided

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:14.439
country.

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:20.239
From Boston to St. Louis, regional competition
was channeled through sports, and advertisers

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.709
leveraged the popularity of the game and its
stars to promote their products.

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:30.269
In 1889, kids in Boston fought over the Old
Judge Cigarettes picture card of the Boston

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.379
Beaneaters’ Mike “King” Kelly, and in
1909 boys in Pittsburgh watched their fathers

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:40.509
open pouches from the American Tobacco Company
to see if their favorite Pirate -- Honus Wagner

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:41.579
-- would emerge.

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.779
Wagner, who reportedly didn’t want his picture
associated with marketing cigarettes to children,

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:48.629
pulled his card from production.

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:55.170
With fewer than 60 known to exist, one of
them sold at auction in 2013 for $2.1 million.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.079
But during Burdick’s lifetime, all of these
cards were basically worthless, and a 1933

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:07.019
Goudey Babe Ruth that could sell for $250,000
today was not significantly more valuable

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.870
than an 1891 Allen &amp; Ginter Golden-Pencilled
Hamburgh chicken.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.620
In 1961, two years before his death, Burdick
valued that Holy Grail T-206 Wagner card at

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.359
just fifty bucks.

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.249
But wasn’t about the money, it was about
the collection.

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:29.769
He spent a lifetime amassing not only 30,000
baseball cards, but hundreds of thousands

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:37.489
of postcards, tobacco and baker cards ranging
from champion women swimmers to perilous occupations

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.930
and depictions of jokes.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.529
In the developing era of cheap mass-production,
Burdick collected and cataloged virtually

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:51.040
every type of card printed -- centuries before,
the Marind people of South New Guinea were

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.510
collecting human heads.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.480
They believed skulls, along with other objects,
contained a sacred life-force known as mana.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.879
Invisible power capable of soothing insecurity,
anxiety and feelings of vulnerability.

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.700
Mana is the magic that human belief imbues
in objects, whether it’s a religious relic

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.309
embodying the power of a deity, a dreamcatcher
to filter nightmares, or picture cards that

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:18.530
could teleport Jefferson Burdick back to his
youth.

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.570
Humans add meaning to objects and search for
solace, safety and security in them -- which

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.570
might just come with the territory of being
born.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.890
Carl Jung, the founder of analytical psychology,
believed that collecting stems from a collective

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.270
unconscious “nut and berries” behavior
inherited from our hunter/gatherer ancestors.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.610
Father of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud believed
that collecting originates in an infant’s

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.600
trauma associated with bowel control, holding
onto one’s poop then becomes holding onto

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.780
one’s objects.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.330
Werner Muensterberger, the author of “Collecting,
an Unruly Passion,” believed collecting

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.190
to be a relief from the shock and uncertainty
felt when an infant realizes they’re a separate

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.140
entity from their mother.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:07.480
They're alone, and an object helps fill that
void.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.910
Psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott describes a
comfort object as something that substitutes

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.260
the mother-child bond.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.910
Often a physical object like a teddy bear
or security blanket, it’s the first possession

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.790
of the child that’s understood to be not
the mother and not me.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.120
Like thumb sucking replacing the comfort of
breast-feeding, the teddy bear becomes a source

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.520
of emotional security.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.870
Collecting is when this protection becomes
a passion.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.920
But being a collector requires access to and
the availability of objects.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:44.770
Historically, only the elite had access - Bishops
like Abbot Suger collected religious relics

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.330
such as splinters allegedly taken from the
Holy Cross; alchemists during the reign of

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.050
Rudolf II gathered artifacts from around the
world, with the hopes that somewhere within

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.030
the collection lie the Philosopher's Stone,
believed to be capable of teaching humanity

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.990
the alphabet of creation; and Tsar Peter the
Great turned an inherited cabinet of curiosities,

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.111
furniture designed to store magical objects
like bezoars and unicorn horns, which were

00:06:10.111 --> 00:06:15.080
actually narwhal tusks, into a collection
spanning thirty rooms that was eventually

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.120
opened to the public in 1714.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:24.370
The availability of items to collect blossomed
during colonization and the expansion of trade.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.740
A generation before Burdick, Sir Thomas Phillipps
set out to collect one copy of every book

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.930
in the world, but it wasn’t until mass production
that a set could reasonably be completed.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.620
You couldn’t exactly collect a complete
set of Greek sculptures.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.090
Burdick lived in the first era in which an
average person could build an extensive collection

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.640
of goods -- and then he lost control of his
hands.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:55.830
By age 33, chronic arthritis -- likely exacerbated
from his job assembling electrical parts -- reduced

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.530
Burdick's mobility.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:02.800
Living alone in Syracuse, New York, he renewed
his childhood interest in cards and made it

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.770
his mission to collect every single one before
he died.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.070
And he did it the hard way.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.080
Burdick's collection was built by trading
with collectors he met through magazines and

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.940
by going to libraries, small store exhibits
and auction sales.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:23.900
Unfortunately for him, eBay, which today has
over 800 million items listed and boasts $82

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:29.220
billion dollars worth of items sold in 2015,
was sixty years away.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.750
With Burdick, as with any true collector,
there was no saturation point.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:39.790
Just as eating food provides temporary hunger
fulfillment, so does obtaining a new object.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:44.630
Collector Paul Wallraf said he would “manger
avec ses yeux” - “eat with his eyes”

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:49.180
-- A sentiment Burdick shared when he said,
“Card collecting is primarily an inherited

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.360
love of pictures.”

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:57.480
The hunt to obtain a new object sparks a collector’s
seeking system, defined by neuroscientist

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:03.110
Dr. Jaak Panksepp as a basic impulse in animals,
including humans, “to search, investigate,

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.110
and make sense of the environment.”

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:09.830
It’s the same biological need that drives
a dog to investigate a noise, or the curiosity

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.180
that influenced you to watch this video.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:18.300
For a collector, the satisfaction from attaining
a new piece quickly subsides... and the hunt

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.889
resumes.

00:08:19.889 --> 00:08:24.500
Collecting as a form of preserving the past
confirms our belief that there must be an

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.950
infinite truth.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:32.000
Life existed before me and it will exist after
me, and “Here’s the proof.”

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.380
Collecting as a form of inspiration influenced
artists like Rembrandt, who made paintings

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.300
of his antique sculptures of Homer, Aristotle
and Socrates.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:45.250
Or writer Umberto Eco, who when asked if he
had time to read his huge collection of literature

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:50.770
and poetry said, “It is not indispensable
to read a book - it’s enough to touch it

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.820
and by a mysterious fluid, you absorb it.”

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:59.750
Whether it’s Eco’s mysterious fluid or
a tribal belief that objects carry mana, it’s

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:05.760
the reason an X-ray of Elvis Presley can sell
for $3,500 and an X-ray of your cousin Larry

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.950
was probably thrown away.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:13.290
And collecting as a form of establishing one’s
identity is a celebration of individuality

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.730
because no two collections are the same.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:21.090
Your button, coin or card collection creates
a conceptual circle of magic that wards off

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:27.340
uncertainty and chaos, helps define you, and
proves not only that you exist, but that you

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:28.340
are unique.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:34.690
A collection is a secure micro world of order
entirely controlled by you in a macro world

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:41.760
of chaos… but that becomes a problem when
the toy trains control the conductor.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:47.290
In 2013, Hoarding Disorder was split off into
its own entry under Obsessive-Compulsive and

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:53.230
Related Disorders in the DSM-V. It’s defined
as persistent difficulty discarding or parting

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:57.360
with possessions regardless of the value others
may attribute to them.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.990
The American Psychiatric Association estimates
that two to five percent of the population

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:07.529
suffer from Hoarding Disorder, which creates
fire hazards and health hazards for themselves

00:10:07.529 --> 00:10:09.120
and family members.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.670
Some people are incapable of letting their
objects go.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:19.250
But as Burdick’s health deteriorated, letting
go of his collection became a personal crusade.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:24.440
When Sir Hans Sloane donated his massive collection
of coins, books and dried plants to The Royalty

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.730
Society in 1759, The British Museum was born.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:33.410
Jefferson Burdick was determined to leave
his legacy here at The Met - and curator A.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:38.660
Hyatt Mayor accepted the offer under the condition
that Burdick organize it all.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:44.620
He spent the next 16 years cataloguing all
300,000 cards, and eventually moved to New

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:50.770
York City to work on the project full-time
at a small oak desk here in the Print Department

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:51.960
of The Met.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:57.080
Along the way, he developed The American Card
Catalog, a classification system for organizing

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.130
old cards that’s still used today.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:03.770
Burdick was determined to immortalize his
collection in the face of his progressing

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:04.770
illness.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:11.000
It became a race against time; he took cortisone
shots that made him sick just to briefly dull

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.190
pain so bad that it took a full minute of
agony just to put on his hat.

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:20.210
He’d often tell Mayor, “I might not make
it.”

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.040
But he did.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:28.500
When the final card was glued down into history,
he stood up, painfully twisted into his coat,

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.020
and said, “I shan’t be back.”

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:36.570
The very next day, Jefferson Burdick checked
into University Hospital and never checked

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:37.570
out.

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.360
He died two months later.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.690
According to Mayor, the cause of his death
was an exhausted heart.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.690
But he didn't die from collecting.

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:48.240
He lived from it.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:54.640
And in his collection lived the dream that
a nobody like Jefferson Burdick, a nobody

00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:04.210
like me, a nobody like you, each in our own
unique way has a chance to leave a lasting,

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:07.640
positive mark on this world.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:14:06.220
And as always - thanks 

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:14.930
for watching.
