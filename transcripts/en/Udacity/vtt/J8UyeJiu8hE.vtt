00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Assume that this is the curve that describes

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
the dependence of position on time.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
What would be the curve that describes the

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
dependence of velocity x dot on time--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the red one, the green one, the purple one--

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and this is getting a little more complex.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Assume that this is again a curve that describes

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the dependence of position on time.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What about the second derivative?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
If you repeat that same process again--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the derivative of the derivative,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
the rate of change of the rate of change--

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that's nothing but acceleration.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
How quickly does velocity change?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So what would the acceleration be on the red curve--

00:00:45.000 --> 09:59:59.000
the green curve or the purple curve.
