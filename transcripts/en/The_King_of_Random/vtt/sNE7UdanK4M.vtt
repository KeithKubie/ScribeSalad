00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.040
Hey what's up guys, its a new day, new experiment,

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.020
and this project has extreme danger written all over it.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.300
Now here's the basic idea,
we've seen in previous videos that we can take Coke bottles,

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.140
and fill them up with liquid propane and liquid butane,

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.220
cap them off and they would eventually pressurize,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.500
but they wouldn't explode.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.860
That's probably because the outside air temperature,

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.420
isn't enough to get the gas hot enough
to over-pressure the bottle.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.840
So for this experiment today,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.420
I thought it might be fun to use my blowtorch,

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.920
to help heat things up a little.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.140
Here's the basic idea of the experiment:

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.220
We're gonna take two five hundred
millimeter (500mL) Coke bottles,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.100
and empty them out.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.800
We'll fill one of them up with liquid propane,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.500
and the other one with liquid butane,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.520
we'll cap them off and let them warm up to temperature.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.500
After they have settled down and we
have had a chance to observe the differences,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.800
we'll take a propane torch,

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.200
and gently set these bottles into the heat.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.700
What's gonna happen? Well, they're probably gonna explode.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.740
But, the question is, when, and how dramatically?

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.620
Finding that out is the purpose of this video today!

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.040
Now, we know that when it comes to liquid butane and liquid propane,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.820
pressurated Coke bottles hold up no problem,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.340
but how will a water bottle react?

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.020
These things explode at about 60 - 65 PSI,

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.260
which is about half the vapor pressure of both of those gases.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.360
So just for fun,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.880
I'm thinking, why don't fill these bottles,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.980
and see if we can get them to explode on their own.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.100
Ahhhhh refreshing

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.780
Now we fill up the bottles with propane,

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.140
we're going to use this modified tip
we made the previous video,

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.820
simply open the valve and turn it upside down,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.660
and let it fill up the bottle.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.540
Butane is even easier,

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.600
we just turned upside down use
something like a pair of pliers

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.060
to grab the tip and press it in.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.520
Let's go ahead and release the valves,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.220
and fill these bottles up.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.820
Water bottles are not pressuring like soda bottles,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.540
so I don't expect they'll be able to hold up,

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.960
I'm going to fill them up about halfway,

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.900
and cap them off, so let's watch what happens.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.500
So check this out guys,
we have equal levels of propane and butane,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.160
these are filled up exactly the same.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.380
So if we cap them off,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.160
which one do you think's going to explode first?

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.000
Oh!!! What the heck?!

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.900
What the heck, what the heck,

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.200
that was not expected!

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.460
The butane just popped it's top,

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.740
It looked like it was just chillin'
there no problem having fun,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.660
not doing anything,

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.600
as the propane, I would think it was going to go off,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.440
and all of a sudden "BOOM!" butane just in the air!

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.180
These are hold up a lot longer
than I thought they're going to,

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.820
so I think I'm just going to turn the propane,

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.460
put it closer to the flame and see if we get to explode.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.700
oh yeah you can see it's swelling but

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.900
look at the top there, it's swelling up like a balloon

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.130
there goes wow it actually put out the

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.400
propane torch look at that it's just

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.690
hissing now it actually put out the

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.410
flame oh my goodness that was unreal

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.610
look at this bottle that is annihilated

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.010
so it's kind of interesting guys we

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.240
couldn't get the bottles to explode

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.650
right away but when i move to propane

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.630
closer to the flame you can see a balled

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.610
up like a balloon and then erupted then

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:17.900
went off like a gunshot and we can hear

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.340
the sound ricocheting off the mountains

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.860
behind us and this is the damage think

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.420
about this guy's all that flammable gas

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.520
and it actually put out the flame on my

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.020
blow torch

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.500
→MIND BLOWN←

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.260
so check it out guys we've left these

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.150
bottles out for about 25 minutes they've

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.500
both warmed up the outside air

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.120
temperature and holding them both in

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.040
hand the first thing I noticed is the

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.080
propane is a lot more pressurized than

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.599
the butane butane has a lower vapor

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.730
pressure apparently than propane guys I

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.680
think it is pretty hard in fact it's

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.390
making me a little bit nervous you might

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.860
be wondering about how heavy these feel

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.540
and holding them side-by-side it feels

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.280
to me like the butane might be just a

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.080
touch heavier but there is just a tiny

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.940
bit more liquid in there as well other

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:14.900
than that I really feel like they're

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.000
about the same way so what we're going

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.410
to do now is strike up the flame on my

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.090
propane torch and gently set these

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.769
bottles into the heat so we can observe

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:22.940
what happens to the liquid in a

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.650
pressurized bottle with put under

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.180
extreme temperatures let's go with

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.460
propane first moment of truth guys

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.680
pressurize bottle of propane vs

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.100
blowtorch

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.700
what happened

00:04:48.700 --> 00:05:00.670
all right on what the heck he go to the

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:09.130
fire oh my goodness that was amazing so

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.780
I didn't see what happened but some

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.670
person flames went off so i thought the

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.080
bottle exploded i came to check it out

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.410
and then boom huge big fireball I didn't

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.180
even see it I was running away but I

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.200
felt the flames in my back

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.740
that was incredible torts responsive and

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.540
research with propane epic success Usain

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.880
is next I love this little rock here

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.710
works kinda like a blast shield perfect

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.980
so last time I had the bottle sitting

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.640
here and I set the propane for scheming

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.140
to this thing this time I'm gonna get

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.520
the protein towards going and sets

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.440
bottle in anything often executed a

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.090
little bit of a person especially now

00:05:46.090 --> 00:06:00.970
that we are most oh my god hose instant

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.410
those instant I didn't have time to run

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:03.610
away I was just like place the bottle

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.430
and food everywhere and I didn't see if

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.930
that made a huge fireball or not because

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.940
I'm ducking and running when I can smell

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.470
the vapors here's the rest of the bottle

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.260
look at that blew it wide open now that

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.240
didn't take anything one little lick of

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.130
the flame input of the countless nut I'm

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.300
glad I got my hand out of the way in

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.390
time how much paper came off of that all

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.760
of that vaporized yeah but there was so

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.320
much pressure that actually blew the

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.240
flame out on my prepaid cards before it

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.920
had a chance at night that is

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.420
mind-blowing to me

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.010
the guys we started this experiment

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.450
today with the knowledge that we could

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.220
fill up plastic soda bottles with liquid

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.140
propane and liquid butane and at

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.910
reasonable atmospheric temperatures they

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:48.680
won't explode so we tried filling up

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.060
water bottles as well which were made of

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.980
a much thinner plastic and surprisingly

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.540
they held up pretty well but in the end

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.120
they did go off we notice that over time

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.920
both the propane and the butane bottles

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.330
warmed up to the point where all the

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.250
frost melted off to get things a little

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.570
bit more heated we fired up my propane

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.610
torch and stuck the bottles individually

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.830
into the propane flame as soon as the

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.480
bottle full of propane touch the flame

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.520
we saw the liquid started boiling and a

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.020
small pinhole developed which released a

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.700
little gas it didn't take much longer

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.590
though before the entire bottle exploded

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.860
in flames went everywhere now the butane

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.150
was a little bit different it looked all

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.010
calm and beautiful on the surface but it

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.080
was so highly pressurized the second we

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.580
touch it to a claim that went off the

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.760
pain the interesting thing about that

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.140
reaction is that a blew up with such

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.880
force that it blew out the flame on the

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.350
propane torch and none of the safe is

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.680
ignited I was not expecting that so in

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.690
conclusion guys yes it is possible to

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.400
store these liquid in plastic soda

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.220
bottles but it is extreme danger as the

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.080
temperature of the environment Rises the

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.430
pressure in the bottle filled and

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.710
eventually they will explode if there's

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:49.880
any kind of open flame in the room

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:50.990
sometimes they'll go up in a big

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.700
fireball sometimes the flame will go out

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.770
that's probably not a chance to really

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:56.450
want to take not the purpose of this

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:58.100
video was to do just that to play with

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.720
extremely flammable gases under pressure

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.880
with an open flame thanks for joining

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.050
for this video guys I'll be looking

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.040
for you the next one talk to you then

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.000
hey good news we got the fire out
