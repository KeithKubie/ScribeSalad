[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.724 --> 00:00:08.941
MELISSA MONAHAN: Welcome
to our first wellness day.

00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:10.440
We've never had a
wellness day here,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.106
so we've got the vendor fair out
in the courtyard y'all probably

00:00:13.106 --> 00:00:13.980
got to check out.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.920
We've got this talk.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.010
So really happy
that you're here.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.290
This panel is the intersection
of wellness and technology.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.400
So we've got a bunch of experts
here to talk to us about it.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.750
We're a tech company.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.570
We're very concerned
about that intersection.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.650
As you know, Google is a
leader in workplace health

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.290
and wellness.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.540
We have our GFit program.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.260
We've nutrition.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.550
We have massage therapy.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.890
But we also recognize that
we have a lot to learn.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.380
So that is why we have
these folks here today.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.820
I'm going to introduce them.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.236
And then we'll ask
some questions.

00:00:43.236 --> 00:00:45.819
We'll leave time for audience
questions at the end.

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:48.360
This is also being filmed, so
it'll be on our YouTube channel

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.220
in a few weeks, and y'all can
post it and watch it then.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.400
Yeah, so let's get started.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.760
So first I'm going to
try to get all the names

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.210
right, the pronunciation.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.439
So Andy Petranek.

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:00.480
ANDY PETRANEK: You got it

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.110
MELISSA MONAHAN: Did I nail it?

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.440
ANDY PETRANEK: Yeah.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.550
MELISSA MONAHAN: So
Andy's the founder

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.530
of CrossFit LA and the
Whole Life Challenge,

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.550
which is really amazing.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.260
My husband and I
did it, and I highly

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.310
recommend everyone do it.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.590
It's life changing.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.540
Then we've got Dice Iida-Klein.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.320
Dice is a yoga instructor at
Yoga Glow and, if I might say,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.280
a world-class handstand master.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.919
I've been taking his
videos for years,

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:18.960
and I'm a really big fan.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.460
Y'all have got to check him out.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.320
Your mind will be blown.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.600
Kim Whitman, who's the
founder and executive producer

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.910
of "Yoga Today," it's
a beautiful sight

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.310
of yoga classes
filmed in nature.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.860
And so everyone should
definitely check that out.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.220
Jeff Egler is the MD and medical
director at Parsley Health.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.720
This is a really
cool company, it's

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.750
redefining medical
care with a root cause,

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.570
whole-person approach and
focus on data technology

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.700
and real doctor-patient
relationships,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.270
which we all want
and appreciate.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.770
And then lastly, Tom Freeman
is the learning and development

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.294
manager at Headspace.

00:01:51.294 --> 00:01:52.710
Headspace is out
in the courtyard.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.020
You're probably also familiar
with it, meditation app.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.670
I can personally attest to
the effectiveness of that app.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.440
It's really great.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.300
And Googlers get a
really good discount.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.620
So check it out.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.420
Putting in a plug for all y'all.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.410
So let's get started.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.610
I'm going to just
ask some questions.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.250
We'll go down the line and then
leave time for y'all to ask

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.419
questions as well.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.370
So just briefly, we'll
just go down the line,

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.270
starting with Andy.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.170
Tell us briefly what led you
into the wellness profession?

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.257
What factors motivated you to
get to where you are today?

00:02:19.257 --> 00:02:21.090
ANDY PETRANEK: It's an
interesting question.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.140
We were talking about
my varied background.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.642
So I got to go kind of quick
because it's very varied.

00:02:28.642 --> 00:02:29.850
I was kind of forced into it.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.692
I was a Marine back
in the early '90s.

00:02:32.692 --> 00:02:34.650
And I had to get in shape
to be in the Marines.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.880
And I didn't really
realize at the time,

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.460
but it was my first introduction
to being a fitness coach.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.730
I was responsible for a
platoon of men going to war

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.820
and had to make sure that
they were fit and ready to go.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.120
And lo and behold, that
became my profession.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.840
Four years after leaving the
Marines, I started racing.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.450
I started doing professional
adventure racing sponsored

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.750
by Red Bull.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.040
It's like triathlon meets, I
don't know, extreme sports.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.950
We would rock climb and
kayak and mountain bike

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.520
and 300, 400, 500-mile races.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.240
And people started
to ask me what

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.980
I was doing to be in shape.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.510
And I would tell
them what I did.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.410
And then they would say, well,
can you write a program for me?

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.587
Or can you train me?

00:03:20.587 --> 00:03:22.170
And that's how I got
my first clients,

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.450
and I became a fitness coach.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.230
And I started going down
the road of more holistic.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.386
I worked with Paul Chek at the
Chek Institute in San Diego.

00:03:31.386 --> 00:03:32.760
And I started to
go down the road

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:40.110
toward being a wellness and
corrective exercise specialist.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.160
And then I discovered CrossFit.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.460
And it kind of changed the
context of my training,

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.880
because I started having so
much fun with workouts again

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.750
and training again.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.780
I opened up CrossFit
Los Angeles,

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.160
which was one of the first
10 CrossFit in the world.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.970
And was really responsible in
the beginning of that movement

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.370
for delivering a lot of the
publicity for the movement,

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.270
for CrossFit around
the world, even though,

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.840
I just owned a little
gym in Santa Monica.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.400
And the whole of challenge came
out of my desire as a coach

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:22.240
to affect what choices people
made in their everyday life

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.200
outside the gym.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.290
Because they could come see me
two, three, four times a week

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.170
at the gym, but
what would they do

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.420
when they weren't at the gym?

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.880
And that was really
the mother lode for me.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.570
And my business partner,
Michael Stanwick, he and I

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.950
are co-founders
of the Challenge,

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.070
he was my head coach CFLA.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.700
And we were searching
for this answer,

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.210
and we knew it was
not just in exercise.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.990
So we built this
Whole Life Challenge

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.280
around a holistic approach,
which is food and stretching

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:02.200
and mobility and clarity of
mind, gratitude, reflection

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.550
on how you're doing.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.640
And we put it together in a
way that builds community.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.710
So we kind of tumbled
upon this format

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.010
and grew it from 150
in the first challenge

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.840
to we had 23,000
people around the world

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.040
do the one in January, which is
always our biggest of the year.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.214
So that's really it, yeah.

00:05:22.214 --> 00:05:23.130
MELISSA MONAHAN: Dice.

00:05:26.731 --> 00:05:28.480
DICE IIDA-KLEIN: So
the question is, is me

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.479
venturing into the health
and wellness industry?

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.840
Or how did I get it?

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.050
Let me just say I
think early on, being

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.000
a kid I realized the
direct correlation

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.930
between physical fitness,
or at least moving my body,

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.720
and how that helped more my
mental state or the ability

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.270
to almost relax or calm down.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.527
I played a lot of sports
throughout my younger years,

00:05:49.527 --> 00:05:50.860
all the way through high school.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.620
And in college I
was a big gym rat.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.310
But I'd never really
touched upon yoga,

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.555
but I started working for a
little company called Lululemon

00:05:58.555 --> 00:06:00.430
at one point.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.010
And at the time, they
allowed their employees

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.502
to take any sort of
physical fitness,

00:06:06.502 --> 00:06:07.960
go into the physical
fitness world.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.377
As long as you
wore their apparel,

00:06:09.377 --> 00:06:10.793
you could take the
class for free.

00:06:10.793 --> 00:06:12.230
So I ventured into
so many things

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.480
I never thought I would touch.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.570
And this was right after
I'd graduated from UCLA.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.520
And I basically
tried a yoga class.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.749
And, yeah, I fell
in love with yoga.

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:26.290
And I never really
thought I would be

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.498
able to share it or teach it.

00:06:27.498 --> 00:06:28.690
That wasn't really the idea.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.200
But I did realize that there
was this strong connection

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.950
between mind-body, and how I
was always so physically active,

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.900
but I realized I needed to be
physically active to, I think,

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.650
be able to handle
what's going on up here.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.983
And I think that goes for
most human beings, in general.

00:06:42.983 --> 00:06:45.880
And once you start to
realize that connection,

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.300
things start to go
in a good direction.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.730
But the ability
to actually share

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.680
what I'm able to
practice and teach really

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.990
came from the company
that I'm fortunate enough

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.880
to work for, Yoga Glow.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.320
They are really
bringing, I think,

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.240
yoga to the masses in
a way that some people

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.190
that are in remote
areas or can't really

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.710
get to a public yoga class,
we're able to reach out to them

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.293
or at least be with
them in their home

00:07:07.293 --> 00:07:10.120
and provide some
sort of clarity,

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.800
serenity, all the things that
I think we're all looking for.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.565
So I don't know.

00:07:14.565 --> 00:07:16.690
I guess I would say I just
stumbled into the health

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.134
and wellness realm.

00:07:18.134 --> 00:07:19.300
I didn't really intend upon.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.970
It wasn't something that I
was so keen on getting to.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.340
But I feel very
fortunate and blessed

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.580
to be able to actually be a part
of it in some tiny little way,

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.816
so that's it in
a nutshell, yeah.

00:07:31.816 --> 00:07:32.740
MELISSA MONAHAN: Kim.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:33.698
KIM WHITMAN: Thank you.

00:07:33.698 --> 00:07:38.550
And like Dice, I also am
someone who's stumbled into--

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:39.490
actually fell.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.520
I crashed on my
skis in Argentina,

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.710
had this horrible
injury that I was

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:46.280
recovering for seven months.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.980
I crushed my leg, had
all these surgeries.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.940
And so, yeah, I, like
many people who find yoga,

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.970
it's because of an injury.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.110
You never seek
health and wellness

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.030
until you don't
have it, which is

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.110
something Parsley knows about.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.660
So anyways, yeah,
so, I came back.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.990
And I was in Jackson
Hole being sort

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.460
of a ski bum for a couple
of years after grad school,

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.860
I actually did
study engineering,

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.920
which is not what--
so I now I say

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.800
I'm in the business of renewable
energy, but in the human form.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.220
So it's all come full circle.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.190
But, yeah, so anyways,
I was recovering

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.470
from this ski accident.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:28.600
And I was doing a ton of yoga.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.110
I'd always done tons of sports
in college and high school.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:37.210
I was an athlete, skier,
lacrosse, swimmer, rower.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.070
And I've never been
in better shape

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.080
than when I was doing 8
to 10 yoga classes a week.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.340
I can say that fully.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.800
And I've been in the gym, in the
weight room, and all of this.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:53.380
So I was just floored by
not just the physical,

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.860
but also the mental
conditioning that you

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.330
get from the practice of yoga.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.280
And then it goes into the
Whole Life Challenge thing.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.021
Like, you're in this
vein of wellness.

00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:05.520
And all of a sudden,
you're starting

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.190
to make better decisions about
what you eat because you don't

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.450
want to have a
hamburger in your belly

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.400
when you're in yoga
class doing a handstand.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.240
And then all of a sudden,
you're speaking a little kinder

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.940
to people, and you're making
better choices in terms

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.614
of every life decision.

00:09:19.614 --> 00:09:21.030
So yoga's one of
those things that

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.524
just permeates your whole life.

00:09:22.524 --> 00:09:23.940
And all of a sudden,
you're in it.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.290
Like, you don't even mean to.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.820
It's like a sneaky
form of exercise.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.690
Like you don't mean to--

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:30.435
you don't know.

00:09:30.435 --> 00:09:32.310
You're thinking, oh,
I'm going to go stretch.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.060
And, like, oh, you kind
of get your butt kicked.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:41.130
So, yeah, I am also extremely
grateful for falling

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:46.110
into yoga, quite literally, and
the path that it's taken us on.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.710
We started the yoga
show as a content

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:53.220
carrot for a larger investment
for a different company

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:53.820
altogether.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.650
And then so many
people were loving it.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:58.720
We spun it out into
its own business.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.760
It was like on the top 10
podcasts in iTunes in 2006,

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.300
up there with-- people were
consuming it ravenously,

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.880
writing in saying, like
what are you doing?

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.080
You're putting an hour yoga show
filmed in nature in HD online,

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.640
and you're giving
it away for free?

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.020
Like this is too
good to be true.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.790
And of course, it was.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.800
And so people were
consuming it ravenously.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.800
They were like, well, we
don't want to miss one.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.017
I'm doing yoga every day
now because of this show.

00:10:25.017 --> 00:10:26.100
And like, what's going on?

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.516
I'm losing all
this weight, or I'm

00:10:27.516 --> 00:10:29.292
getting over this depression.

00:10:29.292 --> 00:10:30.750
So the letters that
were pouring in

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.200
were so moving that we
couldn't turn it off

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:38.800
when the larger investment that
we made it for was turned off.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.820
And so we spun it,
did the freemium thing

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.537
before Pandora went
to Pandora One,

00:10:43.537 --> 00:10:45.120
and we didn't know
if anyone was going

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.830
to pay for content online.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:51.360
So it's been this like complete
evolution from the wild,

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.400
because we're in Jackson Hole.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.890
So we're doing it all
from a media vacuum,

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.926
which has been interesting.

00:10:57.926 --> 00:11:01.650
But, yeah, no, it's been a
wild ride during this time,

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.250
when the internet's sort
of taking over television,

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:06.280
to stumble into
it as an outsider.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.590
I feel really blessed.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.890
But most of all to stumble
into yoga as an outsider

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.780
and now be an insider
and, like, realize

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.140
it's changed my whole life and
be so grateful for the people

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.660
that it's put me
in contact with.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.380
So, yeah, that's
how it happened.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.860
It's pretty wild.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:24.360
Thank you.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:28.350
JEFFREY EGLER: My
name's Jeff Egler.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:31.020
I'm the medical director
of Parsley Health

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.842
here in Los Angeles.

00:11:32.842 --> 00:11:34.050
Thank you for having us here.

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.010
This is a lot of fun.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.260
It's great to come out and
talk about what we're doing

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.030
and to share it with people.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.100
I think I have an
interesting answer for you,

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:46.290
interesting in that I feel like
even as a physician, trained

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.950
in a allopathic
conventional manner, an MD,

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:55.290
I also stumbled into
health and wellness

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:59.320
after practicing medicine
for more than a decade.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.730
And what I mean by that is I
think you've all heard this.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:04.930
I think it's probably
becoming a bit of a cliche.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:09.300
But my opinion, and
I'm not alone here,

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:13.160
is that we don't
really have a disease--

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.120
we don't really have a health
care system in our country.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.510
We have more of a
disease management

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.647
system in our country.

00:12:19.647 --> 00:12:21.480
And quite frankly, it
doesn't really even do

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.290
a good job of managing disease.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.620
And so I had been
practicing as a physician.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.630
Initially, I chose
to be a physician

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.715
because I started
in engineering,

00:12:29.715 --> 00:12:32.340
which is something that many of
you might be able to relate to.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.280
And I really loved the
science and the math.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.330
And as I started to
study more of this,

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.360
I started to realize that the
application that I wanted to

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.620
was in the human form.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.900
I wanted to solve
problems with people.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.080
So I went into
medicine, and that's

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.290
where I spent my attention
for the first decade or so,

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:55.560
which is finding disease
and trying to fix that,

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.150
rather than focusing
on health and wellness.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.330
And so quite honestly, I
can say looking back now,

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.464
it's very ironic that I
wasn't trained really,

00:13:03.464 --> 00:13:05.880
nor did I really think in terms
of keeping people healthy.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.296
I was looking for
disease and then

00:13:07.296 --> 00:13:09.546
trying to get them
back to health.

00:13:09.546 --> 00:13:10.920
But really that
horse was already

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:11.920
sort of out of the barn.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:17.160
So moving into what we
do now at Parsley Health,

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.314
you may be familiar
with some of the terms

00:13:19.314 --> 00:13:21.480
functional medicine,
integrative medicine, holistic.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.940
We don't necessarily attach
or identify ourselves

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.890
in any of those one ways.

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:27.840
But that is the line
that we're taking.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.340
And the reason we
don't attach to it

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.850
is because we really feel like
we take the best of everything.

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.640
We have the science
training to look out there

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:38.820
amongst all the different health
modalities and really take

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.070
the best and incorporate
them in a personalized

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:44.370
way for the individual.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.520
And I got to that
by really realizing

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.270
after a decade of
medicine I wasn't taking

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.610
really good care of myself.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:52.650
And I was teaching at USC.

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:55.140
I was teaching
doctors to be doctors.

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.960
And as I started to take
better care of myself,

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.300
I started asking more questions
about what I was eating

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.950
and how I was sleeping
and, of course,

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.870
reducing stress and exercising.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.760
And as I started
to translate that

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.700
into teaching my
physicians-in-training

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.200
to do that with
their patients, they

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.130
were looking at me like
deer in the headlight.

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.950
You know I don't have time
to talk to them about that.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.810
I just need to
diagnose, prescribe,

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:17.190
get to the next room.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:21.240
And so I realized that I didn't
fit into that model anymore.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.000
And luckily, at that time,
Parsley Health was coming up.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.070
And now I get to practice
medicine and health

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.720
in the way that fits
for me a lot better.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.930
Thanks.

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:33.870
MELISSA MONAHAN: Tom.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:34.620
TOM FREEMAN: Cool.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.440
Thanks very much for having us.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.150
So, yeah, I think
my story, if there's

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.590
one thing which kind of
pulls it all together,

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:43.830
I think it's the idea of
demystifying something.

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:47.770
So probably starting back in
my school days, university,

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:51.940
you guys say school, I had
this real passion to kind study

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:54.510
business psychology, so the
psychology of organizations

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:55.690
and how they work.

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:57.780
But at the same
time, I was rooted

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:01.032
in this idea of training and
people with like numbers,

00:15:01.032 --> 00:15:02.490
and that didn't
really interest me.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:05.820
But this huge idea of wellness
and getting more for yourself,

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:09.430
where I came across
that quite a lot.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.340
This idea of mindfulness,
which doesn't have

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.570
to be this religious thing.

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:16.070
It can be this practical
thing which anyone can do,

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:18.570
that kind of was getting quite
a lot of traction around then

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:21.210
in literature, and loads and
loads papers coming about it.

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:24.210
At the same time, I was
like super stressed out.

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:25.890
Exam season was coming along.

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:27.550
You guys call them finals.

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:29.730
You probably relate to it's
a pretty stressful time.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.400
So I went and saw
this therapist, part

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.550
of the university offering.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.040
And he suggested I take up
meditation and give this thing

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:35.970
a try.

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:40.794
And I was amazed at how quickly,
how practical this thing was.

00:15:40.794 --> 00:15:42.210
You can read a
book on it, and you

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.001
don't have to go off
to a monastery in Asia

00:15:44.001 --> 00:15:45.920
and burn incense
and where robes.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.612
It's something you can do in
your dorm room with friends.

00:15:48.612 --> 00:15:50.820
And I think, like, wow, this
thing's really powerful.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.010
This thing can turn
around your relationship

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:55.020
with stress,
anxiety, performance,

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.470
all that kind of stuff.

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:57.300
So that was that.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.160
So I kind of finished
off my education,

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.260
did my master's,
started meditating.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:05.970
And then I kind of
found Headspace.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:07.710
And again, Headspace has
got this really interesting

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:08.200
mission.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:08.741
I don't know.

00:16:08.741 --> 00:16:10.769
People are probably
familiar with it.

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:12.810
But we have this mission
to demystify meditation.

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:16.140
Again, we have we have
our co-founder Andy, who

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.270
spent 10 years trying
to become a monk

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.877
and brought it back
to the rest in London

00:16:21.877 --> 00:16:24.210
and had this clinic where he
would see people one on one

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:27.120
and teach them
mindfulness exercises.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.880
And I came across
Headspace a few years ago

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.300
when we were quite
small back in London.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.410
And like this mission
of demystifying

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.386
this thing, like with
work stuff at university

00:16:36.386 --> 00:16:38.010
I was interested in,
like, demystifying

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:40.301
work, how it doesn't have to
be this thing where you're

00:16:40.301 --> 00:16:42.320
tied to a desk for
eight hours a day.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.150
You can do it anywhere you want.

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:46.280
Like looking at things
like employee well-being,

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.620
really, really important.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.420
So that was kind of like the
demystifying of work piece.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.410
But then Headspace came along.

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:51.470
It's like, whoa,
these guys are trying

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:53.970
to demystify this really,
really old thing which

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.190
is rooted in all of this
teaching and these trainings

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:59.250
and bringing it to like
a modern way of thinking,

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:00.801
a modern way of life.

00:17:00.801 --> 00:17:02.550
So those two kind of
things came together.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:06.328
And I joined Headspace back
in London a few years ago

00:17:06.328 --> 00:17:07.369
when we were quite small.

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:11.819
And yeah, that for me, just
being part of that mission

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:14.780
was, yeah, just a huge
part of how I kind of--

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:19.829
well, my process, in particular,
how looking after the mind

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:21.839
and seeing it as this
everyday thing, which

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:24.520
doesn't have to be this
really religious thing,

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.060
I think that's a really
important way of looking at it.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:30.120
So, yeah, that's kind of my
journey from education to work.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.010
And it's funny
being here actually.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.560
We used to be one block from
here, around the corner.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.890
We used to walk past
this place all the time.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:39.104
Had office envy, big time.

00:17:39.104 --> 00:17:40.020
So, yeah, don't worry.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.770
But, yeah, we moved a
couple of years ago.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.060
But, yeah, that's my journey.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.250
And now I'm kind of working
in learning development.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.700
And before this, my role
was culture manager.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:51.540
So in terms of the behaviors and
the culture of an organization,

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.900
how do you kind of build a place
which fits your brand, which

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.954
takes well-being
really seriously,

00:17:57.954 --> 00:18:00.120
which encourages your
employees to meditate and take

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.040
good breaks and look
after their minds at work,

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.709
yeah, that's kind
of how I got here.

00:18:05.709 --> 00:18:06.750
MELISSA MONAHAN: Awesome.

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:07.830
Thank y'all so much.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.190
And I find it so
interesting that we often

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.010
think of health as physical.

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:14.792
And everyone's touching upon
the spiritual-psychological.

00:18:14.792 --> 00:18:16.750
I mean, three of y'all
have psychology degrees,

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:19.640
so I think that's
very interesting.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.129
So thank you so much.

00:18:21.129 --> 00:18:23.420
Next question, so we are
talking about the intersection

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:24.544
of technology and wellness.

00:18:24.544 --> 00:18:26.310
So we do want to dive into that.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:29.720
So how have you seen technology
impact the wellness space

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.280
in a positive way?

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.890
And then on the opposite,
have you seen negative impacts

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:36.750
from technology on
the wellness field?

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:39.437
So we can just go right
back down the line.

00:18:39.437 --> 00:18:42.020
ANDY PETRANEK: We wouldn't have
a business without technology.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.853
We wouldn't have a
business without Facebook

00:18:43.853 --> 00:18:45.470
or without Google or without--

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:48.410
the interaction of
community or the building

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:53.990
of community online has
been such a powerful tool.

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:58.370
The hard part, the interesting
part for us was how to do that

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:01.920
effectively so that you didn't--

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.290
so that it was a valuable
space to spend time in

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:07.380
and it wasn't just another
recreation of Facebook

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.740
or a place that
people already were.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:18.810
So I'm forever indebted to
technology for my whole life.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:22.380
I mean, I'm so grateful that
life has brought me here.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.810
I can work out of the
comfort of my home

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:28.800
and communicate
with 20,000 people

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.920
at a time doing the
Whole Life Challenge,

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.900
and they can interact with me.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.310
They can interact with the game.

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:36.600
They can score themselves.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.670
They can do things that
wouldn't be allowed.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:45.110
I think one of the challenges
for me around health

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:50.660
and mindfulness and
technology is this insatiable

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.430
need for people to think--

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:56.410
they think they need more data,
they need more information.

00:19:56.410 --> 00:20:02.500
And I and I think that without
the consciousness-- like one

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.000
of the things that we don't do
and the Whole Life Challenge,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.700
we don't partner-- we've
never partnered with Fitbit

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:13.840
or connected in an automatic
step tracker or habit tracker.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.760
We want people to actually
have to do it manually.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.270
We want people to be conscious.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:20.750
We want people to be
aware of what they're

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:23.930
doing so that they're
actually making choices

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:25.550
about the way they
spend their time.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.530
And they're aware of how
they spend their time.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:32.870
If it's too automatic, it's
just easy to lose track of.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:33.710
I've done it myself.

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:35.660
I mean, I've experimented
with every fitness

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:36.740
tracker known to man.

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.540
I actually love
fitness trackers.

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.040
But when I don't--

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.285
when I get all this
data, it takes time

00:20:46.285 --> 00:20:47.910
to actually go in
and look at the data.

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:49.220
And then what did you look at?

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.360
And what's important?

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.570
And how do you not
get lost in that?

00:20:53.570 --> 00:21:00.930
So really for Whole Life
Challenge, it's not anti data.

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:04.520
It's be aware of
what you're doing.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.812
And if the data supports--

00:21:06.812 --> 00:21:09.350
if it supports you to
have a goal of walking

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:15.410
15,000 steps in a day and it
gets you moving, fantastic.

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:17.690
Don't just shoot
for 15,000 steps

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:25.240
because that's what Fitbit
tells you what to do, so thanks.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.790
DICE IIDA-KLEIN: Technology
positives and possible rooms

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:30.400
for improvement, I guess--

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.867
room for improvement.

00:21:32.867 --> 00:21:35.200
Working for Yoga Glow, I mean,
I touched upon it already

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:39.245
with just my brief intro,
but one of the positives

00:21:39.245 --> 00:21:41.620
is it's really brought, I
think, just health and wellness

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.828
to the masses, or at least
to people that are looking

00:21:43.828 --> 00:21:46.181
to improve upon themselves.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:52.375
Yeah, think it's a wonderful
way also to create community.

00:21:52.375 --> 00:21:53.890
Or kind of like
Andy was saying, was

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:55.719
being able to not
globalize, but being

00:21:55.719 --> 00:21:57.760
able to connect with people
around the globe that

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.710
are doing maybe the
same things as you are,

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:01.810
thinking the same way as you.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:03.730
And so I think
technology, in general,

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.460
is just helping us to bridge
the gap between people

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.930
that seem so far away.

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:10.315
It's really bringing a
global community together.

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:15.674
Negative aspects?

00:22:15.674 --> 00:22:17.590
I don't want to say it's
necessarily negative,

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:19.689
but I think, as cliche
as it may sound,

00:22:19.689 --> 00:22:21.730
the one thing that I think
you hear a lot in yoga

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:27.380
is this idea of being in the now
or being in the present moment.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.380
And I feel like at
times with technology,

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.900
because you may have a Fitbit
tracker or something that's

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.670
tracking your steps
or you have a goal

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:35.230
that you're looking
for, you tend

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:38.080
to either weigh on the side
of the past or the future.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.540
And you're always kind
of going back and forth

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.670
between the two, which is
normal, and it should happen.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:45.340
That's how you can
assess a situation

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.990
and move forward or
make changes as needed.

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:52.149
But oftentimes we forget that--

00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.940
again, it's cliche.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.940
But everything you have,
everything you need

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:56.380
is right here right now.

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.080
And if you can sometimes
put the phone down or put

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:04.750
even Yoga Glow down
or whatever it may be,

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.467
you can realize that--

00:23:06.467 --> 00:23:07.800
MELISSA MONAHAN: Don't say that.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:08.200
DICE IIDA-KLEIN: Yeah,
yeah, don't say that.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:08.740
Sorry.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:13.467
[LAUGHTER] I think all I'm
saying is that sometimes--

00:23:13.467 --> 00:23:15.050
ANDY PETRANEK: Qut
while you're ahead.

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:15.110
DICE IIDA-KLEIN: Yeah.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.140
Yeah.

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:15.170
Yeah.

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:17.040
Technology can take
us out of the moment.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.900
And then you start to realize
that a lot of times the most

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.494
important thing is to realize
that the things that you

00:23:22.494 --> 00:23:24.910
do along the way to your goal,
those are what matter more.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:26.326
That's kind of a
gift, the ability

00:23:26.326 --> 00:23:27.910
to see how you
actually got somewhere

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:30.910
versus where you're trying
to go or even where you been.

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:33.410
But just being there now, yeah.

00:23:37.684 --> 00:23:38.350
KIM WHITMAN: No.

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:41.020
And I agree with
everything you said,

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:42.280
and I don't want to repeat.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.630
But that's exactly right.

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:45.088
It does take you
out of the moment.

00:23:45.088 --> 00:23:49.450
I do think it's good in that
you're able to put your art

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:52.660
form, whether it's yoga
or whatever, CrossFit,

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.180
into the world and find
your people, lovely.

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:55.930
Love that.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:58.210
I have people from
the Netherlands

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:01.700
that I'm friends with now that
I wouldn't be because of--

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.080
without yoga today,
or all over the world.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.780
But, yeah, the drawback, and I
don't know if it's a drawback.

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:10.780
I think it's just we're in
a conversation right now.

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:15.550
This is not something black
and white, like good or bad.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:22.000
We're in the gray right
now with how to manage--

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.540
I'm sure everyone saw Anderson
Cooper on "60 Minutes"

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:27.420
doing the cell phone tests.

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:28.120
He's hooked up.

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.370
And he's literally
giving off-- his brain

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:34.120
is giving off the same chemicals
that you get from cocaine

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.010
but checking his phone.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:37.130
It's an addiction.

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:39.700
People are device addicted.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.520
You get that little
hit of like dopamine

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.600
when you get a like
on your Instagram.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.400
And Instagrams like
withholding likes so

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.380
that they come in in bulk now.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:51.130
All these things, it's like
tech companies are intentionally

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.080
designing these things
to be addictive.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.040
And as humans, it's like we
have to decide, OK, well--

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.600
and as creators of
technology, we have to decide,

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.120
well, let's have
that conversation.

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.460
And let's decide what
is in the best interest.

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.370
It's like the whole GMO debate.

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:07.900
It's like, yeah,
well, we can solve

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.120
vitamin A deficiencies
in populations

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.700
by inserting some
vitamin A in rice.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.620
But then what are the cons--

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.760
it's like there's
good and there's bad.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.400
And we're in the dialogue.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.610
And I'm sure we'll look back
on this time as like, oh, wow,

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:24.490
this is the time that
they were scrambling

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:25.900
to figure it out culturally.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.600
But I like to be an optimist
and think that technology really

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.010
does solve problems.

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:32.770
And in general, our lives
will be better for it.

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:36.510
So, yeah, I guess I'm
ambiguous on this.

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:40.330
But I agree with what you said.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:45.280
JEFFREY EGLER: Agree with
most, if not all of it.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.790
We've always had technology
from the beginning of man.

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:50.950
Fire is a technology.

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:53.260
And we will always have
technology to a certain degree.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.200
And we are evolving
with our technology.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.750
And it is really
interesting how quickly

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:01.030
we're evolving with our
technology, the differences

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.940
between generations,
that we actually

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:07.575
have to split generations
into different generations

00:26:07.575 --> 00:26:09.700
because things are moving
and changing and adapting

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:10.750
so quickly.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.930
As an example of
that technology,

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:16.240
I think that the
crisis that we've

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.150
started to see in terms
of obesity and diabetes

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:22.030
and heart disease and things
like that probably starting

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:25.900
around the '80s because
of the food industry,

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:26.980
which is a technology.

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:32.230
And certainly food industry made
things a lot more convenient

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.750
for us.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.180
But at what cost?

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.100
And so I think that
through education we're

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.808
starting to reverse
some of those things.

00:26:37.808 --> 00:26:40.725
So those are some of the things
that I think where technology--

00:26:40.725 --> 00:26:42.850
and we're probably not
talking about the technology

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:44.766
that we're used to talking
about in this room.

00:26:44.766 --> 00:26:47.890
But that's where I think some
of the negatives have been.

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:52.870
Positives, like Andy said, part
of what we do at Parsley Health

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:56.520
is in addition, of course,
to seeing patients,

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.944
we are able to communicate
with them through technology.

00:26:58.944 --> 00:27:00.610
We actually don't
even have a phone line

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:02.320
because we do all of
our communications

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.960
through a secure portal where
patients can ask a question

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.986
and get an answer
within 24 hours.

00:27:06.986 --> 00:27:08.860
And we have somebody
scanning it to make sure

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:12.970
if there's an emergency, that
gets addressed immediately.

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:14.920
We're a 21st-century
practice, where

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.660
I don't think a lot of doctors
are utilizing this fully.

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:19.935
But we can do telemedicine.

00:27:19.935 --> 00:27:21.310
So it doesn't
really matter where

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:23.200
your office is located anymore.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:27.550
I spoke with a patient
today who's in Florida.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:29.810
So that technology
wasn't available.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:32.800
We do blogs and offer
patients information

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.150
on a regular basis that way.

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:36.772
That wasn't available
to us 5, 10 years ago,

00:27:36.772 --> 00:27:38.230
at least in the
way that it is now.

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:45.010
So that's all wonderful stuff,
and we integrate technology

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:50.050
into our decision-making
processes by having people--

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:53.050
we typically order
a lot more labs

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:56.800
that we use as biomarkers
because we have the technology.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:01.960
Medicine has a tendency to lag
way behind other technologies.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:05.320
And so in many ways, the
typical doctor out there

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.690
is probably way behind in
terms of the technology that's

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:11.080
available of diagnosing
problems, special tests.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:15.160
And most doctors, and I say
this intelligently because

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.020
five years ago I
was most doctors.

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.900
And what I was teaching doctors
was not the cutting-edge stuff

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:22.390
that we're doing now.

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:24.850
But we have to learn how to
integrate that technology,

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:27.050
to understand it, and
explain it to people.

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:28.870
But we're utilizing
a lot of those things

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:31.610
now because we're also
looking at markers

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:33.640
that show what degree
of health you're in,

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.890
not just looking for--

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:40.510
the old way was sort of
looking at markers for disease.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:43.850
And if you have this lab value,
then you have this disease.

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:47.110
But we can look at
more shades of gray

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:49.540
now and keep people in the
green rather than waiting

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.400
until the yellow or the red.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.110
And just more
quickly, I would also

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:56.980
just add that I do have concerns
about technology, especially

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:58.960
our attachment to it.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.750
And I think that this is
somewhat pseudo generational.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:04.290
I'm a little bit older
than my wife, for example,

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:06.490
and we use our phones
completely different.

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:11.290
But there's only a five year,
seven year gap in there.

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:13.270
And the attachment
to texting, or I

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:15.490
can't have a moment
sometimes with my family

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:18.149
without having to
capture it in Instagram.

00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:19.690
And that's concerning
to me because I

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:22.300
think I see so many people
that are out on a hike,

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.790
and they stop and
take a picture,

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:27.324
like I'll look at that later,
rather than actually taking

00:29:27.324 --> 00:29:28.490
in the beauty in the moment.

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:31.515
So it is, again, back
to being present.

00:29:31.515 --> 00:29:32.098
JEFFREY EGLER:

00:29:32.098 --> 00:29:32.330
TOM FREEMAN: Thanks.

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:34.288
Yeah, I think this is a
really interesting one.

00:29:34.288 --> 00:29:37.060
Headspace started as an events
company quite a few years ago.

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.330
So at first, we were
kind of like just

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:41.370
like this, just speakers.

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:44.100
And then we use
technology to really think

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:45.840
about how we could
scale our product.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.090
And the vision of Headspace
is to improve the health

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:49.214
and happiness of the world.

00:29:49.214 --> 00:29:51.210
And doing that through
the online means,

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:53.300
we found that to be
really, really powerful.

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.050
But also we're kind
of aware of this irony

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:57.990
of like offering guided
meditations through a phone.

00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:59.464
It's a really common question.

00:29:59.464 --> 00:30:00.630
Like, we get it from people.

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:01.540
And it comes in.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.060
And, yeah, like, it's
a great question.

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:05.310
And we're aware of that irony.

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:08.040
But at the same time, like
it's being covered here,

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.740
it's all about that
relationship with your phone.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.950
The iPhone in your
pocket, or Android,

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:17.370
is just a lump of glass and
metal and plastic, right?

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:20.160
But how you engage with that
product is entirely up to you

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:20.790
in your mind.

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:21.960
That's where it starts.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.710
So that's kind of our
perspective on that.

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:26.190
And through
mindfulness, I think you

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:29.700
can learn to react and
engage with that product

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.930
in a different way.

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:33.670
So it's actually
quite interesting.

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:35.190
Every year, we do
a company retreat.

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:38.770
And for one day we take the team
away from the office for a day.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:40.950
And part of that is
that everyone kind of

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:44.316
gives their phones to
me and to our team.

00:30:44.316 --> 00:30:46.690
And in the morning you kind
of see these people thinking,

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:48.870
oh, I've been on my
phone for five years.

00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:49.621
I haven't checked.

00:30:49.621 --> 00:30:51.786
Hasn't been a day without
Instagram for three years.

00:30:51.786 --> 00:30:52.920
And you see this reaction.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.420
It's really, really interesting.

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:57.346
And for some people it's
really hard, and we get it.

00:30:57.346 --> 00:30:59.220
But at the end of the
day, you're like, whoa.

00:30:59.220 --> 00:30:59.930
We had one last week.

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:00.638
It was whole day.

00:31:00.638 --> 00:31:03.070
It was like 12 hours
without a phone.

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:04.810
And by the end of
the day, you're like,

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:06.740
whoa, people-- well,
I thought people

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:07.830
were going to run to me saying,
can I have my phone back?

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:08.460
Can I have my phone back?

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.001
And like no one really ran to
me asking for their phone back.

00:31:11.001 --> 00:31:12.979
People were like,
whoa, this is amazing.

00:31:12.979 --> 00:31:14.770
I've had this whole
day where I haven't had

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:17.020
to take photos, upload things.

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.110
So I think, in a way,
like testing ourselves

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:21.120
to see if we can do that
is quite interesting,

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.120
even for a weekend
morning or something, just

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.310
going and putting
your phone away.

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:27.852
So there are positives
and negatives,

00:31:27.852 --> 00:31:29.476
I think, in terms of
scaling something.

00:31:29.476 --> 00:31:31.440
And if you have a phone
and you're on the go

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:35.550
and you want to train your
mind on on-the-go basis

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:38.760
without going off to a monastery
somewhere or putting robes on,

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.656
it's one way that
technology, I think,

00:31:40.656 --> 00:31:42.030
can be really,
really beneficial.

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:43.780
And of course, you can
get addicted to it.

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:45.330
I'm guilty of
scrolling endlessly

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:46.690
through Instagram and stuff.

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:49.230
But at one point, you
do catch yourself.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:50.760
You catch your mind
going, oh, this

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:51.885
is actually pretty useless.

00:31:51.885 --> 00:31:53.750
This is pretty boring.

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:55.890
It's nice showing your
friends you care about them.

00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:58.740
But it's not really showing
you care about your friends.

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.510
That's you just
ticking a picture.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:02.819
So at some point--

00:32:02.819 --> 00:32:04.360
I'm definitely not
an expert in this.

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.412
But through training and
looking how your mind works,

00:32:07.412 --> 00:32:09.870
you can think actually this
isn't a great use of your time.

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:12.510
And that's you still engaging
with that bit of glass

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:16.730
and plastic, but like it's kind
of, yeah, it starts with you, I

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:18.400
think, a big part of that.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.720
And also just to reference like
at-work piece, because fully

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:24.030
aware that as soon as
you come in the office,

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:25.600
you've got emails coming in.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.990
You've got Slacks or
whatever going on.

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:29.550
And like, yeah,
it's just a big part

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:32.672
of kind of startup
life or business

00:32:32.672 --> 00:32:33.630
life, whatever that is.

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:35.880
But I think companies can
start thinking about technology

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:36.671
in a different way.

00:32:36.671 --> 00:32:38.947
And one of the things
we do at Headspace

00:32:38.947 --> 00:32:42.090
is that we block out
no-meeting blocks in your days,

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:43.722
one at 10 o'clock
and one at 3 o'clock.

00:32:43.722 --> 00:32:45.930
We have these blocks when
people don't have meetings.

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:47.902
But in those times,
people can go off

00:32:47.902 --> 00:32:49.110
and meditate if they want to.

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:51.526
So they can kind of disengage
from technology if they want

00:32:51.526 --> 00:32:53.790
and just sit and meditate
for 10, 15 minutes.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:55.302
And we never force
it, of course,

00:32:55.302 --> 00:32:57.510
but you can go outside, take
a walk around the block,

00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:58.330
get some fresh air.

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:00.120
But I think also
companies really

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:03.200
encouraging their employees
to disengage with technology

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.780
and seeing kind of better breaks
and disengaging from technology

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:09.110
is actually a way of
being more productive

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:11.110
and engaging with technology
in a different way.

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:13.485
So there are a few different
levels to it there probably.

00:33:13.485 --> 00:33:17.310
But it does ultimately start,
I think, yeah, with your mind.

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:18.810
MELISSA MONAHAN:
That is so awesome.

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:22.166
I think we should start
thinking about that at Google.

00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:24.370
It's a really good idea.

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:27.510
Just as a personal anecdote to
a couple of things y'all said,

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:31.380
with Whole Life Challenge I can
say that there was a week where

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:34.030
you could only check
social media once a day.

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:35.370
And it was hard.

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:37.770
We had to turn notifications
off our phones.

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:38.690
It's hard.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:40.500
Yeah, I think
that's part of it is

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:43.596
if you want to move towards
a lifestyle like that, where

00:33:43.596 --> 00:33:44.970
you're only checking
it that way,

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:46.960
you got to get the
notifications off.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.793
Otherwise you're like,
oh, someone liked it.

00:33:48.793 --> 00:33:49.920
Oh, my god, look.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.700
And then on the
positive, I wanted

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:54.840
to say just an interesting
story is that years ago I

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:56.800
was in an international
development field

00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:00.300
and was working in Afghanistan
briefly and wanted to do yoga.

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.300
And I learned about
Yoga Glow and actually

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:06.270
did a bunch of Dice's
classes in Afghanistan,

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:09.150
where there was barely
any internet connection

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:11.100
and really enhanced my practice.

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.800
And so thinking on the
positive side of technology

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.870
and how you said there's
a global community,

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:18.397
I would have never had that
without this kind of thing.

00:34:18.397 --> 00:34:19.980
So I think it is all
about the balance

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:21.604
and not letting it
take over your life,

00:34:21.604 --> 00:34:23.659
but using it to your advantage.

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:26.040
So just some anecdotes.

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.690
So you kind of
already-- like Tom,

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:29.523
you were already kind
of talking about this.

00:34:29.523 --> 00:34:30.780
But this is a good segue.

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:34.360
If you could, and you can,
what one piece of advice would

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.159
you give to audience
members who want

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:38.800
to improve their
overall well-being,

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.872
one piece of advice.

00:34:40.872 --> 00:34:44.300
And we can start the other
way, just to spice it up.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:45.510
TOM FREEMAN: Excellent.

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:48.357
So yeah, this is me just
speaking personally.

00:34:48.357 --> 00:34:50.440
But definitely taking some
time out of your day to

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.429
look after your mind.

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:54.013
I think it starts
with just 10 minutes.

00:34:54.013 --> 00:34:56.429
And through Headspace you can
do three-minute meditations.

00:34:56.429 --> 00:34:57.640
You can do a
one-minute meditation

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.889
if you're really, really busy.

00:34:58.889 --> 00:35:01.140
But kind of making a priority
just for sitting there

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.132
around doing nothing.

00:35:02.132 --> 00:35:04.090
I think, as we're so
busy, we're running around

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:05.710
from meeting to meeting
or getting to work

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:07.600
or stuck in traffic or
whatever that is, just

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:12.740
blocking out that 10 minutes
just to have time for yourself,

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:13.240
I think.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.656
And then the benefits, and
speaking personally again here,

00:35:15.656 --> 00:35:19.340
but the benefits it can have
on so many areas of your life.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:22.360
So in terms of your relationship
with stress or anxiety,

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.590
there's no way I would have
been up here on a panel

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:26.031
two or three years ago.

00:35:26.031 --> 00:35:28.030
I would have probably
been in the kitchen eating

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:29.440
loads of food.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:32.050
But anyway, and I'm still
there but that relationship

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:34.480
with how you relate
to everyday things,

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:38.650
whether it's stress,
anxiety, sports, eating,

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:39.520
all those things.

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.901
I think, if it starts with
just taking time for yourself

00:35:42.901 --> 00:35:45.400
personally, that's kind of, I
think, a huge benefit in that.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.437
So just blocking out
10 minutes in your day

00:35:48.437 --> 00:35:50.020
in the morning maybe
after you get up,

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:51.750
before brush your teeth.

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:55.300
Personally, also, anchoring
it to like an everyday thing.

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:57.030
Another common
question we get is,

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:58.450
I don't have the
time to meditate.

00:35:58.450 --> 00:35:59.866
I don't have 10
minutes in my day.

00:35:59.866 --> 00:36:02.980
And it can sound--

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.480
some people it's
like, wh 10 minutes

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.479
doesn't sound very much.

00:36:05.479 --> 00:36:07.710
But when you're busy, it is.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:09.820
But finding that time to
anchor it into your days,

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:11.340
maybe after you
brush your teeth.

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:13.381
Hopefully everyone brushes
their teeth every day.

00:36:13.381 --> 00:36:15.250
If they don't, that's cool.

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:17.500
But, yeah, anchoring it to
something you do every day,

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.376
and then you say, OK,
after I brush my teeth,

00:36:19.376 --> 00:36:21.541
I'm going to sit for 10
minutes before I go to work,

00:36:21.541 --> 00:36:22.600
before I jump in the car.

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.710
And then it's done for the day.

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:25.600
And that can help you
set up your whole day

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.692
in a different way.

00:36:26.692 --> 00:36:28.400
And for some people,
it's in the evening.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.430
For some people, it's
after lunch at work,

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:32.320
just finding a room
at work to do that in.

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.486
Whatever works for you,
whatever time works for you,

00:36:34.486 --> 00:36:37.680
I think just finding that
time, somewhere that's quiet,

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.677
somewhere that's
private, and just, yeah,

00:36:39.677 --> 00:36:42.010
finding 10 minutes for yourself
I think is a good start.

00:36:46.619 --> 00:36:47.910
JEFFREY EGLER: Thanks for that.

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:49.659
It's hard to come up
with something that's

00:36:49.659 --> 00:36:50.980
more important than that.

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:54.960
My off-the-cuff
doctor answer is food.

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.380
Food matters.

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.200
But I think because
that's sort of probably

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.310
more obvious to some of
the people in the room,

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:04.935
I would say that maybe a more
unique answer to me would be--

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:10.740
so I was talking a few
minutes ago about technology

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:12.810
and how all of us
here can actually

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:14.100
have a doctor in their home.

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.380
But I think many of
us would probably

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:18.890
think twice about having
a doctor in their home.

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:21.150
Do I really want a doctor
on my screens in my home

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:22.430
or at my place of work?

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:24.180
And that's what we're
trying to at Parsley

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.950
is really change
the relationship

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:29.280
of people with a doctor and
change what a doctor means.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:32.550
I don't want to be somebody
that comes to me when they're

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:34.980
sick looking for a medication.

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:37.890
I want to have relationships
with younger people,

00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:40.140
that we start to
talk about health.

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:43.110
And what Tom was saying
before about some of us

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.540
feel like we don't have 10
minutes in a day to meditate.

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.550
And I would say if
that's your mentality,

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:51.297
you've probably got a lot
bigger problems than that.

00:37:51.297 --> 00:37:53.130
And when what I mean
by that is you probably

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:55.260
have a lifestyle that's not
going to really work out so

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:56.620
well for you in the long term.

00:37:56.620 --> 00:38:00.180
And so having somebody that you
trust, whether it's a physician

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:02.430
or a different type
of provider that

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:04.320
can help you look
objectively at your life

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.986
at an early stage when you think
things are going well and maybe

00:38:06.986 --> 00:38:08.550
start to accumulate some data--

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:10.410
I agree with Andy
that we don't want

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:14.460
to necessarily don't
need to always obsess

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.280
about minor pieces of data.

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.030
But they can be helpful
to kind of give us

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:21.810
a reflection if we are really
as healthy as we think we are

00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:23.820
and to rethink some
of our health habits.

00:38:27.054 --> 00:38:28.820
KIM WHITMAN: Yeah,
all in agreement.

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.900
And I have to say, though, the
one thing that you should do

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:34.690
is yoga.

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:35.200
Obviously.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.990
MELISSA MONAHAN: So this
was sponsored by Yoglers.

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:39.454
gPause.

00:38:39.454 --> 00:38:40.120
KIM WHITMAN: No.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:44.140
Well, and I only say that
because I now preach meditation

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:45.160
as my number one thing.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.520
But I would never have
gotten there without yoga.

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:51.520
It actually took me eight
years of yoga practice,

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:53.770
consistent practice,
and a yoga show

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:56.230
that I happened to be running
as well to actually commit

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:57.730
to a meditation practice.

00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:00.880
And I think the only
reason was that yoga

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.210
is a moving meditation.

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:06.340
So as a monkey-minded
person that can't sit still,

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:09.950
and I like to ski and I'm always
sore from doing something,

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:12.760
I needed that segue
into meditation

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:13.930
with a physical practice.

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:16.630
And actually, yoga was
really designed just

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:19.420
to prepare your body to sit
for hours in meditation.

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:22.670
And so it truly is the
precursor to meditation.

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:24.729
So if you can do both,
then that's the way to go.

00:39:24.729 --> 00:39:26.770
And one more thing I want
to say about meditation

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:29.620
is I have started
giving-- be gentle

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:32.470
to yourself is the other
piece of advice, I guess,

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:33.630
that I have for everyone.

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:37.630
And you don't have
to be so hard core

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:40.450
and like-- so I've allowed
myself to do the morning

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:44.350
meditation in Savasana in
my bed with a little pillow

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:45.100
over my eyes.

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:47.524
And if I fall back
asleep, it's OK

00:39:47.524 --> 00:39:48.940
because I needed
that extra sleep.

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:53.470
But I do my 20 minutes every
morning from my pillow,

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:54.790
and that's fine.

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:55.930
I don't have to be a monk.

00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:58.000
So start with that.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.770
And then if you can
work it in, instead

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:02.260
of going for the second cup
of coffee in the afternoon

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:08.020
when you start to drag, go and
do your second 20 minute or 10

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:09.070
or whatever is--

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:10.120
3.

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.470
But, yeah, yoga
leads to meditation,

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:13.470
which is the ultimate.

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:14.540
And be nice to yourself.

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:19.107
Those are three
pieces of advice.

00:40:19.107 --> 00:40:20.690
DICE IIDA-KLEIN: I
mean, I'm basically

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:22.120
going to be saying
the same thing,

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.989
I think, that everybody said
because they're all honest ways

00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:27.280
to really help yourself,
especially if you're, I think,

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.080
working with a tech company.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:32.380
But definitely just
to add on, I think

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.540
being able to put down
your technology is huge,

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:35.800
and it's so hard.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.860
I know in my household
specifically,

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:40.070
I have a four-year-old.

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:45.490
Watching someone that young be
so attracted to technology so

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:48.970
early on, having to limit
his use and even TV use,

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:50.300
it's pretty amazing.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:52.104
It's made him much more--

00:40:52.104 --> 00:40:53.770
when I used to give
him more technology,

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:58.690
he honestly was so quick at--

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:01.480
instant gratification became
more and more like apparent.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.820
He would want to change
things so quickly, so often.

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.080
And once I started to get
him off of technology more

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.630
and weaned him off
of it, his ability

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:09.088
actually pay
attention to one thing

00:41:09.088 --> 00:41:11.330
became a whole lot better.

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:13.880
And that's just a
four-year-old, who is really,

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:16.030
I think, in the more present
moment than many of us

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:17.410
are as adults.

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:19.964
So as adults, if all you
ever do is sit at a computer

00:41:19.964 --> 00:41:21.880
and you're on your phone
and you're constantly

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.440
having to stay connected with
your business, your emails

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:25.648
and all that, I think although
it may seem difficult,

00:41:25.648 --> 00:41:28.270
and you're like, well,
I run my life this way,

00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:29.950
taking 30 minutes--
or if you have

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:31.570
a rule of like
stepping into your home

00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:33.695
and literally dropping it
into a bucket for an hour

00:41:33.695 --> 00:41:34.360
or something.

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:37.270
Things like that will definitely
help you out in the long run

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:39.700
up here, for sure.

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:43.240
I think on the more, I think,
meditation, the physical realm,

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:46.015
yoga asana and all
of that, with yoga,

00:41:46.015 --> 00:41:47.390
there's so many
different realms.

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:50.500
There's so many different limbs
or legs to it, you could say.

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:53.770
And for most of us, we're
a highly physical culture

00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:55.450
or being, really, right?

00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:57.970
So we really relate to our
bodies and our physical self.

00:41:57.970 --> 00:41:59.920
The more we exercise
and move, typically

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:01.390
the better we feel up top.

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:02.849
But you start to
realize that there

00:42:02.849 --> 00:42:04.848
are so many other elements
that you can work on.

00:42:04.848 --> 00:42:06.490
And what it all comes
down to, I think,

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:08.590
personally, is you're
just always working

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:11.740
on self-improvement,
self-betterment,

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:13.660
self-awareness, and
realizing what things

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:17.080
make you feel better, also
what things make you tick, what

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.940
things sends you off
the deep end, how

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:22.137
you react to certain situations,
people, things like that.

00:42:22.137 --> 00:42:24.220
The more you start to ask
those kinds of questions

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:26.140
about yourself and not
necessarily be attached

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:29.290
to a good or bad
outlook on yourself,

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:32.624
I think the better you're
going to be in the long run.

00:42:32.624 --> 00:42:34.040
It'll make you a
healthier person,

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.040
especially if you're
around something

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.870
as amazing as technology
that you guys are

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:40.350
using all the time.

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:40.850
Yeah.

00:42:43.517 --> 00:42:45.100
ANDY PETRANEK: So I
love this question

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:46.750
because I've been
asked that a lot.

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:48.890
And in developing the
Whole Life Challenge,

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:50.710
I had thought about
it a lot because we

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:53.320
have a much broader context.

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.240
We have seven daily
habits, as opposed to--

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.830
and they're all important.

00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:58.480
All these answers
have been fantastic.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.563
And they're all important.

00:42:59.563 --> 00:43:03.010
So the question then is,
well, where do I start?

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:05.640
And where do I go?

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:09.160
And what I always tell people
is there are two things.

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:13.180
The best way to start is to
walk through the door you're

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:15.640
willing to walk through.

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:19.330
If somebody came into my gym and
all they wanted to talk about

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.910
was being able to
do 100 push-ups,

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:25.824
I wouldn't start talking to
them about food or meditation,

00:43:25.824 --> 00:43:27.490
because that's not
the door that they're

00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:29.860
willing to walk through.

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:34.090
So if you are considering
getting started down the health

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:37.330
path, if you want to go
down the meditation route,

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:39.040
that's the route
you should take.

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:42.370
And that route, kind of
like what you were saying,

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:44.710
is that leads to other things.

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:49.480
Yoga leads to meditation
and might lead to push-ups.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.330
You know, when you
do enough Chaturangas

00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:54.310
and fall on your
face, you might need

00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:57.520
to strengthen your upper body.

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:01.730
But take the path that
you're willing to go through

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:05.320
and use that as you're keystone.

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:08.170
Like we deal with habits a lot
in the Whole Life Challenge.

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:09.880
So use that as your
keystone habit.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:12.040
And if you're
willing to address,

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.320
say, sleep in your life, great.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:18.490
If you improve your sleep
by 20 minutes a night or you

00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:22.300
improve the quality or the
lack of light in your bedroom,

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:22.861
fantastic.

00:44:22.861 --> 00:44:24.610
And you start feeling
a little bit better,

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:27.250
than maybe you'll have a little
bit more energy with which

00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:29.041
to deal with some of
the stress that you're

00:44:29.041 --> 00:44:30.220
feeling with your spouse.

00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:31.930
And maybe when you start
dealing with the stress

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:33.430
that you're feeling
with your spouse

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:36.101
a little bit better, maybe
that leads to, oh, man,

00:44:36.101 --> 00:44:37.600
now I've got the
energy to work out,

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.141
and I'm going to actually get
up in the morning and work out.

00:44:40.141 --> 00:44:41.500
So it's kind of like--

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:42.750
it's like a snowball effect.

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:45.080
And it's a more meta answer.

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:46.940
I don't have an answer for you.

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:49.957
You've got to be willing to
find the thing and the door

00:44:49.957 --> 00:44:51.790
that you're willing to
walk through and then

00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:53.741
walk through it,

00:44:53.882 --> 00:44:55.840
MELISSA MONAHAN: These
are all awesome answers,

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.304
I hope y'all are taking note.

00:44:58.304 --> 00:44:59.470
That's going to be on video.

00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:01.720
I realized I never introduced
myself at the beginning.

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:05.150
I'm Melissa Monahan.

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:08.710
I'm a recruiter here and
our yogler representative,

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:12.110
and this talk is for
yogler, gPause, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:15.100
So I realize you might be like--
actually, I know half the room,

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:15.890
but it's fine.

00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:18.070
KIM WHITMAN: And you
also teach the yoga here.

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:19.540
MELISSA MONAHAN: I also
teach yoga every Friday,

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:20.207
so check it out.

00:45:20.207 --> 00:45:21.165
KIM WHITMAN: Plug that.

00:45:21.165 --> 00:45:22.240
MELISSA MONAHAN: Plug it.

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:25.230
So one last question, and then
we have a couple of minutes

00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:26.980
for audience questions,
if y'all have any.

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:29.890
So please take advantage
of these experts.

00:45:29.890 --> 00:45:34.495
Back to the tech topic, as you
know, Google's a tech company.

00:45:34.495 --> 00:45:35.870
And there's lots
of us out there.

00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:37.744
So what would you like
to see tech companies,

00:45:37.744 --> 00:45:42.017
like Google or others, do or
invent to further innovate

00:45:42.017 --> 00:45:43.100
within the wellness space?

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:46.725
So this could be a product, a
campaign, advocacy, anything

00:45:46.725 --> 00:45:47.350
that you think?

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:50.470
When we have these types
of resources and platform,

00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:54.670
is there anything that you
would hope to see us do?

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:56.480
TOM FREEMAN: Yeah,
I think, broadly,

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.604
just thinking about diversity
and getting out there

00:45:58.604 --> 00:46:02.094
to as many people as
we can and just helping

00:46:02.094 --> 00:46:04.010
all different communities,
engaging with tech,

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:06.080
and hopefully finding
some use for it.

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:07.970
I think practically,
I don't know.

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:09.352
I sometimes do think about this.

00:46:09.352 --> 00:46:11.060
Because when you're
bombarded by so much,

00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.370
whether it's 1,000
tabs in your browser

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:16.820
or it's apps shouting
at you, this idea

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:20.930
of how can devices become
smarter to like switch off.

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:22.680
Is there like an
out-of-office mode?

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:23.570
Your phone goes on.

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:25.940
And then you put it
for x-hours a day.

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:28.330
And your phone is just,
like, no one can reach you.

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:30.800
And then your phone sends in
my office saying, actually,

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.332
Tom is offline for two hours.

00:46:32.332 --> 00:46:33.790
He'll get back to
you at lunchtime.

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:36.490
But how can our devices, how
can software become smarter,

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:37.480
whether it's--

00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:41.510
gosh, I should probably sign
an NDA actually for this idea.

00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:45.020
But like even a browser,
can a browser shut down?

00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:47.510
Or does your browser
reminds you every half hour

00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:49.250
to take a minute
to do something,

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:51.680
whether it's a minute of
meditation or something

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.513
like that, just something
that's popping up.

00:46:53.513 --> 00:46:55.550
I think the pop-up thing
can be really annoying.

00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:57.210
At the same time,
we're reminded to break

00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:57.860
you're habits in a day.

00:46:57.860 --> 00:46:59.090
It's also quite interesting.

00:46:59.090 --> 00:47:03.042
So I think, yeah, just something
software wise is helping us,

00:47:03.042 --> 00:47:05.000
that relationship with
tech in a different way,

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.070
reminding us to
disconnect, I think,

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:10.700
rather than just us letting
it be owned and open more tabs

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:12.800
and get more apps
shouting at us.

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.620
How can we actually let
our devices kind of control

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:16.730
us for a bit, I think?

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:17.150
MELISSA MONAHAN: I like that.

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:17.650
Cool.

00:47:20.885 --> 00:47:22.260
JEFFREY EGLER:
All right, Google.

00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.047
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:24.047 --> 00:47:25.630
I've been waiting
for Google to ask me

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:26.880
this question for a long time.

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:27.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:30.277
So I'm excited right now.

00:47:30.277 --> 00:47:32.860
All right, Google your mission,
should you choose to accept it

00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:33.600
is this.

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:37.690
So this is a very
selfish request.

00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:40.840
But it is in the
interest of all patients.

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:44.590
And that is what we have seen
in technology on the physician

00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:46.200
side of things in
the past 10 years,

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:49.780
there's been a lot of
incredible developments.

00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:52.630
And a lot of them we can
hold in the palm of our hand.

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:55.990
But what I have been
completely underwhelmed with

00:47:55.990 --> 00:48:00.250
is the lack of
significant benefit

00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:01.780
of electronic medical records.

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:04.840
So over a decade or so,
this was the big boom

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.250
in health industry, right?

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:10.270
And it's now a
billion-dollar industry.

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:14.440
There's too many
to count, scores

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:16.430
of electronic medical
records systems.

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:19.600
But what they are
all really lacking

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.360
is what we had hoped
for in the first place.

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.190
Really, the original
intent is clear

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:28.060
and clinical decision
support systems,

00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:31.780
help physicians take all the
data that is available to them

00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:34.620
and make better decisions
with their patients,

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:37.470
not for their patients.

00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:41.080
And now we're seeing
such an explosion

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:42.610
of even more and more data.

00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:45.460
Genetics information
is now available to us.

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:49.010
Information regarding the
microbiome in your gut,

00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:51.280
I can go on and on and on
with the different types

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:54.250
of testing that we do in our
more cutting-edge practice.

00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:59.110
But the problem is with more
data comes more complexity.

00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:01.870
And there is no right
answer for everybody.

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:05.114
What doctors typically
use are guidelines.

00:49:05.114 --> 00:49:07.030
This is the historic way
that doctors operate.

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:10.060
And guidelines are basically
based on population medicine,

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:10.870
large studies.

00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:13.090
And so we need ways to
integrate all of these things.

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:16.120
The cognitive load for
physicians is too great.

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.479
There are too many factors
to help people decide

00:49:18.479 --> 00:49:20.270
what are the best
decisions for themselves,

00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:24.430
even whether it's diet or how to
sleep or what kind of exercise

00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:25.100
to be doing.

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:29.230
So I think that the greatest
revolution in the future moving

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:32.800
forward will be AI
and other technologies

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.340
that help doctors take
all this information

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:38.470
and boil it down to the
best recommendations

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:41.030
for individual patients.

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:42.910
So there you go.

00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:44.612
I'm available to talk to, too.

00:49:44.612 --> 00:49:46.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:48.220
KIM WHITMAN: Yeah,
that was amazing.

00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:49.720
Actually, agree
with all of that.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.990
And I'm going to take mine until
way more entertainment lean.

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:58.080
It's not nearly as critical
for human survival.

00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:59.980
But I love that.

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:02.560
No, I am very-- as
Yoga Today has always

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:05.320
been sort of in the forefront
of like production quality

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:09.140
for bringing the user
into an experience.

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:12.250
We shoot them 4K
in national parks.

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:14.132
And people are like,
is that a green screen?

00:50:14.132 --> 00:50:16.090
And like do you realize
how much work that was?

00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:17.670
It was not a green screen, OK?

00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:20.695
We're in with like flies
buzzing around us and bison.

00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:23.320
Anyways, the point
is I want to be

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:26.710
able to use VR to
give people in cities

00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:29.920
that aren't in these beautiful
places the same experience.

00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:32.980
Because I can't describe to
you what it's like to do a yoga

00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:34.570
show in front of the Tetons.

00:50:34.570 --> 00:50:37.270
Like to be on the show, you're
just like, what is happening?

00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:38.320
It's so amazing.

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:41.650
And people just don't
get enough connection

00:50:41.650 --> 00:50:44.950
with the natural world, now
that I'm trying living in city--

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:48.220
I'm trying to live in
LA, and it's different.

00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:51.160
And so I want to give
people that access

00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:53.834
to the natural world through VR.

00:50:53.834 --> 00:50:55.750
I know they're already
doing VR yoga in Korea.

00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:56.980
I'm going to go check it out.

00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:58.210
Yeah, I know.

00:50:58.210 --> 00:50:59.050
It's so cool.

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:01.041
And I think it's more
like animatronic.

00:51:01.041 --> 00:51:03.040
And we want it to be like
high-production value,

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:04.720
and then we want
the Google Glass

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:08.830
to be able to just flip from
I'm in the Tetons with them,

00:51:08.830 --> 00:51:11.590
or I'm in a studio
with a bunch of people.

00:51:11.590 --> 00:51:15.130
And after class be able to
make that connection face

00:51:15.130 --> 00:51:17.440
to face with people
instead of, oh, I

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:19.360
see 16 people are in
this class with me.

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.890
But I don't see them.

00:51:20.890 --> 00:51:23.650
So I am so excited about VR.

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:25.640
And that's when I'm
geeking out on right now.

00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:30.340
And that's where I want
Google to come help us out.

00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:31.130
Cool.

00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:33.130
MELISSA MONAHAN: There's
some engineers in here.

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.530
DICE IIDA-KLEIN: I think
what I want to say is Google,

00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:42.862
keep doing what you're doing.

00:51:42.862 --> 00:51:44.320
Just being able to
be up on a panel

00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:48.434
like this with other health
professionals and wellness

00:51:48.434 --> 00:51:50.350
professionals and being
able to talk about it,

00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:53.430
that's already something
that you guys are amazing at.

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:56.200
And it's bringing, I think,
more and more of, I guess,

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:59.680
bigger companies or bigger
conglomerates kind of coming

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:01.430
together and cooperating
with one another,

00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:04.030
I think, to just help
other human beings out.

00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:06.860
That's all I ask
you guys keep doing.

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:09.880
You guys have so much power in
the world, I mean, literally.

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:13.181
And it's a cheesy line,
but with great power

00:52:13.181 --> 00:52:14.305
comes great responsibility.

00:52:14.305 --> 00:52:15.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:20.060
And in a sense, doing
what you're doing,

00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:23.710
which is trying to
bring ease, technology,

00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:26.100
make things better for human
beings around the world.

00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:29.480
But I think it starts with the
collaboration and the coming

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:29.980
together.

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:32.170
And that's huge, so you
guys are already doing it.

00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:33.320
Just keep doing it.

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:36.621
And realize the impact
that you have on the world.

00:52:36.621 --> 00:52:37.120
That's all.

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.151
I think that's all I got.

00:52:39.151 --> 00:52:41.650
MELISSA MONAHAN: And I think
we could do more collaboration,

00:52:41.650 --> 00:52:44.050
because we can do this,
but sometimes we're

00:52:44.050 --> 00:52:45.640
competitive with
other tech companies.

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:48.610
And we're not necessarily
always working together to do.

00:52:48.610 --> 00:52:49.570
DICE IIDA-KLEIN: And I know
it's not one sided on that.

00:52:49.570 --> 00:52:49.880
MELISSA MONAHAN: Yeah.

00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:51.320
DICE IIDA-KLEIN: It
takes two to tango.

00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:52.210
MELISSA MONAHAN: But it's good.

00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:52.710
I like that.

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:53.710
It's good thinking.

00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:54.257
Andy?

00:52:54.257 --> 00:52:55.840
ANDY PETRANEK: Have
you guys ever seen

00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:56.840
the show "Black Mirror"?

00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:59.710
MELISSA MONAHAN: Oh,
I love all of them.

00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:00.932
ANDY PETRANEK: Don't do that.

00:53:00.932 --> 00:53:02.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:08.350
Because my brain goes-- like,
I cannot wait for my car to be

00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:10.060
the last car that I ever drive.

00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:14.820
I'm so excited about autonomous
vehicles and driving.

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:15.610
I love driving.

00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:17.068
It's not that I
don't like driving.

00:53:17.068 --> 00:53:20.620
But I want to do it when I
go to a racetrack for fun.

00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:22.489
I don't need to
drive around town.

00:53:22.489 --> 00:53:24.280
I can't wait to order
up my car, and my car

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:26.840
shows up without a driver and
takes me where I need to go.

00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:28.690
And then it never has to park.

00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:30.880
It can just be cruising
around, waiting

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:34.030
to pick up the next person.

00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:38.260
But "Black Mirror," holy crap.

00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:40.780
It just takes it to
the next extreme,

00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:43.690
like chips and
being able to delete

00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:46.840
your memory and your
people out of your life

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:49.220
and kill people
through technology.

00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:51.110
It's just crazy.

00:53:51.110 --> 00:53:53.830
So if you haven't watched
it, it's a great show to--

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:55.596
well, maybe it's
not a great show.

00:53:55.596 --> 00:53:56.428
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:56.428 --> 00:53:57.260
MELISSA MONAHAN: It's
a great show I love it.

00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:58.343
ANDY PETRANEK: It's scary.

00:53:58.343 --> 00:54:01.000
It's black.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.810
But no, seriously, I
agree 100% with what

00:54:03.810 --> 00:54:05.920
Dice said about
being responsible,

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:11.620
like removing consciousness
and removing awareness

00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:16.150
from the human, making us
less human through the use

00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:18.800
of technology would be a
step in the wrong direction.

00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:22.570
And so I think Google
being conscious

00:54:22.570 --> 00:54:24.970
of what they're developing
and how they're developing it,

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:27.840
and then what's the-- we always
have to think about rules.

00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:31.030
As a professional
athlete, you tend

00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:34.210
to win things when
you're either the fastest

00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:37.450
or you're the best at
skirting the rules just

00:54:37.450 --> 00:54:39.055
inside the barriers
of the rules.

00:54:39.055 --> 00:54:40.930
And I think one of the
things with technology

00:54:40.930 --> 00:54:43.502
is, well, at least
when we do it,

00:54:43.502 --> 00:54:45.460
is we have to think,
well, how are people going

00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:48.850
to use this rule
either in their favor

00:54:48.850 --> 00:54:51.730
or maybe not in their favor
in order to score points

00:54:51.730 --> 00:54:54.160
or in order to get
a better score?

00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:56.820
And I think that
is very important

00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:58.630
that technology
companies, especially

00:54:58.630 --> 00:55:00.970
ones with as much
power as Google,

00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:02.740
are aware of and conscious of.

00:55:03.985 --> 00:55:05.230
MELISSA MONAHAN: Great.

00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:07.280
Those are great--
this is a great panel.

00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:08.900
I'm just going to tell you.

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:11.120
So we are at 1:00.

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.440
Does anyone have questions?

00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:14.330
We have the really awesome--

00:55:14.330 --> 00:55:16.622
all right, I just want
to throw it to you.

00:55:16.622 --> 00:55:19.803
So let's see what
this is all about.

00:55:19.803 --> 00:55:20.969
DICE IIDA-KLEIN: What is it?

00:55:20.969 --> 00:55:22.514
MELISSA MONAHAN:
It's a microphone.

00:55:22.514 --> 00:55:23.180
AUDIENCE: Hello?

00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:31.520
Let's see, so I immediately
forgot my question

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:33.336
once I was put on the spot.

00:55:33.336 --> 00:55:34.815
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:41.150
So, yeah, there is kind of
this paradox of wellness

00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:44.090
and technology being
1,000 years old,

00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:47.780
and then also it seems like
it's really advancing really

00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:49.490
quickly right now.

00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:53.330
And so there's a lot
of experimentation

00:55:53.330 --> 00:55:54.440
being done with both.

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:58.010
And so with that
we get fads, which

00:55:58.010 --> 00:56:04.340
are initially a good idea, but
they might not have longevity.

00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:07.010
What are some fads
that you can't

00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:14.030
wait to see go away forever, be
they socially or different apps

00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:17.390
or products in your
respective fields?

00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:25.640
And then to be less cynical,
what are some things that you

00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:29.540
wish you saw more of
or perhaps directions

00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:32.060
for your respective
fields in the near term?

00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:36.890
ANDY PETRANEK: I can
answer that first one.

00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:38.540
I don't think
they'll ever go away.

00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:41.750
But they need to go away is
this idea that a diet can

00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:43.290
solve your problems.

00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:45.310
There's any one diet
that's the right diet

00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:48.440
and that you can do it in four
months or four weeks or eight

00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:50.927
weeks, or like you'll
do it and it'll be over

00:56:50.927 --> 00:56:52.760
and you'll achieve what
you want to achieve,

00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:54.560
and then you can get
on with your life.

00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:55.920
It's just not true.

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:57.290
And it never will be true.

00:56:57.290 --> 00:57:00.892
And it's like a
layer of an onion.

00:57:00.892 --> 00:57:03.350
You keep peeling it, peeling
it, and you keep working at it

00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:04.308
and keep working at it.

00:57:04.308 --> 00:57:07.310
And it's a lifelong
journey that you're on.

00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:11.240
I'd love to see diets
just die a quick death.

00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:14.450
I don't remember your
second question, so.

00:57:14.450 --> 00:57:16.860
JEFFREY EGLER: I'll piggyback
on that, if you don't mind.

00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:18.860
And I can pick on a couple
of fads, if you like.

00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:23.480
But one of the trends that
I would like to see go away

00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:26.030
is just what Andy
was referring to is

00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:31.580
the overnight fixes, the magic
bullets, the eight-minute abs.

00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:36.770
So as an example, Parsley,
we do year-long memberships.

00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:38.540
And we have a membership
model because we

00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:41.150
don't believe that people get
healthy with one magic visit

00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:44.840
to a super smart doctor.

00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:46.760
We think that it's a process.

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:51.459
Again, a cheesy line, but
it's a journey, not an event.

00:57:51.459 --> 00:57:53.000
And so that's what
we're trying to do

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.430
is that people get on the
trolley with this thing

00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:56.810
that we're going to develop.

00:57:56.810 --> 00:57:59.210
And like you said
also before, we're

00:57:59.210 --> 00:58:02.510
going to pick that one door that
you're willing to walk through.

00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:04.130
And so many people were just
like, well, I want to do this.

00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:04.670
Then I want to do this.

00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:05.270
Then I want to do this.

00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:06.860
I want to get the most
out of my first 30 days.

00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:08.930
You will get the most
out of your first 30 days

00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:11.719
when you are successful at the
most important thing that's

00:58:11.719 --> 00:58:13.010
standing right in front of you.

00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:15.050
I always tell people
that if I give you

00:58:15.050 --> 00:58:19.250
one thing to do this month,
you have an 85% or so chance

00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:20.910
of successfully doing that.

00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:23.710
But if I give you just
two, it drops to below 50%.

00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:26.330
And if I give you three, it's
down less than 15% as well.

00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:29.990
So putting one foot in
front of the other, I think,

00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:31.430
is the best way to go.

00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:36.002
And then the thing I'd like to
see us get rid of is gluten.

00:58:36.002 --> 00:58:36.710
I'm just kidding.

00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:38.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:38.790 --> 00:58:41.900
But I do bring up
gluten-free diets

00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:45.470
as an example of further
educating ourselves,

00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:48.720
because what I have seen
with gluten is it's a fad.

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:49.500
It's a real thing.

00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:51.166
I mean people have
gluten sensitivities.

00:58:51.166 --> 00:58:53.600
But in the science that
we're using and incorporating

00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:56.660
is that not everybody
is going to benefit

00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:57.727
from a gluten-free diet.

00:58:57.727 --> 00:58:59.810
There is a certain percentage
of people that will.

00:58:59.810 --> 00:59:01.768
And what we've also
learned now is that there's

00:59:01.768 --> 00:59:04.325
what we've suspected all
along, as physicians,

00:59:04.325 --> 00:59:06.200
is that it might be
gluten, but it's probably

00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:08.390
some other things in wheat.

00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:10.310
And now we can test
for those things too.

00:59:10.310 --> 00:59:12.710
So I bring it up
as sort of a joke.

00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:14.750
And certainly it's a real thing.

00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:17.319
But it's not just that.

00:59:17.319 --> 00:59:18.860
And there's other
things that we need

00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:23.347
to be informing people about.

00:59:23.347 --> 00:59:25.680
KIM WHITMAN: And I'd like to
answer the second question.

00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:27.920
One thing that I think
is not going away,

00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:30.320
and maybe I'm just
an eternal optimist,

00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:32.400
but I think it's mindfulness.

00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:36.570
I think as we dive
deeper into AI and tech,

00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:39.560
and as our society leans
harder on machine learning

00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:44.300
and all of this, I think we're
A, freeing up our time so

00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:46.280
that we can act more
productively, I hope,

00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:48.530
is what's happening.

00:59:48.530 --> 00:59:51.440
And that's where we're
going to be moving

00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:55.490
more towards the mindfulness
space and yoga and health

00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:59.850
and wellness and connection,
human connection.

00:59:59.850 --> 01:00:03.170
And I think people need it more
and more as we are surrounded

01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:05.250
in like a media cloud.

01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:06.990
We need to be able to separate.

01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:08.970
And people are recognizing that.

01:00:08.970 --> 01:00:11.040
And I feel really optimistic.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.200
I know you look at the
younger generation,

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.980
and you're like, how
is that possible?

01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:18.360
But I think there's going to be
a tipping point with everybody.

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:22.300
And I'm optimistic that
that's going to stick around.

01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:24.945
I hope.

01:00:24.945 --> 01:00:27.330
MELISSA MONAHAN: Great.

01:00:27.330 --> 01:00:28.674
Any other questions?

01:00:28.674 --> 01:00:29.715
Toss that mic back there.

01:00:29.715 --> 01:00:30.669
I know we're over time,
but these are really

01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:31.150
all great questions.

01:00:31.150 --> 01:00:31.775
AUDIENCE: Test.

01:00:31.775 --> 01:00:33.340
Test.

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:36.880
So I think it's wonderful that
at a technology and fitness

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.830
convention plays
the devil's advocate

01:00:38.830 --> 01:00:41.680
and says turn your phone
off and find yourself.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.496
And I love that.

01:00:43.496 --> 01:00:45.370
And I think all of you
are wonderful and have

01:00:45.370 --> 01:00:49.600
made the most insightful,
important recommendations

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.640
to anyone who is
either at a high level

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:54.970
or starting and entering
a door and where to go.

01:00:54.970 --> 01:00:58.570
I think in the exact
opposite direction, however,

01:00:58.570 --> 01:01:01.510
I would love to have
all six of you with me

01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:03.971
at all times in my
phone constantly

01:01:03.971 --> 01:01:06.095
monitoring me and maybe
bickering among yourselves.

01:01:06.095 --> 01:01:08.640
Be like, nah, nah, nah,
not CrossFit today.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:12.480
He needs a little headstand
and breathe, and you know what?

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.100
Eat this.

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:14.600
But I know you ate
gluten yesterday.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:15.910
You're processing it, you know?

01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:17.950
So like when is that toy coming?

01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:20.210
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:24.820
KIM WHITMAN: There's a
price tag for everything.

01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:25.467
We're willling.

01:01:25.467 --> 01:01:27.550
ANDY PETRANEK: That's super
smart, super smart AI.

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:28.765
I don't know about that.

01:01:28.765 --> 01:01:29.890
AUDIENCE: It's not, though.

01:01:29.890 --> 01:01:30.820
It's an intuition.

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:33.294
And you are all very
intuitive about your clients

01:01:33.294 --> 01:01:34.960
and about having a
relationship in a way

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.730
that AI will never have.

01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:38.040
You can see it, I'm tired.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.370
You can see it, you need this.

01:01:39.370 --> 01:01:40.870
Or you can see
it, you know what?

01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:41.470
Just breathe.

01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:42.730
Just think for a minute.

01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:46.440
And I think that is
where we're going.

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.313
And that's all.

01:01:48.313 --> 01:01:49.762
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:52.784 --> 01:01:54.200
JEFFREY EGLER: I
absolutely agree.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:54.900
And you're right.

01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:56.358
There are so many--
and that's sort

01:01:56.358 --> 01:01:58.790
of what I was speaking to
before, too, is that there are

01:01:58.790 --> 01:02:02.000
so many individual technologies
out there, like Headspace,

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.010
for example, that
are just wonderful,

01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:08.330
like the yoga businesses
that we have here.

01:02:08.330 --> 01:02:12.890
But there's a lack of bringing
those things together.

01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:14.600
And I think that
that is very cultural

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:20.220
because everybody is wanting
their business to move forward.

01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.400
But I do think that
the salvation of us

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:25.800
all will be the best
technologies working together.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:28.910
And so I, like you, look forward
to those kind of collaborations

01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:29.750
and those products.

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:34.866
AUDIENCE: Like Spotify
eventually took everything,

01:02:34.866 --> 01:02:35.490
gave it to you.

01:02:38.502 --> 01:02:39.710
MELISSA MONAHAN: I like that.

01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:41.017
Anything else?

01:02:41.017 --> 01:02:42.350
JEFFREY EGLER: The other thing--

01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:43.110
I'm sorry.

01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:43.300
MELISSA MONAHAN:
Yeah, oh, please.

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:44.450
JEFFREY EGLER: I don't mean
to just keep jumping in.

01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:45.450
But it just reminds me.

01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:47.575
The other thing that, and
this is sort of the model

01:02:47.575 --> 01:02:52.202
that we have created and are
trying to expand is that A,

01:02:52.202 --> 01:02:53.660
there needs to be
a paradigm shift.

01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:54.951
There's a great book out there.

01:02:54.951 --> 01:02:57.410
It's called "The Patient
Will See You Now."

01:02:57.410 --> 01:02:59.990
And it's written about
how the patient needs

01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:02.677
to be the center, rather than
the old paternalistic doctor

01:03:02.677 --> 01:03:04.260
telling the patient
what to do, right?

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:05.420
We're consultants.

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:06.969
But we also work
with health coaches

01:03:06.969 --> 01:03:08.010
who are part of our team.

01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:11.270
And I think ultimately
the best team

01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:13.730
to work with a
member or a patient

01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:17.600
in the future would be a
fitness person, a meditation

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:19.700
person, somebody that's
doing the psychology,

01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:22.640
somebody that's making sure
that they are doing safe yoga

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:25.100
practices, interdisciplinary
teams, which

01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:27.620
is not a novel idea.

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:28.785
But it's not the norm.

01:03:28.785 --> 01:03:31.160
And I think it's going to need
to be before we can really

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:32.510
make progress.

01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:34.614
ANDY PETRANEK: It's
something you just said.

01:03:34.614 --> 01:03:36.530
I think that one of the
things we try to teach

01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:39.500
is the patient
being responsible.

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:41.840
The patient's the
CEO of the company.

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:44.570
The CEO has to
make the decisions.

01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:47.080
The CEO doesn't pass the buck
to the board or to the chief.

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.350
You might have a chief doctor.

01:03:48.350 --> 01:03:51.410
You might have a chief trainer
and a therapist and a yoga

01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:52.710
instructor.

01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:54.650
But you make the decisions.

01:03:54.650 --> 01:03:57.920
And I think very often
we look to the experts

01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.960
as if they know more than we do.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.090
And people forget that--

01:04:02.090 --> 01:04:03.740
or maybe they never knew--

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:06.470
that their intuition
could perhaps

01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:09.860
be more powerful than
even every book that

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:13.790
was ever written by any
Harvard expert or anybody else.

01:04:13.790 --> 01:04:16.220
They have to be responsible
for making that decision.

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:19.040
And sometimes it's
the exact opposite

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.660
of what everybody
else is saying.

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:23.090
But if it's in
alignment for them,

01:04:23.090 --> 01:04:26.450
that's the best answer, so.

01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:27.950
KIM WHITMAN: Yeah,
and then in yoga,

01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:29.480
you are your greatest teacher.

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:32.900
So I think, yeah, listening
to all the experts,

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:36.560
absorbing the information, but
being authentic to yourself

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:42.139
and your gut is ultimately,
yeah, the best guide.

01:04:42.139 --> 01:04:43.680
MELISSA MONAHAN: I
think you've clued

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:45.960
into this is a great
assortment of people,

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:49.320
which was my thinking.

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:53.310
So what we'll do is once we've
the video, we'll send it out

01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:54.030
so you have it.

01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:58.020
And then we'll include links to
all of their various companies

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:00.420
and social media
and all of that,

01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:05.700
but only check it once a day,
so that you have the access

01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:09.630
and can even reach out and
ask additional questions.

01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:13.099
Anybody else have anything you
want to ask of these folks?

01:05:13.099 --> 01:05:14.890
Any parting words that
y'all want to share,

01:05:14.890 --> 01:05:17.720
pass the wisdom
you've already shared?

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:19.042
Well, let's give them a hand.

01:05:19.042 --> 01:05:20.000
They're really amazing.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.750
[APPLAUSE]
