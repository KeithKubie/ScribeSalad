00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.920
We're on problem 120.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:17.540
David has d books, which is 3
times as many as Jeff, and 1/2

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.890
as many as Paula.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.740
So d is equal to 1/2 the number
of books Paula has.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.020
How many books do the
three of them have

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.770
together in terms of d?

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.620
So they want to know how
much d plus j plus p

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.130
is, in terms of d.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.120
So what's j in terms of d?

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.950
j is equal to-- divide both
sides by 3-- is equal to d/3.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.040
And what's p in terms of d?

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.700
If we multiply both sides by 2,
you get p is equal to 2d.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.970
So this turns into d plus
j, which is d/3,

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.180
plus p, which is 2d.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.410
Let's find the common
denominator.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.890
Well, 3.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.366
1d is the same thing
as 3d over 3.

00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.690
d over 3, well, that's still
just going to be d/3.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.880
2d, that's the same thing
is 6d over 3.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:29.220
That's equal to 3, 4, plus 6 is
10d over 3, or 10 thirds d.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.390
And that's choice C.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.800
10 thirds d.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.620
Problem 121.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.090
There are 8 teams in a certain
league, and each team plays

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.260
each of the other teams
exactly once.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.490
If each game is played by 2
teams-- it's a traditional

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.953
game-- what is the total
number of games played?

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.840
Let's think about
it a little bit.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.550
They each play each other
exactly once.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.900
So this turns into that grid
problem that we did last time.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:24.160
If I have 8 teams, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.520
And I'm going to write
the same thing.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:34.170
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.190
They can't play each other.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.290
1 is never going to play 1.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.360
2 is never going to play 2.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.580
3 is never going to play 3.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.460
4 is never going to play
4, et cetera, all the

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.290
way down the diagonal.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.050
You can't play yourself.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.860
And 1 is going to play
2 exactly 1 game.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.890
That's 1 game.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.170
And we're not going to write
2 played 1, because 1

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.090
already played 2.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.580
They only play each
other once.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.210
So you don't want to count
this one down here.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.370
You don't want to
count this one.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.120
This is when 1 plays 3.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.650
This is when 2 plays 3.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.080
So, essentially, you want to
figure out all of these spots

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.330
that are above the diagonal.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.370
Let's think about how many
spots there are.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.260
If we have an 8 by 8 square,
there are 8 times 8 squares on

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.880
this grid, if I actually
drew them as squares.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.170
I did that a couple
of problems ago.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.240
If I actually drew it like that,
then you might see the

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.480
grid a little bit better.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.360
But I think you get the idea.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.880
You have 8 by 8 spots on this
grid, because it's 8 spots

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.260
high, 8 spots wide.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.370
So you have 64 spots.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.850
Now, you're not going to have
one of the games along the

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.400
diagonal, because that would
be a team playing itself.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.950
So how many spots are
along the diagonal?

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:48.820
There's 8.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.010
There's 1 against 1,
2 and 2, 3 and 3.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.300
So that's each team
playing itself.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.180
So there's 8 spots along
the diagonal.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.240
So 64 minus 8 is 56.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.460
And so 56 would give us the
number of squares that aren't

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.530
in the diagonal.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.310
But if we counted all of them,
we would be double counting.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.000
We'd be counting 1 playing 2
up here, and 2 playing 1.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.750
So we only want to count half
of the remaining squares.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.519
So if you divide this
by 2, you get 28.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.320
So there'd be a total
of 28 games.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.750
And that's choice C.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.750
Question 122.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:40.230
An operation theta is defined
by the equation a theta b is

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:47.840
equal to a minus b over a plus b
for all numbers a and b such

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.460
that a does not equal minus b.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.560
That ensures that the
denominator does not equal 0.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.930
So they're defining
the domain.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.060
If a equaled minus b, then it
would be undefined, because

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.360
you'd have something
divided by 0.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:12.050
If a does not equal negative c,
and a theta c is equal to

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.840
0, then c is equal to-- So
they're telling us right now

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.420
that a does not equal minus c.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:30.670
So let's just write it down. a
theta c is equal to a minus c

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.670
over a plus c.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.020
And then, that we want
to set equal to 0.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.780
Because they're telling us
a theta c is equal to 0.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.780
They're telling us that a
does not equal minus c.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.220
So that's essentially saying
if a was minus c, then the

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.590
denominator would be 0,
and we would have

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.470
something really strange.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.720
So they are telling us the
denominator does not equal 0.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.850
So if the denominator does not
equal 0, and this fraction

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.320
equals 0, then the numerator
of this fraction has to be

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.390
equal to 0.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.460
Or another way you could say it,
a minus c over a plus c is

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.030
equal to 0.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.940
We know a plus c is
not equal to 0.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.390
So let's multiply both sides
of the equation times it.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.450
And you get a minus c is equal
to 0 times a plus c.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.295
That's just 0.

00:06:15.295 --> 00:06:17.625
In other words, if a fraction
is equal 0, the

00:06:17.625 --> 00:06:18.880
denominator is not 0.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.015
That would make it undefined.

00:06:20.015 --> 00:06:22.520
Then the numerator has
to be equal to 0.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.100
So then, just solving, you
get a is equal to c.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.100
Add c to both sides.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.170
So they want to know
what c is equal to.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.200
So c is equal to a.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.710
And that is choice E.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.310
Next question.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.140
Let me switch colors.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.960
123.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:50.380
The price of a lunch for 15
people was $207, including a

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.840
15% gratuity for service.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.130
So that was plus 15%.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.920
What was the average
price per person,

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:04.220
excluding the gratuity?

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:13.210
So essentially, we want to
figure out the price of 15

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:17.650
before gratuity times-- so
this is after gratuity.

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.050
So I'll call this, price
before gratuity.

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.400
I don't want to get too
complicated with my notation--

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:28.250
Price before gratuity times
1.15, because we're going to

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:35.840
increase by 15, is
equal to $207.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.430
So the price before gratuity of
the 15 people is equal to

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.820
207 divided by 1.15.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.630
And we want to figure out the
average price per person.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:57.630
So we want to figure out
this divided by 15.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:01.350
This looks, at its heart,
kind mathy.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:06.310
But let's just chug through it
and see where we can go.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:19.310
So this is the same thing
is 207/1.15 times 1/15.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:28.120
And that's equal to 207 divided
by 15 times 1.15, the

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.550
denominator.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:33.020
Let's figure out the
denominator first.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:39.580
Well, maybe the numerator--
207 divided by 1.15.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:44.610
1.15 goes into 207.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:46.780
Add some decimals.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.620
Push this two to the right,
two to the right.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.320
The decimal goes there.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.930
115 goes into 207 one time.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.830
1 times 115 is 115.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:02.010
Then, it's 85 plus 7.

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:06.610
85 plus 7 is 92.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.180
920.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.460
And then then this should
go roughly 8 times.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.870
8 times 115.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.260
8 times 5 is 40.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.490
8 times 1 is 8 plus 4 is 12.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:22.360
Carry the 1.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.830
8 times 1 is 8, plus 1 is 9.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.710
It actually equals
exactly 920.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:27.960
Great.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:34.420
So before gratuity,
it was $180.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.750
Before gratuity, our
price was $180.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.260
And now, we have to divide
that by 15 to

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.220
get the average price.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.820
So 15 goes into 180
how many times?

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.200
1 times 15, 30.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.190
15 goes into 30 two times.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:54.250
So the average price before
gratuity was exactly $12, B.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.120
And I'm out of time.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.870
See you in the next video.
