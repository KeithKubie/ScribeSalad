00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.130
 
today we're gonna look at the fact that

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:01.140
today we're gonna look at the fact that
 

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.990
today we're gonna look at the fact that
all prime numbers when you square them

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000
all prime numbers when you square them
 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.079
all prime numbers when you square them
are one more than a multiple of 24 which

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089
are one more than a multiple of 24 which
 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.700
are one more than a multiple of 24 which
a lot of people don't believe it you are

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710
a lot of people don't believe it you are
 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.870
a lot of people don't believe it you are
shocked when I first told you about this

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880
shocked when I first told you about this
 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.000
shocked when I first told you about this
you are you're beside yourself because

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010
you are you're beside yourself because
 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.589
you are you're beside yourself because
people think the prime numbers haven't

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599
people think the prime numbers haven't
 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.539
people think the prime numbers haven't
got a pattern like a lot of emails from

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549
got a pattern like a lot of emails from
 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.340
got a pattern like a lot of emails from
people saying oh I found a pattern the

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350
people saying oh I found a pattern the
 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.359
people saying oh I found a pattern the
prime numbers are like yes there are

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369
prime numbers are like yes there are
 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.529
prime numbers are like yes there are
loads of patterns in the prime numbers

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539
loads of patterns in the prime numbers
 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.599
loads of patterns in the prime numbers
and including this one which will test

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609
and including this one which will test
 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.300
and including this one which will test
so Brady what prime number should we do

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310
so Brady what prime number should we do
 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.340
so Brady what prime number should we do
with the black sharpie

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350
with the black sharpie
 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.440
with the black sharpie
let's do 17 7.5 okay 17 squared equals

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450
let's do 17 7.5 okay 17 squared equals
 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.690
let's do 17 7.5 okay 17 squared equals
okay so it's gonna be no I can do this

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700
okay so it's gonna be no I can do this
 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.430
okay so it's gonna be no I can do this
cuz squares gonna be a hundred and

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440
cuz squares gonna be a hundred and
 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.280
cuz squares gonna be a hundred and
seventy plus seven times that which is

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290
seventy plus seven times that which is
 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.250
seventy plus seven times that which is
gonna be seventy plus 49

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260
gonna be seventy plus 49
 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.690
gonna be seventy plus 49
okay so just off the top of my head at

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700
okay so just off the top of my head at
 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.250
okay so just off the top of my head at
work was that I'm sorry seven eight

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260
work was that I'm sorry seven eight
 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.080
work was that I'm sorry seven eight
twelve thirteen okay I think it's

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090
twelve thirteen okay I think it's
 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.250
twelve thirteen okay I think it's
roughly that's not right seventeen times

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260
roughly that's not right seventeen times
 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.260
roughly that's not right seventeen times
17 equals to 8 now I was right doubted

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270
17 equals to 8 now I was right doubted
 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.270
17 equals to 8 now I was right doubted
myself and so I'm saying that's one more

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280
myself and so I'm saying that's one more
 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.030
myself and so I'm saying that's one more
than a multiple of 24 and so we can

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040
than a multiple of 24 and so we can
 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.120
than a multiple of 24 and so we can
split that apart because we've got 240

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130
split that apart because we've got 240
 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.310
split that apart because we've got 240
hidden in there plus 49 left over and

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320
hidden in there plus 49 left over and
 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.649
hidden in there plus 49 left over and
that's one more than 48 which is a

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659
that's one more than 48 which is a
 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.690
that's one more than 48 which is a
multiple of 24 and so this whole thing

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700
multiple of 24 and so this whole thing
 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.670
multiple of 24 and so this whole thing
here is gonna be as 12 times 24 plus one

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680
here is gonna be as 12 times 24 plus one
 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.550
here is gonna be as 12 times 24 plus one
so I argue any prime number you give me

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560
so I argue any prime number you give me
 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.190
so I argue any prime number you give me
if you square it you'll get some mobs

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200
if you square it you'll get some mobs
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.240
if you square it you'll get some mobs
pull of 24 plus 1 on the end 5 5 is 25

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250
pull of 24 plus 1 on the end 5 5 is 25
 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.649
pull of 24 plus 1 on the end 5 5 is 25
that's one more than 24 you could have

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659
that's one more than 24 you could have
 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.319
that's one more than 24 you could have
opened with that Brady but now we do 17

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329
opened with that Brady but now we do 17
 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.929
opened with that Brady but now we do 17
first it doesn't work if you go back up

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939
first it doesn't work if you go back up
 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.469
first it doesn't work if you go back up
and do 2 or 3 so 2 or 3 don't work too

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479
and do 2 or 3 so 2 or 3 don't work too
 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.530
and do 2 or 3 so 2 or 3 don't work too
small too small and I mean I argue that

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540
small too small and I mean I argue that
 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.120
small too small and I mean I argue that
they're not real prime numbers I call

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130
they're not real prime numbers I call
 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.340
they're not real prime numbers I call
them the subprimes so I would like to

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350
them the subprimes so I would like to
 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.810
them the subprimes so I would like to
ignore those for the purpose of this

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820
ignore those for the purpose of this
 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.270
ignore those for the purpose of this
they don't work everything 5 onwards

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280
they don't work everything 5 onwards
 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.490
they don't work everything 5 onwards
this always works but we should prove it

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500
this always works but we should prove it
 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.780
this always works but we should prove it
right you didn't take my word for these

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790
right you didn't take my word for these
 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.730
right you didn't take my word for these
things so it comes down to when I first

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740
things so it comes down to when I first
 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.010
things so it comes down to when I first
saw this first of all I was amazed and

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020
saw this first of all I was amazed and
 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.389
saw this first of all I was amazed and
then I was like what hang on there must

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399
then I was like what hang on there must
 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.740
then I was like what hang on there must
be a reason why there's this pattern is

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750
be a reason why there's this pattern is
 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.929
be a reason why there's this pattern is
that there are loads of patterns in the

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939
that there are loads of patterns in the
 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.219
that there are loads of patterns in the
prime numbers so there's a nice one

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229
prime numbers so there's a nice one
 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.980
prime numbers so there's a nice one
involving multiples of 6 and because 24

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990
involving multiples of 6 and because 24
 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.660
involving multiples of 6 and because 24
is a multiple of 6 I was like you know

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670
is a multiple of 6 I was like you know
 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.040
is a multiple of 6 I was like you know
what that might be something to do with

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050
what that might be something to do with
 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.750
what that might be something to do with
it so I'm gonna recreate list out a

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760
it so I'm gonna recreate list out a
 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.410
it so I'm gonna recreate list out a
number line 11

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420
number line 11
 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.640
number line 11
12 13 18 19 okay so we got those and

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650
12 13 18 19 okay so we got those and
 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.710
12 13 18 19 okay so we got those and
then let's find our favorites the primes

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720
then let's find our favorites the primes
 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.630
then let's find our favorites the primes
we've got the subprimes hanging out down

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640
we've got the subprimes hanging out down
 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.250
we've got the subprimes hanging out down
here and then we've got the real primes

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260
here and then we've got the real primes
 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.970
here and then we've got the real primes
there's five there seven there

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980
there's five there seven there
 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.040
there's five there seven there
11 13 17 19 and so on and you go right

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050
11 13 17 19 and so on and you go right
 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.500
11 13 17 19 and so on and you go right
where are the multiples of six there's

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510
where are the multiples of six there's
 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.690
where are the multiples of six there's
multiple of six there it's six look at

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700
multiple of six there it's six look at
 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.010
multiple of six there it's six look at
that there's a prime on either side of

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020
that there's a prime on either side of
 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.990
that there's a prime on either side of
it right so those two either side of

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000
it right so those two either side of
 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.790
it right so those two either side of
multiple six there's the next multiple

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800
multiple six there's the next multiple
 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.320
multiple six there's the next multiple
of six look at that there's a prime on

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330
of six look at that there's a prime on
 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.940
of six look at that there's a prime on
both sides of it nothing else in between

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950
both sides of it nothing else in between
 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.040
both sides of it nothing else in between
next mode will six over there look at

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050
next mode will six over there look at
 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.390
next mode will six over there look at
that there's a prime on each side of it

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400
that there's a prime on each side of it
 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.350
that there's a prime on each side of it
so the primes are always above and below

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360
so the primes are always above and below
 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.110
so the primes are always above and below
all the multiples of six except doesn't

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120
all the multiples of six except doesn't
 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.699
all the multiples of six except doesn't
always work so if I kept going the

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709
always work so if I kept going the
 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.370
always work so if I kept going the
number layer stopped at 19 so 23 is a

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380
number layer stopped at 19 so 23 is a
 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.130
number layer stopped at 19 so 23 is a
prime 25 is not a prime there is our

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140
prime 25 is not a prime there is our
 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.590
prime 25 is not a prime there is our
next multiple of six and only on one

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600
next multiple of six and only on one
 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.160
next multiple of six and only on one
side do we get a prime 25 is not up

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170
side do we get a prime 25 is not up
 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.410
side do we get a prime 25 is not up
until now they have all been and the

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420
until now they have all been and the
 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.570
until now they have all been and the
reason this one isn't is 5 finally

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580
reason this one isn't is 5 finally
 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.270
reason this one isn't is 5 finally
caught up with us so 5 is prime but then

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280
caught up with us so 5 is prime but then
 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.030
caught up with us so 5 is prime but then
every 5th number isn't tens not 15 s not

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040
every 5th number isn't tens not 15 s not
 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.640
every 5th number isn't tens not 15 s not
20 s not boom so that's not this one out

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650
20 s not boom so that's not this one out
 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.349
20 s not boom so that's not this one out
the moral of story is not that there's

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359
the moral of story is not that there's
 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.090
the moral of story is not that there's
something magical about the primes and

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100
something magical about the primes and
 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.620
something magical about the primes and
they happen to always be above and below

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630
they happen to always be above and below
 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.690
they happen to always be above and below
every mod for 6 it's just that's the

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700
every mod for 6 it's just that's the
 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.970
every mod for 6 it's just that's the
only place they can be so here's a

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980
only place they can be so here's a
 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.229
only place they can be so here's a
multiple of 6 and here's the next one

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239
multiple of 6 and here's the next one
 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.289
multiple of 6 and here's the next one
they can't be at the even points in

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299
they can't be at the even points in
 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:35.910
they can't be at the even points in
between because we know Prime's can't be

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920
between because we know Prime's can't be
 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.740
between because we know Prime's can't be
even so immediately it knocks out these

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750
even so immediately it knocks out these
 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.300
even so immediately it knocks out these
two and it can't be the number in

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310
two and it can't be the number in
 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.220
two and it can't be the number in
between because multiple 3 number

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230
between because multiple 3 number
 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.870
between because multiple 3 number
between each multiple of 6 is multiple

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880
between each multiple of 6 is multiple
 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.970
between each multiple of 6 is multiple
of 3 so it can't be on any of these

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980
of 3 so it can't be on any of these
 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.280
of 3 so it can't be on any of these
which is why it has to be above or below

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290
which is why it has to be above or below
 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.860
which is why it has to be above or below
a multiple of 6 it's just a fancy way of

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870
a multiple of 6 it's just a fancy way of
 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.620
a multiple of 6 it's just a fancy way of
saying Prime's don't have 2 or 3 as a

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630
saying Prime's don't have 2 or 3 as a
 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.170
saying Prime's don't have 2 or 3 as a
factor and then to their constrain to

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180
factor and then to their constrain to
 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.849
factor and then to their constrain to
those and so people are happy if you say

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859
those and so people are happy if you say
 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.849
those and so people are happy if you say
all primes are odd ignoring the small

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859
all primes are odd ignoring the small
 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.830
all primes are odd ignoring the small
ones right and that's just because this

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840
ones right and that's just because this
 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.300
ones right and that's just because this
does nobody's saying Prime's haven't got

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310
does nobody's saying Prime's haven't got
 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.340
does nobody's saying Prime's haven't got
2 as a factor if you say all Prime's are

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350
2 as a factor if you say all Prime's are
 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.140
2 as a factor if you say all Prime's are
1 more or less than multiple of 6 and

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150
1 more or less than multiple of 6 and
 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.520
1 more or less than multiple of 6 and
was like wow but all we're saying is

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530
was like wow but all we're saying is
 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.160
was like wow but all we're saying is
they haven't got 3 as a factor and then

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170
they haven't got 3 as a factor and then
 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.890
they haven't got 3 as a factor and then
when we say all Prime's squared

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900
when we say all Prime's squared
 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.020
when we say all Prime's squared
give you one more than multiple 24 it's

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030
give you one more than multiple 24 it's
 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.789
give you one more than multiple 24 it's
a variation on this it just looks more

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799
a variation on this it just looks more
 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.469
a variation on this it just looks more
impressive and so the way I'll show you

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479
impressive and so the way I'll show you
 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:20.610
impressive and so the way I'll show you
the way I first worked it out when I

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620
the way I first worked it out when I
 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.960
the way I first worked it out when I
came across that I cuz like right I'm

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970
came across that I cuz like right I'm
 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.520
came across that I cuz like right I'm
going to prove this

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530
going to prove this
 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:35.809
going to prove this
delivery so here's what I did I said any

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:35.819
delivery so here's what I did I said any
 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:37.610
delivery so here's what I did I said any
prime number other than two or three is

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620
prime number other than two or three is
 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.830
prime number other than two or three is
it either gonna be some molds pull of

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840
it either gonna be some molds pull of
 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.670
it either gonna be some molds pull of
six plus one or some multiple of six

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680
six plus one or some multiple of six
 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.610
six plus one or some multiple of six
minus one so every K we can put in one

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620
minus one so every K we can put in one
 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.020
minus one so every K we can put in one
of these two categories and so my

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030
of these two categories and so my
 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.730
of these two categories and so my
thought was I'll just square these and

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740
thought was I'll just square these and
 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.649
thought was I'll just square these and
show they're both one more one less than

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:51.659
show they're both one more one less than
 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.409
show they're both one more one less than
a multiple of twenty-four but then they

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419
a multiple of twenty-four but then they
 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:55.189
a multiple of twenty-four but then they
didn't work out really really

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199
didn't work out really really
 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.110
didn't work out really really
complicated so I had another cheating

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120
complicated so I had another cheating
 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.860
complicated so I had another cheating
moment when I realized this K here is

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870
moment when I realized this K here is
 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.499
moment when I realized this K here is
either going to be odd or even so that K

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:03.509
either going to be odd or even so that K
 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:07.309
either going to be odd or even so that K
is either gonna equal let's use skews em

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:07.319
is either gonna equal let's use skews em
 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:11.240
is either gonna equal let's use skews em
this time to M or it's gonna equal this

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250
this time to M or it's gonna equal this
 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.270
this time to M or it's gonna equal this
is or to M plus one it's either even or

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280
is or to M plus one it's either even or
 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.070
is or to M plus one it's either even or
odd and so I can split each of these

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080
odd and so I can split each of these
 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.839
odd and so I can split each of these
into their two options so this one is

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849
into their two options so this one is
 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.959
into their two options so this one is
either gonna be if I put two M in there

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:20.969
either gonna be if I put two M in there
 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:25.369
either gonna be if I put two M in there
it's gonna be 12 M plus one or if I put

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:25.379
it's gonna be 12 M plus one or if I put
 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:27.499
it's gonna be 12 M plus one or if I put
in two n plus one it's going to be

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:27.509
in two n plus one it's going to be
 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:32.390
in two n plus one it's going to be
twelve M plus seven and then down here

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400
twelve M plus seven and then down here
 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.120
twelve M plus seven and then down here
that's either going to be put into M

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130
that's either going to be put into M
 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.450
that's either going to be put into M
that's gonna be 12 and minus one or it's

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460
that's gonna be 12 and minus one or it's
 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.430
that's gonna be 12 and minus one or it's
gonna be 12 m plus six negative 1 5 okay

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440
gonna be 12 m plus six negative 1 5 okay
 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.800
gonna be 12 m plus six negative 1 5 okay
so now I know every single prime number

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810
so now I know every single prime number
 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.019
so now I know every single prime number
falls into one of these four categories

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:48.029
falls into one of these four categories
 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:50.689
falls into one of these four categories
and so then I went through and I took

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699
and so then I went through and I took
 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.350
and so then I went through and I took
each of these and squared them to see

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360
each of these and squared them to see
 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.839
each of these and squared them to see
what happens when you square now this is

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849
what happens when you square now this is
 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:59.659
what happens when you square now this is
not exhaustive like an exhaustive proof

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669
not exhaustive like an exhaustive proof
 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:00.649
not exhaustive like an exhaustive proof
where I've checked every single option

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:00.659
where I've checked every single option
 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:02.809
where I've checked every single option
I've just taken all the options and put

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:02.819
I've just taken all the options and put
 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:04.580
I've just taken all the options and put
them into four categories and now I'm

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590
them into four categories and now I'm
 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:05.869
them into four categories and now I'm
going to check each of the categories

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:05.879
going to check each of the categories
 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:09.559
going to check each of the categories
separately so let's do them quickly M

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:09.569
separately so let's do them quickly M
 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.680
separately so let's do them quickly M
squared plus two times that time this

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690
squared plus two times that time this
 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.249
squared plus two times that time this
one's 144 m someone will correct me if

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259
one's 144 m someone will correct me if
 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:21.339
one's 144 m someone will correct me if
I'm wrong - tutors at times 2a plus 25

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:21.349
I'm wrong - tutors at times 2a plus 25
 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:23.540
I'm wrong - tutors at times 2a plus 25
okay that's what we have to do now is

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550
okay that's what we have to do now is
 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.159
okay that's what we have to do now is
show that every single one of these is a

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169
show that every single one of these is a
 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.379
show that every single one of these is a
multiple of twenty-four plus one and the

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:27.389
multiple of twenty-four plus one and the
 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:28.700
multiple of twenty-four plus one and the
first ones reasonabie straightforward

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710
first ones reasonabie straightforward
 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.959
first ones reasonabie straightforward
because that's a multiple of 24 because

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:32.969
because that's a multiple of 24 because
 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:35.300
because that's a multiple of 24 because
that's 12 squares that's 6 times 24 so

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310
that's 12 squares that's 6 times 24 so
 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.860
that's 12 squares that's 6 times 24 so
we actually put 24

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870
we actually put 24
 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.939
we actually put 24
outside of that's gonna be 6m squared

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:39.949
outside of that's gonna be 6m squared
 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:43.909
outside of that's gonna be 6m squared
plus M plus one so multiple Oh 24 plus

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919
plus M plus one so multiple Oh 24 plus
 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:49.129
plus M plus one so multiple Oh 24 plus
one this one is 24 outside of again 6m

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139
one this one is 24 outside of again 6m
 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:55.790
one this one is 24 outside of again 6m
squared plus seven M plus two plus one

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800
squared plus seven M plus two plus one
 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.469
squared plus seven M plus two plus one
so I've done theirs at 48

00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479
so I've done theirs at 48
 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:00.080
so I've done theirs at 48
I've sorry that 49 I've realized is 48

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.090
I've sorry that 49 I've realized is 48
 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.050
I've sorry that 49 I've realized is 48
plus one and so the 224 is the 48 plus

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060
plus one and so the 224 is the 48 plus
 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.480
plus one and so the 224 is the 48 plus
the one at the outside yeah same deal

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:05.490
the one at the outside yeah same deal
 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.140
the one at the outside yeah same deal
again 24 outside 6m squared minus one

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.150
again 24 outside 6m squared minus one
 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:10.670
again 24 outside 6m squared minus one
plus one

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680
plus one
 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.230
plus one
that's what mass m and finally 24

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240
that's what mass m and finally 24
 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:23.270
that's what mass m and finally 24
outside of 6m squared plus 5m plus 1

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280
outside of 6m squared plus 5m plus 1
 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.300
outside of 6m squared plus 5m plus 1
plus 1 so there I've taken every single

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:26.310
plus 1 so there I've taken every single
 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.340
plus 1 so there I've taken every single

slightly clever exhaustive proof where I
 

00:07:49.979 --> 00:07:51.800
slightly clever exhaustive proof where I
put it in categories and I've dealt with

put it in categories and I've dealt with
the categories one at a time I was so

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000
the categories one at a time I was so
 

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.129
the categories one at a time I was so
pleased when I got to the end is nigh

00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:55.139
pleased when I got to the end is nigh
 

00:07:55.139 --> 00:07:56.960
pleased when I got to the end is nigh
was like yep I knew it had something to

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:56.970
was like yep I knew it had something to
 

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.270
was like yep I knew it had something to
do with being one or more one less than

a multiple of six I did some algebra I

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:01.530
a multiple of six I did some algebra I
 

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.320
a multiple of six I did some algebra I
worked it out I showed some friends of

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:03.330
worked it out I showed some friends of
 

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.690
worked it out I showed some friends of
mine and one of them said why didn't you

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:05.700
mine and one of them said why didn't you
 

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.950
mine and one of them said why didn't you
do it the easy way

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960
do it the easy way
 

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.180
do it the easy way
and I was like ah you know me I like to

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:11.190
and I was like ah you know me I like to
 

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.550
and I was like ah you know me I like to
do some algebra easy way so it turns out

do some algebra easy way so it turns out
there's an easier way to do this so I

00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599
there's an easier way to do this so I
 

00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:18.260
there's an easier way to do this so I
did this way this is mine I love it my

00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919
friend Paul said look all you're doing
 

00:08:19.919 --> 00:08:22.820
friend Paul said look all you're doing
is you're looking at P squared minus 1

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:22.830
is you're looking at P squared minus 1
 

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:26.570
is you're looking at P squared minus 1
and asking is that a multiple of 24

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:26.580
and asking is that a multiple of 24
 

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.370
and asking is that a multiple of 24
every prime squared subtract one is a

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:28.380
every prime squared subtract one is a
 

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.100
every prime squared subtract one is a
multple 24 okay P squared minus one you

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:31.110
multple 24 okay P squared minus one you
 

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.899
multple 24 okay P squared minus one you
may remember this from school or you

00:08:32.899 --> 00:08:32.909
may remember this from school or you
 

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:34.100
may remember this from school or you
could still be in school and you see

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:34.110
could still be in school and you see
 

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:35.269
could still be in school and you see
that and immediate you think well that's

00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279
that and immediate you think well that's
 

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:37.370
that and immediate you think well that's
difference of two squares its P minus 1

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:37.380
difference of two squares its P minus 1
 

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.790
difference of two squares its P minus 1
P plus 1 if it's been a while since you

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800
P plus 1 if it's been a while since you
 

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.500
P plus 1 if it's been a while since you
did this at school you can just

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:42.510
did this at school you can just
 

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.909
did this at school you can just
double-check that if you multiply these

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919
double-check that if you multiply these
 

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:45.770
double-check that if you multiply these
out you'll get back to P squared minus 1

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:45.780
out you'll get back to P squared minus 1
 

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.449
out you'll get back to P squared minus 1
so what we really want to know is is

00:08:47.449 --> 00:08:47.459
so what we really want to know is is
 

00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:48.920
so what we really want to know is is
this a multiple

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:48.930
this a multiple
 

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.470
this a multiple
24 well what can we say about this well

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:51.480
24 well what can we say about this well
 

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.050
24 well what can we say about this well
on the number line that's gonna go over

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:54.060
on the number line that's gonna go over
 

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.790
on the number line that's gonna go over
here we're gonna have the number 1 less

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:55.800
here we're gonna have the number 1 less
 

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.100
here we're gonna have the number 1 less
than P P minus 1 here we're gonna have

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:58.110
than P P minus 1 here we're gonna have
 

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.050
than P P minus 1 here we're gonna have
the prime P and then above it we can

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:00.060
the prime P and then above it we can
 

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.360
the prime P and then above it we can
have the prime P plus 1 so actually we

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:02.370
have the prime P plus 1 so actually we
 

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.090
have the prime P plus 1 so actually we
got three consecutive numbers here and

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:04.100
got three consecutive numbers here and
 

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.310
got three consecutive numbers here and
the prime in the middle hasn't got any

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:07.320
the prime in the middle hasn't got any
 

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.800
the prime in the middle hasn't got any
factors so we know every second number

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:09.810
factors so we know every second number
 

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.350
factors so we know every second number
is a multiple of two so because these

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:12.360
is a multiple of two so because these
 

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.180
is a multiple of two so because these
are in a row we know either those two

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:14.190
are in a row we know either those two
 

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.769
are in a row we know either those two
are a multiple of two or that one's a

00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:15.779
are a multiple of two or that one's a
 

00:09:15.779 --> 00:09:17.090
are a multiple of two or that one's a
multiple of two and this can't be a

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:17.100
multiple of two and this can't be a
 

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.790
multiple of two and this can't be a
multiple of two we know P is not even

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800
multiple of two we know P is not even
 

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.620
multiple of two we know P is not even
because it can't have two as a factor

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:21.630
because it can't have two as a factor
 

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.440
because it can't have two as a factor
so both of these numbers have to have a

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:24.450
so both of these numbers have to have a
 

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.630
so both of these numbers have to have a
they're both multiple of two these are

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640
they're both multiple of two these are
 

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.760
they're both multiple of two these are
both even numbers in fact because

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:28.770
both even numbers in fact because
 

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:30.769
both even numbers in fact because
they're two consecutive even numbers one

00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:30.779
they're two consecutive even numbers one
 

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:33.170
they're two consecutive even numbers one
of them we don't know which one of them

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:33.180
of them we don't know which one of them
 

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.449
of them we don't know which one of them
is a multiple of four so either this

00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:35.459
is a multiple of four so either this
 

00:09:35.459 --> 00:09:36.620
is a multiple of four so either this
one's a multiple of two this one's a

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:36.630
one's a multiple of two this one's a
 

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.329
one's a multiple of two this one's a
multiple of four or that one's for and

00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:38.339
multiple of four or that one's for and
 

00:09:38.339 --> 00:09:40.130
multiple of four or that one's for and
that one's too right do we know when we

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:40.140
that one's too right do we know when we
 

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.350
that one's too right do we know when we
multiply them together the combined

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360
multiply them together the combined
 

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.320
multiply them together the combined
total will be a multiple of eight so now

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:45.330
total will be a multiple of eight so now
 

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:50.389
total will be a multiple of eight so now
we know this it is a multiple of eight

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399
we know this it is a multiple of eight
 

00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:52.340
we know this it is a multiple of eight
because it's two even numbers either

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:52.350
because it's two even numbers either
 

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.079
because it's two even numbers either
side of a prime and one's for ones too

00:09:54.079 --> 00:09:54.089
side of a prime and one's for ones too
 

00:09:54.089 --> 00:09:56.810
side of a prime and one's for ones too
we have to get eight now we've also got

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:56.820
we have to get eight now we've also got
 

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.150
we have to get eight now we've also got
three numbers in a row and every batch

00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.160
three numbers in a row and every batch
 

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.829
three numbers in a row and every batch
of three numbers one of them has to be a

00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:00.839
of three numbers one of them has to be a
 

00:10:00.839 --> 00:10:02.540
of three numbers one of them has to be a
multiple of three every third numbers a

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:02.550
multiple of three every third numbers a
 

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.829
multiple of three every third numbers a
multiple of three again it's not the

00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839
multiple of three again it's not the
 

00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:05.120
multiple of three again it's not the
middle one because we know that when

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:05.130
middle one because we know that when
 

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:09.019
middle one because we know that when
there is not a multiple of three because

00:10:09.019 --> 00:10:09.029
there is not a multiple of three because
 

00:10:09.029 --> 00:10:10.310
there is not a multiple of three because
it kind of have 3 as a factor it's a

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320
it kind of have 3 as a factor it's a
 

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.440
it kind of have 3 as a factor it's a
prime so one of these has to be a

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:12.450
prime so one of these has to be a
 

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.030
prime so one of these has to be a
multiple of three again we don't know

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.040
multiple of three again we don't know
 

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.760
multiple of three again we don't know
which when we multiply them together the

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:16.770
which when we multiply them together the
 

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:19.400
which when we multiply them together the
total must be a multiple of three so we

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:19.410
total must be a multiple of three so we
 

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.710
total must be a multiple of three so we
also know that is definitely a multiple

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720
also know that is definitely a multiple
 

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.310
also know that is definitely a multiple
of three and if something is definitely

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:25.320
of three and if something is definitely
 

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.900
of three and if something is definitely
a multiple of three it's definitely a

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:26.910
a multiple of three it's definitely a
 

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.620
a multiple of three it's definitely a
multiple of eight it is a multiple of 24

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:30.630
multiple of eight it is a multiple of 24
 

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.350
multiple of eight it is a multiple of 24
and so that's it just because the two

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360
and so that's it just because the two
 

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.510
and so that's it just because the two
numbers are either side of a prime if

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:35.520
numbers are either side of a prime if
 

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.819
numbers are either side of a prime if
you multiply them together you get a

00:10:37.819 --> 00:10:37.829
you multiply them together you get a
 

00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:40.340
you multiply them together you get a
number which is a multiple of 24 and

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:40.350
number which is a multiple of 24 and
 

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.100
number which is a multiple of 24 and
actually we've not really used the fact

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:43.110
actually we've not really used the fact
 

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:47.480
actually we've not really used the fact
that this is a prime all we've used is

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:47.490
that this is a prime all we've used is
 

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:49.250
that this is a prime all we've used is
the fact that it's not even and it's not

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:49.260
the fact that it's not even and it's not
 

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.810
the fact that it's not even and it's not
a multiple of three so what we've

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:50.820
a multiple of three so what we've
 

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.760
a multiple of three so what we've
actually managed to prove is that all

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:52.770
actually managed to prove is that all
 

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:56.060
actually managed to prove is that all
numbers which don't have two or three as

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:56.070
numbers which don't have two or three as
 

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.610
numbers which don't have two or three as
a factor if you square them you get a

00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:58.620
a factor if you square them you get a
 

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.620
a factor if you square them you get a
number which is one more than a multiple

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:00.630
number which is one more than a multiple
 

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.240
number which is one more than a multiple
of 24 and that

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:02.250
of 24 and that
 

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.740
of 24 and that
all the ones either side of every single

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:03.750
all the ones either side of every single
 

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:07.940
all the ones either side of every single
six so what vaccinations approve is both

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:07.950

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:10.850
six so what vaccinations approve is both
all primes are either side of multiple

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:10.860
all primes are either side of multiple
 

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.400
all primes are either side of multiple
of six and if you square any number on

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:13.410
of six and if you square any number on
 

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:15.290
of six and if you square any number on
either side of a multiple of six

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:15.300
either side of a multiple of six
 

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.940
either side of a multiple of six
you always get a number which is one

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:16.950
you always get a number which is one
 

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.160
you always get a number which is one
more than a multiple of twenty-four and

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:19.170
more than a multiple of twenty-four and
 

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:20.960
more than a multiple of twenty-four and
that is one of my favorite prime

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:20.970
that is one of my favorite prime
 

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:24.050
that is one of my favorite prime
