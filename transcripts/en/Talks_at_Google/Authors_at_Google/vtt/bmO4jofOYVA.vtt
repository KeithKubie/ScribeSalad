ANNOUNCER: Please
welcome our moderator,

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.710
Todd Womack from
"Barely Political,"

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.370
and of course, BJ Novak.

00:00:07.945 --> 00:00:09.070
TODD WOMACK: Hi, everybody.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.855
How are you guys doing?

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:10.290
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.623
TODD WOMACK: How about another
hand for our friend who's

00:00:12.623 --> 00:00:13.232
visiting us?

00:00:13.232 --> 00:00:14.065
BJ NOVAK: Thank you.

00:00:14.065 --> 00:00:16.780
TODD WOMACK: Look at that.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.440
All right.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.970
So, BJ.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:18.595
BJ NOVAK: Yeah.

00:00:18.595 --> 00:00:20.820
TODD WOMACK: An
afternoon with BJ Novak.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.490
Look at all these
dedicated Googlers

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.645
missing the Board of Directors
meeting just to see you.

00:00:26.645 --> 00:00:29.020
BJ NOVAK: I understand you
have a choice in presentations

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.180
today, and I thank you
for choosing this one.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.430
TODD WOMACK: You chose wisely.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.180
BJ NOVAK: Yeah.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.870
TODD WOMACK: You actually
played a Google employee.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.150
BJ NOVAK: What if this is
a trick, and everyone who

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.066
came to this is fired?

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.610
Be a great prank.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.140
TODD WOMACK: For you.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.685
So what've you got going on?

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:47.560
What are you doing in
New York, first of all.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.602
BJ NOVAK: I came here to
visit the company Google.

00:00:51.602 --> 00:00:53.060
TODD WOMACK: Massive
search engine.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.120
BJ NOVAK: Massive search engine.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.920
I don't know if you know,
I played a Google employee

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.470
in a movie.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.011
TODD WOMACK: I was
about to say that.

00:00:58.011 --> 00:00:59.610
Did you do any research?

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.710
BJ NOVAK: Yes, for years.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.700
I used the search engine.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.720
I used the email, the maps.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.880
I got very deep into
it, so I could really

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.640
understand the
mindset of someone

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.086
for whom Google is an
essential part of their life.

00:01:13.086 --> 00:01:14.210
TODD WOMACK: See, he cares.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.340
He did the research,
did the work.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.700
So tell us about the book.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.020
BJ NOVAK: Well, this
book-- the reason I'm here

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.100
in general in New York this
week is for the paperback launch

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.090
of this book, "One More Thing--
Stories and Other Stories,"

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.400
which is a collection of
64 short stories of very

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.850
different lengths, and
topics, and sometimes tones,

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.540
and always themes
that really are meant

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.180
to be, in my opinion, a book
of fiction for the social media

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.380
age, in a way.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.060
This is for a generation
that I include myself

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.880
in where we can click around,
and flip around, and find

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.850
different things that we're
in the mood for at any moment.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.160
And I wanted a book
that felt like that too,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.450
that you could flip through
it and visually see,

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.290
this looks short.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.660
This looks sweet.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.130
This looks involving.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.330
This looks crazy.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.110
This has a lot of swears in it.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.810
This one is more innocent.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.630
My mind was working in
a very jagged way when

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.620
I was-- I had just
left the office,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.220
and my mind was flooded
with all these ideas.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.660
And I thought it would be
great if I could pull it off,

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.300
to write a jagged book.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.690
So they're all
comedic, but they're

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.187
expressive of different
feelings and moods, as well

00:02:32.187 --> 00:02:33.020
as different topics.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.280
TODD WOMACK: Right.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.370
Yeah, there's some that
are just sweet and sad.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.680
And they're all pretty
funny, the ones that I read.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.305
I didn't have time to read
the whole book since Monday,

00:02:40.305 --> 00:02:41.180
since I got the book.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.080
But I'm going to read a couple
of these titles of the stories

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.370
in here, just because the titles
themselves are pretty funny.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.410
"'The Something,'
by John Grisham."

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.194
I thought that was pretty good.

00:02:51.194 --> 00:02:52.860
BJ NOVAK: That's a
story in which author

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.600
John Grisham wakes up and sees
a full-page ad in "The New York

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.500
Times" congratulating him from
his publisher, Random House,

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.400
on his book called,
"The Something."

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.900
And it turns out,
he had just mailed

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.602
in a manuscript with that
as a placeholder title.

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:07.990
And they had never checked it.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.220
And it becomes a meditation
on perfectionism.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.220
The book's number one.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.170
Everyone loves it.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.230
They think "The Something"
is a cool title.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.904
And does he let it go, or do
heads roll at Random House?

00:03:18.904 --> 00:03:20.070
Yeah, you tell me the title.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.630
I'll tell you what it's about.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.870
TODD WOMACK: His follow
up is "Working Title."

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:22.922
Right.

00:03:22.922 --> 00:03:26.970
Here we go. "The Man Who Posted
Pictures of Everything He Ate."

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:27.720
That's quite good.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.400
BJ NOVAK: That's so short,
I could even read it later

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.820
if you want.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.520
That's one of those--

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.020
TODD WOMACK: That's
what I was going to say,

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.810
if you want to do a
little bit of that.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:32.560
BJ NOVAK: Perfect for this room.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.920
Yeah.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.500
TODD WOMACK: All right.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.860
Would you guys like
to hear that later?

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.485
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:03:35.485 --> 00:03:36.443
TODD WOMACK: All right.

00:03:36.443 --> 00:03:37.516
Then that shall be done.

00:03:37.516 --> 00:03:38.640
They get their wishes here.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.080
"Johnny Depp, Fate, and the
Double Decker Hollywood Tour

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.040
Bus."

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.260
BJ NOVAK: That's a story--
some of these stories have--

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.020
TODD WOMACK: These are fiction.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.353
BJ NOVAK: These are all fiction.

00:03:45.353 --> 00:03:47.495
I should have made
that more clear maybe.

00:03:47.495 --> 00:03:48.870
TODD WOMACK: It
says on the back.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:49.800
BJ NOVAK: Yeah.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.730
That's one in which Johnny Depp
faces an existential crisis

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.225
while riding a motorcycle
alongside a Hollywood tour

00:03:56.225 --> 00:03:57.700
bus that recognizes him.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.270
And he feels more
and more compelled

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.260
to show off for the tour bus.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.260
And it goes to a real
extreme of fate and legacy.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.944
And it ends, as
many of the stories

00:04:08.944 --> 00:04:10.610
do-- not many, as
several of the stories

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.670
do-- with a discussion question.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.045
TODD WOMACK: Right, which you
have in the back, questions

00:04:15.045 --> 00:04:15.280
for discussions.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.440
BJ NOVAK: I have more discussion
questions in the back.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.570
TODD WOMACK: Yeah,
discussion questions.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.589
BJ NOVAK: Yeah, I figured
I'd just jump the gun

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:22.160
and make the academic version
of the book for when it's

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.922
a classic taught in schools.

00:04:23.922 --> 00:04:25.380
I'd just save
everyone the trouble.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.130
TODD WOMACK: Yeah.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.500
That'll go well in this crowd.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.790
"Wikipedia Brown and the
Case of the Missing Bicycle."

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.820
BJ NOVAK: Wikipedia
Brown is a detective.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.090
A child detective.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.040
He's not perfect.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.060
He never said he was.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.010
But he works fast,
and he works for free.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.760
TODD WOMACK:
"Confucius at Home."

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.730
BJ NOVAK: "Confucius at Home"
is about the philosopher

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.570
Confucius, who has a scribe
with him at all times.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.890
And everything that he says,
the scribe takes for wisdom.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.000
And sometimes, that
annoys Confucius.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.680
And sometimes, he thinks, well,
that does sound pretty good.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.414
That's another one
I'd be happy to read.

00:05:05.414 --> 00:05:06.330
It's a very short one.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.370
TODD WOMACK: Great.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.360
"Heyyyyy, Rabbits."

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.360
BJ NOVAK: "Heyyyyy,
Rabbits" is an abstract one.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.100
TODD WOMACK: Did
I say that wrong?

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.920
BJ NOVAK: No, you
said it perfectly.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.520
I said it wrong.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.103
TODD WOMACK: There's
five Ys in there.

00:05:15.103 --> 00:05:15.740
BJ NOVAK: Yeah.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.550
"Heyyyyy, Rabbits" is a
very abstract and short one

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.020
about a man who-- sort of
a parable about commitment.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.800
A man who lives alone,
and sees a rabbit hopping

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.920
through his yard,
and wishes there

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.980
were a way to
attract many rabbits.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.280
But he doesn't want to keep
them cooped up or trap them.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.650
He doesn't want any
commitment to the rabbits.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.080
So he wonders how he can
just see more rabbits,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.366
hang around with rabbits,
without having a rabbit.

00:05:49.366 --> 00:05:53.240
TODD WOMACK: Very allegorical--
today's young dating scene.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.137
This one, I really
like this one.

00:05:55.137 --> 00:05:57.470
" 'Everyone was Singing the
Same Song.' " Wait, quote, "

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.469
'Everyone was Singing the
Same Song,' end quote,

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:02.110
the Duke of Earl Recalls
His Trip to America in June

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.450
of 1962."

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.020
BJ NOVAK: Are people here
familiar with the song,

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.735
"Duke of Earl"?

00:06:07.735 --> 00:06:08.360
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.151
BJ NOVAK: OK, good.

00:06:09.151 --> 00:06:13.610
So I imagined that if there
were a real Duke of Earl who

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.120
visited America the year
that that song was a hit,

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.050
he would have had such
a beautiful experience.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.550
And he might have
interpreted it as America

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.970
being this place full
of harmony and life

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.720
where everyone is singing
the same song whenever

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.860
they meet him.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.950
And to me, that was
probably an extreme version

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.190
of how people remember
America right around then.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.850
In the early '60s, when we
idealized this America, when

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.610
despite all the things
under the surface,

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.870
it seemed as though everyone
was singing the same song.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.400
So that's his vision of America.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.740
TODD WOMACK: They will a capella
a song about you, about anyone.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.231
BJ NOVAK: Yeah, but they
never sing his part.

00:06:58.231 --> 00:06:59.980
They're just kind of--
they can't help it.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.680
If you met the Duke of Earl,
you'd be like, [HUMMING]

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.570
Everyone kind of hums.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.440
And they're all so
happy to see him.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.910
They're like, you're
really the Duke of Earl?

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.230
They're just so excited.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.130
TODD WOMACK: So
I read that you--

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.520
these were the things that
you couldn't-- you had a bunch

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.490
of ideas in the writer's
room of "The Office"

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:27.200
that ended up as, not scraps,
but ideas that were different.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.910
Did you have a central storage
place for all this stuff or--

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:37.170
BJ NOVAK: Well, I kept a lot
of pocket notebooks maintaining

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.450
all these different
scraps, ideas.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.019
And when "The Office"
ended, I thought that, well,

00:07:42.019 --> 00:07:43.560
time to look through
these notebooks.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.330
I probably have four
or five screenplays

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:47.830
if you add all these
ideas together.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.965
TODD WOMACK: Right.

00:07:47.965 --> 00:07:49.316
So you actually just
pen in everything.

00:07:49.316 --> 00:07:50.190
BJ NOVAK: Yeah, yeah.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.455
Sometimes, I had them in my
phone, my Android device.

00:07:53.455 --> 00:07:55.080
TODD WOMACK: I saw
you before the show.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:55.460
BJ NOVAK: Am I doing well?

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.810
TODD WOMACK: You had
an iPhone, I think.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.640
BJ NOVAK: So I kept
them in my phone--

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.380
I don't remember what I was
using-- my phone, my notebooks.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.760
And I thought, well, I'm sure
when "The Office" is over,

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.560
I've been writing
ideas for years.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.060
There must be some
movies in there.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.518
When I looked
through a bit, it was

00:08:11.518 --> 00:08:17.210
more like I had 800
opening shots and no movie.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.060
And so I started writing
them all out thinking,

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.330
well, let's see
what I have here.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.660
And as I wrote them out,
many of them, I felt,

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:29.410
took their best
form as the story.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.390
Some of them became like
a "New Yorker" length

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:37.200
comedy piece or
piece of fiction.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.710
And others became
something you could really

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:41.809
fit even on Twitter or Tumblr.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:45.840
But all of them were
in their best form,

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.080
I felt, as my summary.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.330
TODD WOMACK: In
writing the book, being

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.980
a TV writer with a lot of
experience at this point,

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.900
how would you
differentiate writing

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:03.130
for TV purposefully as opposed
to writing stories for a book.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:06.010
BJ NOVAK: Well, I
was very focused on

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:07.720
how they could be similar.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.660
So for me, writing for an
audience was very important.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.580
And I read the stories out
loud, and actually booked

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.670
a theater-- the UCB Theater
in LA-- and once a month,

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:18.630
would read.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.680
I'd book a night
and read the stories

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:25.764
to a crowd of about 100 people,
and go up with a pen on stage,

00:09:25.764 --> 00:09:26.930
and edit in front of people.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:30.230
And that was my way of
keeping the work ethic

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:31.720
that I had from
television, where

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.320
I would write pages for the
cast, take them down to set,

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.020
think they were good,
and then figure out

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:41.080
if they were or not based on
how they played in front of me.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.370
Sometimes, I was even in
them, and I could literally

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:47.145
feel if I was scoring or not.

00:09:47.145 --> 00:09:48.520
And also, as a
stand up comedian,

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.714
I would write things,
think they were funny,

00:09:50.714 --> 00:09:51.880
and then take them on stage.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.840
And sometimes, I was right.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.490
And sometimes, I was wrong.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.180
But you never know
until you try it out.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.790
So with these stories,
I tried to adapt that

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:01.810
into a model of workshopping
that I'd seen David Sedaris do

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.780
and tried to read
them and react live.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.960
So I tried to make it like
TV in terms of my end goal

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.170
was always to entertain
and to connect.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.474
So I would try to do that
viscerally and be honest with

00:10:12.474 --> 00:10:14.390
myself about what was
working and what wasn't.

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:19.450
TODD WOMACK: That's sort of
like-- how did those go over

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.360
as a show, do you think?

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.040
BJ NOVAK: Great.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:22.335
TODD WOMACK: Yeah?

00:10:22.335 --> 00:10:23.002
BJ NOVAK: Yeah.

00:10:23.002 --> 00:10:25.460
TODD WOMACK: Did you-- because
it kind of sounds like you--

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.690
BJ NOVAK: I can see
your skepticism, yeah.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:31.314
See, I'm very attuned
to an audience.

00:10:31.314 --> 00:10:32.730
TODD WOMACK: I'm
just imagining it

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.740
as sort of like, hey, come on
and watch me work for an hour

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:36.480
down at the UCB.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.517
How did you actually--

00:10:37.517 --> 00:10:39.850
BJ NOVAK: Well, I had done a
lot of shows as a stand up,

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:40.880
including at the UCB.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.410
So I think people knew.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.650
They weren't focused on
exactly what it would be.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:45.590
They saw my name.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:47.090
They had seen me there before.

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:49.680
It said I was doing, I called
it, "Uncollected Stories."

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.530
So they figured it
be something comedic.

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.530
It wasn't like I booked a
Broadway theater or something.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.486
So by the time I
got there, I think

00:10:57.486 --> 00:11:00.110
you could see that I was wearing
my heart on my sleeve in terms

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:01.693
of how much I cared
about the stories.

00:11:01.693 --> 00:11:03.800
But the stories
are funny stories.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.500
So I'm not a masochist.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.930
I read the stories
that I thought

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.040
would be most entertaining.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.220
So yeah.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.700
But I'd seen Sedaris do
it so well that I really

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.380
wanted to make a live reading
an evening of entertainment,

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.487
and tell stories between
them, and really act out

00:11:20.487 --> 00:11:21.320
the different roles.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.950
TODD WOMACK: Yeah, so do you
have a favorite story or two

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:28.564
in the book?

00:11:28.564 --> 00:11:29.980
BJ NOVAK: They're
all my favorite.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.980
Oh god, I sound like
such a lame parent.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.286
I'm very relieved though,
because as I wrote the book,

00:11:36.286 --> 00:11:38.160
I was constantly swapping
stories in and out.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.760
And I would change my mind at
the last minute about what was

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.635
good and what wasn't.

00:11:41.635 --> 00:11:44.960
So I was very happy, in the
end, that a year later, I really

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.754
do love each one.

00:11:45.754 --> 00:11:47.670
And I, inadvertently,
whenever anyone tells me

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.669
their favorite story, I
say, that's my favorite.

00:11:49.669 --> 00:11:51.590
And I mean it every time.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.870
Because as I wrote that story,
I was in the mindset of,

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:58.460
this is my favorite thing
I've ever thought of.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.050
If you don't do that, I
feel like you're not fully

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:03.190
believing in your work.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.860
TODD WOMACK: Going back a little
bit, I found out-- let's see.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.360
You wrote for the
"Harvard Lampoon."

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:07.790
Is that right?

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:08.415
BJ NOVAK: Yeah.

00:12:10.501 --> 00:12:12.500
TODD WOMACK: Can you tell
us what that was like?

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.260
Do we have some
Harvard grads in here?

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:14.760
One?

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:15.810
Just the one guy?

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:16.657
Two people?

00:12:16.657 --> 00:12:17.740
Isn't this Google anymore?

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.820
What happened?

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:20.320
Over here?

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.770
Nobody?

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:22.900
All right.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:23.650
Just three people?

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:24.560
BJ NOVAK: Eric
Schmidt's watching this.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.130
He's like, we have a
Facebook problem again.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.005
TODD WOMACK: Getting
killed by Schmidt, guys.

00:12:28.005 --> 00:12:29.530
Come on.

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.550
Yeah, tell us about that.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:35.030
Was that your first professional
writing sort of thing?

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.710
BJ NOVAK: Well, that was
probably the first time

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:41.080
that I was held up to very
high standards for comedy.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.530
So it's a real advantage.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:47.405
I don't think there's that
much advantage to having been

00:12:47.405 --> 00:12:49.640
in the "Harvard Lampoon"
in terms of connections,

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.900
which people really
think there is because so

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.090
many of its graduates go on.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.740
I think the real
advantages are twofold.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:59.490
One is that first of all,
you leave with the confidence

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.120
that this could
be a real career.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.860
I think many funny
people, most funny people,

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:08.660
never really think that
they can be a comedy writer.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:11.960
And even if they do
wonder about it sometimes,

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:16.000
they certainly don't think
that after a year or two

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.060
of unemployment and failure in
trying to be a comedy writer.

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.227
But a "Harvard Lampoon"
graduate has seen it happen.

00:13:21.227 --> 00:13:23.643
So they get out there, and
they write script after script,

00:13:23.643 --> 00:13:25.000
and meeting after meeting.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.970
And they're confident enough
to persevere to the point

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:29.460
where it actually
starts working.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.650
So it's sort of a Dumbo's
feather in that way.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:36.810
The other advantage is
that people are mercilessly

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:41.660
critiquing your comedy
at age 18, 19, 20.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.580
And most people who
are just naturally

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:46.830
funny with their friends, their
friends never critique them.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.170
They're never like, that
story started out great.

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:52.110
Then I knew where
you were going.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:55.190
It ended strong, but I thought
the second to last joke

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:58.400
felt kind of flat because it
was the same as the first joke.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.640
No friend ever says that.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.420
So here, you're
actually, wow, you're

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.390
held up to that
kind of standard.

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.450
And you get trained
a little bit.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:07.134
TODD WOMACK: Right on.

00:14:07.134 --> 00:14:09.745
A lot of SNL writers do
come out of there, right?

00:14:09.745 --> 00:14:10.370
BJ NOVAK: Yeah.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.120
TODD WOMACK: Like
a crazy proportion.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:12.900
BJ NOVAK: Yeah.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.117
I don't know about
the exact proportion,

00:14:15.117 --> 00:14:15.950
but I know a lot do.

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:17.586
TODD WOMACK: It's 54%, actually.

00:14:17.586 --> 00:14:18.012
BJ NOVAK: Oh, wow.

00:14:18.012 --> 00:14:18.864
TODD WOMACK: I'm just kidding.

00:14:18.864 --> 00:14:20.610
BJ NOVAK: You guys, everyone
on a laptop was like--

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:21.985
TODD WOMACK: I
just made that up.

00:14:21.985 --> 00:14:23.300
I just made that up.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.690
So take me through--
so you're writing

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.300
for the "Harvard Lampoon."

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.500
You got on "The
Office" very quickly.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.566
But you had a writing
credit before that, right?

00:14:31.566 --> 00:14:32.940
BJ NOVAK: I did
write for a show.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.300
Does anyone remember a show on
the CW called-- actually, no.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:37.290
Then, it was the WB.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.937
Does anyone remember a
show called, "Raising Dad?"

00:14:39.937 --> 00:14:41.130
AUDIENCE: [MURMURING]

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.560
BJ NOVAK: Some embarrassed,
anonymous murmurs.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.102
Yeah, that's how I
feel about it too.

00:14:45.102 --> 00:14:46.851
Yeah, I might've seen
that a couple times.

00:14:46.851 --> 00:14:48.870
TODD WOMACK: That was a
polite murmur, I think.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.230
BJ NOVAK: It was a show
starring Bob Saget.

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:51.640
TODD WOMACK: He's great.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.306
BJ NOVAK: And his two
teenage daughters,

00:14:53.306 --> 00:14:57.810
who now are quite successful--
Kat Dennings and Brie Larson,

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.780
both of whom have
great acting careers.

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.710
So I was 21.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:07.620
I had put up a show at
Harvard called the BJ Show.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:10.770
It was not-- yeah, anyway.

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:13.260
And I had invited-- I
traded on the Harvard

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:14.260
name pretty shamelessly.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.440
I wrote a letter
called, "To Bob Saget."

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.230
And I said, the
"Harvard Lampoon"

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.620
would like to honor you,
give you some award.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.200
Basically, they
let me give anyone

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.680
an award if you're on staff.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.380
Yeah, sure, give him an award.

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:27.350
How much is a trophy?

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:30.000
I'll say you're Comedian of
the Century or something.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.420
And would you like to come
and receive your honor?

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:35.310
And also, there's
this show called

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.070
the BJ Show, funny coincidence.

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:38.560
I'd love to have you in.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.020
And so he was very
flattered and happy to have

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.350
Harvard on his resume.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:43.590
So he said sure.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:44.722
So he came out.

00:15:44.722 --> 00:15:46.430
And the show-- I put
a lot into the show.

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:47.471
The show was really good.

00:15:47.471 --> 00:15:51.400
We wrote a script called,
"The Lost Full House Episode,"

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.230
that I acted in with him.

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:56.360
I played Uncle Jesse, and he
played-- he played himself.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.665
He played Danny Tanner.

00:15:57.665 --> 00:15:58.830
TODD WOMACK: Yeah, you've gotta
give yourself the Jesse part.

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:00.496
BJ NOVAK: It was an
R-rated "Full House"

00:16:00.496 --> 00:16:05.720
episode in which Danny tries
to teach Michelle about sex.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.380
And then Uncle Jesse overhears
and realizes that Danny

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:09.930
doesn't know what sex is.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:13.560
And so then Uncle
Jesse explains sex

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.642
to Danny, who then becomes
a sex-crazed maniac.

00:16:19.317 --> 00:16:21.900
It didn't really make sense, I
guess, if you thought about it.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.190
But it definitely
worked on stage.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.890
So on the strength of
that, he and the creator

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:29.820
of "Raising Dad"
offered to hire me

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:34.490
as the young writer who would
edge up their writer's room.

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:36.170
And I was happy to do it.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.378
I wasn't looking for something
like that at the time,

00:16:38.378 --> 00:16:39.471
but I knew not to say no.

00:16:39.471 --> 00:16:40.970
So that became my
first writing job.

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:48.580
Then that was cancelled,
shockingly, after a year.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:52.390
And then after that, I had
some money saved up now,

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:55.040
but I was back to square one.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.830
And then I started
doing stand up comedy,

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:59.210
and that eventually led to
"The Office" about two years

00:16:59.210 --> 00:16:59.610
after that.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:02.109
TODD WOMACK: Yeah, I heard you
say that Greg Daniels saw you

00:17:02.109 --> 00:17:04.380
at the Ha Ha, which I've
done plenty of shows at.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.050
I mean, it's a special place.

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:06.750
BJ NOVAK: Greg
Daniels, I'm sure,

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:07.880
has never been to the Ha Ha.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.250
TODD WOMACK: That's
what I was thinking.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:08.660
I wanted to talk
to you about that.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.170
BJ NOVAK: I started
at the Ha Ha.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:10.900
He saw me at the Improv.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:11.180
TODD WOMACK: OK.

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:11.750
Great, great.

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:12.150
BJ NOVAK: Yeah.

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:13.380
Greg Daniels does
not go to the Ha Ha.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.530
TODD WOMACK: That's what I
was going to actually ask you.

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.109
BJ NOVAK: That is the
world's saddest place.

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:17.190
TODD WOMACK: I know for a fact.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:17.790
BJ NOVAK: Yeah.

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:19.010
They should have
that under the sign.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:20.509
It would probably
get more business.

00:17:20.509 --> 00:17:23.839
Ha Ha Comedy Club-- the
World's Saddest Place.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:26.589
People would be like, that's
an interesting juxtaposition.

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:28.844
They have a sophisticated
sense of comedy over there.

00:17:28.844 --> 00:17:30.510
TODD WOMACK: But no,
it's quite literal.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:30.930
BJ NOVAK: No, no.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:32.263
It's the saddest place on earth.

00:17:32.263 --> 00:17:34.380
This is so you don't
sue us for expecting

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:35.644
a positive experience.

00:17:35.644 --> 00:17:37.060
TODD WOMACK: A lot
of comedy clubs

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.960
though, there's just not
a lot of joy in the--

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.810
BJ NOVAK: Not a lot of
joy in a comedy club.

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.160
Yeah.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.564
TODD WOMACK: But so Greg Daniels
sees you, and what happens?

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:46.480
BJ NOVAK: Greg saw me.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.438
I had been unemployed
now for a couple of years

00:17:48.438 --> 00:17:50.900
and had been doing stand
up just about every night,

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:54.655
and had built up now a
pretty good stand up act.

00:17:54.655 --> 00:17:57.880
A pretty good brief act,
like 10 minutes-- 10 minutes

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.550
that was really good and about
20 that were not very good.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.590
But on these
showcases, they have

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:05.940
you do the seven that are good.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.070
So I was doing this
show, and Greg was there.

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:12.254
And he was putting together the
cast for the very early stages

00:18:12.254 --> 00:18:12.920
of "The Office."

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.378
TODD WOMACK: So if you guys
don't know who Greg Daniels is,

00:18:15.378 --> 00:18:17.900
he's a big-time TV
producer, showrunner.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.130
And he was tasked
with Americanizing

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:21.180
the British "Office."

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.480
BJ NOVAK: He had been a
writer for "The Simpsons"

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.580
and "Saturday Night Live."

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.990
And then had created
"King of the Hill,"

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:28.769
and now was looking
for his next thing.

00:18:28.769 --> 00:18:31.310
And "The Office," at that time,
was a very acclaimed but very

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:32.860
short-lived British show.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:36.690
And the producers had
found him and asked him

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:38.549
if he would adapt
the American show.

00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:40.340
So he was the one in
charge of figuring out

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:41.310
what this would be.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:42.101
TODD WOMACK: Right.

00:18:42.101 --> 00:18:44.030
So did you have that,
"I like you, kid,"

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:47.155
moment that so many
people yearn for?

00:18:47.155 --> 00:18:47.780
BJ NOVAK: Yeah.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.060
That's not-- he
doesn't talk like that.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.560
TODD WOMACK: He's
not from the '30s?

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:52.320
BJ NOVAK: No.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:52.950
No.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.440
This happened in this century.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.280
But it was that same vibe.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.711
TODD WOMACK: Barely, though.

00:18:58.711 --> 00:18:59.960
Three years into this century.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:00.876
BJ NOVAK: That's true.

00:19:00.876 --> 00:19:02.590
Early into this
century, just barely.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.560
Because in the '90s, we
all talked like that.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.550
TODD WOMACK: Yeah, I remember.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:09.650
BJ NOVAK: I was there.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:12.550
So yeah, he saw me and
asked for a meeting.

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:16.680
And he saw me for
the role of The Temp,

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.650
as he called it,
someone who thought

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:20.496
he was better than this place.

00:19:20.496 --> 00:19:22.870
Quiet and thought he was better
than this place, which is

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.920
sort of a vibe I had on stage.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.100
I think I wore a suit back then.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.740
I had very good one-liners, and
I paused a lot between them.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:32.600
And I think that
was out of fear,

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.050
but I think people
interpreted that as cockiness.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:36.550
TODD WOMACK: You're
just stretching.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:37.650
You're just sweating
inside, stretching it.

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:38.275
BJ NOVAK: Yeah.

00:19:38.275 --> 00:19:42.030
And he knew that he
would like, ideally,

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:43.960
to have writer-actors on shown.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.800
And he knew that I
had written before.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.650
So he talked to me
about potentially

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:48.970
being a writer-actor.

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:51.095
TODD WOMACK: To which you
replied, where do I sign?

00:19:51.095 --> 00:19:51.719
BJ NOVAK: Yeah.

00:19:51.719 --> 00:19:52.620
Where do I sign?

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:53.411
TODD WOMACK: Great.

00:19:53.411 --> 00:19:55.320
And so that started very soon.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.890
You went on for
eight years, right?

00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:59.060
BJ NOVAK: Yeah.

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.239
It was a nine-year
show, actually.

00:20:01.239 --> 00:20:02.280
I was on for eight years.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.630
TODD WOMACK: Yeah, right.

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:08.360
So I saw that you actually were
executive producing by the end,

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.780
directing, writing stories.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.530
BJ NOVAK: Well, executive
producing really

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:16.070
means, in most
cases, that you have

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:18.000
been a writer for a long time.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.700
And my least favorite
thing, by the way,

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:25.530
is when people try to give you
metaphors so you'll understand.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:27.932
Like, it's like for you guys
when-- I hate that so much.

00:20:27.932 --> 00:20:28.890
TODD WOMACK: Maybe not.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:29.320
They don't work in TV.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.819
BJ NOVAK: But it's like here
or in any other profession when

00:20:31.819 --> 00:20:34.550
you might get a job title
increase every year,

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:37.277
but you've been doing the
same thing every year.

00:20:37.277 --> 00:20:38.860
You've just been
doing it well, so you

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:39.970
keep getting a new title.

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:42.150
That's what the writers
on any show tend to be.

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:47.130
So I started as an
executive story editor,

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:51.570
that is really like-- did anyone
take swimming lessons in camp?

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.490
And it's like beginner,
advanced beginner, intermediate,

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:55.710
it's like those levels.

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:57.950
So the levels-- and I'll
go through them right now.

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:02.015
They're official levels in
comedy writing on a Writers

00:21:02.015 --> 00:21:02.890
Guild sponsored show.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.590
You start as a staff writer.

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.100
That's what I was
in "Raising Dad."

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.530
Then story editor.

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.370
Then executive story editor.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:10.900
I'm not making this up.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.080
Then co-producer.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.680
Then producer.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.245
There could be many
producers though.

00:21:18.245 --> 00:21:20.540
And sometimes, there's only
one co-producer and several

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.260
producers.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.080
I'm not making this up.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:24.919
Staff writer.

00:21:24.919 --> 00:21:25.460
Story editor.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:26.480
Executive story editor.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.260
Co-producer.

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:28.540
Producer.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.180
Supervising producer.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:34.260
Co-executive producer.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.475
Executive producer.

00:21:35.475 --> 00:21:36.850
TODD WOMACK:
Congratulations, you

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:37.540
made it all the way to the top.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.915
BJ NOVAK: It just
means I made it

00:21:38.915 --> 00:21:42.110
to the final level of
Scientology, basically.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.810
Yeah.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:43.772
I met L. Ron Hubbard.

00:21:43.772 --> 00:21:44.980
TODD WOMACK: Congratulations.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:45.800
BJ NOVAK: Thank you.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.175
TODD WOMACK: I could feel it
in your hand when you shake.

00:21:48.175 --> 00:21:49.490
And there are two microphones.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:50.684
If you all want to start.

00:21:50.684 --> 00:21:52.600
If anyone has questions,
go ahead and step up.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.320
And we'll grab you
when you come up.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.260
But feel free to also do that.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:02.385
Really quickly, so we we're
going to take some questions.

00:22:02.385 --> 00:22:03.010
BJ NOVAK: Sure.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:05.200
TODD WOMACK: You are going to
do a little signing afterward.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.280
Would you like to read
some of the book now?

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:07.630
BJ NOVAK: Sure.

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:09.588
TODD WOMACK: What story
would you like to read?

00:22:09.588 --> 00:22:12.550
BJ NOVAK: I can read maybe
the more internet age

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:14.109
ones because we're here.

00:22:14.109 --> 00:22:15.400
TODD WOMACK: Whatever you want.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.950
BJ NOVAK: I can read
"The Man Who Posted

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.030
Pictures of Everything He Ate."

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.010
Very brief story.

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:22.760
[THUMPING]

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.250
This sound effect is part
of the story, by the way.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:25.666
TODD WOMACK:
Somebody's just going

00:22:25.666 --> 00:22:28.532
to complete the drywall
back there as we go.

00:22:28.532 --> 00:22:30.490
BJ NOVAK: So again, some
of these are 20 pages,

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:32.490
and some of them
are half a page.

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.922
This one is closer
to the latter.

00:22:34.922 --> 00:22:36.380
This is called,
"The Man Who Posted

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:39.870
Pictures of Everything He Ate."

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:43.220
"Once, there was a man
who posted pictures online

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.210
of most of the things he ate.

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:48.480
He put up pictures
of most of his meals

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:52.220
and some of his snacks
with little captions.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:23:00.230
'Yum!' 'I made this myself.'
'Hits the spot.' 'Salty.' 'I'm

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:06.150
going to regret this tomorrow.'
'Yum!' And plenty of times,

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:09.030
most of the time, he simply
let the pictures speak

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:10.840
for themselves.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:16.320
The 16, then 15, then
16, then 14 people

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:21.280
who followed him made fun
of him for it mercilessly.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.790
'Why do you post pictures of
your food?' 'We don't give

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:28.100
a [PAUSE] what you
ate.' " In the book,

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.650
the swears are not bleeped out,
but this person in the thread

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:31.600
bleeped it out.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.599
Just explaining.

00:23:33.599 --> 00:23:34.890
TODD WOMACK: I can verify that.

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.730
BJ NOVAK: "The more they
teased him, the more he did it.

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:41.360
And the more he did it,
the more they teased him.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:46.695
'Why do you always post pics
of your food?' He did it

00:23:46.695 --> 00:23:49.320
because it made him feel like he
was eating his meals with more

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.940
people.

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:56.050
It was the same reason
he liked the teasing."

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:57.700
TODD WOMACK: Sad, sweet, funny.

00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:58.040
You said it yourself.

00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.915
BJ NOVAK: I'll read the
other one I mentioned

00:23:59.915 --> 00:24:03.075
too, "Wikipedia Brown."

00:24:03.075 --> 00:24:04.200
Let's see if I can find it.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:04.440
There we go.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:04.920
TODD WOMACK: I read that one.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:05.470
I enjoyed that one a bit.

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:06.303
BJ NOVAK: Thank you.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:12.540
This is called "Wikipedia Brown
and the Case of the Missing

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:16.260
Bicycle." "It was
a quiet Sunday.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.220
Wikipedia Brown was
sipping lemonade

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.280
with his friend, Sally,
when all of a sudden,

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.510
their classmate, Joey,
ran in, out of breath.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:24.810
'Help,' said Joey.

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:26.420
'Someone stole my bike.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:30.920
I left it outside the
library this morning.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.770
Who stole it?'

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:36.380
'The modern day chain bicycle
was patented in Germany

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:41.110
in 1877,' said Wikipedia Brown.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:43.670
'10-speed bikes became
popular in the United States

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:45.300
in the 1970s.

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:49.290
Carrot Top uses a bicycle as a
prop in his popular mainstream

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.620
comedy act.'

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:52.880
'Oh, Carrot Top,' said Joey.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.900
'What ever happened
to that guy?'

00:24:55.900 --> 00:25:00.050
'Carrot Top was born Scott
Thompson in Big Bear City,

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:04.920
California, in 1965,'
said Wikipedia Brown.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.130
'Big Bear City?

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:07.060
What an odd name.

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:09.710
Is that a real
place?' asked Joey.

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:11.750
'Big Bear City is
an unincorporated

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:15.450
census-designated place in San
Bernardino County, California,

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:16.720
with a population of--'

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:21.110
'Wait, let's not get
distracted,' said Sally.

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:26.560
'Every time we talk to Wikipedia
Brown, we get distracted.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.880
We spend hours and
hours with him,

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:32.530
and always forget what we
were supposed to investigate

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.860
in the first place.'

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:36.250
'Yes, good point,' said Joey.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:37.710
'We have to find my bike.

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:40.600
Sally, do you have any ideas?'

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:45.290
'Sally is a bad detective
and a well-known slut,' said

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:46.120
Wikipedia Brown.

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:54.750
'Citation needed.'

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:59.445
'Is-- is that true?' asked
Joey, his intentions unclear.

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.220
'No,' said Sally,
fuming with anger.

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:07.470
'I don't know told him that.

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:11.890
It could've been anyone,
literally anyone.'

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:15.160
'The government caused 9/11,'
said Wikipedia Brown suddenly

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.510
for no reason.

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:20.370
Sally pulled
Wikipedia Brown aside.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:23.120
'Are you sure you're
OK, Wikipedia?'

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:25.880
'I'm not perfect,'
said Wikipedia Brown.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.500
'I never said I was.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.380
But I work fast,
and I work for free.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.100
And that's all anyone seems
to care about these days.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.170
Plus, I'm getting
better by the second,

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:38.010
and it's all thanks to people
like you.' Sally smiled.

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:41.000
She liked being part
of Wikipedia's process.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.145
'OK, Wikipedia,' said Sally.

00:26:43.145 --> 00:26:45.180
'But I have a question
for you, Joey.

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:47.350
You say you left your
bike outside the library

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:48.540
this morning.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.320
It's Sunday morning.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:55.550
The library's closed.' Wikipedia
Brown stood up with a start.

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:59.540
'Barack Obama is the father of
Miley Cyrus' baby,' announced

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.290
Wikipedia Brown.

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:04.410
This story is under review."

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:04.980
Thank you.

00:27:09.864 --> 00:27:11.030
TODD WOMACK: Very well done.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:11.910
We have those in the back.

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:12.730
Don't be shy, guys.

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:13.640
Oh, you got one.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.340
Go for it.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:18.236
AUDIENCE: So you've
got this book

00:27:18.236 --> 00:27:20.485
and your children's book,
"The Book with No Pictures."

00:27:20.485 --> 00:27:23.150
Do you prefer heading
down this path

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:25.110
of being a book
writer versus sticking

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:27.542
with traditional
screen and TV writing?

00:27:27.542 --> 00:27:29.000
If you could call
that traditional.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.510
BJ NOVAK: Yeah, I think I
will be back next in what

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:33.390
I was doing before.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:37.290
But I became a much
richer, I think,

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:40.120
entertainer and writer
from doing this.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.580
Where I could really
go deep into who I was

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:43.860
and what I wanted to say.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:46.370
And some of the other
stories are deeper than that.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.932
You're like, well,
that's not that deep.

00:27:48.932 --> 00:27:51.380
I could really go
deeper into ideas

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.520
and then really take
full responsibility

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.150
for bringing them
to an audience,

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:59.450
reading them out loud,
promoting them online, designing

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:02.800
the covers-- which obviously, I
put a lot of design work into.

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.784
TODD WOMACK: This one too.

00:28:04.784 --> 00:28:06.450
BJ NOVAK: Which took
a surprising amount

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:08.310
of design work actually.

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:10.390
Simplicity can be difficult.

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:13.130
But I think I'm
much richer for it.

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:15.400
But I think probably
what I'll do

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:19.653
next is back on those fields,
because what my real love is

00:28:19.653 --> 00:28:23.080
is connecting through
entertainment.

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.020
Making someone's
favorite something

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.230
is what I always say
is what I want to do.

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:30.600
So you can make a lot of
people's favorite something

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:34.710
more if you do it
for more people.

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:37.940
I hope no one ever
quotes me on that.

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:38.560
Really vague.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.690
But you get what
I'm trying to say.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:42.380
TODD WOMACK: While we're on this
topic of this book, real quick.

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.796
If you haven't seen this one,
"The Book with No Pictures,"

00:28:44.796 --> 00:28:45.550
it's a kids' book.

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:47.640
And it's really fun.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.100
There's a video
of you reading it

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.250
to a bunch of kids,
which is quite cool.

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:53.517
The kids love this book, yeah?

00:28:53.517 --> 00:28:55.350
BJ NOVAK: It's a very
big hit with the kids.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:57.610
TODD WOMACK: I've
heard this before.

00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:58.270
I don't know.

00:28:58.270 --> 00:28:59.010
Do you want to describe it?

00:28:59.010 --> 00:28:59.900
Maybe I don't want
to butcher it.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:00.524
BJ NOVAK: Sure.

00:29:00.524 --> 00:29:05.720
This is a book with no pictures.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:09.710
I'll start it out for you. "This
is a book with no pictures.

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:11.460
It might seem like
no fun for someone

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:14.740
to read you a book
with no pictures.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.990
It probably seems
boring and serious.

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:21.010
Except--" I know
the book by heart.

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:23.050
"Here's how books work.

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:25.510
Everything the words say,
the person reading the book

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:27.320
has to say.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.240
No matter what.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.380
That's the deal.

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:32.730
That's the rule.

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:37.560
So that means even if
the words say-- Blork.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.235
Wait, what?

00:29:38.235 --> 00:29:39.970
That doesn't even mean anything.

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:40.470
Bluurf.

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:41.270
Wait a second.

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:41.890
What?

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:44.214
This isn't the kind of
book I wanted to read."

00:29:44.214 --> 00:29:45.630
So that's the
premise of the book.

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:48.700
And then it makes you say
all kinds of silly things.

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:52.270
"Yes, I am a monkey."
"I'm a robot monkey."

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:53.680
You have to praise the kid.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.840
"Best kid ever."

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:59.560
Eventually, they usually laugh
just at the sight of this page

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:03.155
because they know what things
like this are going to lead to.

00:30:03.155 --> 00:30:05.130
They call that
the Mayhem Spread.

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:07.665
So the idea is
that the parent has

00:30:07.665 --> 00:30:09.040
to be engaged in
this read aloud.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.000
But really, the
secret message is

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.210
that words have
this great power,

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:16.350
and you can abuse this power.

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:18.310
That's how you know
it's a cool power.

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.940
TODD WOMACK: This is great.

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:19.990
I love the concept for this.

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.060
BJ NOVAK: Thank you.

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:21.768
TODD WOMACK: How'd
you come up with that?

00:30:21.768 --> 00:30:23.910
BJ NOVAK: Well, I was
reading-- my best friend,

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:28.669
Ches, from college had a
kid who was two at the time.

00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:29.960
And I would read lots of books.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.260
And he would always come up
to me holding a book for me

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:33.039
to read.

00:30:33.039 --> 00:30:35.080
And at some point, I
thought, this is very funny.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.310
He doesn't realize
how much power he has.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:41.330
Because I'm used to being
a co-executive producer

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:44.720
or higher, and now,
I'm just an actor who

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.264
has to say whatever
lines he hands me.

00:30:47.264 --> 00:30:48.180
That's what a book is.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.380
It's a script.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.269
When you're two and
handing it to an adult,

00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:53.560
you're handing them a script
that they have to perform.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.375
So I thought, well,
what's the funniest script

00:30:56.375 --> 00:30:57.890
that a kid could hand you?

00:30:57.890 --> 00:30:59.330
Well, it would be
things that they

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:04.220
know what it's going to say,
but you act so bewildered by.

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.050
So that was the
original idea for it.

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:07.190
TODD WOMACK: Yeah, it's
a good, fun, little game.

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.560
BJ NOVAK: Yeah.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.059
And I guess the lesson that I
learned well from "The Office"

00:31:10.059 --> 00:31:14.590
is that, if something
crazy happens,

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:16.600
the real laughter is
on the reaction shot.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.247
So that's why the parent has
all this dialog like, what?

00:31:19.247 --> 00:31:20.330
I didn't want to say that.

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:21.790
What kind of book is this?

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:23.249
Excuse me?

00:31:23.249 --> 00:31:24.415
That's where the kid laughs.

00:31:24.415 --> 00:31:26.690
It's not when you say
the outrageous thing.

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:28.386
It's when you react
deadpan to it.

00:31:28.386 --> 00:31:30.052
So that's a lesson I
took from the show.

00:31:30.052 --> 00:31:30.454
TODD WOMACK: Yeah.

00:31:30.454 --> 00:31:30.856
It's a great, great book.

00:31:30.856 --> 00:31:32.230
How about a question?

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.940
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:33.930
Thanks for coming.

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:36.280
I got "One More Thing"
right when it came out.

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.480
And it was one of those
books I couldn't put down.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:38.910
BJ NOVAK: Thank you.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:39.850
AUDIENCE: Very well crafted.

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:40.880
BJ NOVAK: Thank you.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.210
AUDIENCE: And so I
loved the comedic parts.

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:46.640
But there were also some that
took a turn for the profound.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.390
They could be read
almost as parables.

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:54.850
And I was curious as to how
much influence the fabulist

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:56.510
writers had over you?

00:31:56.510 --> 00:32:00.480
Such as Italo Calvino with his
book, "Numbers in the Dark,"

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:03.180
and those types of
story collections.

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:05.320
BJ NOVAK: I don't
know that book.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.270
I was a literature
student in school,

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:10.260
and read a lot of
magical realism,

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:13.940
and was drawn, in my
free time, to stuff

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:18.470
by George Saunders, Richard
Brautigan, Philip K. Dick

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:19.170
sometimes.

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:22.800
People that are--
the last name is

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.720
more cerebral in
terms of his concepts,

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.730
but they were actually
very emotional too.

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:29.770
So I was always really
drawn to fiction

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:34.210
that captures something,
as David Foster

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:35.350
Wallace liked to say.

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:39.820
That really used the
abstract to express something

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.980
that couldn't be
expressed in another way.

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:43.590
So I was very drawn to that.

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:46.070
And often, when I started
with these stories,

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:49.830
each one started with an
idea that made me laugh.

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:52.205
One of them, probably the most
emotional one in the book,

00:32:52.205 --> 00:32:53.500
is called "Sophia."

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:58.150
And it started as a very
silly idea I had written down.

00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:04.230
It said, "First AI to feel
love falls in love with man

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:06.440
who doesn't want commitment."

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.300
And then I wrote,
"Garry Shandling?"

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:12.425
I thought it's sort of like
his old-time style to do that.

00:33:12.425 --> 00:33:13.800
But the story I
ended up writing,

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:18.380
"Sophia," I put so much
of my own observations,

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:22.810
and hypocrisies, and
heartbreaks into,

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:25.060
that it evolved into
something more that way.

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:28.480
I think that type of fiction
had always been in me.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.430
I wouldn't have dared
to attempt it head on.

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:36.290
But I sort of
accidentally pursued it

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:40.399
in the service of trying
to make a comedic story.

00:33:40.399 --> 00:33:41.940
That was also a
lesson that I learned

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:46.490
from "The Office" in that the
biggest comedic moments tend

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:48.540
to come when you're
emotionally invested.

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.960
So if I didn't
have a good joke, I

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:54.030
would just go deeper into truth
as far as I could until a joke

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:55.902
presented itself.

00:33:55.902 --> 00:33:56.610
Thanks very much.

00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:57.460
I'm really glad
you liked the book.

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:58.620
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:00.320
TODD WOMACK: Copies
for sale over there.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.962
How about a question?

00:34:01.962 --> 00:34:03.920
AUDIENCE: Hey, thanks so
much again for coming.

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.920
And I think I also owe you a
thank you for "Boo Boo Butt"

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.716
being a favorite word
of my two-year old's.

00:34:08.716 --> 00:34:11.350
BJ NOVAK: Oh, great.

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:13.550
AUDIENCE: So it's clear
to me from listening

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:15.550
to the way you talk
about your process

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:17.510
and also just hearing
you read, that you really

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:21.020
have specific intonations for
the way things should be read,

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:24.850
or how quickly, and the voice
level and all that stuff.

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:27.770
So it's very interesting that
you ultimately put it in a book

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:32.060
where the speaker or the
reader really makes decisions

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:33.120
on what it sounds like.

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.370
So I was just wondering if
you could talk a little bit

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:37.159
about that and
why you ultimately

00:34:37.159 --> 00:34:38.739
decided to go with
a book as opposed

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:40.531
to maybe a YouTube video.

00:34:40.531 --> 00:34:41.989
BJ NOVAK: And you
mean specifically

00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:42.906
the kids' book, right?

00:34:42.906 --> 00:34:43.780
AUDIENCE: Either one.

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:46.080
Even just listening to the
way you read-- I'm sorry.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.280
I haven't read "One
More Time" yet.

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.360
"One More Thing," sorry.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.549
But you definitely
have a vision and a way

00:34:52.549 --> 00:34:53.820
of hearing it in your head.

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:57.880
BJ NOVAK: Well, what I
did was, with this book,

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:03.670
I think a lot of parents don't
feel they know how to be funny.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:04.420
I hear that a lot.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:06.628
And they hear this is a
funny book, and they're like,

00:35:06.628 --> 00:35:08.050
I'm not funny though.

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:10.890
And they are funny, but they
don't have the confidence,

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:12.348
or they don't know
how to be funny.

00:35:12.348 --> 00:35:15.280
So again, I thought of
this book as a script.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.820
And with the layout, it
was important to have

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:22.110
it seem like stage directions.

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:25.450
But I didn't want them to think
about it or feel intimidated.

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:29.090
So for example, "And
now, I'm reading

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:31.564
you this book with my monkey
mouth and my monkey voice.

00:35:31.564 --> 00:35:32.230
That's not true.

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:35.075
I'm not a monkey."

00:35:35.075 --> 00:35:36.700
I think you can tell
that this is meant

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:40.320
to be more colorful,
a little goofy,

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.299
and this is meant to
be straight and small.

00:35:42.299 --> 00:35:43.840
But you don't have
to think about it.

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:47.280
And then I timed the page turns
to exactly where I thought

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.609
the pauses would naturally go.

00:35:48.609 --> 00:35:50.400
I tried to make it
seamless so you wouldn't

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.760
have to think about it.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.980
That said, there's a
little song in there.

00:35:55.980 --> 00:36:00.420
And I was reading it for my
best friend's son, Bruce,

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.630
after it was done.

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:04.390
And Ches, my friend,
warned me, "by the way,

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:07.186
we do the song
differently in our house."

00:36:07.186 --> 00:36:08.390
So that's great.

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:10.230
I love people having
their own traditions

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:13.090
and their own spin on it.

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:16.569
It's like when you write
a play, and actors do it

00:36:16.569 --> 00:36:17.860
in all types of different ways.

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.250
But you make it clear
from the stage directions,

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:23.350
and the dynamics,
and the exclamation

00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:26.160
points-- a thousand
little choices

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.400
dictate what you are picturing.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.743
But then it's exciting when
people do different things.

00:36:30.743 --> 00:36:32.993
AUDIENCE: Have you ever heard
someone read it in a way

00:36:32.993 --> 00:36:34.270
that you were like, oh, no.

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:35.193
That's not right.

00:36:35.193 --> 00:36:35.960
TODD WOMACK: Cut.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:36.570
BJ NOVAK: No.

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:39.420
But I've seen people do it.

00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:42.350
I've stolen from other
people, the way they read it.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:50.430
My cousin's husband reads it to
their kid in a very deadpan way

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:52.650
that I hadn't thought
of until I saw

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:54.670
him do it and got huge laughs.

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:57.310
Because I thought you try
to be a little animated.

00:36:57.310 --> 00:36:59.670
I'm not that animated
an actor, but I try

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:01.440
to amp it up for a kids' book.

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.639
But then he took it
get even further down.

00:37:03.639 --> 00:37:05.180
And it was funny
because the contrast

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.020
of the dignity of,
"I didn't want to say

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.580
that," that cracked the kid up.

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:11.357
So yeah, I'm always learning.

00:37:11.357 --> 00:37:12.190
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:13.270
BJ NOVAK: Thank you.

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:15.169
TODD WOMACK: Let's
do another one.

00:37:15.169 --> 00:37:15.710
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:18.200
You talked a little bit
about hoping that you make

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.450
somebody's favorite something.

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:21.700
And you definitely made one
of my favorite somethings,

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:22.670
which is "The Office."

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:23.400
BJ NOVAK: Thank you.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.670
AUDIENCE: And this is a
pretty simple question,

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:27.290
but I would actually love to
know what your favorite episode

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:29.930
was in terms of either writing
or the way it panned out,

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:33.650
and how you felt
about playing Ryan.

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:34.650
BJ NOVAK: Thank you.

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:37.510
I'm somewhat-- like
the book of stories,

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:39.760
I'll ask you at the end what
your favorite episode is,

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.240
and I bet, instinctively,
I'll say, that's my favorite.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:45.460
Because I'm taken back to
the moment when it was all

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.390
I thought about.

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:49.729
I would say, sort of
all-time, the one that

00:37:49.729 --> 00:37:52.270
makes me smile the most, if I
was about to die and they said,

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.269
we're going to play one
"Office" episode for you

00:37:54.269 --> 00:37:57.040
for old-time's sake, I'd
say, play "The Injury."

00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:57.765
That was the one.

00:37:57.765 --> 00:37:58.640
Mindy wrote that one.

00:37:58.640 --> 00:37:59.639
It made me really happy.

00:38:03.872 --> 00:38:06.080
It's opening monologue could
only have been our show.

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:12.170
It was Steve Carell grilled his
foot on a George Foreman Grill

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:15.730
because he liked to wake up to
the smell of crackling bacon.

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:18.860
So he kept a Foreman
Grill next to his bed.

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:20.210
And then he goes back to sleep.

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:23.390
He has like a snooze button
system where he closes it,

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:24.680
grills a little more.

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:27.465
Then he stepped on the
grill and punctuates it

00:38:27.465 --> 00:38:29.810
by showing the grill
marks on his foot.

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:32.067
Then he thinks he's
handicapped, and comes in

00:38:32.067 --> 00:38:33.900
and lectures everyone
on handicap awareness.

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:40.450
Only Steve Carell could do that
without you turning off the TV,

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:43.140
saying this show is
fucking ridiculous.

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:45.550
Because it was ridiculous,
but he grounded it

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:51.250
with so much passion and
belief that you were like,

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:54.589
I guess some people have to
work at a place like this.

00:38:54.589 --> 00:38:55.630
And it just became funny.

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:57.970
I think that one is a
great example of the show.

00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:00.470
It could have only been us, and
so it makes me really proud.

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:01.678
What's your favorite episode?

00:39:01.678 --> 00:39:03.610
AUDIENCE: My favorite's
"Women's Appreciation"

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:05.240
when there's the flasher
in the beginning.

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:05.948
BJ NOVAK: Oh, OK.

00:39:05.948 --> 00:39:07.870
AUDIENCE: That's
one of my favorites.

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:08.550
TODD WOMACK: "That's
my favorite too."

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.940
That's your line.

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:09.810
BJ NOVAK: I didn't
work on that one.

00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:10.520
Yeah.

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.390
I didn't work on
that one that much.

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:12.170
AUDIENCE: Also "WUPHF."

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:13.128
I think that's amazing.

00:39:13.128 --> 00:39:15.660
BJ NOVAK: Thank you. "WUPHF,"
I like that one a lot too.

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.410
I have a friend at
Google in Mountain View

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:19.370
that says that
sometimes, ideas come up,

00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:20.900
and they compare
them to WUPFH.com.

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:24.984
So I'm honored to make
it into your lexicon.

00:39:24.984 --> 00:39:26.360
TODD WOMACK: Go ahead.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.930
AUDIENCE: So when
you're writing a book,

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:30.860
I guess it's more of
a solitary process.

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:33.930
You're not necessarily writing
with other writers in a writing

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:34.430
room.

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:37.907
You're not necessarily
writing for any actors.

00:39:37.907 --> 00:39:39.240
Do you find it more challenging?

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:42.430
Or what differences do
you find in that process?

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:44.890
BJ NOVAK: In some ways,
it's much more challenging.

00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:47.424
In some ways, it's
much-- I would

00:39:47.424 --> 00:39:49.340
change the word "challenging"
to "frustrating"

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:50.554
as a better way to get at it.

00:39:50.554 --> 00:39:52.220
In some ways, it's
much more frustrating

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:56.820
because when you hit a wall,
there's no coasting on a wave.

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.140
It's sort of like--
well, I was going

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:01.390
to compare it to [INAUDIBLE],
but I don't know enough.

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:03.342
But anyway, take that back.

00:40:03.342 --> 00:40:05.550
When you're in a writer's
room, there's so many ideas

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:08.510
going all the time
and so many minds

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:11.180
going all the time,
that if you're stuck,

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:14.346
someone else is
going in a direction.

00:40:14.346 --> 00:40:15.470
It could be their own idea.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:18.050
It could be elaborating
on what you pitched.

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:19.260
You can zone out.

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:20.990
You can have a bad day.

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.970
Be in a bad mood.

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:25.010
Not have had enough coffee.

00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:27.677
Be mentally stuck
on a certain idea.

00:40:27.677 --> 00:40:29.510
And there's just all
these smart people that

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:30.800
are just moving it forward.

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.550
And you can coast on
what they're doing.

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:36.800
Or you can just be
leaning back, zoning out,

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.800
and then you have an-- someone
says something, you riff on it,

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.030
and you save the day.

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:43.490
And you weren't
stressed in the least.

00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:46.470
So that form of
collaboration is incredible.

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:51.910
And it's very frustrating not to
have when you're working solo.

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:54.160
But the frustration that you
avoid when you work solo,

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:59.950
I found, is that you get to be
your own harshest critic, which

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:01.010
can be very liberating.

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:04.720
Because when you make a pass
at yourself, you're there.

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:09.070
So often, I would have an idea
that I loved on "The Office"

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:11.360
or I had written a
script that I loved,

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:14.890
and they didn't want to cast
it the way I envisioned it.

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:18.110
Or they did and now
we're editing it,

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:19.760
and they took out
the scene that was

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:22.030
the whole reason I wrote
the script because it

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:23.590
didn't fit for time.

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:26.820
And I was like, cut the rest
of the episode for time.

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:28.700
That's the best scene
we've ever done.

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:32.530
So those are so heartbreaking
as a writer and so frustrating.

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:34.220
And you also lose
so much energy.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.011
And then sometimes,
you lose so much energy

00:41:36.011 --> 00:41:37.160
arguing for something.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:38.070
And you win.

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:39.410
And then you were wrong.

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:40.340
That happens too.

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:41.890
Then that scene is just dead.

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:45.004
So it's different
frustrations, I guess.

00:41:45.004 --> 00:41:46.170
You trade one for the other.

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:48.628
And I think that's probably
why I would like to always keep

00:41:48.628 --> 00:41:50.280
going back and forth.

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:50.780
Thanks.

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:51.163
TODD WOMACK: Right on.

00:41:51.163 --> 00:41:51.930
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:53.360
TODD WOMACK: Let's
take one more.

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:55.640
We might have to get into
autograph time after that.

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:56.660
AUDIENCE: BJ, thanks
for coming in.

00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:57.760
Big fan of all your work.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:58.593
BJ NOVAK: Thank you.

00:41:58.593 --> 00:42:01.300
AUDIENCE: I just had a quick
random question for you.

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:02.910
What is your favorite
Google product,

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:04.410
and what would you
improve about it?

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:04.993
BJ NOVAK: Wow.

00:42:06.799 --> 00:42:08.590
TODD WOMACK: So give
him a little list too,

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:11.162
just in case he doesn't
know them all like we do.

00:42:11.162 --> 00:42:14.360
You've got-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.800
BJ NOVAK: My favorite
Google product is Search.

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.410
Too obvious.

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:19.970
But also, my favorite "Simpsons"
character is Homer Simpson.

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:22.240
My favorite "Sopranos"
character was Tony Soprano.

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.240
My favorite "Office"
character is Michael Scott.

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:27.650
I think people underrate
the number one thing.

00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:29.965
So Google Search, it's the best.

00:42:29.965 --> 00:42:31.340
AUDIENCE: What
would you improve?

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:31.760
BJ NOVAK: What's that?

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.510
AUDIENCE: What would
you improve about it?

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:35.340
BJ NOVAK: About that?

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:37.800
I think you should probably
have better pictures of me

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.450
show up when you google my name.

00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:43.360
There are some that
aren't as good angles.

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:46.410
I'll tell you what
I wish you could do.

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:49.240
Google Earth, Google Maps,
these are incredible.

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:58.260
I want to be able to--
maybe sober, maybe not--

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:01.200
have on my screen
like its "Grand Theft

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:06.679
Auto" or something, point
of view of the environment.

00:43:06.679 --> 00:43:07.220
I don't know.

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:08.950
Maps, Earth, you
figure that part out.

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:13.390
And I'd like to be able to take
a road trip across the country

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:16.140
or through the
air, and just like,

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:20.030
let's go to fucking
Austin right now.

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.950
What would it be like?

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:22.320
What streets would we take?

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.590
Let's go at 400 miles an hour.

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:25.860
Let's fly.

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:30.820
Let's go to Uzbekistan.

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:34.530
Let's just kind of-- and
just sort of virtual reality

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:36.180
using your Maps and Earth.

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:38.369
I would do that all night.

00:43:38.369 --> 00:43:39.410
AUDIENCE: Thanks so much.

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:39.840
BJ NOVAK: Thank you.

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:40.550
TODD WOMACK: Get on that, bro.

00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:41.910
You gotta get on that.

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:44.910
I would feel remiss if we didn't
get a real quick chance at just

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:49.800
asking you about-- what was
it-- "Inglourious Basterds"

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.550
or "Saving Mr. Banks."

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:52.930
Maybe you pick which one.

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:55.760
Do you have any wicked
stories from either

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.980
that would blow us away?

00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:00.860
Working with Tarantino, or
Brad Pitt, or Tom Hanks,

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:01.530
or anything?

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:02.550
BJ NOVAK: Well, there's a moment
that it still gives me chills

00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:04.780
when I think about it.

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:07.052
There's several in
"Inglourious Basterds."

00:44:07.052 --> 00:44:09.510
"Pulp Fiction" was really what
made me want to be a writer.

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:10.740
I think a whole
generation was that way.

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:11.860
You see "Pulp Fiction,"
and you're like,

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:14.300
I have to get as close to
that as I can in my life.

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:16.570
There was a first
time, being a writer,

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:19.430
it felt sort of like
being a rockstar to me

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:22.490
when I saw this person, Quentin
Tarantino, had made this thing.

00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:24.070
And it was so fucking cool.

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:26.640
So there was a moment
I'll always remember.

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:30.220
There was a close up on me
in the veterinary scene.

00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:32.720
I don't think they used
it or most of that scene,

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:33.760
actually, in the end.

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:37.200
But I just remember
Quentin with,

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:41.840
like a viewfinder, just
lining it up on me.

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:42.740
Oh my god.

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:44.410
What a moment that was.

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:46.196
The big time.

00:44:46.196 --> 00:44:49.010
God.

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:51.327
So that was pretty
profound, I would say.

00:44:51.327 --> 00:44:52.410
TODD WOMACK: Yeah, acting.

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:55.550
You had a good scene
where you bound

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:57.010
with-- was that with Brad Pitt?

00:44:57.010 --> 00:44:58.410
BJ NOVAK: Yeah.

00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:00.285
TODD WOMACK: What's
he like to work with?

00:45:00.285 --> 00:45:02.660
Because he just seems like
the coolest guy ever, I guess.

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:05.055
BJ NOVAK: Yeah, no,
he's really cool.

00:45:05.055 --> 00:45:07.180
There was a scene, we both
had bags over our heads.

00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:08.800
And then they pulled them off.

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:09.514
And we shot that.

00:45:09.514 --> 00:45:11.930
And for some reason, you just
think weird things at times.

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:16.300
I was like, aw, Mindy
Kaling's gonna love this shot.

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:19.930
Like me and Brad Pitt
coming out of the bag.

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:20.510
I don't know.

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:22.490
Just like, this is
her kind of moment.

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:25.530
She just loves that like, fuck,
yeah, alpha movie star moment.

00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:26.385
TODD WOMACK: Yeah.

00:45:26.385 --> 00:45:28.234
It's just every day.

00:45:28.234 --> 00:45:30.470
Guys, please give a
round of applause for BJ

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:31.147
for coming down.

00:45:31.147 --> 00:45:31.980
BJ NOVAK: Thank you.

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.450
And to Todd, thank you.
