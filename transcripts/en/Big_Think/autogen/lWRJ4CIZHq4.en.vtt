00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.270
 
I like to think of innovation as as a

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:07.280
I like to think of innovation as as a
 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.850
I like to think of innovation as as a
process the process of transforming new

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860
process the process of transforming new
 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.549
process the process of transforming new
ideas into tangible societal impact and

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559
ideas into tangible societal impact and
 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.789
ideas into tangible societal impact and
so it that means that it's not enough to

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:15.799
so it that means that it's not enough to
 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:17.950
so it that means that it's not enough to
just have a new idea but it's really

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960
just have a new idea but it's really
 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.250
just have a new idea but it's really
important for that idea to make an

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260
important for that idea to make an
 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.859
important for that idea to make an
impact to scale to grow to touch many

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869
impact to scale to grow to touch many
 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.769
impact to scale to grow to touch many
people's lives certainly it can create

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779
people's lives certainly it can create
 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.189
people's lives certainly it can create
financial wealth but it also creates

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199
financial wealth but it also creates
 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.350
financial wealth but it also creates
social wealth social capital human

social wealth social capital human
capital and so it's really important to

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160
capital and so it's really important to
 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.430
capital and so it's really important to
look at it from that whole perspective

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440
look at it from that whole perspective
 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.810
look at it from that whole perspective
right now we're in a very challenging

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820
right now we're in a very challenging
 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.790
right now we're in a very challenging
situation obviously and everyone's

situation obviously and everyone's
 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.110
situation obviously and everyone's
wondering where the next jobs going to

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120

come from and absolutely new Joe hubs

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420
come from and absolutely new Joe hubs
 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.459
come from and absolutely new Joe hubs
are going to have to come from new

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469
are going to have to come from new
 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.020
are going to have to come from new
businesses and new products and those

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030
businesses and new products and those
 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.990
businesses and new products and those
come from from new ideas so if you do

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000
come from from new ideas so if you do
 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.209

universities have historically been a
 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.770
universities have historically been a
huge source of innovation for the

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780
huge source of innovation for the
 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.770
huge source of innovation for the
country and in fact there was a study

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780
country and in fact there was a study
 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.750
country and in fact there was a study
that was done recently a couple years

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760
that was done recently a couple years
 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.360
that was done recently a couple years
ago that looked at the rd 100 which is

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370
ago that looked at the rd 100 which is
 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.449
ago that looked at the rd 100 which is
the hundred most significant innovations

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459
the hundred most significant innovations
 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.390
the hundred most significant innovations
of the year as defined by our d magazine

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400
of the year as defined by our d magazine
 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.680
of the year as defined by our d magazine
and what was interesting they looked

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690
and what was interesting they looked
 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.430
and what was interesting they looked
over the last 30 or more years of

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440
over the last 30 or more years of
 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.050
over the last 30 or more years of
historically speaking and if you look at

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060
historically speaking and if you look at
 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.800
historically speaking and if you look at
about 30 years ago 20 25 30 years ago

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810
about 30 years ago 20 25 30 years ago
 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.800
about 30 years ago 20 25 30 years ago
about seventy percent of the most

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810
about seventy percent of the most
 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.009
about seventy percent of the most
significant innovations had found their

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019
significant innovations had found their
 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.030
significant innovations had found their

sector an industry had funded it
 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.839
sector an industry had funded it
exclusively and now it's completely

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849
exclusively and now it's completely
 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.740
exclusively and now it's completely
flipped so seventy percent our fund are

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750
flipped so seventy percent our fund are
 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.500
flipped so seventy percent our fund are

of something that people have been
 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.030
of something that people have been
saying for a little while now is that

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040
saying for a little while now is that

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.240
 
one thing that very passionate about and

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250
one thing that very passionate about and
 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.470
one thing that very passionate about and
I think is really important for people

I think is really important for people
 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.819
I think is really important for people
to understand every year in this country

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829
to understand every year in this country
 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.700
to understand every year in this country
we spend taxpayers a federal government

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710

spends 50 billion dollars a year on
university research and that's

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910
university research and that's
 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.909
university research and that's
absolutely critical because that's where

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919
absolutely critical because that's where
 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.610
absolutely critical because that's where
the the new ideas are going to be coming

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620
the the new ideas are going to be coming
 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.360
the the new ideas are going to be coming
from in the real breakthroughs however

you spend 50 billion dollars a year on

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930
you spend 50 billion dollars a year on
 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.900
you spend 50 billion dollars a year on
research but we spent almost nothing on

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910
research but we spent almost nothing on
 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.060
research but we spent almost nothing on
the programs and universities to get

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070
the programs and universities to get
 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.270
the programs and universities to get
those ideas out into the market despite

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280
those ideas out into the market despite
 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.870
those ideas out into the market despite
that we still there's a study by the

2008 they do a survey every year show

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080
2008 they do a survey every year show
 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.939
2008 they do a survey every year show
that there have been over 600 new

intellectual property and there's about

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889
intellectual property and there's about
 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:12.800

3,300 University spinouts that are in
 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.689
3,300 University spinouts that are in
business today and so it's it's despite

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699
business today and so it's it's despite
 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:19.189
business today and so it's it's despite
the fact that we're not investing in it

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199
the fact that we're not investing in it
 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.379
the fact that we're not investing in it
it is happening but it's not happening

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389
it is happening but it's not happening
 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.170
it is happening but it's not happening
at nearly the rate and I've seen it with

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180
at nearly the rate and I've seen it with
 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.750
at nearly the rate and I've seen it with
my own eyes that there are things that

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760
my own eyes that there are things that
 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.339
my own eyes that there are things that
are sitting on the shelves and sitting

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349
are sitting on the shelves and sitting
 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:29.839
are sitting on the shelves and sitting
in the labs that are not seeing the

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:29.849
in the labs that are not seeing the
 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:31.250
in the labs that are not seeing the
light of day and I believe that it's

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260
light of day and I believe that it's
 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.529
light of day and I believe that it's
really in large part because of that

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539
really in large part because of that
 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.350
really in large part because of that
there's a big gap between the university

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360
there's a big gap between the university
 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.999
there's a big gap between the university
in the market

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:40.009
 
 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:43.689
 
well first you know what what is what is

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699
well first you know what what is what is
 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:45.879
well first you know what what is what is
that gap and a lot of people talk about

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889
that gap and a lot of people talk about
 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:47.879
that gap and a lot of people talk about
something called the valley of death and

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:47.889
something called the valley of death and
 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.089
something called the valley of death and
it's primarily seen as a funding gap

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099
it's primarily seen as a funding gap
 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:54.129
it's primarily seen as a funding gap
there's some really interesting ideas in

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:54.139
there's some really interesting ideas in
 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:56.079
there's some really interesting ideas in
the lab but just there they're a little

00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:56.089
the lab but just there they're a little
 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:59.529
the lab but just there they're a little
bit too far removed from from the

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539
bit too far removed from from the
 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.230
bit too far removed from from the
private sector is willing to invest in

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240
private sector is willing to invest in
 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.850
private sector is willing to invest in
it so we need to do a proof of concept

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860
it so we need to do a proof of concept
 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.799
it so we need to do a proof of concept
to show that these ideas will actually

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:05.809
to show that these ideas will actually
 

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:09.339
to show that these ideas will actually
work for specific market needs to

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:09.349
work for specific market needs to
 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:12.119
work for specific market needs to
address to address specific market needs

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:12.129
address to address specific market needs
 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:16.299
address to address specific market needs
and so that's that's one need and the

00:06:16.299 --> 00:06:16.309
and so that's that's one need and the
 

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:18.700
and so that's that's one need and the
angel investors venture capitalists are

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710
angel investors venture capitalists are
 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.230
angel investors venture capitalists are
not filling that gap and I'm not sure

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240
not filling that gap and I'm not sure
 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.879
not filling that gap and I'm not sure
that it really isn't appropriate for

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:21.889
that it really isn't appropriate for
 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:23.290
that it really isn't appropriate for
them to be filling that gap because

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300
them to be filling that gap because
 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.879
them to be filling that gap because
these are not ready first to be a

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:24.889
these are not ready first to be a
 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:27.909
these are not ready first to be a
start-up or a of our product yet but

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919
start-up or a of our product yet but
 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:30.040
start-up or a of our product yet but
it's also a cultural gap so in the

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050
it's also a cultural gap so in the
 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.159
it's also a cultural gap so in the
university the other motivations are how

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:33.169
university the other motivations are how
 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:36.299
university the other motivations are how
do I support my students and how do i

00:06:36.299 --> 00:06:36.309
do I support my students and how do i
 

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:38.949
do I support my students and how do i
how do I get the next research grant how

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:38.959
how do I get the next research grant how
 

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:41.589
how do I get the next research grant how
do I raise my reputation as the expert

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599
do I raise my reputation as the expert
 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:44.469
do I raise my reputation as the expert
in this field whereas in the private

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479
in this field whereas in the private
 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:46.540
in this field whereas in the private
secretary of course it's about revenues

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550
secretary of course it's about revenues
 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.749
secretary of course it's about revenues
profits and and so and those are

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759
profits and and so and those are
 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:52.449
profits and and so and those are
completely appropriate motivations for

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:52.459
completely appropriate motivations for
 

00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:54.909
completely appropriate motivations for
the two groups and so another way i like

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:54.919
the two groups and so another way i like
 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:56.320
the two groups and so another way i like
to think about it is in academia

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:56.330
to think about it is in academia
 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.019
to think about it is in academia
surprises are good but in industry not

00:06:59.019 --> 00:06:59.029
surprises are good but in industry not
 

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:01.480
surprises are good but in industry not
so much so it's definitely a big

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.490
so much so it's definitely a big
 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.059
so much so it's definitely a big
cultural gap and then what we're what

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:04.069
cultural gap and then what we're what
 

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:05.439
cultural gap and then what we're what
what we don't want to do is we don't

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:05.449
what we don't want to do is we don't
 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:07.570
what we don't want to do is we don't
want to try to turn academics into

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:07.580
want to try to turn academics into
 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.670
want to try to turn academics into
business people and we certainly are not

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680
business people and we certainly are not
 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.929
business people and we certainly are not
going to get business people to try to

00:07:10.929 --> 00:07:10.939
going to get business people to try to
 

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:12.639
going to get business people to try to
become academics but what we need to do

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:12.649
become academics but what we need to do
 

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:16.389
become academics but what we need to do
is to help connect them and help connect

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:16.399
is to help connect them and help connect
 

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:19.209
is to help connect them and help connect
the two cultures and enable them to

00:07:19.209 --> 00:07:19.219
the two cultures and enable them to
 

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:22.869
the two cultures and enable them to
learn about each other and and what

00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:22.879
learn about each other and and what
 

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:24.249
learn about each other and and what
motivates thumps that they can speak

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:24.259
motivates thumps that they can speak
 

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:28.839
motivates thumps that they can speak
each other's language and so it's it's

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:28.849
each other's language and so it's it's
 

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:30.399
each other's language and so it's it's
really about the bridging and about

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:30.409
really about the bridging and about
 

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:34.890
really about the bridging and about
about teaching

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:34.900
 
 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.890
 
so we've had some you know across the

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:37.900
so we've had some you know across the
 

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.560
so we've had some you know across the
country have been some success successes

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:40.570
country have been some success successes
 

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.529
country have been some success successes
with innovation centers and proof of

with innovation centers and proof of
 

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:48.060
with innovation centers and proof of
concept funds and a greater focus on

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:48.070
concept funds and a greater focus on

transfer and entrepreneurship education
 

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.670
transfer and entrepreneurship education
and so I have a proposal that I wrote

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680
and so I have a proposal that I wrote
 

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.120
and so I have a proposal that I wrote
with a support of many others that is

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.130
with a support of many others that is
 

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.490
with a support of many others that is
called the impact proposal was at the

00:07:59.490 --> 00:07:59.500
called the impact proposal was at the
 

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.350
called the impact proposal was at the
urging of the White House Office of

Science and Technology Policy they said

00:08:02.999 --> 00:08:03.009
Science and Technology Policy they said
 

00:08:03.009 --> 00:08:06.120
Science and Technology Policy they said
how can we help bridge this gap and the

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:06.130
how can we help bridge this gap and the
 

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.969
how can we help bridge this gap and the
idea behind it is a to start with a

spin out of universities stay local
within the state of the university so it

00:10:41.019 --> 00:10:41.029
within the state of the university so it
 

00:10:41.029 --> 00:10:45.030
within the state of the university so it
has a huge economic impact and it also

are within the university in a
programmatic fashion it's a very group

00:11:01.389 --> 00:11:01.399
programmatic fashion it's a very group
 

00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:03.519

effective way of getting alumni involved
 

00:11:06.139 --> 00:11:08.189
effective way of getting alumni involved
and getting the local business community

00:11:08.189 --> 00:11:08.199
and getting the local business community
 

00:11:08.199 --> 00:11:10.750
and getting the local business community
involved within the university and come

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:10.760
involved within the university and come
 

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.569
involved within the university and come
together and then meet each other so its

00:11:13.569 --> 00:11:13.579
together and then meet each other so its

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.519
 
many people have asked me whether is

this just appropriate for elite

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:24.990
this just appropriate for elite
 

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.840
this just appropriate for elite
universities and and I think that's

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:26.850
universities and and I think that's
 

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.870
universities and and I think that's
absolutely not not the case because any

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880
absolutely not not the case because any
 

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.949
absolutely not not the case because any
any university either that does research

00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:32.959
any university either that does research
 

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:37.130

or has students that are have some sort

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.970
for any university to participate in
this sort of activity the reality is

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:22.980
this sort of activity the reality is
 

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.590
this sort of activity the reality is
there's been studies that show that the

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.600
there's been studies that show that the
 

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.880
there's been studies that show that the
more basic and the more groundbreaking

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:28.890
more basic and the more groundbreaking
 

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:33.110
more basic and the more groundbreaking
the research the more effective

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120
the research the more effective
 

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.510
the research the more effective
transferring innovation there is from

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:35.520
transferring innovation there is from
 

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.130
transferring innovation there is from
the University so I would encourage

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:37.140
the University so I would encourage
 

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:41.210
the University so I would encourage
those universities to not give up the

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:41.220
those universities to not give up the
 

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.889
those universities to not give up the
roots of doing some really basic

00:12:42.889 --> 00:12:42.899
roots of doing some really basic
 

00:12:42.899 --> 00:12:44.360
roots of doing some really basic
research because I think there's a bit

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:44.370
research because I think there's a bit
 

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:46.639
research because I think there's a bit
of a temptation to say oh well we only

00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:46.649
of a temptation to say oh well we only
 

00:12:46.649 --> 00:12:49.010
of a temptation to say oh well we only
have a small research base let's try to

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:49.020
have a small research base let's try to
 

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.199
have a small research base let's try to
move as much of it into applied research

00:12:51.199 --> 00:12:51.209
move as much of it into applied research
 

00:12:51.209 --> 00:12:53.030
move as much of it into applied research
as possible and I think that that's

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040
as possible and I think that that's
 

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.800
as possible and I think that that's
absolutely not would not be the right

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:54.810
absolutely not would not be the right
 

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:56.840
absolutely not would not be the right
approach if you're really trying to make

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:56.850
approach if you're really trying to make
 

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:00.620
approach if you're really trying to make
some groundbreaking innovations
