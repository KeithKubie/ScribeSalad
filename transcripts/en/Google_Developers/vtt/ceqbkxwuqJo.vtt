[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.225
Hi, my name is Ed Rex,
and I founded Jukedeck.

00:00:08.225 --> 00:00:09.720
At Jukedeck, we've
built software

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.281
that writes original music
at the touch of a button.

00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:13.780
What that means is,
you can use this

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.707
to create unique
music for your videos.

00:00:15.707 --> 00:00:17.540
And if you want to hear
what it sounds like,

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.304
it's actually providing the
music for this video right now.

00:00:21.304 --> 00:00:23.220
We've raised a couple
of rounds of investment.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.803
And I'd just like to share with
you a few tips we've picked up

00:00:25.803 --> 00:00:27.962
along the way on
how to raise money.

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:29.420
So I think there
are four questions

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.830
you need to ask yourself
when you're raising money--

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.540
when to raise; who to raise
from; how to approach them;

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.360
and what they want to see.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.547
So the first question to
ask is when to raise money.

00:00:39.547 --> 00:00:41.630
And I think it's different
if you're at seed stage

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.110
or if you're a bit
later in your journey.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.660
At seed stage, you
don't even want

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.440
to think about raising
money until you've

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.350
proved your idea has legs.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.880
And that's for two reasons.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.900
Firstly, investors
just aren't going

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.550
to listen to you until you do.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.470
And secondly, and more
importantly, you're

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.640
wasting your own time
if you're raising money

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.180
for something you
don't know works.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.400
So for us, what
that meant was we

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.250
spent quite a lot of
time building software

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.051
before we actually went to
investors in the first place.

00:01:09.051 --> 00:01:11.550
By the time we went to them,
we had a prototype that worked.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.466
And we had something
really good to show them.

00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:15.936
And that really
helped us raise money.

00:01:15.936 --> 00:01:17.310
So it's a bit
different if you're

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.600
raising money at a later stage.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.320
What we've found
is that you really

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.257
need to start raising
money before you need it.

00:01:24.257 --> 00:01:25.840
Because if you wait
until you need it,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.940
you're not going
to get a good deal.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.330
You're going to be desperate
when you go and speak

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.210
to investors, and that's not
a good position to be in.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.220
The other thing we found is that
you really have to start early.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.310
It takes a surprising amount
of time to raise investment.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.270
It took us six to nine months.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.940
And you really need
to plan in advance

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.245
and start work on it in
advance, because otherwise,

00:01:43.245 --> 00:01:45.590
if you start three months
before you run out of money,

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.010
you're going to be
in lot of trouble.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.890
The next question to ask is who
you should raise money from.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.920
You might be tempted to
spread a lot of paint,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.214
to get in touch with as
many people as you can.

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:56.630
But actually, what
you really need

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.410
is investors who are interested
in what you're doing.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.820
If you're a music
company like us

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.320
and you go to someone who
only invests in social media,

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.136
you're wasting everyone's time.

00:02:05.136 --> 00:02:07.760
Now, we actually got very lucky
in that one of the first people

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.880
we talked to, a
lovely guy named Mike,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.550
had worked on
generative music-- which

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.670
is what we're doing-- before.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.820
So he knew how hard
what we're doing is.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.780
And he gave our stuff
a listen and said,

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.340
you're doing it
quite well, actually.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.945
So maybe we'll invest.

00:02:20.945 --> 00:02:23.194
But you don't want them
to be too interested.

00:02:23.194 --> 00:02:25.610
If you go to an investor who's
invested in something a bit

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.320
like you before,
they either are going

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.330
to be put off because
that thing didn't work,

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.300
or that thing will
still be going,

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.346
and you'll essentially
be its competition.

00:02:34.346 --> 00:02:35.720
If you go to that
kind of person,

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.110
again, you're wasting time.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.530
So you need to find the balance.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.863
You need to find someone who's
interested in what you're

00:02:41.863 --> 00:02:44.090
doing, but not so
interested that they've

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.080
been through it before.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.020
So once you figure
out who to approach,

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.410
you need to think about
how to approach them.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.520
Now, I got this very wrong
the first time around.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.660
I sent out a lot of
emails to a lot of people.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.430
And not many of
them got back to me,

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.990
presumably because--
I hope-- they

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.531
have much more
important things to do

00:03:01.531 --> 00:03:03.280
than replying to
every email they get.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.980
Instead, what I found
is the best way to get

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.240
these people's attention is
to cultivate relationships

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.910
with them.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.420
You know, if these
people are going

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.870
to be investing money
in your startup,

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.510
they really want to know you.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.850
They are going to want to
invest in people they know,

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.251
in people they've talked to
a lot, in people they like.

00:03:20.251 --> 00:03:21.750
And what it comes
down to ultimately

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.750
is, it's all about
personal relationships.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.974
You need to go to as
many events as you can.

00:03:25.974 --> 00:03:27.890
You need to talk to as
many people as you can.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.190
You need to put yourself
out there, so that you meet,

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.900
eventually, the right people.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.700
The first people you
meet won't necessarily

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.030
be the people who invest.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.820
But ultimately, if you
get out there enough,

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.420
you'll find the people
who are right for you.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.970
Now, forging personal
relationships

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.960
can be tricky,
especially for the kind

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.180
of people who run startups.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.700
I think one thing that really
helps is personal intros.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.160
If you get someone you know
to intro you to an investor,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.060
they're always going to listen
much more than if you just

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.410
go up to them and chat
to them at a conference.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.840
Any sort of intro you
can get from anyone

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.972
who knows them is a really,
really valuable thing.

00:04:03.972 --> 00:04:05.930
It's sort of annoying
that you have to do this.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.080
You want your idea to be
judged purely on its merits.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.290
But ultimately, that's not
the way the world works.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.904
And you have to get
people to vouch for you.

00:04:14.904 --> 00:04:16.279
And the fourth
and final question

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.170
to ask yourself is what
an investor is going

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.500
to want to see when you
do go and chat to them.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.630
There are a couple of
things to think about here.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.034
The first is quite an obvious
point, which is traction.

00:04:26.034 --> 00:04:27.450
Investors are
really going to want

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.554
to see that people
using your product.

00:04:30.554 --> 00:04:31.970
Investors are going
to want to see

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.370
that your product is being used.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.642
Otherwise, they're not
going to invest in it.

00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:37.100
But what's interesting,
I've found,

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.840
is that traction
doesn't mean you

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.420
have to have thousands, millions
of people using your product.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.050
A great definition
of traction that I

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.470
got from a good friend
who worked at Index

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.980
is that traction is
irrational usage.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.080
Even if you only have five
people using your product,

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.860
if you can show that they're
coming back to it all the time

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.930
and they absolutely
love it, you've

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.030
got something really
exciting on your hands.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.170
An investor doesn't need
to see huge, huge metrics.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.220
They just need to see
retention, because then you

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.170
can go back to them
and say, you see this.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.060
We've made it work.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.160
Now we need to scale it.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.217
That's why we need your money.

00:05:12.217 --> 00:05:13.800
The other thing we
found really useful

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.330
is taking a prototype
to investors.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.217
If you turn up and all
you have is an idea,

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:19.800
it can be really
hard to convince them

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.626
of the benefits of
what you're doing.

00:05:21.626 --> 00:05:23.250
But if you have
something to show them,

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.875
if you can put
something in their hands

00:05:24.875 --> 00:05:27.720
that they can play with,
that's a really powerful way

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.040
of demonstrating exactly
what you're doing.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.542
And you're much more likely to
really grab their attention.

00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:35.500
So I remember, in our
first investment meeting,

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.805
we took along our prototype.

00:05:36.805 --> 00:05:38.180
And the real moment
of excitement

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.940
came when we had it
up on the big screen.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.710
We pressed go, and it wrote
an original piece of music

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:43.671
right there.

00:05:43.671 --> 00:05:45.420
That was the moment
in which are investors

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.074
said, OK, maybe
there's something here.

00:05:48.074 --> 00:05:50.740
So there you go-- four questions
I think you should ask yourself

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.490
when you're trying
to raise investment.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.550
When should you raise?

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.850
Who should you raise it from?

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.190
How should you approach them?

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.380
And what do they want to see?
