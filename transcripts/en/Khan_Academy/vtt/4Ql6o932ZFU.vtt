00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.450
Let's order these
improper fractions

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.970
and mixed numbers from
least to greatest.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.220
And there's two ways to do it.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.490
You could put them
all as mixed numbers,

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.790
or you could put them all
as improper fractions.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.185
I will write them all-- let's
try it as mixed numbers first

00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:15.060
and see what happens.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.820
And then we could also
try improper fractions.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.730
So if we write them
all as mixed numbers,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.570
this expression right
here, this number.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.310
3 goes into 7 two times,
and the remainder is 1.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.610
So it's 2 and 1/3.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.159
Then we have our
4 and 1/2, which

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.340
is already a mixed number.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.240
Then this one over here--
3 goes into 4 one time

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.750
with a remainder of 1,
so this is 1 and 1/3.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.630
And then you have
1 and 2/5, which

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.550
is already written
as a mixed number.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.960
And then finally, we
have this quantity.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.980
15 goes into 17 one time
with a remainder of 2.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.534
So this is 1 and 2/15.

00:00:57.534 --> 00:00:59.450
So we already know the
largest number is, just

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.825
looking at the whole number
parts of these mixed numbers.

00:01:01.825 --> 00:01:05.209
It's 4 and 1/2, so let
me write it out here.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.750
The second largest
number is the 2 and 1/3.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.647
And now the whole number part
of all of these last three--

00:01:13.647 --> 00:01:15.146
they're all the
same, so we now have

00:01:15.146 --> 00:01:16.440
to look at the fractional part.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.540
And they all have
different denominators.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.150
So to simplify things, or so
that we can compare apples

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.690
to apples, let's all give
these the same denominator.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.370
And the best common
denominator will

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.830
be the least common multiple
of 3, 5, and 15, which is 15.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.230
So we can rewrite it.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.430
So this is going to be
1 and something over 15.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.180
To go from 3 to 15, you have to
multiply the denominator by 5.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.200
So let's also multiply
the numerator by 5.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.900
So this is 1 and 5/15.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.780
Let's do this one.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.520
This is 1 and something over 15.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.230
We multiply the
denominator by 3,

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.490
so we also have to multiply
the numerator by 3.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.630
So let's put a 6 there.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.420
2 times 3 is 6.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.070
And then finally,
this one already

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.180
has 15 as the denominator.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.190
This is 1 and 2/15.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.720
So now this is
easier to compare.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.370
They all have 15
as the denominator

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.410
in the fractional part
of the mixed number.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.313
The smallest of
these is 2/15, so I'm

00:02:09.313 --> 00:02:10.479
going to write it out front.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.500
That's the smallest.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.656
Then the next smallest
is 1 and 5/15,

00:02:16.656 --> 00:02:18.530
which is this quantity
right over here, which

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.140
is-- I could write
it as 1 and 1/3.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.820
And then the next smallest,
or I guess the larger one

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.320
after that, is the
1 and 6/15, which

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.220
is the same thing as 1 and 2/5.

00:02:34.015 --> 00:02:34.640
And we're done.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.264
And we can then
rewrite them in the way

00:02:36.264 --> 00:02:37.940
that they were
originally written.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.000
So this one right
over here in pink

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.680
was originally written as 17/15,
so I'll write it as 17/15.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.470
This 1 and 1/3 was
originally written as 4/3.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.590
So I can write it as 4/3.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.710
The 1 and 2/5 was already
written as 1 and 2/5.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.420
And then the 2 and 1/3
was written as 7/3.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.560
And the 4 and 1/2 was
already 4 and 1/2.

00:03:04.081 --> 00:03:06.330
Now, the other way to do it
is to convert all of these

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.455
into improper fractions.

00:03:08.455 --> 00:03:12.040
If we do it that way,
the 7/3 is still a 7/3.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.600
4 and 1/2-- to turn that into
an improper fraction, 2 times 4

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.480
is-- well, one way
to think about it--

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.790
4 is the same thing as 8/2.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.390
8/2 plus 1/2 is 9/2.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.600
Or a simple way, 2 times
4 is 8, plus 1 is 9.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.210
9/2.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.370
And then 4/3 is already written
as an improper fraction.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.660
1 and 2/5?

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.220
Well, 1 is the
same thing as 5/5.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.820
And 5/5 plus 2/5 is 7/5.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.940
Or you could say 5
times 1 plus 2 is 7.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.496
And then finally,
we have the 17/15.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.150
Now, in order to really
compare apples to apples,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.180
we have to have a
common denominator here.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.840
And the least common multiple
of 3, 2, 3, 5 and 15--

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.170
it looks like, if we just
had 3, 5's, and 15's here,

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.330
it would be 15.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.364
But that's not
divisible by 2, so we're

00:04:05.364 --> 00:04:06.530
going to have to go with 30.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.290
So we're going to have 30 as
the common denominator for all

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.330
of these.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.930
So 7/3-- to get the
denominator from 3 to 30,

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.079
we multiplied by 10.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.790
So we multiply the
numerator by 10.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.690
So we have 70/30.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.856
Then we have 9/2,
but now we're going

00:04:23.856 --> 00:04:25.450
to make the denominator 30.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.680
To go from 2 to 30, we had to
multiply the denominator by 15.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.410
So we're going to have to
multiply the numerator by 15.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.490
So 9 times 15 is 90, plus 45.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.100
So that's 135.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.380
Now we have 4/3.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.050
We're going to rewrite
the denominator as 30.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.050
We're multiplying the
denominator by 10,

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.320
so we want to multiply
the numerator by 10.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.100
So it's 40/30.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.720
And then 7/5, we're going to
write with a denominator of 30.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.760
We're multiplying
the denominator by 6,

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.710
so we have to multiply
the numerator by 6.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.370
7 times 6 is 42.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.660
And then finally, 17/15.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.310
If the denominator's 30, we're
multiplying the denominator

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.310
by 2.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.435
So we also have to multiply
the numerator by 2.

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:12.660
17 times 2 is 34.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.214
And now we can compare
apples to apples.

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:16.630
All the denominators
are the same,

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.213
so we can just compare
the numerators.

00:05:18.213 --> 00:05:23.950
The smallest numerator here is
34, so 34/30 is the smallest.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.850
Then the next smallest--
it looks like 40/30.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.385
And then the next
smallest is 42/30.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.920
And then the next
smallest is 70/30.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.643
And then the next smallest or
the largest, now, is 135/30.

00:05:53.394 --> 00:05:55.810
And you convert these back
down to what they're originally

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:56.680
represented at.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.594
You get this exact
same ordering.
