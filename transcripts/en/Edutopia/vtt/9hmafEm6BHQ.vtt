00:00:00.786 --> 00:00:03.366
&gt;&gt;Is there anybody who might be
squeamish about touching fish?

00:00:04.606 --> 00:00:07.706
&gt;&gt;My name is Michelle Underwood,
I'm a seventh grade teacher

00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:08.766
at North Whitfield Middle School,

00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.276
and I've been teaching
for about 11 years.

00:00:11.276 --> 00:00:12.476
&gt;&gt;Student: This one is huge, dude.

00:00:12.476 --> 00:00:16.236
&gt;&gt;Michelle: When I started teaching,
I really had a zeal for teaching.

00:00:16.236 --> 00:00:18.126
I would come up with creative ideas.

00:00:18.126 --> 00:00:19.306
They were kind of snuffed out.

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:20.506
&gt;&gt;Anybody want gloves?

00:00:20.506 --> 00:00:23.516
&gt;&gt;As time passed, I conformed,

00:00:23.826 --> 00:00:25.946
and did what I was supposed
to, like a good teacher.

00:00:25.946 --> 00:00:30.756
I used my textbook, I incorporated
PowerPoint, but it was really death

00:00:30.836 --> 00:00:32.326
by PowerPoint for my students.

00:00:32.806 --> 00:00:35.016
When I moved here to North
Whitfield, things changed.

00:00:35.016 --> 00:00:39.556
&gt;&gt;You need to wash him off
because he's too slimy right now.

00:00:39.616 --> 00:00:43.286
&gt;&gt;The first day I walked into North
Whitfield, I was in my suit and heels

00:00:43.286 --> 00:00:46.926
and pantyhose, and I looked
around, and I was the only one

00:00:46.956 --> 00:00:48.976
in suit and heels and pantyhose.

00:00:48.976 --> 00:00:51.356
As one of the other teachers said,
I had to go get some britches.

00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:56.526
&gt;&gt;You have a dichotomous key in
front of you, and without shouting

00:00:56.526 --> 00:00:57.966
out the answer, I want you

00:00:58.056 --> 00:01:00.906
to identify the species
of fish that you have.

00:01:00.906 --> 00:01:02.436
&gt;&gt;Andrea: She's very,
very intelligent.

00:01:02.436 --> 00:01:08.646
She had her presentations down,
and was extremely structured.

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:11.356
She would stand up in the front,

00:01:11.356 --> 00:01:15.336
and expect to give these
elaborate lectures,

00:01:15.736 --> 00:01:18.536
and have these adolescents
write down everything she said.

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:21.366
And I was very honest with her
about, if things don't change,

00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:24.036
it's not probably going
to work out for you here.

00:01:24.456 --> 00:01:28.376
&gt;&gt;Michelle: I went to one of
the education advisors, I guess,

00:01:28.706 --> 00:01:33.466
for the school, and just,
honestly, I broke down in tears,

00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:35.056
and said, what can I do different?

00:01:35.286 --> 00:01:36.576
&gt;&gt;Andrea: She started a book study,

00:01:36.576 --> 00:01:38.266
started having collegial
conversations,

00:01:39.046 --> 00:01:43.216
and it ended up like a transformation
that I've never seen before.

00:01:43.496 --> 00:01:47.656
&gt;&gt;Michelle: We talked about
going into cell organs.

00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:49.976
&gt;&gt;Instead of just death
by PowerPoint,

00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:52.726
I started incorporating
things like cell phones

00:01:52.726 --> 00:01:55.026
and cameras, and video recording.

00:01:55.086 --> 00:01:59.596
I'm on the floor, I'm painting,
I've got animals in my room.

00:01:59.596 --> 00:02:02.436
My relationship with my students
now is completely different.

00:02:02.656 --> 00:02:05.726
Although there's a lot more work
that's put into the actual design

00:02:05.726 --> 00:02:08.306
of the lesson, when you
get into your classroom,

00:02:08.306 --> 00:02:10.646
and you're in with your
students, you're playing

00:02:10.646 --> 00:02:12.376
with your students,
you're having fun.

00:02:12.376 --> 00:02:14.176
You're enjoying what you're doing.

00:02:14.786 --> 00:02:16.706
&gt;&gt;You're actually seeing
the text upside down.

00:02:16.856 --> 00:02:20.396
&gt;&gt;Dennis: In my past, we've
done a lot of textbook work.

00:02:20.396 --> 00:02:22.266
I think I like this a lot better.

00:02:22.946 --> 00:02:26.106
&gt;&gt;Michelle: I think, when you
see the light in your students,

00:02:26.176 --> 00:02:29.216
and they're smiling and they're
having a good time in your class,

00:02:29.216 --> 00:02:34.966
and they're learning the standards, I
think that any teacher who sees that

00:02:34.966 --> 00:02:37.916
and experiences that,
would change their opinion

00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:41.236
of project based learning
versus PowerPoint and textbooks.

00:02:42.366 --> 00:02:43.916
&gt;&gt;Student: That's our best one.
