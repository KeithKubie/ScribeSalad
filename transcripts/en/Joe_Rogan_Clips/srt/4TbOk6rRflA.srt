1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,340
The Joe Rogan experience
and a few other things.

2
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:09,780
I actually got, um, I got like
hypnotized to before. Yeah, dude,

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,730
who did too. Um, and my
friend Dominique, um, he has,

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,210
he has this, like I met
him through one of the, um,

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,410
one of the other UFC fighters.
Like Julia Marquez. I met him,

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,670
I met him through him and he's like, oh
yeah, I do like hypnotism, all this stuff.

7
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:30,840
I'm like, okay cool. I've done it
before. I did it in California and um,

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,170
so I think three weeks,
two or three weeks prior to the fight,

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,460
we had a few sessions a week where it
just like helped me to really get that

10
00:00:38,461 --> 00:00:41,220
visualization clear cause we have so
many thoughts all the time. Right.

11
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:41,761
And everything,

12
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:46,110
just like thoughts are constantly coming
in and to stay focused and to really

13
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:46,944
like,

14
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,423
like

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,390
get the outcome that we, you know, set
our intention to. It's kind of hard.

16
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,990
So many distractions.
So when you go into his office and,

17
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,420
or wherever you do it and
you guys talk about it,

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,360
do you set a goal before
you start the session?

19
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,760
We do this thing called timeline therapy.

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,080
So it's like I'm just kinda sitting
there with my eyes closed and, um,

21
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,060
we kind of just do this.
We'll pick a subject, whether
it's like, you know, pain,

22
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:17,700
fear, you know, nervousness, something.

23
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,390
I'll just pick a subject of feeling
whatever's going on. And um,

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,260
it's kind of just like a visual
timeline of like, where did this start,

25
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:27,030
where did it come from,
what's the event, whatever.

26
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,650
And we kind of just talk about
that for awhile. And, um, I just,

27
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,110
yeah,

28
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:37,010
Kinda dig to this place of where the
nervousness is coming from or where the,

29
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,340
you know, where the fear is coming
from or whatever. I kinda just,

30
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,400
I find a place on my
timeline and I dig from it,

31
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,990
whether it's in the future or
the past, whatever. And um,

32
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,290
then we get things clear. And then, um,

33
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:55,760
and then after that he kind of helps
me, guides me into this, like hypnotism,

34
00:01:55,761 --> 00:01:58,670
which is really just like a really,
really deep relaxation.

35
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,360
If I wanted to open my eyes or something
like that, I feel like I could,

36
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,200
but I wanted to relax. I
wanted this to help, you know,

37
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:09,760
I wanted my vision to be clear.
So I did my best to just like surrenders,

38
00:02:09,761 --> 00:02:14,000
hit the process and I'd say it's not
something where I woke up and I was like,

39
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,000
oh yeah, my life has changed. But um,

40
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:21,320
I can definitely remember the thoughts
that I had so that I can stay more on

41
00:02:21,321 --> 00:02:26,210
like in that,
in that lane of what I wanted and in my,

42
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:31,330
in my hypnotism actually visualized not
winning the fight because I didn't want

43
00:02:32,571 --> 00:02:34,040
to strive too hard to win.

44
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,800
Like it's just something that
I've been kind of studying.

45
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:41,801
It's like the outcome is not
really like the winning or losing.

46
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:43,310
I don't want to base too much on that.

47
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,350
I just want to put on
like a great performance.

48
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,340
So I visualized after one thing hand,

49
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,450
like just having my hands in the air,
seeing my brother's smile, my coach,

50
00:02:53,451 --> 00:02:57,890
his smile and then slapping hands
with the crowd, um, on the way out.

51
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,940
And then I was also like,

52
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,190
and I want to see my wind bonus and my
show money and these are the things that

53
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:05,620
I wanted to see.
These are the outcomes that I wanted.

54
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,470
Not so much just I want to win the fight,
but the things that I like,

55
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:13,420
how I wanted it to happen. Yeah.
And having that vision clear,

56
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,260
it helped me.

57
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,120
And so like everything that
I've visualized before that
it happened, I was like,

58
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:22,630
cool hands, raise, slap hands with
everybody on the crowd the way out,

59
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,390
sign both my checks.
And that was like,

60
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,720
that was the end of it for me until the
next session until I want to get clear

61
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:31,630
on something else, you
know? It was cool. Wow.

62
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,210
So had you done anything like that before?

63
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:37,840
Any mental coaching before they go
come toxify I did something very,

64
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:40,870
very similar. Yeah. With
um, with another guy.

65
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:45,640
I was out the first time you'd ever done
it. First Time doing hypnotism. Yeah,

66
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,810
definitely. And um, yeah, my
friend Matthias, he's here and uh,

67
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,710
he's really good too. And he
was just like, take some notes.

68
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:57,190
You kind of just have a conversation in
the beginning and everything comes from

69
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:00,190
your own conscious mind.
It's not somebody telling you something.

70
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,550
I just dumped out whatever my own
conscious mind was telling me.

71
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,080
He was just helping me to like relax and
be at peace and just listened to like

72
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:08,920
my own conscious mind.

73
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:13,921
Just unfold all of these kind of
like hidden answers that we all have,

74
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,690
you know?
So that's it.

75
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,700
Now when you get hip and ties and
you're thinking about a specific fight,

76
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,270
do you think about specific things
you're trying to accomplish?

77
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,960
Things that you think you'll do to him
that you'll have an advantage at or

78
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:31,240
strategy or like how do you will,

79
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,270
those were thoughts that were
happening before my hypnotism,

80
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,300
but then all of those thoughts were
coming from the anxiety or coming from the

81
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:46,840
nervousness. You get what
I'm saying? So it's like,

82
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,940
let's go back on the timeline to
why you're feeling nervous. Yeah.

83
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,120
Like all these things are happening.
They're going to you,

84
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,410
you're anticipating all these
things happening and it's
making you feel nervous.

85
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:59,950
So let's go back to the nervousness
and revisit that. Why, you know,

86
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,120
and then like my subconscious,
my unconscious mind, just
like spewing things out.

87
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:09,630
And then after the process of
that mixed with the hypnotism,

88
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,950
I'm not even thinking about, oh, I'm
going to hit this arm drag or whatever.

89
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,580
I just,

90
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,560
I'm thinking about having my conscious
clear in my mind clear and everything so

91
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:24,160
that I can get the expectation that like,

92
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,970
or the the visualization that I created.
Yeah.

93
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,570
So have you tried different versions
of that or different styles of,

94
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:37,030
of hypnosis? Mm, no.

95
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,350
Not that I can, I mean I've done
a lot of just like close die,

96
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,120
like emotional intelligence type
of like exercises, you know?

97
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,870
Like where I'm just like my eyes are
closed and I have someone helping me

98
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,020
visualize internally,
you know,

99
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:58,050
like just whether it's dreams or
emotional pain or whatever it may be.

100
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:01,670
Yeah. People just like guided
meditation almost. Yeah.

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,290
But the actual name, like hypnotism,
I've only had it done by two people.

102
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,910
Well it as when you're watching fighters,
if you are,

103
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:15,911
I think fighters are one
of the most complex puzzles
for psychologists because I

104
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:19,340
think it's a super rare state.

105
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,650
Like the rare state that someone gets to
the weather, it can be completely calm.

106
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,160
See everything in the heat of a dangerous
encounter with another train fighter.

107
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:33,580
And when you're watching these things
play out on TV and you often times see how

108
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:36,860
much anxiety plays a factor
or doesn't play a factor,

109
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:38,540
how much someone having the,

110
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,900
I don't give a fuck attitude
for real at Ken play.

111
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,080
It can be a benefit and it
can fuck you up sometimes too.

112
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,290
And to see these complex psychological
puzzles will play out and see fighters

113
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:54,320
struggle and then regroup,
have a bad fight and come back better.

114
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,500
All that stuff is like,
it's,

115
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,490
it's really like a giant microscope
on the human character and you know,

116
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:04,880
and I like a guy like you who comes back
from the Johnnie Walker fight and looks

117
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,570
sensational against Eric
Andrews. Man. It was like,

118
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,870
that was one of those things you're like,
I like what I'm seeing his guy,

119
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:16,490
he figured some shit out man. We like
that was, that was, that was incredible.

120
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:20,930
It was really fun to watch, man. This guy
really loves Moitai. It was fun to watch.

121
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,050
Thanks man. That was, and that's,

122
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,090
that's kind of the goal too going forward
is that I want to continue to like put

123
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:26,871
on stuff like that,

124
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:30,350
continue to learn Moitai and then cause
that like kind of raised the bar, right?

125
00:07:30,351 --> 00:07:33,890
People are like, Oh man, this guy for
sure. Kind of put me back on the map.

126
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:36,440
So now I'm ready to just go back.
And you know,

127
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,350
how many guys use mental coaches now?
If you had to guess?

128
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,540
A good handful. Good handful.
Yeah, a good handful I think.

129
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:47,890
I think a lot of vitamin Vinny
shoreman he hypnotized me and he uh,

130
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,370
he has a lot of fighters.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was a
trip. It was a very strange,

131
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,020
it's like, oh, this is real. It's a weird
feeling. Right. How long ago was it?

132
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,830
It was the old studio, so it had
to be at least a year and a half,

133
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,770
maybe two years ago. Okay.
Yeah, it was pretty weird.

134
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,560
But he's a great mental coach too though.

135
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:11,240
You knows like what's creeping around
your subconscious just waiting to pop up

136
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,960
and play tricks on you. You know you
shouldn't be short put in enough rounds.

137
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:18,620
Where does he live? Ah,
he's a UK guy. Okay. Yeah, I
gotta get linked up with him.

138
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,960
Yeah, I'm all about it. I don't
care anybody. I'm like, yeah,

139
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,710
like whatever you got any short minute,
let's go. Yeah, he's a good dude.

140
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:26,990
I'll connect you guys.
I think it's a,

141
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,830
probably one of the least trained aspects
of fighting is the mental aspect of

142
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:38,480
it. You know, you realize how good
guys are just by watching them train,

143
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,100
you see them spar,

144
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:42,810
you see them do all these things y'all
with Tammy's got this guy's fucking good,

145
00:08:42,811 --> 00:08:45,620
this guy's got great Jujitsu Guy,
great kickboxing.

146
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,980
You ever hear about the people that
like they're, they're saying's right?

147
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:52,530
Like man that guy's amazing in the gym.
But when he shows up to fight,

148
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,560
like he just doesn't put on like I've
been that multiple times. And like yeah,

149
00:08:56,561 --> 00:08:58,380
a lot of it has to do with mentally.
Yeah.

150
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:02,080
That's almost like an unaddressed
giant chunk of the puzzle.

151
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,050
Like a third of the puzzle. Like if it
was a pie, a third is keep it together.

152
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,670
You know,
like,

153
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,670
you know when it's ready to go
and now and it's all happening,

154
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:17,010
don't freak out and you never like
here's kind of the something that I think

155
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:19,050
about. You never know
everybody's situation, right.

156
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:23,080
So the day before the fight we have weigh
ins and then Dana comes back and like

157
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,430
he gives us this, our speech,
right? So everyone there,

158
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:30,480
you don't know what life position
they're in. You know? So it's like, hey,

159
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:32,220
there's a potential,
we can get a bonus.

160
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:36,300
So all those guys are affected
emotionally somehow. You know what I mean?

161
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:38,460
Some guys maybe they don't
care. Some guys, maybe they do,

162
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,470
but then like we walk out and then
there's a crowd, 15,000 people sold out.

163
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,810
Look around. We got Joe Rogan sitting
here, we got Mcmahon and say we got Dana.

164
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,720
Why we got everybody sitting around
and then like we're still human too.

165
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:54,210
So we're thinking like this is
kind of like a test, you know?

166
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:58,440
It's like we got all the, we got the
whole board right here in front of me,

167
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:02,670
ready to take my test. You know,
like, yeah, it really depends on like,

168
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,430
there's so much that goes into it.

169
00:10:05,431 --> 00:10:08,370
Like mentally you gotta be prepared for
a lot of things or some guys block it

170
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:09,680
out,
but it's just like,

171
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:14,580
like anything else you had to know
about halfway into the first round,

172
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,900
some special shit was happening
though on this fight. Yes. Uh,

173
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,460
after, so after the first
round, I was very happy.

174
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,810
I sat down and my coaches were like,
okay, this is good, this is good.

175
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:30,210
You're doing this. And I was like,
listen, I don't want to know what's good,

176
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:32,610
what should I expect the next round.
Like I was ready to go.

177
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,070
I told this straight to George,
I'm like, dude, I don't care.

178
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,700
What do I need to do next? What
should I prepare for? And he's like,

179
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,020
prepare for a little bit more pressure.

180
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:42,000
He's probably going to try to shoot
for the take down on this round.

181
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,410
And I was like, okay, cool. So that,

182
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,050
I was just looking for that
and using my tools to kind of,

183
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,750
to just prepare for that. But, uh,

184
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,540
definitely midway through the
second round I was like, okay,

185
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,290
like I know he's still got a lot of power,
all this stuff,

186
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:59,940
but I think that that leg, I
should be able to, you know,

187
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:03,180
buy some time and take away
a little bit of damage,

188
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:07,880
like coming at me and he had to be an
agony and he never stopped coming. Yeah.

189
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:12,000
Let me like, he didn't wince at all. Like
even on the cage when I was just like,

190
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:14,760
when he was on the back and I was trying
to kick his leg, he just, his face,

191
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,870
his facial expression never changed.
He's fucking savage. Man is crazy.

192
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,830
He's a bad man. Respect that guy.
Yeah, for sure. Sure. For sure.

193
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:28,560
Even before, like even before the fight.
No. How far and after for sure. Yeah, no,

194
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,730
maybe even more. So man, not everybody
can do that. Not Everybody can take that,

195
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,750
you know, and to do it the way he did
it with 100%, it was character intact.

196
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,930
Never shirked never shied away from it.
Kept moving forward.

197
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,790
That's a dangerous person. And he's still
getting better. Oh yeah. Hello guys.

198
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,350
Just getting better. Oh
yeah. When you were doing,

199
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,510
how much do you think
the hypnosis helped you?

200
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,200
A really good amount man.
How much different did you
feel like in what way? Um,

201
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,690
I just, I felt more clear. I'm,

202
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:03,450
I feel like a lot of times I can be just
kind of like an anxious guy. I just, I,

203
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,510
I feel like I feel a lot of just
energy. The kind of like, I don't know,

204
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,140
I go into a room and I'm
just like, ah. So having,

205
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:17,370
having the focus on having my intention
set on what I wanted to happen

206
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,343
was

207
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,230
70%.
Like I'd owe 70% of like the hypnotism,

208
00:12:25,231 --> 00:12:27,660
all that stuff to just help me
to keep my thoughts on track.

209
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,540
Something never fall back
onto every single time.

210
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,990
If I felt like I was getting distracted
or getting nervous or whatever,

211
00:12:33,991 --> 00:12:35,790
I would remember,
you know,

212
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,960
the things that we went over and the
hypnotism and so every time just kind of

213
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:42,780
like that, hit that reset button
or just a delete button on,

214
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,480
on thoughts that I just didn't want to
have or thoughts that would make me feel

215
00:12:45,481 --> 00:12:48,170
anything other than happy and ready to go.
Yeah.
