00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.443
Hey, we are bring science down to earth.

00:00:03.443 --> 00:00:04.683
What is this, Neil?

00:00:04.683 --> 00:00:06.933
This is Wheel of Science.

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:09.740
(fun music)

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.410
Hey everybody, I'm Chuck Nice.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.312
Welcome to our newest show, Star Talks,

00:00:16.312 --> 00:00:17.729
Wheel of Science.

00:00:18.025 --> 00:00:19.184
This is an interactive show

00:00:19.184 --> 00:00:22.275
where we answer your questions about the universe.

00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:23.835
And because I'm not smart enough

00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:26.255
to even answer my own questions about the universe,

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:27.606
we have here to help out,

00:00:27.606 --> 00:00:28.976
the one, the only,

00:00:28.976 --> 00:00:31.227
your own personal astrophysicist,

00:00:31.227 --> 00:00:33.227
Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson.

00:00:34.124 --> 00:00:35.260
What's up Neil?

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.400
What's up Chuck?

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.498
As usual, you don't know the questions.

00:00:38.498 --> 00:00:39.331
That's right.

00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:40.560
I'm sitting here clueless.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.414
Ah ha, but I'm positive that you know the answers.

00:00:44.414 --> 00:00:45.914
Our topic today is

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.400
black holes.

00:00:48.397 --> 00:00:49.937
Let's do this, bring it on.

00:00:49.937 --> 00:00:51.121
Hey Neil, before we get into it,

00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:52.159
can you just let the people know

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:53.348
what is a black hole.

00:00:53.348 --> 00:00:55.143
Black hole is a region of space

00:00:55.143 --> 00:00:58.790
where matter has condensed to such a high density

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.011
that the gravity at it surface,

00:01:01.011 --> 00:01:02.085
the surface gravity,

00:01:02.085 --> 00:01:05.085
is so high that you cannot escape it

00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:07.030
even at the speed of light.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.388
You are forever trapped.

00:01:08.388 --> 00:01:12.055
It is the fabric of the space time continuum

00:01:12.397 --> 00:01:14.230
warped back on itself.

00:01:14.468 --> 00:01:15.844
And once you fall in,

00:01:15.844 --> 00:01:17.585
you are never coming out.

00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:18.680
It is the human version

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.241
of the roach motel.

00:01:20.241 --> 00:01:22.491
(chuckles)

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:25.737
You check in but you don't check out a black hole.

00:01:25.737 --> 00:01:26.932
That's why we call them black.

00:01:26.932 --> 00:01:28.117
And when you fall in you don't come out,

00:01:28.117 --> 00:01:29.626
that's why we call it a hole.
(Chuck chuckles)

00:01:29.626 --> 00:01:31.930
'cause we tell it like it is in astrophysics,

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:32.763
black hole.

00:01:32.763 --> 00:01:34.096
Spin that wheel.

00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:36.550
(game music)

00:01:38.201 --> 00:01:40.344
Daniel Junius wants to know:

00:01:40.344 --> 00:01:43.356
"What happens when we fall into a black hole?"

00:01:43.356 --> 00:01:45.638
Ooh, you want to avoid that first of all.

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:47.388
Never, don't do that.

00:01:47.589 --> 00:01:50.124
Neither at home or at work, or anywhere else.

00:01:50.124 --> 00:01:52.431
But if you happened to fall in a black hole,

00:01:52.431 --> 00:01:55.138
which is my preferred form of death.

00:01:55.138 --> 00:01:56.907
It's better than getting hit by a bus.

00:01:56.907 --> 00:02:00.121
So, if you fall in at a feet first dive,

00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:01.871
to this cosmic abyss,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.599
you will not survive.

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:06.682
Because you will not miss

00:02:07.017 --> 00:02:09.267
the tidal forces of gravity

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.468
will create quite a calamity

00:02:11.468 --> 00:02:14.051
when you stretched head to toe.

00:02:14.588 --> 00:02:16.921
Are you sure you want to go?

00:02:17.381 --> 00:02:18.881
Those tidal forces

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:21.533
will increase to the point

00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:24.586
where your body will just snap in two

00:02:24.586 --> 00:02:26.946
likely at the base of the spine.

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:29.471
Then each of those two pieces will snap into two.

00:02:29.471 --> 00:02:33.250
So you become one to two, to four, to eight, to 16,

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.881
until you bifucate all the way down,

00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:38.007
to the center of the black hole.

00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:40.007
And you become a stream of atoms.

00:02:40.007 --> 00:02:41.948
And that's not even the worst part.

00:02:41.948 --> 00:02:44.435
The worst part is you are funneled,

00:02:44.435 --> 00:02:47.935
extruded through the fabric of space time.

00:02:48.282 --> 00:02:50.157
So that you used to be this wide,

00:02:50.157 --> 00:02:52.157
now you are this narrow.

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:54.419
And so, this phenomenon,

00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:59.363
this extrusion, like toothpaste through a tube,

00:03:00.051 --> 00:03:01.884
we have a word for it.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.860
Death by black hole is called "Spaghettification".

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.881
Spaghettification, sounds like a meal to die for. (laugh)

00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:10.948
See what I did there.

00:03:10.948 --> 00:03:11.781
Kill me.

00:03:11.781 --> 00:03:13.432
But give this video a like for a dead joke.

00:03:13.432 --> 00:03:14.280
(chuckles)

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.113
Chuck.

00:03:15.113 --> 00:03:16.557
Alright Neil, are you ready for the next one?

00:03:16.557 --> 00:03:18.057
Spin that wheel.

00:03:18.566 --> 00:03:20.983
(game music)

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.188
Ivica Sur wants to know this:

00:03:24.188 --> 00:03:27.023
"There is a black hole in the middle of our galaxy,

00:03:27.023 --> 00:03:30.273
"is there a giant black hole, or something giant,

00:03:30.273 --> 00:03:32.025
"in the middle of our universe?

00:03:32.025 --> 00:03:34.560
"And something in the middle of the multiverse

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.157
"if we follow that logic?"

00:03:36.157 --> 00:03:36.990
No.

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:41.461
And that's all we have time for.

00:03:41.461 --> 00:03:43.544
(laughs)

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.940
No. What do you want from me?

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.107
It's a no. No.

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:49.040
No.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.510
But I'm suer there's more to it.
No.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.200
But I'm suer there's more to it.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.030
What's up?

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.040
There is no center of the universe.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.850
All the universe was at the same place at the same time

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.890
nearly 14 billion years ago.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.660
Then you could think of it sort of is a center.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.070
But after that we are expanding

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.960
and all pieces expanding away from every place else.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.730
It feels like we are at the center,

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:08.820
but we're not

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.620
anymore than when you are a ship at sea,

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.760
and you are in the middle of you own horizon.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.990
You are equally distanced from every edge of your horizon

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.790
doesn't mean you are at the center of anything.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:20.620
So no.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.450
There is no known center of the universe.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.780
And therefore I can say with some confident that

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.970
there is no black hole there.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.580
Okay Neil, thanks for making me feel less important

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.750
than I already do

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.760
knowing that I'm not the center of the universe.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.600
But wait a minute,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.520
how about black hole at the center of our galaxy?

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.470
We've got one,

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.140
Andromeda's got one.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.930
Except theirs is bigger than ours.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:38.900
We have black hole envy,

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.900
but that's another show.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.890
Long ago we didn't know if black hole

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.630
would be common in the center of the galaxies.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.480
But with the help of Hubble telescope,

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.650
which has good precise ways to look down in the center,

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.320
every galaxy we've had the capacity to check

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.640
has revealed a black hole to us.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.560
Thus we will extrapolate and assert

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.550
that a black hole is a natural phenomenon

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.450
in the center of all galaxies in the universe.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.060
Neil, as usual, that's fascinating.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.730
We have time for one more question.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.900
And we are gonna take a look at some group comments.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.370
But first, let's spin that wheel.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.780
(game music)

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.220
Dan Birmingham wants to know:

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.630
"What's the most exciting thing

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.460
"we don't know about black holes?"

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.530
There's good theoretical ideas

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.370
about what would happen if you survive a trip

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.280
through the black hole,

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.840
and come out on the other side.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.200
All of our equations tell us that

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.700
an entire new space time opens up for you.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.810
Once you left the universe you were just in

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.940
you will never return to it.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.750
But you will enter another domain.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.880
Our equations tell us it's there.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.040
But there is no way to test that

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.730
and come back and tell anybody about it.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.560
So that remains for me

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.050
one of the most intriguing mysteries of the universe.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.550
Is each black hole a universe unto itself?

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.030
Chuck, back to you.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.680
Damn. That is super cool.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.690
I'm gonna call that a black rabbit hole.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:09.520
(exciting music)

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.560
Well, Neil, we are out of time.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.710
Thanks for being here, buddy.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.260
I'm happy to be with you Chuck, always.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.200
Make sure you subscribe to

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.370
StarTalk network on Facebook watch,

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.110
and join the Wheel of Science group

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.070
and leave comments,

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.760
like Brain McReynolds says,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.830
"I have just started sneaking science facts

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.850
"onto the dry erase announcement board at work,

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.980
"so this will give me some more ideas lol"

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.390
Why don't you find Brain and leave him some facts.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.150
Thanks for watching guys.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.490
We'll see you next week on

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:36.910
Wheel of Science.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.970
