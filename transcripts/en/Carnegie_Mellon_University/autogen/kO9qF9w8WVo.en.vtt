fiction films and television shows so we

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020
fiction films and television shows so we
 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.110
fiction films and television shows so we
do some readings on cutting-edge science

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:23.120
do some readings on cutting-edge science
 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.940
do some readings on cutting-edge science
and then look at some science fiction

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950
and then look at some science fiction
 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.080
and then look at some science fiction
film examples that relate to it and try

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090
film examples that relate to it and try
 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.330
film examples that relate to it and try
to critique the science fiction films

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340
to critique the science fiction films
 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.549
to critique the science fiction films
from a scientific point of view and it

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.729
for MCS students to keep them interested
in science and I proposed a course on

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739
in science and I proposed a course on
 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.340
in science and I proposed a course on
science and science fiction and

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350
science and science fiction and
 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.139
science and science fiction and
everybody thought it was a great idea

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149
everybody thought it was a great idea
 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.759
everybody thought it was a great idea
but they suggested one of the things we

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769
but they suggested one of the things we
 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.770
but they suggested one of the things we
had to do was to build a warp drive as

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780
had to do was to build a warp drive as
 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.230
had to do was to build a warp drive as
part of the coursework which we haven't

succeeded in doing yet how does a warp

drive work you might well ask so the

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850
drive work you might well ask so the
 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.670
drive work you might well ask so the
idea is that the energy produced in the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680
idea is that the energy produced in the
 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.990
idea is that the energy produced in the
matter/antimatter reaction in the warp

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000
matter/antimatter reaction in the warp
 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.539

engines somehow distorts space and the

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549
engines somehow distorts space and the
 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.340
engines somehow distorts space and the
idea is that you compress the space in

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350
idea is that you compress the space in
 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.319
idea is that you compress the space in
front of the ship and expand the space

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329
front of the ship and expand the space
 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.080
front of the ship and expand the space
behind the ship and you end up riding

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090
behind the ship and you end up riding
 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.819
behind the ship and you end up riding
along on a wave of distorted space which

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829
along on a wave of distorted space which
 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.490
along on a wave of distorted space which
actually doesn't quite violate the limit

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500
actually doesn't quite violate the limit
 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.370
actually doesn't quite violate the limit

they really like to tear apart the films

from a science perspective and see

from a science perspective and see

from a science perspective and see
what's wrong with it

something comes up that is plausible but

something comes up that is plausible but
 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.699

usually not usually it's in the realm of
