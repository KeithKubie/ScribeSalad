00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
Hey there all you Halloweeners.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:09.120
I am Walter Banasiak and welcome back to October Top 5. So many of you have been asking about this series.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.640
So just call me the mailman because I'm delivering in a big way, starting right now with a best episode breakdown.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.990
"Are you afraid of the dark?", a question that has meant a lot to a legion of fans since the early 1990s.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.349
This series aired a total of 7 seasons and 91 episodes the original run ended in

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.089
1996 after just five seasons, but was revised in 1999 for two more.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.000
I did discuss it a bit in my video of the top 5 best 90s Nickelodeon shows and

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.400
make no mistake about it, Nick in the 90s would not have been as strong as it was without this show.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.300
Upon rewatching, I was pleasantly surprised with how well Are You Afraid of the Dark held up.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.698
It excelled in what it was good at, which

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.099
was being a scary show for kids while still being

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.059
interesting enough to hold the attention of teenagers and even some of their parents.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:09.088
There are some legitimately great episodes of this Canadian produced anthology series. So let's take a look, eh?

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.220
Submitted for the approval of the Channel Awesome Society I call this countdown...

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.080
Fwoosh!

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.879
The Top 5 Best Are You Afraid of the Dark? episodes.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.150
Number 5

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.319
The Tale of Train Magic from season 4.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.170
I'm gonna say this right off the bat.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.519
This is a horrible title.They could have gone with numerous other ones that would have better

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.429
represented this story. If I were to make a top 5 worst

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.369
Are You Afraid of the Dark episode titles, this might make the list. However, the actual episode is one of the best.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.089
Frank tells the tale of a boy named Tim who has recently lost his father a train conductor and is not dealing with it well.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.328
He's obsessed with trains and wants to be just like his dad.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.399
A veteran conductor appears to him on an old set of tracks near his house and the mysterious trainman

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:07.019
eventually gives Tim a special toy train car. The young boy soon finds out the horrifying details behind these peculiar happenings.

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.169
This definitely isn't the scariest episode in the series,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.760
but it's just creepy enough with a very strong story. Not to say it isn't a little cheesy,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.260
but I'm a sucker for an effective sympathetic character and Tim absolutely fits that description.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.069
The kid just lost his dad and is trying to hang on to something from him.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.130
Tim's father's friend, Cap, looks out for the young boy

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.300
and when that strange conductor starts showing up Cap explains who he might be.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.200
Train crashed. A lot of folks died including the conductor.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.730
Ray Lawson.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.500
But I saw him. We dug his body out of the wreck. Still had the watch in his hand.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.009
This episode has a concept that shows up in the series a few other times. That being the main character

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:58.750
getting sucked into a smaller version of an actual place. In this case, the toy train car transports Tim onto a ghost train.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.890
I won't give the rest away, but it works great as a little ghost story.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.940
There is something kind of eerie about old trains and abandoned tracks. This episode covered that well with some good character development.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.310
Let's chug along at number four.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.306
Number 4

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.519
The Tale of the Crimson Clown from season 3.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.809
Scary clowns are very popular right now, so this episode fits right in.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.130
Gary tells the tale of two brothers, Mike and Sam, who are out trying to get their mom a birthday present

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.440
Sam, the bratty younger brother, treats Mike like crap and steals the money his older brother was going to use to buy his mom's present

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.509
and buys a videogame for himself.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.830
Mike tells Sam to stop misbehaving or the crimson clown will get him. What started out as a story to scare Sam turns out to

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:04.160
be a lot more real than the troublemaker ever thought. I grew up with Bozo, so I was never really scared of clowns,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.950
but I remember being creeped out by Crimson. It's that laugh. It's freaking demented.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.900
You rotten kid! Ahahahahaha!

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.469
They really play up how much of a little jerk Sam is, so when the Crimson clown haunts him later

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.669
you don't feel all that bad for him. However, it doesn't make it any less creepy.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.169
Mike!

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.600
Help...

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.600
What the?

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:49.700
I can see this one freaking out little kids, and if you do have a fear of clowns, it's probably still a little scary.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.700
Help!

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.300
No one will help you, Sam!

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.300
Nobody wants to!

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.920
That laugh though.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.100
Number 3

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.460
The Tale of Station 109.1 from season 5.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.800
Ryan Gosling and Gilbert Gottfried guest star in this episode, so it's definitely a star-studded installment.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.089
Stig tells the tale of Chris Leary, a boy who has a fascination with death and the afterlife.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.700
When his brother Jaime locks him in a hearse to scare this obsession out of him, Chris begins to hear a strange voice on the radio.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:40.230
When he investigates the station he finds out it's for those who have passed away and missed crossing over to the other side.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.500
He's mistaken for a dead person and must convince the clerk there that he's still among the living.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.529
This is a really good concept, and the acting is pretty solid from everyone.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.900
But the real reason that this episode is on the list is because of Gilbert Gottfried.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.900
Do not knock on the window! What's the matter with you? You can't read?

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.180
Here! Knock window.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.180
Do not on the.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.820
Let's try it together, shall we? Do not knock on the window!

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.580
He's hilarious in this while maintaining a little touch of dread.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:20.180
Boy, if I had a dime for every time somebody tried to weasel out of dead...

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.540
It would actually do me no good at all cuz I'm dead. Why do I need money for? What am I gonna

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.020
do? I'm dead. What am I gonna do, buy gum?

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.160
There are jokes in there that went over my head watching it for the first time as a kid, but our funny as hell now.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.360
You can't come in here unless you're in the union!

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:42.700
I don't make mistakes, buddy-boy.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.000
When I was alive I worked for the department of motor vehicles!

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.020
Gosling isn't the main kid in this one, but he's still enjoyable.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.370
What a cheese head.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.250
I'm...Daniel Carpenter.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.120
*Scoffs* Sure you are, bud.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:05.229
There's a sense of urgency for Chris to not be mistakenly thrown into the afterlife that kept me interested the entire time.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.240
This is a really good episode.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.300
Okay, one more.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:15.160
All standing quietly one after the other. Why do you suppose that is?

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:23.120
It's a line! That's what it is! It's a line! Why don't you try waiting in the line!

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.580
You tell 'em, Iago!

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.190
Number 2

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.320
The Tale of The Midnight Madness from season 2.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.600
I love this episode. The setting, the concept, Dr. Fink.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.820
Vink! With a Vuh-vuh-vuh!

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.620
It's just great.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:46.150
Frank tells the tale of an old-time theater called the Rialto. It's a landmark that shows classic films

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.640
but isn't making enough money to stay open.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.640
Dr. Vink shows up to change all that. He gives the employees an old silent film

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.640
he made called Nosferatu: The Demon Vampire to show at the theater.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.680
The movie is a massive hit and saves the cinema

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:06.220
but when the manager goes back on his word to show more of Vinc films, Nosferatu comes to life straight out of the movie screen.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.680
Leaving the employees to deal with the vicious vampire.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.580
The execution on this episode is pretty much perfect.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:20.300
The idea of a movie character coming to life in the real world isn't an earth-shattering new idea, but it works flawlessly here.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:34.820
I always thought Nosferatu was unnerving, so seeing a version of Count Orlok pop up here is pretty freaky.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:40.860
I love that he doesn't make any sound since he came out of a silent movie and glides instead of walks. Great touches.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.940
*Door creaks*

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:59.900
We also care about these protagonists. The male and female employees, Pete and Katie, are pretty good.

00:09:00.009 --> 00:09:02.969
Pete especially is given some nice development in a very short amount of time.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.240
When he went up against Nosferatu, I was rooting for him.

00:09:12.069 --> 00:09:16.589
I have to mention Dr. Vink as well. He's a fan favorite and appeared in a few of Frank's stories.

00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:21.220
This is my favorite appearance from him. I couldn't have written it better myself.

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.660
And believe me.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.880
I've got many many more

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.920
that are far better than this one!

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.880
Can we see some of those? A sequel to this episode would be fantastic.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:44.200
Like a lot of you, I grew up loving this show and there are so many more than just 5 great episodes

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.840
I really wanted to talk about, but at the very least I can list them here as honorable mentions.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.620
And the number one best, are you afraid of the dark episode is?

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:16.300
The Tale of the Silver Sight parts 1 through 3 from season 7.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:23.320
This is the ultimate story. We finally get to see the Midnight Society in a scary tale all their own.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.980
When his grandfather unexpectedly dies Gary, the former leader of the Midnight Society,

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:34.519
returns to the group seeking their help. His grandfather left behind a true story for him that only he would believe.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.209
It involves tracking down the former members of the original Midnight Society and

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.700
destroying an evil charm called the Silver Sight. The group splits up, looking for the original members

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.240
but don't anticipate what a dangerous path they're all on.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:53.460
This little saga was absolutely worth bringing Gary back for. It's ultimately his story.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.820
I'm Tucker's brother. I used to run these briefings.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.240
It looks like you've changed things a little bit.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.460
When I was here we...

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.140
Building the war of the Midnight Society itself was a great idea.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:17.020
Having it basically be a family heirloom that Gary and Tucker are continuing the legacy of

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:22.140
provided even more background for us to care about with these characters. Love this by the way.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.720
Haven't done this in a while.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:32.440
Submitted for the approval of the Midnight Society I call this story...

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:42.640
I will say these aren't perfect episodes for some reason they felt it necessary to make a few scenes a little too goofy.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.000
The sewer sequences in part 2 almost killed the vibe.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.980
What have we here?

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.480
Were you announced?

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:56.820
*Gasp*

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:02.620
The Silver Sight is a fun eerie and intriguing mystery that proved to be the series best.

00:12:02.699 --> 00:12:07.909
It's a layered story and made me want to see the Midnight Society have their own scary adventures more often.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:12.120
Looking back though the fact that this is the only one makes it that much more special.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:18.800
Again, having Gary return and seeing him with Tucker one last time was just really cool as a longtime fan of the series.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:38.720
After watching this and Goosebumps back-to-back, I feel like I have a pretty strong perspective on the strengths and weaknesses of both shows.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:45.560
But which one is better? Go ahead and check out a new video on my personal channel, where I present my thoughts on this question.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:50.260
I want to hear what you guys think. What is your favorite Are You Afraid of the Dark? episode?
