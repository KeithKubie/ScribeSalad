so you'll have a different different

00:37:59.950 --> 00:37:59.960
so you'll have a different different
 

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:02.140
so you'll have a different different
culture and then you have to deal with

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:02.150
culture and then you have to deal with
 

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:04.480
culture and then you have to deal with
the question of what do you do with with

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:04.490
the question of what do you do with with
 

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:08.550
the question of what do you do with with
a cultural heritage in which you have

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560
a cultural heritage in which you have
 

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:14.380

human sacrifice now

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:14.390
 
 

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:18.070
 
if you if you go to another planet and

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:18.080
if you if you go to another planet and
 

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:21.750
if you if you go to another planet and
you find that the humanoids there have

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760
you find that the humanoids there have
 

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:27.340
you find that the humanoids there have
orgies and get completely wasted on

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:27.350
orgies and get completely wasted on
 

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:30.010
orgies and get completely wasted on
hallucinogenic drugs and have human

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:30.020
hallucinogenic drugs and have human
 

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:33.520
hallucinogenic drugs and have human
sacrifice and so forth the people who

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:33.530
sacrifice and so forth the people who
 

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:35.440
sacrifice and so forth the people who
are doing the terraforming try to

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:35.450
are doing the terraforming try to
 

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:37.750
are doing the terraforming try to
distance themselves from that that we

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760
distance themselves from that that we
 

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.100
distance themselves from that that we
don't that's totally different for us

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:39.110
don't that's totally different for us
 

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:42.010
don't that's totally different for us
and so the Europeans invented the myth

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:42.020
and so the Europeans invented the myth
 

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:44.140
and so the Europeans invented the myth
of cannibals which isn't entirely a myth

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:44.150
of cannibals which isn't entirely a myth
 

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:47.740
of cannibals which isn't entirely a myth
but the idea that well these people on

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:47.750
but the idea that well these people on
 

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:50.140
but the idea that well these people on
these other planets they're cannibals

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:50.150
these other planets they're cannibals
 

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:53.850

doesn't agree with you now the human
 

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:32.090
doesn't agree with you now the human
sacrifice particularly interesting

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:32.100
 
 

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:35.480
 
were there more people killed a human

of animal totems and so on and they're
 

01:01:34.050 --> 01:01:38.240
of animal totems and so on and they're
pretty well well discussed and then they

pretty well well discussed and then they
 

01:01:38.250 --> 01:01:41.860
pretty well well discussed and then they
became completely differently discussed

became completely differently discussed
 

01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:45.740

really here is that the notion of a

important aspects of world history are

important aspects of world history are
and what those important most important

01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.160
and what those important most important
 

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:48.220
and what those important most important
aspects are though it may take another

do it so I'm skeptical about the notion

do it so I'm skeptical about the notion
of taking globalisation as something

01:04:59.260 --> 01:04:59.270
of taking globalisation as something
 

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:02.200
of taking globalisation as something
good and more inclined to think that

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:02.210
good and more inclined to think that
 

01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:04.300
good and more inclined to think that
globalization will have to be something

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:04.310
globalization will have to be something
 

01:05:04.310 --> 01:05:07.420
globalization will have to be something
that has overcome that globalization

that has overcome that globalization
 

01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:13.170

will become what European exceptionalism

01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:13.180
will become what European exceptionalism

will become what European exceptionalism
was early in the 20th century a concept

01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:17.030
was early in the 20th century a concept
 

01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:18.850
was early in the 20th century a concept
that has to be overcome to recognize the

01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:18.860
that has to be overcome to recognize the
 

01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:21.220
that has to be overcome to recognize the
rest of the world and I think that

01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:21.230
rest of the world and I think that
 

01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:23.860
rest of the world and I think that
globalization is going to become an

globalization is going to become an

globalization is going to become an

result of a world history and how that's

01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119
result of a world history and how that's
 

01:05:39.119 --> 01:05:43.029

going to happen I I don't obviously know

01:05:43.029 --> 01:05:43.039
going to happen I I don't obviously know
 

01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:46.910
going to happen I I don't obviously know
but it certainly is going to raises the

but it certainly is going to raises the

but it certainly is going to raises the
promise that in another 50 years we

promise that in another 50 years we
 

01:05:50.999 --> 01:05:55.069
promise that in another 50 years we
might be able to write a something like

the earth and its people's that will be
not a world history but a world's

01:06:02.239 --> 01:06:02.249
not a world history but a world's
 

01:06:02.249 --> 01:06:05.359
not a world history but a world's
history and that it will be very

history and that it will be very
 

01:06:05.369 --> 01:06:07.429

god then the other perspective of course
is that the internet will change

01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:18.900
is that the internet will change
 

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:21.799
is that the internet will change
everything and we have another another

almost 30 years I have now taught the
