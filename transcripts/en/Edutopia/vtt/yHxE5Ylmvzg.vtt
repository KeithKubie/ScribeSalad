00:00:00.106 --> 00:00:01.146
&gt;&gt;Karimah: My name is Karimah.

00:00:01.146 --> 00:00:04.656
I graduated last year and I'm first
in my family to go to college.

00:00:09.456 --> 00:00:12.086
&gt;&gt;Karimah: Growing up, I was always
scared that college was not going

00:00:12.086 --> 00:00:14.826
to be an option for me, not
only because of financial needs,

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.906
but because of my appearance
and my ethnicity.

00:00:18.086 --> 00:00:22.286
My father, he sat down with me and just
told me, "Daddy can't afford college."

00:00:22.336 --> 00:00:25.546
I remember feeling really
heartbroken that I was trying so hard.

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:29.226
I was a four point oh student, but I've
always believed that there's a path.

00:00:29.226 --> 00:00:31.826
And I remember my sophomore
year at Envision Academy.

00:00:32.106 --> 00:00:35.286
I began to blossom into
the person I am today.

00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:38.946
&gt;&gt;You know, I'm always big on leadership
and finding myself, and I found myself

00:00:39.016 --> 00:00:42.086
through poetry and all the workshops
and projects here at Envision.

00:00:42.316 --> 00:00:45.506
&gt;&gt;So when I did get a scholarship,
I remember showing my dad.

00:00:45.636 --> 00:00:48.316
I told him, "Well, look Dad, like,
college is not a worry anymore."

00:00:49.136 --> 00:00:52.396
Being the first generation in
my family to go to college,

00:00:52.446 --> 00:00:54.706
I am a role model for
my younger siblings.

00:00:55.036 --> 00:00:56.956
I'm just excited that I have
opened these doors for them.
