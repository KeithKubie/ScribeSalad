00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.540
Or remembering, that I said that device motion, is,

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.170
a strict super set of device orientation. Anything, you can

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.570
do with device orientation, you could do, with device

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.870
motion. However, it's going to be easier to implement things

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.380
like a compass or a joystick, using device orientation

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.660
rather than device motion. However, if you want to implement

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.780
shake to send feedback, you really need the acceleration, sensing

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.910
that device motion offers. And for a generic game controller,

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.140
rather than just a joy stick, you might find

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.130
device motion, is interesting. For example, the roll it game,

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.890
that we demonstrated at IO used the acceleration rates, from

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.870
device motion and that way you could tell what speed

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.320
the device was moving and in which direction. So,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.360
it made it really easy to throw a ball, with

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.230
pretty good precision. One major difference, between, these two APIs,

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.900
is how often they're fired. Device orientation, is, only fired,

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.530
when the device orientation changes. For

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.730
device motion, it's fired whenever, the acceleration

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.080
changes, on the device, which includes

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.320
lateral movement. So, it fires pretty often.
