00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's just take a look again if there's activities.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If you remember what we're trying to do is get, keep and grow customers,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and so these things on the left with all these arrows going into the funnel,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
those represent all the demand creation activities you were doing either paid or free.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And in the physical channel that we're getting you into the funnel on the top.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And for web, mobile or cloud, we were getting you into the funnel on the bottom.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now remember, these are just visual representations of the process.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The world doesn't actually look like this but when you get good enough ad,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
thus you tend to actually look at your process.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
What we are really looking is a funnel laying on its side and you tend to think about

00:00:43.000 --> 99:59:59.000
how do we efficiently get payers or users into the funnel and all the way through it.
