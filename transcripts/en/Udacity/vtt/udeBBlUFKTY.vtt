00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.992
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We just need to set y equal to each side of the equation. So our two lines or

00:00:03.992 --> 00:00:08.262
curves are y equals x squared plus 8x plus 15 and y equals 3. Let's look at what

00:00:08.262 --> 00:00:12.508
the intersection of these lines actually looks like. So here's a lovely graph,

00:00:12.508 --> 00:00:16.781
and we can see two points of intersection. At these two points, we'll be able to

00:00:16.781 --> 00:00:19.649
find x values that satisfy this equation right here.
