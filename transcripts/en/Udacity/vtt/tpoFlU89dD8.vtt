00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.600
Here's a very nice demo showing an important technique for cube maps. Up to

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.974
this point the techniques described have used cube maps created in advance. In

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:11.986
fact the GPU is plenty powerful enough to make cube maps on the fly. Look at

00:00:11.986 --> 00:00:14.970
this demo carefully. What's great about it is that the shiny knot figure and

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.820
cube are reflected in the sphere, changing position every frame. The way this

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.236
is done is to make a cube map from the viewpoint of the spheres position. The

00:00:23.236 --> 00:00:27.648
spheres center in each face of the cube map forms of a view uuu. You render the

00:00:27.648 --> 00:00:30.686
scene six times, one for each cube face, and each rendering is then used for

00:00:30.686 --> 00:00:35.320
the new cube face. The sphere itself is not rendered into the cube map. After

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.920
the cube map is rendered, it's immediately applied to all of the objects in the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.850
scene. The cube map includes the knot and block in it, so you can see these

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.496
reflected in the sphere. The exact reflection is not precisely right, but close

00:00:46.496 --> 00:00:50.342
enough that we accept it as correct. For efficiency, this same map is used on

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:53.202
the knot and block objects, but the reflections are so distorted that we don't

00:00:53.202 --> 00:00:58.159
notice that the environment map is incorrect. That it includes two objects and

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.860
not the third. Notice how this demo is recursive in nature. The objects

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.277
reflected are also reflective, each object when rendered is using the previous

00:01:05.277 --> 00:01:09.740
frame's environment map on it, so, they all look reflective. I recommend toying

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.260
with this demo and changing objects and materials to see how it changes what

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.594
you see. This technique of generating cube maps on the fly is popular in racing

00:01:16.594 --> 00:01:19.848
games for example. The car is removed from the scene and the rest of the

00:01:19.848 --> 00:01:23.650
environment is rendered to the cube map which is then applied to the car.
