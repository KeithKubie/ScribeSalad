00:00:00.574 --> 00:00:03.059
- [Voiceover] Consider the
function f of x is equal to one

00:00:03.059 --> 00:00:07.889
over x-squared minus k-x,
where k is a nonzero constant.

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:10.420
The derivative of f is given by,

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.335
and they give us this
expression right over here.

00:00:12.335 --> 00:00:15.435
That's nice that they took
the derivative for us.

00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:19.752
Now part a, let k equals
three so that f of x is equal

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:22.422
to one over x-squared minus three-x.

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:24.965
So they set k equal to three.

00:00:24.965 --> 00:00:27.832
Write an equation for the line tangent

00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:30.503
to the graph of f at the point

00:00:30.503 --> 00:00:34.053
whose x-coordinate is four.

00:00:34.053 --> 00:00:35.890
So to find an equation for a line,

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.550
the equation of a line
is gonna be in the form

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.721
y is equal to m-x plus b,

00:00:40.721 --> 00:00:42.251
where m is the slope of the line

00:00:42.251 --> 00:00:44.237
and b is the y-intercept.

00:00:44.237 --> 00:00:46.594
And the slope of the
line, right over here,

00:00:46.594 --> 00:00:50.321
this needs to be equal to
the derivative evaluated

00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:52.097
when x is equal to four.

00:00:52.097 --> 00:00:54.779
So we could say, y is equal to...

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:56.486
Let me write it this way.

00:00:56.486 --> 00:01:01.292
We could say that m is
going to be equal to f-prime

00:01:01.292 --> 00:01:02.908
when x is equal to four.

00:01:02.908 --> 00:01:05.356
So, f-prime of four, which is equal to...

00:01:05.356 --> 00:01:07.097
Well, we know that k is equal to three.

00:01:07.097 --> 00:01:08.665
So, they gave us f-prime of x.

00:01:08.665 --> 00:01:12.577
So, it's going to be
three minus two times,

00:01:12.577 --> 00:01:13.738
we're taking f-prime of four,

00:01:13.738 --> 00:01:17.303
so minus two times four

00:01:17.303 --> 00:01:20.704
over x-squared.

00:01:20.704 --> 00:01:24.705
So that's going to be
four-squared, minus k,

00:01:24.705 --> 00:01:28.146
is three times four,

00:01:28.146 --> 00:01:31.873
three times four, and then
we square that whole thing.

00:01:31.873 --> 00:01:33.440
And so what is this going to be?

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.673
This is an eight right over here,

00:01:34.673 --> 00:01:37.588
and all I did is f-prime of
x, when k is equal to three,

00:01:37.588 --> 00:01:40.244
is gonna be three minus
two-x over x-squared

00:01:40.244 --> 00:01:43.437
minus three-x and all of that squared.

00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:46.770
And I want to evaluate
what f-prime of four is.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.930
So, every place where I saw an x,

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.392
I substituted with a four.

00:01:49.392 --> 00:01:51.504
Where I saw the k, k is three.

00:01:51.504 --> 00:01:53.282
And so this is going to be equal to...

00:01:53.282 --> 00:01:56.602
The numerator is three minus
eight, is negative five,

00:01:56.602 --> 00:02:01.098
over this is 16 minus 12,

00:02:01.098 --> 00:02:03.738
which is going to be four,

00:02:03.738 --> 00:02:06.575
16 minus 12 is four,
and then we square it.

00:02:06.575 --> 00:02:08.897
So it's gonna be negative five-sixteenths.

00:02:08.897 --> 00:02:09.883
And so let me write it this way,

00:02:09.883 --> 00:02:13.460
m is equal to negative five-sixteenths.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.409
So, how do we figure out b now?

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:17.431
Well, what are the coordinates?

00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:21.602
When x is equal to four, what
is y going to be equal to?

00:02:21.602 --> 00:02:23.584
Well, y is equal to f of x.

00:02:23.584 --> 00:02:27.743
So we know that y, on
the curve, we know that y

00:02:27.743 --> 00:02:31.769
is going to be equal to f of four.

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.754
So before we evaluated f-prime of four.

00:02:33.754 --> 00:02:37.259
Now we're going to evaluate
y as being f of four

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:41.312
which is equal to one over four-squared,

00:02:41.312 --> 00:02:45.109
four-squared minus three times four,

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:49.160
and so that is equal to one over

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.980
16 minus 12, which is four.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.651
And so this point, right
here, when x is four,

00:02:55.651 --> 00:02:58.089
then y is equal to one-fourth.

00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:02.418
So, we can use that
information to solve for b.

00:03:02.418 --> 00:03:06.169
When y is one-fourth, x...

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:08.352
So, we're gonna say if y is equal to m,

00:03:08.352 --> 00:03:11.011
which is negative five-sixteenths,

00:03:11.011 --> 00:03:13.541
negative five-sixteenths, times x.

00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:16.932
Well, when y is one-fourth, x is...

00:03:16.932 --> 00:03:20.450
Or when I say when x is equal to four,

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.156
y is one-fourth,

00:03:23.156 --> 00:03:24.397
and then plus b.

00:03:24.397 --> 00:03:25.744
So I can now solve for b.

00:03:25.744 --> 00:03:29.006
So all I did is I used f-prime of x.

00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:31.618
I used f-prime of x to figure out m,

00:03:31.618 --> 00:03:33.279
when x is equal to four.

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:35.601
And then, I said, "Okay,
well what is the value of y

00:03:35.601 --> 00:03:37.052
"when x is equal to four?"

00:03:37.052 --> 00:03:41.489
And so, if I know y, m, and
x, then I can solve for b.

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.961
And so, let's just do that.

00:03:42.961 --> 00:03:46.235
We get one-fourth is equal to four times

00:03:46.235 --> 00:03:50.067
negative five-sixteenths,
is negative five over four,

00:03:50.067 --> 00:03:51.135
plus b.

00:03:51.135 --> 00:03:52.923
I can add five-fourths to both sides,

00:03:52.923 --> 00:03:57.381
and I get five-fourths plus
one-fourth is equal to b,

00:03:57.381 --> 00:04:01.934
or b is equal to six-fourths,

00:04:01.934 --> 00:04:04.788
six over four, which you can say...

00:04:04.788 --> 00:04:06.460
Well, there's a bunch of
ways you could write this.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.750
We could just say this
is just equal to 1.5.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.195
And so our equation is y
is equal to negative five

00:04:15.195 --> 00:04:19.359
over 16 x plus 1.5.

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.170
Or if we wanted to write
everything as a fraction,

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.656
we could say y is equal to negative five

00:04:24.656 --> 00:04:27.856
over 16 x plus three-halves.

00:04:27.856 --> 00:04:29.246
Six-fourths is the same thing

00:04:29.246 --> 00:04:33.096
as three-halves,

00:04:33.096 --> 00:04:34.880
and there you go.
