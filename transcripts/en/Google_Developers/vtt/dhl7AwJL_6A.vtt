[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.601 --> 00:00:06.850
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hey, everyone.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.000
So I actually have a
sixth sense for donuts.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.800
I know where they
are, and I'm sensing

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.000
they're right over there.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.730
And all I have to do is
use Android Pay to get one.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.290
Shall we do it?

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.342
Yes, we should.

00:00:18.342 --> 00:00:19.300
Hey, how are you doing?

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.540
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.332
How about yourself?

00:00:20.332 --> 00:00:21.831
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm
doing fantastic.

00:00:21.831 --> 00:00:22.870
So what do I do here?

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.328
SPEAKER 1: Just tap your phone
with the Android Pay loyalty

00:00:25.328 --> 00:00:27.250
card on it and we'll
get you a donut.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.027
TIMOTHY JORDAN: There it is.

00:00:29.027 --> 00:00:30.610
SPEAKER 1: Which
donut would you like?

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.235
TIMOTHY JORDAN: The
green one, clearly.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.723
Thank you so much.

00:00:36.723 --> 00:00:40.087
Thanks, guys.

00:00:40.087 --> 00:00:40.587
Ah.

00:00:44.934 --> 00:00:46.770
That's good.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.700
That's good.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.670
OK, so Dennis and I
clearly have been using

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.150
Android Pay a few more times.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.710
Dennis, tell me about
what just happened there

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.820
when I tapped my phone on?

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.861
DENNIS: So we're doing,
actually, Tap for Treats.

00:00:59.861 --> 00:01:01.590
You get to go to
stations right now.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.400
You, basically, tap through NFC.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.080
And it's a loyalty
card that's set up

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.941
that you can collect points
off of every time you do a tap.

00:01:08.941 --> 00:01:11.440
So you go to the stations, tap,
we'll give you a nice donut,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.534
some other treats.

00:01:12.534 --> 00:01:14.950
After you get four taps, you
can come back to this station

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.242
later on in the day and you
can get a free Android Bot.

00:01:17.242 --> 00:01:18.741
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So
this is something

00:01:18.741 --> 00:01:21.150
that people are doing all
around the festival today.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.900
DENNIS: Correct.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.192
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
I can see, as I've

00:01:25.192 --> 00:01:26.650
been passing by
throughout the day,

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.067
that it's also
very, very popular.

00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:29.691
And I don't think
it's just the donuts.

00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:31.000
I think it's all pretty easy.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.920
DENNIS: Yeah, it's
super easy to do.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.260
Literally takes seconds
to actually recognize

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.090
through the NFC tap.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.380
People obviously love
Android Bots as well.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.046
So that's probably
another big incentive

00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:42.490
of why people are doing it.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.189
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh, and wait.

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.730
There's more than
just donuts, right?

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.840
DENNIS: There is more
than just donuts.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.120
You actually have a custom
Bot that you can get.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.880
Once you tap four times,
come to this terminal.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.160
People can actually
get a nice free custom

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.572
Bot that's specifically
Android Pay and I/O 2017.

00:01:57.572 --> 00:01:59.030
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really cool.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.571
DENNIS: Yeah.

00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:00.506
Here you go.

00:02:00.506 --> 00:02:01.630
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh, really?

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.260
Thank you!

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.010
DENNIS: All right.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.390
Thanks.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.300
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All
right, my hands are full.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.799
I'm going to take care of this
and we'll get something else.

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.749
