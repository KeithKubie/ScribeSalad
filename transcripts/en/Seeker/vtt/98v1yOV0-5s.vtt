00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.090
Doug Vakoch: “In 1950, the Italian physicist
Enrico Fermi asked a question that's become

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.450
known as the Fermi Paradox: where are they?

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.750
If in fact there's intelligent life in the
universe, why haven't they contacted us?”

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.010
Well, one possibility is the zoo hypothesis.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.300
“Maybe extraterrestrials are out there,
perhaps even at the nearest stars, but they're

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.359
simply observing us, sort of like how we watch
animals at a zoo.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.620
Perhaps the protocol for making first contact
requires us to take the initiative.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.280
That's what we're testing at METI.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.910
My name is Douglas Vakoch and I'm the president
of METI, an organization dedicated to messaging

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.969
extraterrestrial intelligence.

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:55.379
For many years, I worked at the SETI institute
as the director of interstellar message composition

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.629
and my work is to prepare for the day we detect
a signal and we need to decide should we reply?

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.850
What should we say?

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.370
Well, there are a number of SETI organizations
but, all of them have focused their energies

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.480
on simply listening.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.160
After a number of years, I decided it's really
time for us to move forward.”

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.720
A move from listening for signals to beaming
intentional ones has been the subject of intense

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.720
controversy.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.750
A petition signed by scientists warned that
"we know nothing of [an extraterrestrials]

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.840
intentions and capabilities, and it is impossible
to predict whether [they] will be benign or

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.630
hostile."

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.260
For METI’s critics, the unknown is a good
enough reason to stay quiet.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.640
And they insist on global consensus before
any message is sent out.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.360
But that hasn’t stopped METI from forging
ahead anyway.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:51.590
“The key to remember is the signals that
we sent off in the 50s and 60s and 70s...are

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.270
all travelling outward at the speed of light.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.990
So for anyone who says we should hide from
the extraterrestrials, I've got some bad news

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.490
for you, it's too late.”

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.560
This isn’t the first time we’ve tried
to broadcast our existence to the cosmos,

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.950
and one of the most famous examples is the
Arecibo message.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.620
Back in 1974, Carl Sagan and astronomer Frank
Drake sent 1,679 pulses of light into space

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.200
from the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.750
If an alien translated it, they would see
the numbers 1-10, the basic chemical elements

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.660
for life, a double helix, and a human figure.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:37.620
“The arecibo message is an ambitious message….it's
an encyclopedia written in the language of

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.620
science.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.600
And while that's laudable to try and tell
the extraterrestrials a lot, I think it's

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.810
overly ambitious.”

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.390
Another problem with the Arecibo Message for
METI was the turnaround time.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:55.790
“The Arecibo message targeted a globular
cluster of stars called M13, 25,000 light

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.569
years from Earth.

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.720
That means any reply we get back will take
50,000 years.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.480
Surely we can do better than that.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.200
In our next round of transmissions, we're
getting three types of messages ready.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.680
One will describe basic chemical principles,
we'll send the periodic table of elements.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.480
The second will describe the human body.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:24.319
The third message will go on to describe something
about how we engage with one another, altruism.

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.590
As we design a message for extraterrestrials,
we need to ask what we and the extraterrestrials

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.000
have in common.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.120
Well, we have in common the universe itself.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.959
So when we look around the universe and try
to describe it, we start with what it's made

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.200
up of.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.290
Hydrogen and helium and carbon and oxygen
and phosphorus and all these 200+ chemical

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.709
elements.

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.320
Well that's something that scientists on another
world will know about too.”

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.099
So how do you translate this into a message
an alien would understand?

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:03.599
“We use a binary notation to show... each
chemical element, and then once we have created

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.280
a little box, by transmitting at three different
frequencies.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.290
One represented by black, one by white, and
one by red, the extraterrestrial gets a string

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.959
of numbers that they can then put into a 2D
array, and then stack that all together to

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.490
show the relationships that we see in our
periodic table of elements.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.680
As we target Proxima Centauri, the closest
star to Earth, it would take just four years

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.930
for our message to get there and another four
to get back, that means in a little over 8

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.889
years we can have a round trip exchange.

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.460
METI is currently moving forward with its
plan to send interstellar transmissions next

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.460
year.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.860
Their efforts to make contact raise questions
about whether we should send messages at all,

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.020
who should speak for Earth, and ultimately,
what this says about us.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.259
“When we send messages, our goal is to learn
if there are other intelligent beings out

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:03.339
there, but even more important than discovering
other life in the universe is what we learn

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:05.759
about ourselves in the process.

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:10.280
Does our science really map on to the way
the universe is structured?

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.499
Will an alien really see it?

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:17.089
Then, what can they tell us that we don't
already know?

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:23.169
By making contact with an alien civilization,
we can hold a mirror up to ourselves, to come

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:38.940
to see ourselves in a new way, and that is
the greatest impact of making contact.”
