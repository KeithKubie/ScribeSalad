00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.680
CGI is now commonplace in the world of movies.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.440
Everything from characters and buildings to
skies and entire cityscapes can be created

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.130
with computer-generated imagery.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.490
It's done for a variety of reasons - sometimes
simply because it looks better, other times

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.500
because it's cost-effective, and for a number
of other reasons too.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.710
Without the CGI applied, any movie that utilises
it looks very different, but certain movies

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.400
look totally unrecognisable - and that's what
this video is going to take a look at.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.239

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.510
Here are ten movies that look nothing like
you'd expect before CGI.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.510
The Avengers
In 2012's The Avengers, the titular superhero

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.510
team took on an army of aliens in New York
City.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.510
It will come as absolutely no surprise to
you to learn that the aliens in the movie

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.510
weren't real, but the majority of the battle
wasn't even filmed in New York.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.510
The main actors could only be in the Big Apple
together for a couple of days, so a majority

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.510
of the battle scenes in New York were actually
filmed in New Mexico using a green screen.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.510
So when you see Captain America, Thor and
company fighting an alien in NYC, you're actually

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.510
watching them taking swings at actors with
sensors on them in New Mexico!

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.510
Jurassic World
Now, it goes without saying that real dinosaurs

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.760
weren't used in 2015's Jurassic World - you
know, given that they've been extinct for

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.739
65 million years - but how some of the movie
looked before CGI was applied may still surprise

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:52.739
you.

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.160
In many scenes, the actors filming scenes
involving dinos had to pretend something was

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.160
there.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.629
In others - such as some involving velociraptors
- they actually had actors with motion sensors

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.019
on them as a point of reference.

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.280
Moreover, some of the scenery in the movie
was nowhere near as vivid or spectacular as

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.300
it was prior to CGI being applied to it.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.140
Gravity
You're probably already aware that 2013's

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.790
Gravity wasn't filmed in space.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.900
If you're not aware of that, it wasn't!

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.830
The majority of the scenes in space were filmed
in plain white rooms - and the space backgrounds

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.650
were applied using CGI later - but that's
not all that was CGI.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.990
The equipment that the astronauts were using
wasn't really there - even the small stuff.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.930
When the actors appeared to be turning knobs,
pressing buttons or holding onto handles,

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.810
they were actually just motioning in thin
air.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.210
Yup, even the gadgets they were using were
all computer-generated!

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.500
Life of Pi
2012's The Life of Pi sees the titular Pi

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.250
Patel spending most of the movie in a boat,
at sea, accompanied by a Bengal tiger named

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.250
Richard Parker.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.490
It may come as a surprise to you, therefore,
to learn that none of the movie was filmed

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.640
at sea and no real tigers were used in the
filming of the movie.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.380
The boat was on water, but it was in a studio
surrounded by green screens - and the tiger

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.860
was completely CGI.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.750
In most instances, there was nothing present
to represent the tiger.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.950
Although, for the scenes in which Pi physically
interacted with it - such as when it was sleeping

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.380
across his lap - a blue doll was used.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.599
The Wolf of Wall Street
2013's The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.989
last movies you'd ever think required CGI
- it's not as if it was a fantasy or sci-fi

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.019
movie that was full of weird creatures or
spectacular alien landscapes - but the fact

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.260
is it was actually teaming with CGI.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.769
The foreign locations the main characters
visited - such as Monaco - were created using

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.249
green screens, whilst even the areas surrounding
the beach houses they partied in were massively

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:33.599
enhanced by CGI.

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:41.069
No wonder the movie's budget was so inexplicably
high!

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.686
Captain America: Civil War
Like The Avengers before it on this list,

00:02:42.686 --> 00:02:47.349
the Marvel Cinematic Universe's flagship 2016
offering, Captain America: Civil War, heavily

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.049
utilised green screens for locations that
you might not think required it - such as

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.290
the airport scene for the epic battle between
Team Captain America and Team Iron Man.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.420
One scene in particular that looked very different
without CGI was that one in which Captain

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.069
America stops the helicopter with his bare
hands.

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.739
Not only is the entire surrounding scenery
produced via CGI, it's also filmed at near-ground-level

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.989
in a studio - and not on a rooftop at all.

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.769
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice
Another superhero movie that is obviously

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.290
absolutely littered with CGI is 2016's Batman
v Superman: Dawn of Justice.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.220
A lot of the backdrops - such as those in
Metropolis - were created using a green screen,

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.279
but there was a lot more to the CGI than that.

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:28.400
For example, when Batman was wearing his powered
armour to fight against Superman, a huge chunk

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.950
of that fight was Henry Cavill acting alongside
a stuntman with sensors all over his body

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.599
- there was no actual physical prop armour,
like Robert Downey Jr sometimes wears as Iron

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.019
Man, for example.

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.900
Godzilla
Like so many other characters and creatures

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.489
on this list, it goes without saying that
2014's Godzilla was created using CGI.

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.510
However, titular monster aside, there was
a lot more computer-generated imagery in the

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.370
movie that might actually surprise you.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.639
For example, in the scenes where the army
are on the coast attempting to attack the

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:59.180
monsters, not only are there no monsters,
there isn't actually a coast either!

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.370
It's just a green screen!

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.840
The sea, the battleships, the clouds, the
monsters and everything else in front of the

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.069
soldiers isn't really there.

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.419
Avatar
2009's Avatar is the highest-grossing movie

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:11.749
of all time, so you're probably familiar with
it.

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:15.459
You'll know it's based on the planet of Pandora
and that the alien species the Na'vi are the

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.920
movie's main stars - and you'll obviously
know that's all fictional - but that still

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.920
might not prepare you for what the movie looked
like without CGI.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.500
The spectacular scenery on Pandora probably
made you think the movie was at least filmed

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.110
in a jungle - but it wasn't.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.300
It was actually filmed in a very plain, boring
studio, with actors running around wearing

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.449
tight-fitting, customised helmets that had
a carbon fibre boom with a camera on the front

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.250
for facial recognition purposes.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.449
Suicide Squad
Although there are obviously some very unrealistic

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:46.340
and outright fantasy elements to 2016's Suicide
Squad movie, it's actually fairly grounded

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.150
in comparison to many of the more "out there"
superhero offerings - especially in relation

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.780
to its setting - so it may shock you to discover
that there was a lot of CGI in the movie.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.740
Take the scene in which Harley Quinn falls
from the helicopter for example.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.961
That's actually just Margot Robbie, standing
upright, with a whirring fan and a green screen

00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:02.961
behind her.

00:05:02.961 --> 00:05:37.199
There wasn't any falling of any kind involved!

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:41.220
Thanks for watching our video about ten movies
that look nothing like you'd expect before

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.220
CGI.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.389
Do you know of any other movies that look
very strange without CGI?
