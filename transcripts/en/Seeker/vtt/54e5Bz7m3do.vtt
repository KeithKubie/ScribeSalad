00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:08.330
Last year, scientist found 50, 1-million-year-old
footprints stuck in the mud! But how do we

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.000
know they weren't made yesterday by that neighbor
kid though?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.650

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.070
Howdy folks, Trace here for DNews. The ancient
footprints that British scientists found are

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.210
the earliest evidence of human habitation
outside of the African continent. They made

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.590
the discovery last year, and according to
a paper just published in PLOS One, "In many

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.780
cases the arch and front/back of the foot
can be identified and in one case the impression

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.730
of toes can be seen." This is a huge step
in human ancestor research -- 50 footprints,

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.500
guys! That's a lot!

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.559
When I read this, I thought about the Creation
Museum... see... last Tuesday during the Ken

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.730
Ham/Bill Nye Debate on Evolution -- Ham kept
repeating a phrase you hear a lot in evolution-denying

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.289
circles, "You can't know because you weren't
there." But we CAN, because OTHER things were

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:00.539
there.

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.319
The discovery of carbon dating earned Willard
Libby the 1960 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, because

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:13.009
with this new method, we can estimate the
ages of any organic thing! Yep! ANY! It's

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:19.119
all based on carbon-14, a naturally occurring
radioactive isotope created when cosmic rays

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.049
hit the air. It enters the food chain when
plants absorb -- and animals eat it. Then

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.529
it lodges itself in their bodies. As the sun
and atmosphere interact constantly, the number

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:35.819
of carbon-14 atoms in your body is the same
as in every other living thing. It's a constant!

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:40.229
Then, every 5,730 years, half of it will decay.

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.090
Using this knowledge, we can date bones of
mummies and Pompeiian victims to an estimated

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.079
age. Periods of solar and geologic activity,
however, could change how much carbon-14 was

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.840
in a specific sample. So, as scientists are
obsessed with corroboration and peer-review,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.169
they found more data to compare to their carbon
dating. Looking at the solar, atmospheric

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:09.050
and geologic data from tree rings, coral beds,
AND ice cores altogether -- we can accurately

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.489
date fossils to 60,000 years AND have other
data to back it up... But how do we get something

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.159
ONE MILLION years and older??

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:24.260
Well, that's not QUITE as simple, but still
possible. Using the same radiometric dating,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.980
scientists look at the layers of the Earth.
As you go deeper into the crust, the fossils

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.280
will have predictable levels of carbon-14
-- but once you get below where science is

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:39.280
confident of the EXACT year -- they look for
other isotopes with longer half-lives. Things

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.590
like uranium-238, uranium-235 and potassium-40
ARE all over in the dirt around the fossils.

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.250
So when they can't use the carbon-14, they
look at the geologic layer and can determine

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.269
when that creature died. Additionally, scientists
have studied the evolution of various plants

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.099
and animals so when other plants and tracks
are found in the same area as a fossil they

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.859
can date it from that as well. All these different
methods can pinpoint a specific point in time,

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.819
and the data has been predictable and consistent.
Thus, there is very little reason for a scientist

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.469
to question whether a fossil found at a specific
depth, is a specific AGE.

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:16.019
In this case, these 50 footprints are thought
to be from a pre-human pre-neanderthal relative

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.079
called Homo antecessor, or perhaps an Homo
heidelbergensis -- They're close to 800,000

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.370
years old and belonged to a group of people
ranging from children to teenagers. They wore

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.420
similar shoe sizes to modern humans and stood
as tall as five-foot six (1.67m) They're not

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.959
the oldest footprints discovered, not by a
long shot. In Kenya there are 1.5 million-year-old

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.370
prints and in Tanzania they've found some
which are 3.5 million years old! It's like

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.579
a family foot tree!... Thing. Yeah, let's
not do that.
