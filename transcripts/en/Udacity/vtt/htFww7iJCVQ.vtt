00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.895
Now let's take a look at how
the initiator and responder and

00:00:03.895 --> 00:00:06.360
authenticate that key exchange.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.630
Both the initiator and

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.240
responder compute a hash value
using a pseudorandom function.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.066
And the input key is the real secret,
which is based on their pre-shared

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:21.030
key and the nonce values
that they have exchanged.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.820
The input block data contains the
information that they have exchanged,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.110
such as the public components
the Diffie-Hellman key exchange,

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.840
the cookies, the crypto
algorithms that they offer, and

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.870
the identity of the initiator and
responder.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.460
Each party can verify the hash value
computed by the other because the hash

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.660
values are based on a pre-shared key,
and the information they just exchanged.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.220
Therefore, these hash values can
authenticate both parties identities and

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.290
the data that they have just exchanged.
