&gt;&gt; Eni Jucja: Ladies
and gentlemen,

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.970
if I could please
have your attention

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.880
for the national anthem
of the Republic of Albania

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.630
and the national anthem of
the United States of America.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.910
And the anthems will be
performed by Lindita Lole.

te lidhim besen per shpetim.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:21.600
Prej lufte vec ai largohet,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:59.880

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.350
[Singing] Oh say can you see
by the dawn's early light,

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:38.970
what so proudly we hailed at
the twilight's last gleaming.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:47.240
Whose broad stripes
and bright stars,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:55.170
through the perilous fight, o'er
the ramparts we watched were

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:17.190
so gallantly streaming?

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.860
And the rocket's red glare,
the bombs bursting in air,

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.310
gave proof through the night

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:38.430
that our flag was
still there Oh,

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:59.870
say does that star-spangled
banner yet wave, o'er the land

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.210
of the free and the
home of the brave!

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.010

thank you, thank you.

Honorable--

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.490
Honorable Minister Bushati,

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.900
Honorable Congressman
[Inaudible],

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:05.640
Honorable Congressman Engel,
coming also Senator Gary Peters,

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.350
Deputy Assistant
Secretary Hoyt Yee,

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.320
acting Deputy Librarian
[Inaudible],

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.800
Excellency ambassadors,
dear Albanian community,

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.700
dear colleagues of the
embassy of Albania,

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.930
let me wish happy
Albanian National Day

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.330
and Happy Armed Forces.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.500
I use every chance to
present Albania as a new

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.830
and modern country and
also as one of the oldest

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.640
and ancient nations in Europe.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:48.720
Today, we have a great chance to
see how this actually is true.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.930
The building of the Library of
Congress has beautiful pieces

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.600
of Albania and has a very
dedicated Albanian corner.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.460
As of now, it will also
contain one of the jewelries

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.910
of Albanian heritage,
the Codex of Berat.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.610
We meet very often together
and I'm so happy I see

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.010
so many friends and
colleagues here,

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.650
so but I will leave the floor

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.440
to all our honorable
guests for their speeches.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.180
If I can have the
attention, Minister Bushati,

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.420
Deputy Assistant
Secretary, Congressman Engel,

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.130
I would really be honored

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:33.510
if I can invite you
all here on the floor.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:42.040

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.340
Deputy Assistant Hoyt Yee.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.370
&gt;&gt; Rep. Eliot Engel:
Good afternoon,

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.670
I'm Congressman Eliot
Engel of New York,

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.580
I am the ranking
member on the house

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.230
of foreign affairs committee,
and I've had a love affair

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:03.400
with Albania since I first
went there back in 1993.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.070
I've been there many
times since,

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.000
probably about 15
or 20 times since.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.330
And I can tell you, you
can go all around the world

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.070
and visit all the countries
and all the continents,

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.650
and people will never be
more friendly to Americans

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.390
than the Albanian people.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.640
And I know I've said
this many times,

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.090
and many times people
have agreed with me.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:31.080
You know it's really a very
important story that Albania

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:35.060
after World War II had
a repressive government

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.060
and a government that
really sold the people

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.170
on anti-Americanism and it
was a communist government.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.950
And what was really
very interesting to me

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:50.470
when I first came to Albania,
again in 1993, was it was clear

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.260
to me that the Albanian
people bought none of it.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.540
They didn't believe any of it.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.370
And that again, despite
all these things,

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.950
the Albanian people remained
as friendly to American people

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.810
as any place in the world.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:09.980
And finally, let me say the
wonderful Albanian Diaspora we

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:14.210
have here in the United States,
people from Albanian but also

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.830
from Kosovo and also from
Macedonia and Montenegro,

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:23.040
they all have contributed
so much to American culture

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.710
and the American opportunity
that it really does me well

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.460
and of course in my home
district in New York,

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.570
we have many, many Albanian
Americans and I have many,

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:35.270
many Albanian friends,
including our ambassador here.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.320
And so we just had a
flag raising in Yonkers,

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.800
New York a few days
ago, 105th anniversary

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.100
of Albanian independence.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.040
We had a nice flag raising.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:49.350
And so I want to be here
and be part of this,

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.100
it means a great deal to me.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.450
Because in all the times
I've been to Albania,

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:57.530
each time I come it gets
better and better and better.

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:01.640
It's a budding democracy,
it's a member of NATO,

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.360
it's just making
so much progress.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.380
And working together, our two
countries, we will continue

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.060
to make progress not only
in terms of friendship

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.180
between Albania and the
United States, but in terms

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.420
of Albania's place in the
world, again, as a strong ally.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.640
And we're going to keep
fighting to get Albania

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.440
into the European Union,
where Albania belongs.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.000
So I'm very happy to say

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.980
that this is a great
celebration right here

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.280
in this wonderful building.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.670
This is my 29th year in
congress, and the work

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:37.260
that I've done with Albania has
been among the most treasured

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.560
work that I've done.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.510
So thank you, "faleminderit."

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:47.170
[ Applause ]

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.400
&gt;&gt; Eni Jucja: You can join
us, congressman, senator.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.510
Yeah, we announced that
you would be coming.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.120
&gt;&gt; Sen. Gary Peters: Well,
good morning everyone.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.420
It is wonderful to be here.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.690
I'm US Senator Gary Peters,
representing the great state

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.420
of Michigan, which
is a wonderful honor.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.230
But it is just as equal an honor

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:10.470
to really represent an
incredibly vibrant Albanian

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.830
American community in
the greater Detroit area.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.420
We're blessed with one of
the largest communities,

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.700
I think second only to New
York, Eliot, in Michigan,

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.000
so I've had the opportunity

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.040
to work closely with
that community.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.340
And the one thing I
learned in dealing

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.210
with Albanian Americans is
that once you go to an event,

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.370
you are part of the family
from that point forward.

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:34.690
You have just incredible
warmth, incredible hospitality,

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:38.800
and just a genuine
friendship that is very unique.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.290
There are other communities that
are like that, but I will say

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:42.640
from my experience
there's nothing

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.820
like the Albanian
American community.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.220
Although I don't believe I
have any bloodline to Albania,

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.290
I believe that I am
part Albanian now

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.080
because of all the work
with the community.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.290
I've had the privilege of
working with Eliot Engel here,

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:56.720
it's great to see you, Eliot.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.170
We actually had a
chance to travel together

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:01.180
to both Albania and Kosovo.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.520
We cut the ribbon for
the wonderful highway

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.080
that connects the two
countries as well at that time.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.850
Certainly Eliot has been
a champion for many years

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.920
as a co-chair of the
Albanian Caucus there.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.710
And I also learned
traveling with Eliot,

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:16.420
he's like a rock
star in Albania, too.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.670
It was amazing the attention
from all the work that you do,

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:24.160
it's a tribute to his
passion for the relationship

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.880
between our two countries.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.600
I took the work, I was in the
Albanian caucus with Eliot

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.690
in the House, and then
when I came to the Senate,

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.390
I found that they didn't have an
Albanian caucus in the Senate.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.360
I go okay, the Senate's got
a lot of good things going,

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.220
but the fact that it doesn't
have a caucus, that's a problem.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:44.890
So we changed that, we now have
an Albanian American caucus

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:46.250
in the United States Senate.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:50.430
I'm a co-chair with Senator
Ernst from Iowa, the republicans

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:51.730
and democrats coming together.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:54.410
We hope that that continues to
be a strong, bipartisan caucus

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:57.710
to make sure we educate our
follow members in the US Senate

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:59.580
as to how important
this relationship is

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.100
and when you have an
important relationship,

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.370
you have to keep working at
that relationship to make sure

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.960
that it continues to
get stronger and better.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.930
And it's clear that
the relationship

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.330
between our two countries
is strong.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.920
I see a number of folks
here from the military.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.030
When the US military goes into
harm's way and we're looking

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:21.200
for allies to assist us in those
efforts, Albania is always one

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.350
of the first countries that
raises its hand and says,

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.290
"We will be there, we will fight
for democracy, we will fight

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.810
for freedom, we will
fight for liberty."

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:32.510
Thank you to the Albanians all
across the world for what you do

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:34.720
for the cause of
liberty and freedom.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.070
And I've seen that with other
groups that I've had the chance

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:40.120
to work with, including a
number of Iranian exiles

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.020
who were finding a difficult
place and didn't know

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.020
where to live and where to land,
and it was to the graciousness

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.500
of the Albanian community
and the Albanian people

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.450
that brought them into Albania

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:53.200
to give them a home
that is secure.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.570
So thank you for letting
me come here to join

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:59.120
in this great celebration
for this day, for Albania

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.310
and for the Albanian
people across the country,

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:03.750
know you have a friend in
me and you're having more

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.310
and more friends each and
every day in the US Senate.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:08.310
I'm confident that
this great relationship

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.260
between our two great countries
will only become stronger

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.230
and more vibrant
in the years ahead.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.510
Thank you and congratulations.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:29.280
&gt;&gt; Hoyt Brian Yee: Ladies and
gentlemen, members of Congress,

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.740
my name is Hoyt Yee, I'm
from the state department.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.490
It's a great honor
to be here today.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.230
I want to thank all
of you for coming.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:40.270
I want to thank the members
of Congress and the librarian

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:44.350
from the Library of Congress
for allowing us to be here

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:49.010
in this beautiful member's room
of the Thomas Jefferson building

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:52.040
to celebrate this
important occasion.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:56.320
It's really a great honor
to, along with my friends

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:01.310
from the Senate and House of
Representatives, to celebrate

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:05.760
with you this important
day, to express on behalf

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.230
of my government and
the American people,

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.510
our very best wishes
to the Albanian people.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:19.280
This is indeed an occasion
for first, a celebration,

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.320
celebrating 105 years
of your independence,

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:28.470
but also at least a quarter
century of successful

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:33.240
and fruitful cooperation with
the United States in a dynamic

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:37.280
and growing stronger
every day friendship

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.530
between the United
States and Albania.

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:42.350
There's much to celebrate.

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:46.220
Your progress towards
integration with Europe,

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:49.600
your joining the European
Union, to look forward

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.560
to your joining NATO, which
you've already achieved.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.610
But also setting an
example for the region

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:02.010
of looking forward,
not backwards.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:06.880
Of building a future for your
young people with opportunity,

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:11.770
with jobs, with the prospects
of yet better things to come.

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:13.720
It's appropriate that we're

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:18.280
in the Thomas Jefferson building
celebrating this special day.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:23.510
Thomas Jefferson wrote in a
letter to John Adams in 1816,

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.470
"I like the dreams
of the future better

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:27.480
than the history of the past."

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:31.870
And I think we can celebrate
with you, the people of Albania,

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:34.260
your success in looking forward

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.650
and in building this
better future.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:39.840
We hope that the United
States will continue,

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.710
we expect that we
will, we promise you

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:45.750
that we will continue working
with you to realize this dream

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:49.720
of a better future, with even
closer integration with Europe,

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:54.380
even more security within NATO,
with stronger rule of law,

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:59.240
democratic institutions,
prospects for your young people.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.260
This is also an occasion
for expressing gratitude.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:06.580
And I want to join my colleagues
in expressing our gratitude

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.330
for what Albania has done
for the United States,

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:13.350
the NATO alliance, the
region, for Europe,

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:15.970
for our 25 year friendship.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.270
Our political, economic,

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:21.940
and people to people ties are
growing stronger every day.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:26.420
And we're deeply grateful to
Albania for the contributions

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.540
to our shared security
and prosperity.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:34.250
To NATO missions in
Afghanistan, Kosovo, and Latvia.

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:36.140
But also as a close partner

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.830
in the global coalition
to defeat ISIS.

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:44.170
Albania is indeed an example
for the region as a center

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.910
of stability and
regional cooperation.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:50.980
We welcome Albania's regional
leadership in the suffer

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.090
of countering trans-national
threats, such as terrorism

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:56.310
and violent extremism.

00:16:56.310 --> 00:17:00.070
And domestically, internally,
Albania's also set an example

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:01.580
for countries in
the region trying

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.670
to achieve the same dream.

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:08.590
With the passage of sweeping
constitutional amendments last

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:12.830
year advancing judicial reform.

00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:15.300
These types of reforms
will bring you closer

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:20.000
to Europe Union, it will
attract more foreign investment.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.160
Such reform underscores a
shared value that we have,

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.500
our two countries, that
a strong partner is one

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.720
in with there is judicial
independence guided by the rule

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:38.030
of law, with strong democratic
institutions firmly in place.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:41.250
Finally, this is an occasion
for reaffirming commitments.

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:43.250
And I want to reaffirm the
United States' commitment

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.630
to Albania.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.900
The Secretary Tillerson wrote
in his statement on the occasion

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:52.010
of your national day, "Albania
is a valued friend and ally,

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.670
and the United States
looks forward

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.080
to your continued progress
towards greater Eur-Atlantic

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.700
integration and EU membership."

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:02.430
So thank you again for your
friendship and partnership

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:05.040
to the United States
throughout the years.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.270
Mr. Minister, I took note of
your comments yesterday saying

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:12.940
that you wanted to see even
more US presence in the Balkans.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.260
And I just want to say I share
with you a saying we have

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.190
in the United States, "Be
careful what you wish for,

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:20.370
because you might just get it."

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.540
Mr. Minister, we are
present in the Balkans,

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.770
we intend to continue to provide
our assistance, our support,

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:31.020
good diplomacy, trade,
commerce, shared security,

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.910
shared responsibility.

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:37.290
We look forward to continuing
to deepen these ties,

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:38.970
which the next 25
years of friendship

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:42.300
and close cooperation
will surely bring.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.850
Finally, just to say,
"Gezuar Diten e Pavaresise."

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:49.510
Thank you.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:56.040
[ Applause ]

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.700
&gt;&gt; H.E. Ditmir Bushati:
Good afternoon, dear members

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.630
of Congress, dear [inaudible],
[inaudible], dear Hoyt.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:08.290
I would like to start by
thanking you all for being here,

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:10.550
I wish you all a
Happy Independence

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:11.850
and Armed Force day.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:17.080
To me personally, this is a
unique occasion in the sense

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.270
that we represent a
fragment of our culture

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:23.580
to the greatest library
in the world.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.390
As Albanians worldwide
celebrated our Independence

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:31.200
and Armed Force day,
an independence

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.380
which would have not been
possible without the role

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:39.720
of United States of America for
which we are forever grateful.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:43.060
Today, US and Albania are allies

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.740
and have a strategic
partnership.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:49.010
Our partnership is based
on common interest,

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:52.380
similar viewpoints of
security in Europe,

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.690
and the trans-Atlantic
community,

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:57.630
shared values and beliefs.

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:01.730
Even though our democratic
institutions have shorter life

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:03.780
than the American institutions

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:08.120
and even though our democratic
culture is less robust

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:12.220
than the American one,
our shared values center

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:17.440
around openness, tolerance,
rule of law, and justice.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:23.520
This legacy of our nation is the
first reason we celebrate today.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.290
What a better story to
demonstrate these values

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:30.220
than the purple Codex of
Berat that are becoming part

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.710
of digital archive
of the library today

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:37.280
and part of UNESCO protected.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.710
Created in the sixth
century before Christ,

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:45.000
the Codex are now part of
world heritage and starting

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.320
from today will be
part of the Congress

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.650
of Library [inaudible]
work of Albanian diplomat

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:54.460
and intellectual [inaudible]

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:58.510
and other luminaries
of Albanian Diaspora.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:03.370
These Codex show that despite
the short and precarious life

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:06.610
of the Albanian state
and state institutions,

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:09.070
the Albanian culture
and its openness

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:14.850
to the Western civilization has
been longer and well documented.

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:20.230
This is something to celebrate
and be deeply grateful today.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:23.950
The second thing I would like
to celebrate today is the

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:28.560
deep-seated partnership and
strong ties between Albania

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.270
and the United States
of America.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:35.430
They do go back to our
history of state formation.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.820
And extend to today's
US contribution

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.920
to Albanian path
of democratization.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.990
The US has played a
strong role in one

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:47.850
of our key domestic reforms
in the past two years,

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:51.030
which is reform in
the judiciary sector.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:55.520
Alongside the EU member states,
the United States is helping

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.750
with the implementation of
this comprehensive reform,

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:01.140
which has repelling
effect in a number

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.700
of other sectors,
not less the economy.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:08.820
United States are present in
the Western Balkans and Albania

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.310
in particular through
their support

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.850
in strengthening
the rule of law.

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:17.790
We want this engagement to
continue, as we strongly believe

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:21.310
that if Albanian institutions
are resilient and rule

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:24.660
of law is strong, we
can contribute more

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:28.740
and in a more qualitative
way to stability and peace

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:33.130
in Western Balkans and more
broadly, to security in Europe

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:36.330
and the trans-Atlantic
community.

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:41.040
Today, while is the day
of Albanian Armed Forces,

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.510
this is also an occasion

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:46.690
to celebrate Albania's
contribution to security.

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.070
Even though a small country,

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.840
Albania stands alongside
the United States

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.500
in the joined fight against
terrorism, radicalization,

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.830
and violent extremism.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.870
Our specific history

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:04.890
of religious tolerance is a
special asset which we put

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:07.070
in the service of prevention

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:10.430
of these phenomena
and global threats.

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:15.430
The US can also play a strong
role in the economic development

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:20.020
in Albania by permitting
connectivity, investing more

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:24.440
in strategic sectors, such as
infrastructure, energy, tourism,

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:29.380
and agriculture, we are creating
a more positive environment

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:32.280
for the US to be more
present in the region

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.170
and in Albania in particular.

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:38.320
Albanian Diaspora is
now a success story

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.260
of our two nations'
relationship.

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:45.150
The Albanian community in
United States plays a vital role

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:47.230
in the Albanian state formation

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:50.350
and in the economic
development of our country.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:54.190
But they also contribute
to the economic, cultural,

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:57.580
and political life
of the US, too.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:01.850
A third reason to celebrate
today is how far Albania

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:03.910
and Albanians have come.

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:06.780
From a small, weak,
and dependent state

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:10.600
in its early days,
to an isolated regime

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.710
in the post-communist
years to [inaudible] years

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:18.370
of post-communism married
by corruption crime

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:23.340
and informality, not to mention
weak social cohesion and trust,

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:26.980
Albania is now moving
ahead and thriving amidst

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:29.490
and against many challenges.

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:32.840
I don't want to sound
overly optimistic,

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.240
but the overarching
reforms we have undertaken,

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:41.110
the economic potential of our
country, and most importantly,

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:44.870
the energy, the drive, and the
[inaudible] of young people

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:48.550
in Albania makes me
believe in the future ahead.

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:54.810
The enthusiasm and the
interest in politics.

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:57.700
The engagement of Albanian
students to do part

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:02.630
in the Albanian day in DC
this week confirm my faith

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:06.670
that we will be able to write
a better story together.

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:09.980
I hope and believe that
our friends and allies,

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:13.400
the United States, will
be part of that story.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.870
Thank you again for
the warm welcome

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:20.510
and Happy Independence Day,
"Gezuar Diten e Pavaresise."

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:29.160
[ Applause ]

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.300
&gt;&gt; H.E. Floreta Faber: Now I
would like to invite everyone

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.980
to enjoy the food and
the drinks and the party.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.280
Thank you!

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.080
Thank you for being here.
