[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.274 --> 00:00:05.190
MARJAI ROBERTS: Hi, my
name is Marjai Roberts,

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.250
welcome to Google.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.520
I'm an advertising
strategist in SMB sales.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.430
I'm here, honored and excited
to be hosting producer Will

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.440
Packer at Google here in
our Mountain View office.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.750
We're here to talk
about his new comedy,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.090
premiering on NBC,
called "Truth Be Told."

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.120
So I'll give some accolades
because you've got a lot here,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.140
so I'll just run down
the list a little bit.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.370
WILL PACKER: Give a lot,
don't give a little.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.790
MARJAI ROBERTS: I'll
give a lot back.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:28.780
WILL PACKER: Take your
time on the accolades part.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.120
MARJAI ROBERTS: I'll
give a lot, cool--

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.494
WILL PACKER: Don't
sell me short.

00:00:31.494 --> 00:00:33.870
MARJAI ROBERTS: I want
it all, I want it all.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.930
Producer Will Packer
has established himself

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.550
as one of Hollywood's
box office hit makers

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.480
with several of his films
opening number one at the box

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.440
office, including "Stomp
the Yard," "Ride Along,"

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.700
"Think Like a Man," and
most recently my favorite,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.280
"Straight Outta Compton."

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.440
He currently develops
his new projects

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.610
under his company, Will
Packer Productions.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.900
He was a founder of the
Atlanta-based Rainforest Films

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.250
and is a co-founder of Bounce
TV, a broadcast network

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.010
geared towards
African-American households.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.500
In 2014, he became one of the
only African-American producers

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.060
to have seven films
debut at number one

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.020
during opening weekend.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.940
So that's no small
feat, of course.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.574
WILL PACKER: Thank you.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:16.740
MARJAI ROBERTS: I could go
on, but you guys probably

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.000
have seen a lot of Will
Packer produced films,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.780
box office hits like "Takers,"
"This Christmas," "Obsessed,"

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.230
"No Good Deed," and
"The Wedding Ringer."

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.290
Will has continued to expand the
boundaries of what filmmakers

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.690
can achieve in creating a
viable space for content that

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.990
speaks to a diverse community.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.880
So among Will's
many projects, Will

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.270
is here to talk to us about his
NBC comedy, "Truth Be Told,"

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.040
premiering October
16th, starring

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.000
Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Tone Bell,
Vanessa Lachey and Bresha Webb.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.290
The new series is about two
diverse couples and best friend

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.400
neighbors living life.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.730
They talk about all topics, not
off limits, from race to sex

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.957
to children and they
basically keep it real.

00:01:59.957 --> 00:02:02.040
WILL PACKER: Not necessarily
all related together.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.560
MARJAI ROBERTS: Oh
no, not together.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.601
WILL PACKER: The order
you said it in felt weird.

00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:07.140
But that's all
right, keep going.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.710
MARJAI ROBERTS: No problem.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.918
And basically they keep it
real on the subject matter

00:02:09.918 --> 00:02:12.330
they cover so it's
a really cool show.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.070
So with that, I wanted to
welcome Will Packer to Google

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.712
today.

00:02:15.712 --> 00:02:17.420
WILL PACKER: Glad to
be here, absolutely.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.430
[AUDIENCE APPLAUSE]

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.930
What's up?

00:02:20.815 --> 00:02:21.690
MARJAI ROBERTS: Cool.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.694
So welcome to Google.

00:02:23.694 --> 00:02:25.110
I'm from Atlanta
too so I'm really

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.850
excited to be hosting you.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:26.891
WILL PACKER: I love that.

00:02:26.891 --> 00:02:28.050
We have Google in Atlanta

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.630
MARJAI ROBERTS: Nice.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.895
Yes, Midtown.

00:02:28.895 --> 00:02:30.170
WILL PACKER: How long have
you been here with Google?

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.200
MARJAI ROBERTS: I've
been here for about four

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.840
and a half years.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.170
WILL PACKER: Yeah?

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.420
MARJAI ROBERTS: Yeah.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.050
WILL PACKER: You like it?

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.630
MARJAI ROBERTS: I do.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.730
WILL PACKER: Answer
correctly now,

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.900
I figure a lot of Google
people are watching.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.850
MARJAI ROBERTS: It's
a great company--

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:37.110
WILL PACKER: There you go.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.310
MARJAI ROBERTS: --it's awesome.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.920
WILL PACKER: You're welcome.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.020
I gave you that one,
that's called a layup.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.180
MARJAI ROBERTS: Yeah.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.680
Right.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.789
Thank you.

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:43.330
Now, a group of
Googlers had a chance

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.370
to watch "Truth Be
Told" yesterday, we

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.330
really all liked it.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.277
And wanted to start
off by asking,

00:02:50.277 --> 00:02:52.360
can you tell us a little
bit about "Truth Be Told"

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.390
and where the title came from?

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.100
WILL PACKER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.641
So like you said,
it's a show on NBC,

00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:58.910
it's a sitcom and
premieres October 16th

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.730
and it's about
these two couples.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.340
And Mark-Paul Gosselaar
plays our character, Mitch,

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.010
and he's married to
a wonderful woman who

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.800
happens to be of Asian descent,
played by Vanessa Lachey.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.760
His best friend is
played by Tone Bell, who

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.420
happens to be a black guy who's
married to a black woman named

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.980
Bresha Webb.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.000
And I keep bringing up
the races of everybody

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.136
because it's kind of
organic to the show

00:03:19.136 --> 00:03:20.260
the fact that it's diverse.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.364
It's not one of these shows that
is diverse for diversity's sake

00:03:23.364 --> 00:03:25.030
or because somebody
said, you know what?

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.430
We need, like,
somebody of color.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.090
Let's put a black
dude in this role

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.780
or put an Asian
guy in that role.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.410
It literally is based on the
creator, DJ Nash's, life.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.435
And in his real life
his wife is Asian,

00:03:35.435 --> 00:03:38.100
his best friend is
black, and oftentimes

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.970
in his core group of friends,
he's the only white dude.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.120
He told me that
story and I loved it.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.230
I was like, wait a minute.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.690
You're the only white guy
in your friend circle?

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:47.590
I love that.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.570
Welcome to my world, now
you see how it feels,

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.760
you're the minority.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.960
And it gives him such an
interesting perspective

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.690
because in our show we
have this group of friends

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.000
and they all bring their
own preconceived notions,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.660
and perceptions, and upbringings
to the various topics

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.000
that we discuss on the show,
and we see it all play out.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.250
The title, "Truth Be Told,"
is really appropriate

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.280
because in real life when
you interact-- and of course,

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.770
this is Google,
so you guys know--

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.510
everybody now is connected.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.230
And we're connected in ways
that we weren't 10 years ago.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.860
And so you're
interacting with people

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.740
that are completely
outside your particular

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.745
demographic-- I don't care
if it's like people that

00:04:24.745 --> 00:04:26.637
live around you, look
like you, worship

00:04:26.637 --> 00:04:28.220
or believe in the
things you believe--

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.380
like you're talking to
everybody on any given

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.170
day through social media
and various networks.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.420
So it means that when you
are on those social networks

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.860
oftentimes you're
brutally honest.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.880
And when somebody says,
OK, truth be told,

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.680
you know you just
prepare yourself

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.240
because whatever
comes next is going

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.770
to brutally honest, is
not going to be filtered,

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.850
and that's how we
interact with real people.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.808
And so that's an appropriate
title for our show

00:04:50.808 --> 00:04:53.325
because this is a group of
four actual real friends

00:04:53.325 --> 00:04:55.970
who organically
talk about things

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.075
in an unfiltered kind of way,
the way that real people do.

00:04:59.075 --> 00:05:00.950
MARJAI ROBERTS: Yeah,
I definitely like that.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.910
So what shaped your interest
in doing a TV project?

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.562
I know you started a lot in
film, what attracted you to TV?

00:05:07.562 --> 00:05:09.020
WILL PACKER: I love
TV because it's

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.146
a different connection
with audiences

00:05:11.146 --> 00:05:12.270
that you're able to foster.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.490
So with the feature film-- even
the greatest feature film--

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.340
you go in and it's
an hour and a half,

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.180
two hour, two
hour-plus experience,

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.537
and for the most part,
it can stay with you

00:05:21.537 --> 00:05:23.120
but when you leave
the theater, you've

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.170
left that film in the theater.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.990
And until you do
another version of it,

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.120
you do a sequel
or you revisit it,

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.750
for the most part
that content is

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.100
meant to be encapsulated in
that period of time and be over.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.280
Whereas with television,
you are intended

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.340
to invest in these characters
over the long term,

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.173
I really liked that.

00:05:41.173 --> 00:05:43.370
As a creative filmmaker,
I liked the idea

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.900
of being a part of a process
that creates characters

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.360
that allows viewers to take the
journey over and over again.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.930
So obviously the television
landscape is changing rapidly

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.330
now and the way people consume
television is changing,

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.370
but people still look for
that organic investment

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.010
with real characters,
people that they can really

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.490
get to know and really
get invested in.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.410
MARJAI ROBERTS:
Agreed, definitely.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.780
So in the first episode, you
cover a lot of subject matter.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.750
You cover the "n"
word, you cover

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.390
unconscious bias,
choosing baby sitters

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.220
and making sure
they're not porn stars.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.960
WILL PACKER: Yeah,
there's that, absolutely.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.220
Always essential.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.590
MARJAI ROBERTS: Exactly.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.419
Can you give us a hint
about other topics

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:24.210
that will be covered
throughout the season?

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.170
WILL PACKER: Yeah--
the fun of the show

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.490
is that you take a really
close knit group of friends

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.847
who talk about things that real
friends talk about and don't

00:06:31.847 --> 00:06:32.680
have to filter them.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:39.540
So on the show, there's
things from when

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.160
do you talk to your
kids about religion.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.420
On our show, you have one
couple that is devout Christian,

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.920
and the other couple
who is anything but.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.587
And the daughter
comes back from school

00:06:51.587 --> 00:06:53.170
and asks a question
about what is God?

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.820
And who is God?

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.236
And what does He
or She look like?

00:06:55.236 --> 00:06:58.780
And the couples have fun with
their own perspectives on that.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.810
There is a lot of talk
about things that--

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.510
like you talked about
unconscious bias?-- well,

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:11.820
there is an episode where our
character played by Tone Bell,

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.090
who's the black guy, thinks that
a restaurant owner is racist.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.260
And he thinks that an
incident has happened

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.000
that was biased against
him because he was black,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
that he comes out and he's so
mad about it, and it turns out,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.540
the guy really wasn't racist.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.140
But our white guy,
Mitch, is caught

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.610
in a, how do I tell my black
best friend that it wasn't

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.260
racist when he really, really
thinks it was, but he was wrong

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
and I don't want to
come off the wrong way?

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.480
So it's like, well, I think,
no, dammit, he's racist.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.072
OK?

00:07:36.072 --> 00:07:37.280
Now you gonna back me, right?

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.130
White guy, white guilt,
white privilege, right?

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.310
And what's the white guy
gonna say in that moment?

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:46.620
So it's fun to have those--
some awkward, some poignant,

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.380
but always provocative
and always real subjects.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.180
MARJAI ROBERTS:
Definitely, definitely.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.100
So you mentioned
there's a clear example

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.410
of unconscious bias
at the beginning,

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:01.550
in the pilot with the
valet, expressing something

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:02.770
related to unconscious bias.

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:05.800
And here at Google, we
do a lot of training

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.930
and it's a big initiative here
on training, and highlighting,

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.700
and recognizing unconscious
bias in the workplace.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.492
So it sounds like--

00:08:13.492 --> 00:08:16.075
WILL PACKER: And is there a lot
of unconscious bias at Google?

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.720
MARJAI ROBERTS: There's a lot
of unconscious bias everywhere,

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.080
I think--

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:18.440
WILL PACKER: That's
a good answer,

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.320
you're absolutely right.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:19.760
Because--

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.360
MARJAI ROBERTS: --so
it's definitely something

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.600
that we really have to recognize
so that we can actually

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.010
change it.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.630
WILL PACKER: And oftentimes,
by the very definition of it,

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:25.430
it's not intentional.

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:26.080
MARJAI ROBERTS:
Exactly, not at all.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.246
WILL PACKER: And so, you
were referencing the pilot,

00:08:28.246 --> 00:08:31.326
in our pilot episode, it's
something as simple-- first

00:08:31.326 --> 00:08:33.700
of all, the Mitch character
played by Mark-Paul Gosselaar

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.020
is somebody who-- and
we all know somebody

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:40.549
like this-- he has
this never-ending quest

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:42.299
to make everything
right in the world.

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:43.820
And he wants
everything to be fair,

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.200
and everybody be treated
fairly, and if he

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.700
thinks something is wrong, he's
got to stand up and stand up

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:49.880
for justice.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.579
And he's got this need for
that, he can't turn it off,

00:08:52.579 --> 00:08:54.870
and sometimes it's great,
it's always well-intentioned,

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.420
and sometimes it ends horribly.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:00.650
And in the pilot episode, as
simple as the guys coming out

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:03.580
of a restaurant and they ask
for their car from vallet-- now

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.300
Russell, the black
guy, has driven--

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.450
and it's a nice
Porsche that pulls up

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.320
and the valet immediately
gives the keys to Mitch.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.450
And Mitch goes, why did
you give the keys to me?

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:13.500
I know why you did.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.840
You did because you didn't think
that this black guy was driving

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.610
this fancy car and I
have a problem with that,

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:18.580
I'm going to stand up for it.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.621
And Russell's going, dude,
it's not that serious.

00:09:20.621 --> 00:09:22.490
It's a valet stand,
it's not Selma,

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.300
let's just go and
get in the car.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.660
And literally, Mitch
will not let it go

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.110
and the valet guy
says, no I actually

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.802
didn't give you
the keys because I

00:09:31.802 --> 00:09:33.760
didn't think the black
guy could drive the car,

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.490
I gave you keys because
there's a John Mayer CD

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:36.440
playing in the car.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.520
And Mitch goes, you're
absolutely right,

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.180
that was my CD and this is
his car but you're right.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.748
He, either way, whether
it was because he thought

00:09:44.748 --> 00:09:46.956
he had some preconceived
notion about the type of car

00:09:46.956 --> 00:09:49.900
that a black dude would
drive or the type of music

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.680
that a black guy
might listen to,

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.370
there is a little bit of
an unconscious bias there,

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:55.970
and it affects us
in everything we do.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.925
Race is just a part of us,
just a part of us as humans

00:09:58.925 --> 00:10:01.050
and the way we relate and
interact with each other.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:04.290
So this is a good opportunity
to bring some levity to it.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.555
Obviously, there have been
some really, really heavy

00:10:07.555 --> 00:10:09.700
and serious
situations around race

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.330
that have happened very
recently in our country

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:14.500
and around the world.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.929
But I think that if
you can talk about it

00:10:16.929 --> 00:10:18.970
and bring some levity to
it-- the important thing

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:20.990
is that the conversation
is happening.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.697
So when you tell
me that Google's

00:10:22.697 --> 00:10:24.780
having those conversations
about unconscious bias,

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.692
I applaud that tremendously
because the first key is

00:10:27.692 --> 00:10:28.400
talking about it.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.690
If we're not talking about
it, if it's something

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:31.340
we're pretending like
it doesn't exist,

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.520
and we're sweeping
it under the rug,

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.300
all we're doing is
fostering things that

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.270
ultimately could be negative.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.080
MARJAI ROBERTS:
Definitely agree.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:38.580
And--

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:38.680
WILL PACKER: That
was a good answer,

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.971
we should stop right now
because that's the best I got,

00:10:40.971 --> 00:10:43.272
it's downhill from here,
guys, just going to tell you.

00:10:43.272 --> 00:10:44.730
MARJAI ROBERTS: I
definitely agree.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.677
That's one thing
I loved, that it

00:10:47.677 --> 00:10:50.830
makes the show a lot more
accessible when you can talk

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.620
about these uncomfortable
topics in a way that

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.414
brings some humor into it.

00:10:55.414 --> 00:10:56.830
And it makes just
more comfortable

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:00.710
in starting the dialogue, so
definitely thank you for that.

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:06.140
So Tone Bell, he is a stand-up
comedian in real life, also

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:11.280
an actor, so was that part of
his character Russell's role

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.029
or did you guys add that
in when you cast Tone?

00:11:14.029 --> 00:11:14.695
WILL PACKER: No.

00:11:14.695 --> 00:11:16.861
What's interesting is that
the character was already

00:11:16.861 --> 00:11:18.360
written as a stand-up.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.860
And so Tone Bell, the actor
that plays Russell brilliantly,

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.870
is also a stand-up, that made
him fit the role perfectly.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.480
There wasn't a
lot that we needed

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.500
to do to shape a role around the
actor, which you do sometimes,

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.080
because in this
instance the actor

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.630
really, really fit the role.

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:36.130
He really has a lot of
the-- he's a loose guy,

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.420
he's a liberal guy,
he's a fun loving guy,

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.101
and he happens to be a stand-up.

00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:43.100
And him being a stand-up,
and being on the road,

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.058
and having to interact
with different audiences

00:11:45.058 --> 00:11:47.480
and make them laugh, it
affects his world view.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.980
And so that's in real
life tone, and that's also

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.340
the character, Russell.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.830
The thing I'll say
about this cast

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.470
is that each of the
characters, they

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:58.030
hadn't worked together before.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.480
Tone Bell and Bresha Webb,
who do play a married couple,

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.430
knew each other, they did have
a camaraderie prior to the show.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:09.175
But there is an organic,
authentic camaraderie

00:12:09.175 --> 00:12:12.350
and chemistry amongst
these four that you can

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.160
see when you watch the show.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.250
And literally, it's
not just about--

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:18.480
and I've been
fortunate to produce

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.469
a lot of content--
and oftentimes,

00:12:20.469 --> 00:12:21.760
when you yell "Cut," that's it.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.344
These actors-- I
don't care if they're

00:12:23.344 --> 00:12:25.801
playing husband and wife, if
they're in an intimate bedroom

00:12:25.801 --> 00:12:26.400
scene-- "Cut."

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.566
Get away from me, all right?

00:12:27.566 --> 00:12:28.864
Where is my coffee? my latte?

00:12:28.864 --> 00:12:31.030
I don't want to talk to you
until it's time to roll.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:35.130
These actors actually,
genuinely are a family.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.399
They're tight-knit, and they
really, really genuinely

00:12:37.399 --> 00:12:39.190
get along, and they
have a great chemistry,

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:40.980
and they hang
outside of the set.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.500
And I bring that up
because these days

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.840
authentic content is really what
is resonating with audiences.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.004
Things that feel real-- whether
it's a world, or a character,

00:12:51.004 --> 00:12:52.670
or a perspective that
you can relate to,

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:55.302
directly or not-- if it feels
like it's really authentic,

00:12:55.302 --> 00:12:57.760
if it feels like it's something
that's very natural and not

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.490
manufactured by some Hollywood
writer, producer, or director,

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.560
audiences resonate towards that.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.540
They're attracted to
that kind of content.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:06.956
And so it's really
good that we've

00:13:06.956 --> 00:13:10.180
got a foursome that is
actually oragnically--

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:11.300
has great chemistry.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.425
MARJAI ROBERTS: Definitely.

00:13:12.425 --> 00:13:14.370
So speaking of
chemistry and everything

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.930
that happens on the set, do
you have any funny bloopers

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.745
or anything that's happened
on the set since you started?

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.580
WILL PACKER: There's a story
that I wouldn't otherwise tell,

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.100
but I'll tell it because
she has told it herself.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:31.230
When Vanessa Lachey, who
is a completely elegant

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.645
and classy woman--

00:13:33.645 --> 00:13:34.770
MARJAI ROBERTS: Disclaimer.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:39.430
WILL PACKER: Yes, absolutely--
she stepped away from the set

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:43.110
and started doing what she
calls, "the fart dance."

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:46.190
And she literally
starts doing this dance

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:51.220
and-- the name is apropos--
she is away and thinks

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:54.300
nobody is watching because
she's trying to, I don't know,

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.760
scoot it out.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.730
What she didn't know is that
the entire cast and crew are now

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.940
stopped and watching her do
her fart dance over there.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.900
And so now she has
to explain what it is

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.030
and what she was doing.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:08.613
And that's how it
came out, and that's

00:14:08.613 --> 00:14:10.250
how we knew what she was doing.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:13.037
I can't think of much
more embarrassing

00:14:13.037 --> 00:14:14.620
then being caught
passing gas in front

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:15.911
of a whole crew full of people.

00:14:15.911 --> 00:14:18.640
MARJAI ROBERTS: I think that
takes the cake for sure.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.890
Definitely.

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:21.770
So I love Mitch.

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.872
You were mentioning
Mark-Paul Gosselaar--

00:14:23.872 --> 00:14:25.330
WILL PACKER: Oh
yeah, he's awesome.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:26.970
MARJAI ROBERTS: He played Zack
Morris on "Saved by the Bell,"

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:27.680
if you guys remember.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.096
WILL PACKER: Yes
he did, yes, yes.

00:14:29.096 --> 00:14:30.510
MARJAI ROBERTS: Favorite.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:33.660
So as you were
mentioning, he reminds you

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.180
of that socially conscious
guy that everyone

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.990
knows, or is friends with,
that really wants to make sure

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:41.870
that they're instilling,
or projecting,

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:46.006
fairness and justice around
them and everyone around them.

00:14:46.006 --> 00:14:48.130
Where do you think Mitch
gets this heightened sense

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:50.540
of consciousness
from or justice from?

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.630
WILL PACKER: Well, two things.

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:56.540
Number one, the character of
Mitch is an ethics professor

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.790
and so he spends a lot of time
talking about, and studying,

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:03.249
ethics and morality,
and studying

00:15:03.249 --> 00:15:05.790
the difference between right
and wrong, the black, and white,

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.490
and the gray areas.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:11.930
It also is based on our
creator, DJ Nash's, actual life

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.880
and he is somebody
that's like that.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.690
He likes to say that,
out of this foursome,

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:22.700
the fifth character on the
show is Mitch's white guilt.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:27.270
And that is very appropriate
for our creator, DJ Nash,

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:32.620
because he is-- in a great, fun,
and lovable way-- somebody that

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.715
always wants to make sure that
he's not part of the problem

00:15:35.715 --> 00:15:37.090
and that he's
doing everything he

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:39.790
can be a part of the solution,
whatever that may be.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:44.110
So he instills that in the
writing of our Mitch character,

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:49.210
and it's really fun to have that
kind of guy opposite somebody

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:52.777
like Russell, who has fun
pushing his white guilt buttons

00:15:52.777 --> 00:15:53.860
every chance that he gets.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:56.200
MARJAI ROBERTS: I agree.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.286
There's a scene
where they listen to,

00:15:59.286 --> 00:16:01.670
I think, a Jay-Z
song in the car,

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.770
and there's a "n"
word that comes up

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:07.570
and the what happens with
that, so that was really funny.

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.600
WILL PACKER: It's
good, it's great.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.830
It's "Empire State
of Mind" by Jay-Z,

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:15.590
who was kind enough to
license the song to us,

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:16.870
really appreciate that.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:21.350
And Mitch-- they're heading
to a Jay-Z concert and Mitch

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.940
is so proud that he has
learned all the words

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.020
to the Jay-Z verse of
"Empire Sate of Mind."

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.740
He is like, oh my god,
you've got to hear me do it.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.740
And he's rapping it,
and of course, Jay-Z

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.960
drops the "n" word every
other verse, and so

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.100
when he gets to the "n"
word, and he's so ready

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.300
to say it, that's when
Russell steps in, cuts off,

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.620
no, no, no, no, no.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.674
What are you doing?

00:16:41.674 --> 00:16:42.590
No, you don't do that.

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:45.340
And Mitch is, but I learned it,
but you should hear me say it.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.860
I don't pronounce the "-er,"
I do it like Jay-Z, let me.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.080
And he's like, no you can't.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.270
So in the episode,
he then forces

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:55.069
Mitch to only sing the
Alicia Keys' part, which

00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:56.360
turns out much more disastrous.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.490
MARJAI ROBERTS:
Yeah, it's not good.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:59.090
Definitely.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:06.720
So we hear a lot of dialogue in
the news and in our community

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.560
that diversity and actors,
and seeing people, diversity,

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:16.550
on TV, is really important
in our community today.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:19.470
And I think we
forget a lot of times

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:22.700
that the people in the
background, it's just

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:27.310
is important for them to be
diverse as well because they

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:28.760
are the decision makers.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.580
So how does that impact you?

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:35.150
Do you agree or do
you think that's fair

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.190
that it's really important to
have that diversity in sitting

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:38.760
at the table?

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.510
WILL PACKER: Yeah.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:42.390
First of all, diversity
is important for a couple

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:43.110
of reasons.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:46.610
Not only because
it's the right thing

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:51.370
to do, just to be upfront
and blatant about it,

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:54.620
but also because it makes
good business sense.

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.790
That's what America
looks like now.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.530
It does not look like
just one monolithic group,

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:03.230
America looks like how
the world looks, diverse.

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:06.690
And various races, ethnicities,
and cultural backgrounds,

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.310
and sexual orientations.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.300
So if you're going
to make content

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.340
for the broadest
possible audience,

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.170
you need to represent
that audience.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:15.920
So that's something
that's very important.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.336
When you talk about behind the
scenes, people like myself,

00:18:18.336 --> 00:18:18.990
you're right.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:21.980
Obviously, I'm going to have a
different level of sensitivity

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:25.320
about diversity, perhaps, than
some of my white counterparts.

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.140
Doesn't mean that we both
can't push it in the same way,

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.790
but it is important to
have diversity in front,

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:33.290
and behind, the camera
because it informs

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:34.510
the decisions that you make.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:37.730
And so in order to have great
shows that are organically

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:42.150
diverse-- again, not just,
let's cast a person of color

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.155
because we need to
meet some quota,

00:18:44.155 --> 00:18:46.270
but actual themes
and subject matters

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:50.130
that are organic to
a diverse cast-- then

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.640
you have to have people
that really understand

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.170
and have a perspective.

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.030
It also makes the
content better.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:19:00.740
Because if you and I like
something, it could be good,

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.270
but I don't know, you've only
got some very small sample.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:06.100
But if this entire
room likes it,

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.220
the chances of it being
good are even better.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.140
And so the more
diverse voices that you

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.320
have weighing in on the type
of content that you're making,

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.390
the better chance you have
of that content being better.

00:19:17.165 --> 00:19:18.540
MARJAI ROBERTS:
Definitely agree.

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:19.920
WILL PACKER: That was my
second best answer, guys.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:20.550
Do you want to cut it--

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:22.060
MARJAI ROBERTS: Clap
for that one too.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:22.950
WILL PACKER: Should
we keep going?

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.110
Look, boom man in the
back is like, yeah bro,

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:26.450
you're downhill from here.

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:28.574
I'm with you.

00:19:28.574 --> 00:19:29.740
MARJAI ROBERTS: Definitiely.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:35.250
So movies, TV, what are
some of the similarities

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:38.076
and differences for you and
producing on both sides?

00:19:38.076 --> 00:19:39.950
WILL PACKER: It's all
about creating content.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:42.860
The process is different,
very different actually,

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.760
in terms of creating in
the different mediums,

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.780
but at the end of the day,
it's about character stories,

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.129
richness, doing it
well in a quality way,

00:19:51.129 --> 00:19:52.420
and finding an audience for it.

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.669
That's really what it's about.

00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:56.330
So whether it's the big
screen, for the small screen,

00:19:56.330 --> 00:20:00.280
for the digital medium,
it doesn't really matter.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.272
For me, it's about what are the
stories we're trying to tell,

00:20:03.272 --> 00:20:05.230
what are the characters
we're trying to create,

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:08.060
and who wants to see those
characters, who will relate,

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.280
or who will be attracted
to those characters

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:10.950
in those stores.

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:12.785
That's really the key for me.

00:20:12.785 --> 00:20:13.970
MARJAI ROBERTS: Definitely.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:17.340
So you're based
in Atlanta and you

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.990
started a lot of
your productions

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:21.910
in Atlanta, which has
become one of the fastest

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:24.220
growing production
hubs in the US

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.970
with all the tax incentives
in the state, what is it

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:30.170
like producing in Atlanta?

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:32.272
And how do you like it?

00:20:32.272 --> 00:20:33.480
WILL PACKER: Atlanta's great.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.910
It's obviously-- we're
here at a global company

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:40.390
and the world now is
completely connected.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:43.490
And so no matter where
you produce the content--

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:45.229
ultimately,
distribution has changed

00:20:45.229 --> 00:20:47.270
and no matter where you
are, where it's produced,

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:49.260
you can get access to content.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:52.570
So a lot of times, the decisions
about where to make the content

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.440
are driven by creative
and by fiscal.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:59.840
So ultimately, Atlanta's a great
market that's been very smart,

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.400
the state of Georgia has put
text incentives in place.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.570
It was my home market
market even before those tax

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.364
incentives were in
place, I like it

00:21:06.364 --> 00:21:08.030
because it has a lot
of different looks,

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:10.270
so as a creative
person you can shoot

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.912
something that can be very
metropolitan, also very rural.

00:21:13.912 --> 00:21:17.770
It's Southern, but yet because
it has so many transplants,

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:22.970
it has a flavor that feels very
diverse, not just Southern.

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:25.339
So I like it for
personal reasons

00:21:25.339 --> 00:21:26.880
because I like that
kind of diversity

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.550
and I like that kind of cultural
melting pot that Atlanta is.

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:33.240
But for business
reasons, it is now

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:37.880
at the forefront of one of the
most efficient places to shoot,

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:41.250
and other studios and
producers are following suit.

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:45.400
And that's how it works
in my business, where

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.660
the tax incentives are-- you
build it, they will come.

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:49.800
You put a tax incentive
in place, whoever's

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.370
got the highest percentage, you
will find your favorite shows

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:56.370
and movies, and other content--
documentaries, whatever it is--

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:58.590
being shot in those markets.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:01.490
MARJAI ROBERTS: I heard
in a BET Genius Talks

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:04.870
interview you did with
Boris Kodjoe last year,

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:08.572
you mentioned that if newcomers
want Hollywood to pay attention

00:22:08.572 --> 00:22:11.030
to them, they really have to
start making their own content

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:15.260
and starting to make
money on that content.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.220
That reminded me a lot
of our YouTube creators

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.620
and how they're using
limited resources to build up

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.720
a subscribership and fan base.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.770
So how big do you
think technology

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:30.690
has played in helping creators
get their work out there?

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:35.609
And how different was that for
you when you first started?

00:22:35.609 --> 00:22:36.900
WILL PACKER: Technology's huge.

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.610
Technology, it affects
everything that we do,

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:44.370
but you can't overstate
the impact of technology

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:46.220
on the film and
television business.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.280
So in every aspect
at every level--

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:53.650
I don't care if you're
talking about a $150 million

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:57.780
tent pole production or a
$2 million indie-- the way

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:02.610
that that content is created now
is affected by the technology

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:04.280
level that we're at right now.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:08.630
So for me, I love it
because what it has done

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:11.970
is remove some of the
barriers that were there

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:15.100
for young artists who want to
get into the movie business.

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.640
Because now, when
I first started

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:21.350
I had to shoot my
first film, on film.

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:25.730
I had to go out and actually
buy celluloid to shoot my film,

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:28.310
60 millimeters is what
we shot it on-- Super 16,

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:30.700
actually, thank you very
much-- and we shot the film,

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.200
and we had to edit
it, and we didn't

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.790
have digital capabilities
at that time.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:38.080
Now, you can shoot a
movie, a complete movie,

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.360
on your cell phone, on your
smartphone, absolutely.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:43.172
So on your Android
smartphone, by the way.

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:49.350
I love that because
now you can go out

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:52.770
and you don't have to go to
one of the gatekeepers to say,

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:55.010
will you give me
a ton of resources

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:56.470
in order to create my content.

00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:00.330
And if it's good enough, and
if people want to see it,

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:03.651
and they will go and follow
you on YouTube and click it,

00:24:03.651 --> 00:24:06.150
and you have a bunch of views,
Hollywood will pay attention.

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:08.900
Hollywood, by its very nature,
is a reactive industry.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.950
It's not very proactive,
unfortunately.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:12.040
It's reactive.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.300
And so you have an opportunity
to get Hollywood's attention

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.810
because those
barriers aren't there.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:18.705
You can go out with
very limited resources,

00:24:18.705 --> 00:24:20.330
and if you're good,
if you're creative,

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:22.746
if you how to market it, you
know how to find an audience,

00:24:22.746 --> 00:24:25.362
Hollywood will find you and
say, help us to exploit you.

00:24:25.362 --> 00:24:26.320
It's what they will do.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.450
But ultimately, it
gets your content out

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:29.380
to a wider audience.

00:24:29.865 --> 00:24:30.990
MARJAI ROBERTS: Definitely.

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:32.448
So you already gave
us a little bit

00:24:32.448 --> 00:24:34.030
of advice for
budding producers, do

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:36.410
you have any other
words of encouragement

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:38.279
for content creators
and producers

00:24:38.279 --> 00:24:39.570
out there trying to get their--

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:40.820
WILL PACKER: Go out and do it.

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.010
Go out-- and that's
my thing now, go out.

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:44.920
Don't use the excuse
of, well, I haven't

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.461
gotten to a particular
level, I don't

00:24:46.461 --> 00:24:49.270
have enough resources--
go out and do it.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:52.170
Inevitabily, the more you
do, the better you will get.

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:55.402
And so what I always tell young
people interested in getting

00:24:55.402 --> 00:24:57.610
into the business is don't
wait for somebody like me,

00:24:57.610 --> 00:24:59.910
or anybody else, to come
and ordain you, and give you

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:02.230
a shot, and say, here's
a big Hollywood budget.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:03.470
Just go out and do it.

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.580
Go out and start shooting.

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.670
Your first stuff is
probably going to be bad.

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:09.290
That's OK, get that
out of your system

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.072
and get to the good stuff.

00:25:11.072 --> 00:25:16.770
I think that because people
that are really ambitious

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:18.360
and go getters, and
really passionate

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.160
and driven about it, now because
there are so many avenues

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.180
to be able to create
your own stuff--

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:26.330
and in distribution outlets,
there are more cable,

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.770
and on demand outlets,
and digital outlets,

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:33.040
and channels online to put your
content on and have it seen

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:37.210
by a wide audience than there
ever were before-- so if you're

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:39.930
hungry and you're really
serious about doing,

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:42.000
there is an opportunity there.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.400
So now that the
excuses are removed,

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.020
you have a lot more people
that are creating content,

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.872
so now the cream has
to rise to the top.

00:25:48.872 --> 00:25:51.330
You have to figure out how to
make your content good enough

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:53.230
that people will notice
it because there's

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:55.020
a lot of content out there.

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.930
So now it challenges you as
a filmmaker, as an actor,

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:00.449
as a writer, as a director,
to stand out and be better

00:26:00.449 --> 00:26:02.990
than some of the peers out there
that are just throwing stuff

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.770
at the wall.

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:05.207
MARJAI ROBERTS: Definitely.

00:26:05.207 --> 00:26:07.540
So we're going to start taking
a few audience questions,

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:12.230
so you can definitely go and
line up in the middle there.

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:15.790
But before that, I
wanted to ask you

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.730
what inspired you to
get into filmmaking?

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:20.260
I know some of you
may not know that you

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:22.850
graduated from FAMU with an
electrical engineering degree--

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:23.850
WILL PACKER: I did, yes.

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:26.660
MARJAI ROBERTS: --so that
resonates here at Google.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.040
But how did you leap from
engineering to film ?

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:35.625
WILL PACKER: I never had a
passion for engineering--

00:26:35.625 --> 00:26:40.060
no offense to present
company-- but for me, I

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:43.230
was strong in technology,
and math, and science

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:46.680
coming in to college and I got
a scholarship to pursue that.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.610
And there was a
push at that time,

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:53.160
not unsimilar to how it is now,
to increase minority graduates

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.710
in technical fields.

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:57.610
And so I got a scholarship
that encouraged me to go into

00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:00.430
to get a degree in electrical
engineering, and along the way,

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:02.990
I hooked up with a buddy,
a lifelong friend of mine

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:05.610
named Rob Hardy, and he wanted
to be a director, that's

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:06.560
all he wanted to do.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.390
He was like, I want to
be a movie director.

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:09.806
That wasn't my
particular passion,

00:27:09.806 --> 00:27:11.580
but I wanted to be
an entrepreneur.

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:14.910
And so I helped him to
make his first movie.

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:20.730
And after we made it, I was able
to get distribution, hustle it

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:23.360
into the theaters locally.

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.930
Ultimately, I helped him
get the actor, the finance

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:28.620
and the distribution,
and then do that again

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:29.950
with another small project.

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:32.234
And later I learned that's
what a producer basically

00:27:32.234 --> 00:27:34.650
does, you go and get financing
for projects and create it.

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:37.160
So I stumbled into
being a movie producer,

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:38.980
it wasn't something
that I checked a box

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:40.521
when you're trying
to figure out what

00:27:40.521 --> 00:27:43.280
your career's going to be as
a teenager or college student.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.845
But we were able to
make it successful,

00:27:45.845 --> 00:27:48.350
we took a little small movie
and made a little bit of money,

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:49.150
and I said, you know what?

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:51.280
This is my entrepreneurial
endeavor right here,

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.380
this is a business model.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.810
I'm going to go and I'm going
to do this movie producer thing.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:59.869
I learned on the job, never went
to film school, trial by fire,

00:27:59.869 --> 00:28:01.410
making a lot of
mistakes, doing a lot

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:04.020
of things wrong, but
ultimately hustled until I

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:07.010
got to the point where
my content actually was

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:09.150
good enough for people to see.

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:11.260
And a lot of people to
see it, at this point.

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:11.900
MARJAI ROBERTS: Definitely.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.310
Congratulations on that success.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:14.268
WILL PACKER: Thank you.

00:28:14.268 --> 00:28:18.300
MARJAI ROBERTS: So what are
you most proud of of "Truth Be

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:18.850
Told?"

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:21.344
And I would love to learn
more about any future projects

00:28:21.344 --> 00:28:22.260
you're working on now.

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:24.593
WILL PACKER: With "Truth Be
Told," I'm proud of the fact

00:28:24.593 --> 00:28:26.210
that its organically
diverse, it's

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:28.400
not something that
is a show that's

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.540
diverse for diverse's sake.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:33.080
It's a show about real people,
and it pushes the envelope,

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:36.970
it's provocative but
not in an offensive way.

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:38.870
It's fun, it's light
and I like that.

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:41.930
And I think that the timing
is right for that kind of show

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:43.820
on television and I
think that audiences

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:47.572
who tune in and watch it, will
fall in love these characters.

00:28:47.572 --> 00:28:49.572
I'm proud of that, I'm
proud to be a part of it.

00:28:49.572 --> 00:28:51.113
MARJAI ROBERTS:
Definitely, congrats.

00:28:51.113 --> 00:28:53.160
So we'll take a few
Q&amp;A from the audience.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.184
AUDIENCE: First, I would
like to say, welcome Rattler.

00:28:56.184 --> 00:28:56.850
WILL PACKER: Oh!

00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:57.350
Thank you.

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:58.790
FAMU in the house.

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:00.020
AUDIENCE: Also an EE.

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:00.610
WILL PACKER: Love that.

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:02.360
AUDIENCE: Probably the
same scholarship program

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.850
and also not an
engineer anymore.

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:05.530
WILL PACKER: I love it,
when did you come out?

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:07.613
AUDIENCE: I came out in
2000, so my contemporaries

00:29:07.613 --> 00:29:10.002
would be people like John
Brown, Joe Carrol-- I

00:29:10.002 --> 00:29:12.460
was on Senate with him-- Reggie
Harris and that whole crew.

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:13.459
WILL PACKER: Absolutely.

00:29:13.459 --> 00:29:14.540
Wow, what a small world.

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:15.900
MARJAI ROBERTS: That's
actually a manager on my team.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:16.733
WILL PACKER: Really?

00:29:16.733 --> 00:29:17.347
I love it.

00:29:17.347 --> 00:29:19.430
AUDIENCE: So I've been
watch you work ever since--

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:21.240
WILL PACKER: We should just
keep the "convo" between us,

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:21.310
this is--

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:22.050
AUDIENCE: Right, exactly.

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:23.430
WILL PACKER: --completely
irreverent to everybody

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:25.310
in the room, and
everybody has no idea

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:27.196
what we're talking about,
but that's awesome.

00:29:27.196 --> 00:29:28.320
AUDIENCE: That'll be lunch.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:28.990
WILL PACKER: Yeah.

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:31.573
AUDIENCE: So I've been watching
your work since Chocolate City

00:29:31.573 --> 00:29:33.940
at TOPS, Trois.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.299
Interested in-- I know the
journey that you've gone

00:29:36.299 --> 00:29:38.840
through and I've been watching
for probably, what is it now--

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.350
WILL PACKER: Chocolate
City was my first movie,

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:41.974
I know that you might
be a little lost.

00:29:41.974 --> 00:29:44.930
When I was a student
at FAMU, Florida A&amp;M,

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:47.259
I did a little small, small,
movie, that $20,000 movie,

00:29:47.259 --> 00:29:48.550
and it's called Chocolate City.

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.549
It was a movie about
college life as we knew it.

00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:53.090
Horrible little movie but it
started a pretty nice career.

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:54.131
All right, where were we?

00:29:54.131 --> 00:29:56.610
AUDIENCE: And we all had
to watch in orientation.

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:58.450
So on this journey,
I know there's

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:01.210
a lot of personal development
behind the success

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:03.720
that people see outwardly,
I'm interested in knowing

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:07.020
what is probably some of the
biggest personal challenges

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.210
that you've had to
grow through in order

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:13.680
to be able to look at the
Will Packer that was then,

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.460
to the person that
we see now before us?

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:17.300
WILL PACKER: That's
an excellent question.

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:20.040
For me, my personal
growth has all

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.999
been around learning the
work-life balance because when

00:30:23.999 --> 00:30:26.290
I get the opportunity to come
and have talks like this,

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:29.120
and talk to people, it is
always about the success

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.170
that I've had as a film
producer or television producer,

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:34.430
and the projects that I
have and what's coming up.

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:37.170
But what really, really
defines me is family

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:39.520
because if you ask
me who I am, I'm

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:43.100
going to say I'm a father and a
husband first who also happens

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.640
to work in Hollywood.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.490
So for me, that balance--
my foundation is very strong

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.840
and allows me to go out
and do the work that I

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.850
do in a very, very
challenging, competitive field

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:55.000
because I've got that
great family foundation.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.530
And so as I have
grown personally,

00:30:57.530 --> 00:30:59.940
the maturity to really
understand and grasp

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:04.200
that work-life balance
has been immense in terms

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.520
of giving me a leg up,
even on some of my peers

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.370
who don't have that.

00:31:09.974 --> 00:31:12.390
AUDIENCE: First, thank you for
spending some time with us,

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:13.349
know you're very busy--

00:31:13.349 --> 00:31:15.889
WILL PACKER: I thought you're
going to say you were from FAMU

00:31:15.889 --> 00:31:17.600
and I was going to
say, this is a setup,

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.090
this whole room is fake.

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:21.430
None of you people work
at Google, what is this?

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:22.460
Is this an intervention?

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:23.360
What's going on?

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:23.910
No.

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:24.480
AUDIENCE: Not quite.

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.021
But I was wondering if you could
talk a little bit about what

00:31:27.021 --> 00:31:31.000
pressure, if any you feel, as
one of a handful of producers

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.060
that can push content through
the Hollywood machine featuring

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:36.880
predominantly African-American
actors or themes.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.500
I know the two aren't
always the same,

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.507
but what pressure,
if any, you feel?

00:31:40.507 --> 00:31:42.090
I wonder if you could
talk about that?

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:44.830
WILL PACKER: First of
all, when you say handful,

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:47.780
it's a small hand, I'm
going to be honest with you.

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:50.900
There are not many
African-American producers

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.310
that are fortunate enough
to produce on the level

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:55.860
that I have been fortunate
enough to produce on.

00:31:55.860 --> 00:32:00.290
I see it as an opportunity
because right now I

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:03.280
am one of very few
voices, so I always

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:07.360
want to be the
person-- the parable is

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:11.770
the shoe salesman who goes
into the land of no shoes.

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:13.820
It's-- I don't know,
people look at me crazy.

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:16.700
So this story is that there
were two shoe salesmen,

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:19.800
and one went to
this far away town

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:23.130
and came back to the
shoe company and said,

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:25.830
oh this is horrible, we
can go into this town.

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:29.200
They don't know what a shoe is,
they don't wear shoes, move on.

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.890
And then the second salesman
went to the same town

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:34.440
and came back and said, oh
my god, this is perfect.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.080
Unlimited potential for growth.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:39.442
We can take it over and start
our whole marketing machine

00:32:39.442 --> 00:32:41.150
here, and so he saw
an opportunity there.

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:44.240
So for me, I see an
opportunity if I'm

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:46.210
the only one in the
room that's doing

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:48.570
a particular type of content.

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:50.100
But I know that's
going to change,

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:51.640
and I know that if
I do it well, it

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.681
would open the door--
because, as I said earlier,

00:32:53.681 --> 00:32:56.200
Hollywood is reactive--
and so you will have people

00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:00.000
that will say, give me more of
insert successful content here.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.720
Give me more movies and
TV shows like insert

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.370
successful producers'
content there.

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:08.970
So for me I see it as a
responsibility, but also

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:10.090
an opportunity.

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:13.900
And I know it will
change, it will.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:16.060
Right now I'm definitely
enjoying the ride

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:19.220
because it allows
me to take risks

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:22.840
because the expectations
are still not

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:27.334
extremely high for
content that is diverse.

00:33:27.334 --> 00:33:29.500
It's changing though, it's
changing because you look

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:32.130
at the top shows on television
and the top movies in theaters

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:35.200
for the last-- there
was a run of five weeks,

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.130
it started with "Straight Outta
Compton," where the number one

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:43.600
movie in the country featured
African-American leads for five

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.490
weeks in a row.

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:47.300
And then, of course, the number
one show on television right

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.620
now is "Empire," so
it says something

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:53.680
about the-- and those aren't
just black audiences that

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:57.990
are watching those shows-- so
it says something about where

00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:00.360
the country is in terms
of the type of content

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.037
they're willing to embrace.

00:34:02.037 --> 00:34:02.870
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:05.310
MARJAI ROBERTS: Thanks guys.

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:07.260
So one question I did
want to ask about,

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:10.300
that I'm excited about,
is you are producing

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.380
the remake of "Roots" and
I'm hearing about "Uncle

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:16.800
Buck," which was a remake.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:19.989
Mike Epps is playing
it, originally--

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:20.989
WILL PACKER: John Candy.

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:22.198
MARJAI ROBERTS: --John Candy.

00:34:22.198 --> 00:34:24.572
So I'm excited about those,
can you tell us a little bit,

00:34:24.572 --> 00:34:25.870
sneak peak about that or--

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:27.380
WILL PACKER: Sure, yeah.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.139
Two very different
projects, obviously,

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:30.780
"Uncle Buck" and "Roots."

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:35.670
So I don't see a mash
up coming any time soon.

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:37.110
MARJAI ROBERTS: Not at all.

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:39.400
WILL PACKER: "Uncle Buck"
is an interesting project

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.639
because it is revered
in a lot of circles.

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:46.000
The great John Candy,
it's a cult classic,

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.080
nobody will ever be John Candy
and we didn't approach it

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.690
with an eye towards
replacing John Candy

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:56.139
or doing the same show, the
same movie, as a TV show.

00:34:56.139 --> 00:34:59.280
We looked at the theme, the
heart of what that was about,

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.510
and we made it our own.

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:03.310
And so we've got an
amazing team of creators

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:05.830
that have put a show together
around the super talented

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:10.310
comedian, Mike Epps, and it
follows that same formula

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:13.374
that was in "Uncle Buck," but
it's a very different show.

00:35:13.374 --> 00:35:15.540
And it's something I'm
excited about because I think

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:17.998
it's a type of show that will
resonate with audiences today

00:35:17.998 --> 00:35:20.541
because it's real.

00:35:20.541 --> 00:35:23.570
Families today are not just
the traditional families

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:25.910
of '80s television, they
look a lot different,

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:28.390
and this is a family that
looks a lot different.

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:31.150
And then with "Roots,"
that is something that I'm

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:32.450
really, really proud of.

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:33.686
I'm proud to be a part of it.

00:35:33.686 --> 00:35:35.310
It's obviously a
tremendous undertaking

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:38.560
that I don't take
lightly, remaking

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:41.790
an iconic classic, the
most watched television

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:45.020
series in television history.

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:47.720
It is something that
I'm doing because I

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.040
know there's an entire
generation of youth that

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.010
have not seen it and it deserves
a contemporary retelling.

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:56.260
So we've got an amazing
team, amazing actors,

00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:58.700
amazing directors and I'm
happy to be a part of it.

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:01.200
MARJAI ROBERTS: Great,
we're looking forward to it.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:05.310
So at this point, I wanted
to play rapid fire with you.

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:07.040
We do this sometimes
on Talks at Google.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.070
So I'm going to throw a few one
or the other questions at you

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:11.419
and pick the first one.

00:36:11.419 --> 00:36:13.460
WILL PACKER: This is where
it goes off the rails.

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:14.240
MARJAI ROBERTS: Here
we go, here we go--

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.864
WILL PACKER: Heavy
editing in this part

00:36:15.864 --> 00:36:17.590
of the show people, all right.

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:20.294
MARJAI ROBERTS:
So LA or New York?

00:36:20.294 --> 00:36:21.210
WILL PACKER: For what?

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:23.400
I don't-- see,
that's why I'm bad,

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:26.331
I'm already messing
up with this.

00:36:26.331 --> 00:36:28.080
Because immediately
different things came.

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.509
To visit, to work, to--

00:36:29.509 --> 00:36:30.550
MARJAI ROBERTS: Anything.

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:31.883
WILL PACKER: --run from the law?

00:36:31.883 --> 00:36:34.060
Which-- what are we?

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:34.879
I'm going to go LA.

00:36:34.879 --> 00:36:35.670
MARJAI ROBERTS: LA.

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:36.170
OK.

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:36.890
Truth or dare?

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:39.240
WILL PACKER: Dare.

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.948
MARJAI ROBERTS: Early
riser or night owl?

00:36:40.948 --> 00:36:42.330
WILL PACKER: Night owl.

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:44.800
MARJAI ROBERTS: Since you live
in Georgia, UGA or Georgia

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:45.700
Tech?

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:46.410
Careful.

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:47.960
WILL PACKER: U-- UGA.

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:48.836
MARJAI ROBERTS: Yes.

00:36:48.836 --> 00:36:51.030
Good answer, good answer.

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:52.740
Go dogs!

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:53.890
Spring or Fall?

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:54.750
WILL PACKER: Spring.

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:55.625
MARJAI ROBERTS: Good.

00:36:55.625 --> 00:36:56.840
Salty or sweet?

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.090
WILL PACKER: A little of both.

00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:00.131
MARJAI ROBERTS: Good.
"Martin" or "Fresh Prince?"

00:37:00.131 --> 00:37:01.690
WILL PACKER: Oh my god, Martin.

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:02.270
Martin.

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:03.519
MARJAI ROBERTS: Coffee or tea?

00:37:03.519 --> 00:37:04.360
WILL PACKER: Tea.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.890
MARJAI ROBERTS: SWV or TLC?

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:07.920
WILL PACKER: Oh wow TLC.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.780
MARJAI ROBERTS: OK,
there we go, well done.

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:10.768
WILL PACKER: Woo!

00:37:10.768 --> 00:37:11.268
All right.

00:37:12.034 --> 00:37:13.700
MARJAI ROBERTS: Thank
you so much, Will,

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:14.370
for coming to Google.

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:15.360
WILL PACKER: Thank you for
having me, this was awesome.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.700
MARJAI ROBERTS: Yeah,
thanks for taking time out

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.120
of your busy schedule
to visist us.

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.010
WILL PACKER: Thank you, Google.

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:20.468
Can we talk about
my search engine?

00:37:20.468 --> 00:37:22.260
I'd love it so that
when you just look up

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:23.950
pretty much anything,
myself pops up.

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:25.039
I don't who we--

00:37:25.039 --> 00:37:26.830
MARJAI ROBERTS: It's
supposed to work out--

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:29.020
WILL PACKER: --if somebody
in this room can-- Or when--

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:29.530
MARJAI ROBERTS: I'll
talk to a technician.

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:31.529
WILL PACKER: --you Google
me, Denzel and Edris--

00:37:31.529 --> 00:37:35.380
50% of the time-- their
photos pop up next to mine.

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:36.455
Can we-- I don't know--

00:37:36.455 --> 00:37:38.080
MARJAI ROBERTS: I'll
set up a meeting--

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.020
WILL PACKER: That's not a yes.

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.370
I'd like, while we're on
camera, to get you to say--

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:41.730
MARJAI ROBERTS: It's a yes.

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:43.380
WILL PACKER: I'll talk to
somebody, don't worry about it,

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.671
I'll wander around these halls.

00:37:44.671 --> 00:37:46.590
Security is tight
here, by the way.

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:49.900
We have to have an amazing
guide, Dana, who's here,

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.551
I've got to give
her a shout out.

00:37:51.551 --> 00:37:53.300
I tried to go to the
bathroom without Dana

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.742
and it didn't work out so well.

00:37:55.742 --> 00:37:57.450
Dana was like, you
don't want to do that.

00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:59.344
I was like, it's
Google, like what?

00:37:59.344 --> 00:38:01.010
She was like, you
don't want to do that.

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:03.730
So I didn't do it, I'm
going to listen to Dana,

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:05.197
y'all are serious around here.

00:38:05.197 --> 00:38:06.280
MARJAI ROBERTS: Very cool.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:10.770
So I did want to mention Viola
Davis, during her historic Emmy

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:11.762
win last month--

00:38:11.762 --> 00:38:13.720
WILL PACKER: Yes, I was
there, there in person.

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:14.470
So awesome to see.

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:15.680
MARJAI ROBERTS: That amazing.

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.520
She made a comment that
the only thing that

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.440
separates woman of color from
anyone else is opportunity,

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.610
and she went on to thank
a lot of the producers

00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:25.940
and writers in her life that
have made that opportunity

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:26.900
available to her.

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:28.720
So I wanted to take
the time to thank you

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:31.060
for doing that as well
and creating opportunity

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.885
to everyone in the
entertainment industry--

00:38:32.885 --> 00:38:34.510
WILL PACKER: Thank
you for saying that.

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:34.970
MARJAI ROBERTS: --so, thank you.

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:36.200
WILL PACKER:
Absolutely, thank you.

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:36.590
MARJAI ROBERTS: Thank you

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:37.881
WILL PACKER: Thank you so much.

00:38:37.881 --> 00:38:38.800
Thank you everybody.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.900
Awesome.

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:41.800
Great job.

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.300
My, my.

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:48.450
