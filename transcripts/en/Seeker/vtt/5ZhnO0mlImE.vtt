00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.330
What if you didn’t speak before the age
of three, but could play Mozart on the Piano?

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:11.280
Well you might just be a child a prodigy.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.369
There’s not any good figures for how many
child prodigies there are in the world, but

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.019
we do know there are enough for plenty of
reality shows to be made about child prodigies.

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:27.080
These unique children possess remarkable abilities,
in fields like art, music, or math and most

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.109
possess incredible memories.

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.530
These abilities at a young age almost seems
unnatural, which is actually where the word

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.129
prodigy comes from.

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.804
Seriously, the word prodigy, comes from the
latin for omen or as Andrew Solomon, psychology

00:00:40.804 --> 00:00:43.160
writer describes it, a “monster that violates
the natural order.”

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.420
Now to define what a prodigy is, we can look
to a couple different sources.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.870
Some psychologists consider a prodigy to be
anyone under 10 with remarkable abilities

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.859
in a specific area.

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:56.360
Some are even considered geniuses.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.250
According to Lewis Terman who created the
IQ concept, the average IQ is about 100.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.180
Any score over 110 is superior intelligence
and anything over 140 is genius.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.369
Many kids who are considered math prodigies
have IQs ranging from 134-147 and music prodigies

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.869
have IQs of around 108-142, way over what
MENSA reports as average.

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.830
I know, I know, we could debate the merits
of IQ but that’s a whole other episode.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.980
The thing is the link between IQ and prodigy
is hard to pin down.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.460
The science of prodigies is hard to pin down.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.320
There’s not a lot of great research into
why some children are born with remarkable

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.510
talents.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.390
One small study of five families, published
in the journal Human Heredity shows there

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.930
might be a link between prodigy and autism.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.759
Lead researcher, Assistant Professor of Psychology
at Ohio State University, Joanne Ruthsatz

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.689
believes this link might have to do with the
way memory is stored in the brain.

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.799
Typically we have two places to store memory
in our brain.

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.340
The hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.140
The hippocampus stores long term memories,
like facts, dates, names, that sort of thing.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.399
But the prefrontal cortex stores things like
riding a bike, tying your shoes, basically

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:04.969
muscle memory.

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:09.500
According to Ruthsatz’s research, prodigies
and some people with autism, use the prefrontal

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.920
cortex to store those long term memories.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.180
So remembering facts, dates, even a piece
of music is literally like riding a bike for

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.120
them, it’s in their muscle memory.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.840
This is what she believes makes a child prodigy.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.810
So what happens to all these child prodigies
when they grow up?

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.070
Well, they’re still there, we just don’t
hear about them because, while they might

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.409
be excelling or at the top of their field
in say medicine or computers, that doesn’t

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.489
make them stand out like a 3 year old playing
Mozart.

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.569
As psychologist Ellen Winner told the New
York Times, "only a fraction of gifted children

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.510
eventually become revolutionary adult creators".

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.870
And the reason behind former child prodigies
fading into professionally successful obscurity

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.520
or becoming adult creators, might be thanks
to their parents.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.701
Or to be specific, they have too many rules,
according to a study published in the The

00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:57.250
Journal of Creative Behavior that looked at
highly creative adolescents.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.980
The study looked at the top 5% of creative
kids in a school district and compared their

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.480
parent’s rule style to the parenting style
of less creative kids.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.420
The authors found that average kids had about
6 rules, while creative kids had less than

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.420
one!

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.400
So if a child prodigy has parents that set
a lot of rules, it will stifle their creativeness

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.090
and prevent them from becoming genius “adult
creators.”

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.390
They’ll grow up following rules and become
the best doctor they can be, but won’t break

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.230
out to once again stand out like they did
as a child.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.660
Following rules is helpful if you want to
play Mozart in Carnegie hall before the age

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.860
of ten, but it doesn’t help you BECOME Mozart.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.780
For that you need passion and the freedom
to explore that passion.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.010
And of course, plain old practice.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.010
So color outside the lines!

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.400
It might just make you a genius.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.129
In fact one study showed that drawing can
indicate genius, Trace and Tara have the smart

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:59.670
scoop in this episode, right here.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.870
So were you a kid genius?
