the problem in the discussion was what

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270
the problem in the discussion was what
 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.330
the problem in the discussion was what
we do about this how can it be regulated

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340
we do about this how can it be regulated
 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.820
we do about this how can it be regulated
how can any control so that the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830
how can any control so that the
 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.640
how can any control so that the
destructive parts of it can entertain

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650
destructive parts of it can entertain
 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.510
destructive parts of it can entertain
and the feeling was that it can't be

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520
and the feeling was that it can't be
 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.280
and the feeling was that it can't be
controlled that the best way to deal

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290
controlled that the best way to deal
 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.380
controlled that the best way to deal
with an emerging technology like this is

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390
with an emerging technology like this is
 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.780
with an emerging technology like this is
to have more transparency more openness

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790
to have more transparency more openness
 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.810
to have more transparency more openness
and to stress the positive uses obsesses

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820
and to stress the positive uses obsesses
 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.819
and to stress the positive uses obsesses
such technology such that the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829
such technology such that the
 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.979
such technology such that the
destructive uses would be d incentivized
