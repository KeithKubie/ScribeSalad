00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.182
We'll start with our general case. We'll have one person completing one job in

00:00:04.182 --> 00:00:09.222
a hours and another person completing that same job in b hours. This means that

00:00:09.222 --> 00:00:13.932
their total time together would be x hours. And 1 over x would be the fraction

00:00:13.932 --> 00:00:18.756
of the job done together in one hour. We know x in this case would be 2 and 4

00:00:18.756 --> 00:00:22.437
10ths hours. Since this is the total amount of time it takes them to edit the

00:00:22.437 --> 00:00:27.314
film together. Now, we need expressions for these two. If we let x equal the

00:00:27.314 --> 00:00:32.256
time it takes Carlos to edit, we can use x in one of the denominators. We know

00:00:32.256 --> 00:00:36.968
Melissa takes two hours longer than Carlos, so we can just add two to x to get

00:00:36.968 --> 00:00:43.990
x plus 2 for Melissa's time. Great thinking if you found this equation. I know

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.710
it's not easy.
