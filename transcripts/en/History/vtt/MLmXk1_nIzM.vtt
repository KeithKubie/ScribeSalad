00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.880
- You're disturbing my day over
(inaudible).

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.620
- Yes.
- So this better be good.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.120
Oh, this is--
this is really good.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.000
This will blow your mind,
but at the same time,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.380
I still can't explain it.
You ready?

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.540
All right.
- Here I stand.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.330
Hey, Mike!

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.790
Bring out that-- that thing!

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.000
[laughs]

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.290
Bring out that thing?

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.080
- There's no explanation.
- I'm ready, man.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.920
I'm telling you.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.330
I'm ready.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.830
[electric guitar playing]
- Eh?

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.210
- I'm already liking it.
- Already, yeah?

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.750
See?

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.750
Ha ha ha.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.420
That's Stoney.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.920
Yeah, buddy!

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.330
Are you kidding me?

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.080
You see what I mean?

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.080
What-- what is this?

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.080
You see what I mean?

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.880
What do you call that?

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.250
Are you kidding me?

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.750
It's the best gig I've
ever had in my life.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.080
Rocking on the go, baby.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.500
Rocking on the go.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.750
DANNY KOKER (VOICEOVER):
This picnic table is bad ass.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.750
I brought this thing to life
with eight Odyssey batteries,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.120
powered by an electric golf
cart motor, 12-inch wheels,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.120
and a rack and pinion system,
so you can get your picnic

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.290
on anywhere you want to.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.460
Then I did what Horny
Mike does best--

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.960
made it crazy.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.210
First, I burned the wood
to bring out the grain,

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.920
then I covered it in green
ice pearl and clear coat,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.750
because a splinter
in the butt will ruin

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.460
a day at the park in a hurry.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.920
Next, I hooked her
up with a cooler

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.120
that has a full stereo system.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.920
Then on the front,
a V8 propane grill

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.420
to cook all your picnic needs.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.960
Then, of course, a giant set of
horns to finish off the front.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.460
Because, well, why wouldn't I?

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.080
My head is about to explode.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.250
Well, then let
me give you a tour

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.290
of this beautiful picnic table.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.040
You obviously see the motor.
- Dude.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.290
[inaudible] Chevy.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.830
Aluminum heads, aluminum intake.
- No.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.580
No.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.000
More like a propane grill, so
that we can grill on the go.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.620
We got propane on the
front as a bumper--

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.000
DANNY KOKER:
Because that's safe.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.460
Come on back here.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.830
Oh, you know, we have
a beautiful umbrella,

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.460
nicely done by Paul.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.080
Don't want to get sunburned
while you're eating food.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.120
- Got the badges.
- OK, OK.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.580
Tony, how long did
you know about this?

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.620
Well, he told me
about it and said, hey,

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.000
can you come in and jam a
little bit on my picnic bench?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.620
I've had some pretty strange
offers in my life, but this--

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.250
this one is right up there.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.120
OK.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.000
All right, i topped it.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.460
So here's-- here's
where it all comes out.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.000
This is what Stoney's
playing out of.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
DANNY KOKER: Out of the cooler!

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.920
Out of the cooler, man.
What?

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.830
It's not just a box.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.330
Fully functional.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.000
DANNY KOKER: It's
really a cooler?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.670
HORNY MIKE: Yeah, we've
got all of your beverages.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.710
DANNY KOKER: And you're
playing out of it.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.710
TONY: And I'm playing into it.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.710
DANNY KOKER: Wait a minute.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.790
What possessed you to do this?

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.710
Why not?
Why not?

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.000
You know what?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.620
I cannot dispute that answer.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.710
Mike has had some crazy
ideas in the past,

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.710
but this picnic
table takes the cake.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.540
I got food.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.790
This isn't-- what?

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.000
I got food.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.380
I got-- I got everything set.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.500
We are ready to rock
and roll-- we just got

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.830
to get the rest of the fellas.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.710
Pardon the pun, but
I'm picking my seat.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.210
Let's go.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.380
I got to get the food.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.880
- I'm ready, man.
- Come on, Ryan.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.290
I'm hungry, brother.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.880
This has to be one
of your better ideas.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.040
- All right.
- Come back.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.500
Here we go.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.580
We got a full spread,
ready to rock and roll.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.420
Kidding me?
Shannon, what's up, baby?

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.040
Yeah, got all the condiments.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.250
Want a burger or a hot dog?

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.420
DANNY KOKER: I
know, they're good.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.330
KEVIN MACK: What
are you guys doing?

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.710
Kevin Mack!

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.880
What is all this?

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.920
How come nobody's working?

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.170
Because we're doing a picnic.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.330
It's lunchtime.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.040
So let me ask you
something, Mike.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.670
How much of this picnic table
does Count's Kustoms own?

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.250
Bro, if I had to guess,
Kevin, I probably own it all.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.540
You know what?
I'm in, then.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.670
Let's eat.
- Come on.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.710
Let's eat, baby.
- Come on!

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.210
Come get some food.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.170
I've never seen anything
so bonkers in my life.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.210
Let's roll.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.580
All right, everybody hold on.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.670
DANNY KOKER (VOICEOVER):
But I have to admit I'm

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.380
excited to take it for a spin.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.830
HORNY MIKE: You really got to
pay attention driving this.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.920
Yeah, don't blame Stoney
for not steering right.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.250
KEVIN MACK: This
is genius, Mike.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.580
HORNY MIKE: I'm
completely happy.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.580
I feel like we should
do this every day.
