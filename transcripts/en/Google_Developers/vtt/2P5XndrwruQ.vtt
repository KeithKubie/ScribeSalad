00:00:10.986 --> 00:00:12.610
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
Mr. Pete LePage.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.890
PETE LEPAGE: Hello,
Mr. Timothy Jordan.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.540
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So I'm traveling
around visiting my best DA

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.040
friends.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.330
PETE LEPAGE: Woo-hoo.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.050
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
talking about what

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.770
are you going to do
during the holidays?

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.714
Now, it's not your sort of
serious professional work.

00:00:23.714 --> 00:00:25.630
But maybe you're going
to explore some new fun

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.870
technology, and what is
that going to look like?

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.640
PETE LEPAGE: Well,
I'm going to go play

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.440
with progressive web apps.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.260
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I bet you are.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.780
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, you
know, it's kind of fun.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.920
There's lots of neat stuff.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.440
You had somebody on your show.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.112
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Darren Fischer-- we

00:00:35.112 --> 00:00:37.570
had Darren Fischer on the
show a few weeks ago talking

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.450
about progressive web apps in
his keynote at the Chrome Dev

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.950
Summit.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.160
You should check it out.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.670
PETE LEPAGE: The cool thing
it starts as a browser tab.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.120
You just go www dot
whatever dot com,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.600
and you use it like a web app.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.630
But you can add it
to your home screen,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.620
and the more you use it,
the more useful it becomes.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.360
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Give me a couple
of the technologies involved

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.830
in progressive web apps.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.800
Just let me know what to
search for and learn and check

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.080
out and program against.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.099
PETE LEPAGE: So the big
one is service workers,

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.930
because service workers
enables two big things.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.910
One, it enables you to do an
entirely offline experience,

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.380
and two, push notifications.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.510
In the past, it always had
to be a native app that

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.110
was doing push stuff.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.660
The web couldn't do push.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.227
With service worker,
web can do push.

00:01:20.227 --> 00:01:21.810
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Service worker's cool.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.726
PETE LEPAGE: Service
worker's kind of awesome.

00:01:23.726 --> 00:01:26.280
And then the other one
is the app manifest.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.280
You saying, hey, this is my app.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.440
This is the information
you need to know about it.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.400
And as long as you've
got those things

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.279
and you're served via HTTPS,
Chrome will start prompting,

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:37.320
hey, do you want to add
this to your home screen?

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.760
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's pretty dope.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.470
PETE LEPAGE: And you've
got a progressive web app.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.280
TIMOTHY JORDAN: If
you want to check out

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.470
more about what Pete
talks about on the show,

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.070
there's a bunch of great
links down in the show notes.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.564
Pete, thank you for braving
the wonderful New York weather.

00:01:47.564 --> 00:01:48.730
PETE LEPAGE: You're welcome.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:49.540
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
let's go get warm.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.039
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah,
I like that idea.

00:01:53.487 --> 00:01:56.070
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So here I am on
another part of the High Line.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.410
This is just as majestic
and just as cold,

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.070
and I've caught up
with my buddy, Josh.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.670
Josh, how you doing?

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.410
JOSH GORDON: I'm doing great.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.200
Thanks for coming to New York.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.890
It's good to have you.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:03.212
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Hey, your welcome.

00:02:03.212 --> 00:02:04.128
It's great to be here.

00:02:04.128 --> 00:02:06.900
So I'm asking my best DA buds,
when you leave the office,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.840
and you get some time
to relax and renew,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.520
and you still want
to do some coding,

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.100
what are you going to play with?

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.520
JOSH GORDON: I am going to
relax and renew with TensorFlow.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.270
As you heard from the awesome
[INAUDIBLE] a couple weeks ago,

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.830
TenserFlow--

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:17.950
TIMOTHY JORDAN: He was on
the show a couple weeks ago.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:18.670
JOSH GORDON: He's phenomenal.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.920
But TensorFlow is a new
open source machine learning

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.560
tool kit released by Google.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.260
And specifically what
I'm going to play

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.134
is with using
TensorFlow on Android.

00:02:26.134 --> 00:02:28.050
TIMOTHY JORDAN: If you
were to play with that,

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.010
let's say, on your
Android device,

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.920
what would it look like?

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.003
JOSH GORDON: Well, I have
an awesome demo for you.

00:02:32.003 --> 00:02:34.691
And this is TensorFlow running
a computer vision model.

00:02:34.691 --> 00:02:36.940
And the way this will work
is I'll activate the camera

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:37.772
on my phone.

00:02:37.772 --> 00:02:39.730
Then I'll point the phone
at different objects,

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.290
and it will tell
me what they are.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.040
For example, if I point
it at this banana,

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.640
it will say this is a
banana or this is an apple

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.260
or this is an Android doll.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.050
And it works quite
well, all in real time,

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.780
running just on the device,
super fast, no Wi-Fi

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.519
or any kind of cloud
access necessary.

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.060
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
how does it work?

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.730
JOSH GORDON: Well,
it uses something

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.535
called the convolutional
neural network.

00:02:57.535 --> 00:02:58.910
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
And what is that?

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.535
JOSH GORDON: Well,
to learn about that,

00:03:00.535 --> 00:03:03.210
I'm actually working on a series
of videos called "Demystifying

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.791
Deep Learning," and they'll be
released in a couple months.

00:03:05.791 --> 00:03:07.540
And they will teach
you from the ground up

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.580
what a CNN actually
is and how it works.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.788
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's great.

00:03:10.788 --> 00:03:12.670
So today they can
play with TensorFlow

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.380
by going to tensorflow.org.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.880
And in a few months, we're going
to learn even more from you

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.890
about how to do machine
learning in their apps?

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.556
JOSH GORDON: Absolutely,
and by the way,

00:03:20.556 --> 00:03:23.275
the tutorials on tensorflow.org
are top notch, so highly

00:03:23.275 --> 00:03:25.650
recommend them, and you can
try this stuff out right now.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.510
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank
you for joining us

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.420
on this holiday edition
of "The Developer Show."

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.700
JOSH GORDON: Thanks for
having me, and stay warm.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.250
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.
