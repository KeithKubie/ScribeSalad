Schmitt:
THE APOLLO 17 MISSION

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.934
WAS TARGETED TO EXPLORE
THE VALLEY OF TAURUS-LITTROW.

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:10.701
WE HAD ADDITIONAL DAYS
IN LUNAR ORBIT

00:00:10.701 --> 00:00:14.968
FOR RECONNAISSANCE AND
OBSERVATIONS OF LUNAR FEATURES.

00:00:14.968 --> 00:00:16.734
THERE WERE SPECIFIC TARGETS,

00:00:16.734 --> 00:00:18.534
BUT THEY WERE
GEOLOGICAL TARGETS.

00:00:18.534 --> 00:00:19.968

Narrator:
THE CREW'S FIRST DUTY

00:00:21.501 --> 00:00:25.667
IS TO OFFLOAD EQUIPMENT
FROM THE LUNAR MODULE.

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:32.601
THIS INCLUDES THE 460-POUND
LUNAR ROVING VEHICLE, OR LRV.

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:35.400
DEVELOPED
AT A COST OF $38 MILLION

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.968
TO OPERATE IN THE LOW-GRAVITY
VACUUM OF THE MOON,

00:00:38.968 --> 00:00:41.167
THE LRV ENABLES
THE TWO ASTRONAUTS

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:42.968
TO TRAVEL ACROSS ITS SURFACE

00:00:42.968 --> 00:00:46.434
AT A MAXIMUM SPEED
OF 8 MILES PER HOUR.

00:00:47.934 --> 00:00:51.834
OBVIOUSLY, WE WERE PAYING
ATTENTION TO THE DRIVING,

00:00:51.834 --> 00:00:55.734
MAKING SURE WE DIDN'T DAMAGE
[Chuckling] THE LUNAR ROVER

00:00:55.734 --> 00:00:58.234
ON A ROCK OR IN A CRATER
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT --

00:00:58.234 --> 00:01:01.300
THAT YOU DIDN'T HIT IT SO HARD
THAT THE FRONT END FELL OFF

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.133
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:06.634
SO HAVING TWO PAIRS OF EYES
LOOKING OUT WAS IMPORTANT,

00:01:06.634 --> 00:01:09.734
IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT
I WAS TRYING TO MAKE SURE

00:01:09.734 --> 00:01:12.367
THAT I WAS UNDERSTANDING
WHAT THE GEOLOGY WAS

00:01:12.367 --> 00:01:14.934
IN THE VALLEY OF TAURUS-LITTROW.

00:01:14.934 --> 00:01:16.767
Narrator:
DURING THEIR THREE-DAY MISSION,

00:01:16.767 --> 00:01:19.267
THE ROVER HELPED
SCHMITT AND CERNAN COLLECT

00:01:19.267 --> 00:01:22.734
OVER 240 POUNDS
OF LUNAR ROCK AND DIRT,

00:01:22.734 --> 00:01:26.200
MORE THAN ON
ANY OTHER APOLLO MISSION.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.434
I THINK ALL OF THE ASTRONAUTS
WERE AWARE OF THE VALUE,

00:01:30.434 --> 00:01:33.367
SCIENTIFIC VALUE,
OF THE LUNAR SAMPLES.

00:01:33.367 --> 00:01:35.267
I CERTAINLY WAS, BEING A VERY --

00:01:35.267 --> 00:01:37.467
BEING PROFESSIONALLY INVOLVED
IN THEIR ANALYSIS

00:01:37.467 --> 00:01:39.467
AND REMAIN SO TODAY.

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:42.367
WHEN WE CAME TO A SITE THAT
WE HAD PLANNED TO STOP AT,

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:44.200
I WOULD GET OFF THE ROVER FIRST

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.634
AND WANDER AROUND
AND DO RECONNAISSANCE,

00:01:46.634 --> 00:01:49.000
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT,
"OKAY, WHAT IS IMPORTANT HERE?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.834
WHAT MIGHT NOT BE IMPORTANT?"

00:01:50.834 --> 00:01:54.400
AND ADD THAT TO THE TASKS
THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN DECIDED

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.033
WOULD BE UNDERTAKEN
AT THAT SITE.

00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:59.534
THEN, WE WOULD
GO INTO OUR SAMPLING MODE.

00:01:59.534 --> 00:02:02.467
AND ONCE YOU DECIDED
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA BE SAMPLING,

00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:04.200
THEN THAT WAS FAIRLY AUTOMATIC,

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.834
BECAUSE WE HAD TRAINED TO DO
THESE VARIOUS TASKS

00:02:06.834 --> 00:02:10.000
FOR SO LONG AND SO FREQUENTLY.

SCHMITT AND CERNAN'S EXPLORATION

00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:15.901
OF THE MOON'S IMPACT CRATERS
USING THE LRV

00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:18.601
PROVIDES ASTRONOMERS
WITH VITAL INSIGHTS

00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:22.601
INTO THE HISTORY OF OUR PLANET'S
CLOSEST COSMIC NEIGHBOR.

00:02:22.601 --> 00:02:24.901
Schmitt: IT TURNS OUT
MOST OF THAT CRATER IN HISTORY

00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:27.634
OCCURRED A LONG TIME AGO --
BILLIONS OF YEARS AGO.

00:02:27.634 --> 00:02:29.801
AND WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE,
WE REALIZED THAT

00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:33.300
THE MOON WAS RECORDING
THE HISTORY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.
