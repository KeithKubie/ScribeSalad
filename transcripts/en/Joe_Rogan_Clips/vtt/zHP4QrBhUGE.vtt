1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.670
The Joe Rogan experience.
Um,
so you've have you never written your act down?

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.160
Um,
no I couldn't.
I used,
see I used to do sketch comedy,
like,

3
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.250
like a Monty python thing and I wrote those and then I was doing a street full

4
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:20.780
of for four years.
And that's very unwritten.
I know that's very difficult,

5
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.070
right.
It's difficult to actually develop material for that.

6
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.230
So I did that for four years.
So I got into this thing of,

7
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:29.040
well I'll do performing like how,
so what would you do?
Um,
we,

8
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:30.120
we were double act initially.

9
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:35.121
Me and my partner rob and we did weigh things are escaping from a wooly jumper.

10
00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:38.450
He just wrap a wooly jumper.
I returned to escape wooly jumper.

11
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.690
What does that Willie Cardigan we really pull over?
Pull over.
Okay.
Yeah.

12
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.350
I got sweater.
Yes.
Sweater.
Yeah.
So instead of a straight jacket,

13
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.460
he said we'd take this really sweat because take a sweater.
Just ridiculous.

14
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.230
Ridiculous.
I'm a,

15
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:56.940
I'm making a bowl of cornflakes disappear because you ate it.
Yeah.
I hate it.

16
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.590
So at its best they go,
this is insane.
These guys are crazy.

17
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.120
And they clapped when they give us five minutes and when it was,
it was the guy.

18
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.980
These people are insane.
This is awful.
And they broke away.

19
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.660
Then we did sword fighting.

20
00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:13.450
That was good because I directed three musketeers that university and uh,

21
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.490
so we would doing,
showing you how to kill someone when drunk when thing,

22
00:01:16.491 --> 00:01:19.650
when you,
when you do,
you know,
all these different moves.
So that was quite fun.

23
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.490
Then I went solo and I was doing escapology from chains and ropes and then from

24
00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:28.350
a five foot unicycle from a pair of manacles escapology meaning I escape Ology

25
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.730
ESCO real thing.
Is that once the apology,
you guys really call it that?
Yeah.

26
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.160
What do you call it?
Oh,
I don't think is a name for it.
Never even heard of that.

27
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.800
I think it,
Google will tell us there is an escape.
Artists,

28
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.440
I know there's escape artists.
Escapology does it exist?
Who?

29
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.630
The word it his word?
There's a thing called a skip ology.

30
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:48.300
Live escape games were on escape rooms and there's a bunch of them.

31
00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:51.270
I don't know if it's the same thing as escape rooms.
Escape rooms.

32
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.720
Go apology should be a Wiki on art form.

33
00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:56.730
It's almost like it's not right off is a craft.

34
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.240
Well know Houdini was an artist of that.
I was uh,

35
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.940
I was at jumping crofting there.
It is practically escaping from restraints,

36
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:09.420
right?
Yeah,
yeah.
There you go.
Steal Books.
She's barrels,
bags,
things.

37
00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:11.490
So I was escaping from ropes and chains.

38
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.180
And you made a conscious decision to do this like on the street,

39
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.040
like this is how you're developing.
Yeah,

40
00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:19.980
that was developing because I couldn't get my sketch comedy thing wasn't going.

41
00:02:19.981 --> 00:02:23.160
I,
there's a thing called the Edinburgh festival.
We have Scotland.
Yeah.

42
00:02:23.161 --> 00:02:26.550
You know that one.
So I did 12 of those in the ends right before I took her off.

43
00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:30.780
So I did three doing sketch and then about four doing street.

44
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.440
But on the street you have this freedom.

45
00:02:32.441 --> 00:02:34.890
We know the freedom when things of working a bit and,

46
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.570
and it's really kind of feral.
Um,
no one's checking you out.

47
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.940
No one knows what you're doing.
You're just on the street.

48
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.680
So I was useless at this.
And then I developed a confidence,
a gut confidence.

49
00:02:46.681 --> 00:02:49.410
You know that that stomach's really important.
Probably isn't fighting as well.

50
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.030
There's something that comes out of the,

51
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.960
there's a confidence center in the stomach.
Real.
Yeah.

52
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.440
There's something about the stomach.
You,
you look into it with fighting.

53
00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.150
I think it's neurons,
right?
It's like there's something,
everything joins the,

54
00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.650
there's something to do with it.
Anyway,

55
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:06.610
I felt I developed this confidence on my own to go and stand on.

56
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.050
If you ever seen had the film,

57
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:13.000
my fair lady or seen a film of Eliza Doolittle that is set on coven garden,

58
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:16.840
it's a massive,
Piet said massive square.
Um,

59
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.610
Washington Square Park in New York was another straight before in place.

60
00:03:20.611 --> 00:03:24.640
So it's a big open place and I could stand up that on my own and talk to no one

61
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.210
and build up an audience.
I would set out these tea cozies,

62
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:32.800
which a little animal tea cozies ducks and hamsters that weird things.

63
00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:35.440
Things that just look like animals and put them on the floor.

64
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:36.760
And people thought this guy's crazy.

65
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:38.140
And then I'd start talking and there'll be no,

66
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.890
literally no one there sometimes and I'd take it often.

67
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.290
Then I'm going to do a show.
Welcome to the invisible audience.

68
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.310
Very nice to have you here.

69
00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:49.390
And I had this confidence if I just kept talking a bit like you know in your,

70
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.330
your podcast here,
you know,
you keep talking,
I can queue and I go on.

71
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:54.730
Yeah we've got to the awesome visible people here as well.

72
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:56.410
This is Dan is Jack and Kenyans guy.

73
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.980
And I would just go on and on until I built up about 20 people and then I could

74
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:03.520
start the shower,
then we'd get into it.
And if you're doing an escapology show,

75
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.640
in the end you're going to get out.
You've worked out how to get out.

76
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.600
And so there will be a definite end and then you can say,
now go,
please,

77
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:13.630
can you give me some money?
So that's how I am my living.

78
00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:18.070
But that's the Ninja training of performing because I learned to perform when

79
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:21.360
people didn't even want to see me right now.
Cause normally they've cut,

80
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.620
they've come into a room,
at least I go,
okay,
who is this guy?

81
00:04:23.621 --> 00:04:26.170
Then I we're in the room so let's drink a beer and watch.

82
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.150
But if they're on the street,
they don't have to watch.

83
00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:32.570
They can just walk off and they often dead.
So it was a tough,
I have,

84
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.730
I lost all my confidence on the street.
In fact,
I,
in fact I did a thing,

85
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.450
army does this,
you know,
uh,
break you down,
build you back at the marines,

86
00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:44.560
break you,
then build you back out.
Uh,
they also in,
in,
in a drama school,

87
00:04:44.561 --> 00:04:46.540
they break you down and build you buy all this kind of idea.

88
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.890
I accidentally broke myself down and built myself back up on the streets of

89
00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:55.210
London.
So wow.
It's kind of beautiful.
That's why I was creatively born.

90
00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.220
Uh,
this,
the version that had this thing.
Okay,
we're going to talk about chickens.

91
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.220
How many chickens did it take to change a light bulb?
Well,
quite a lot.
Ready?

92
00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:05.170
Cause you know,
they can't.
Um,

93
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.620
and as I had a friend with maybe a dog could help them or they could rig up

94
00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:12.760
something.
I just waffle on stuff.
And if he didn't hit a punchline,
I didn't care.

95
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:14.080
I just carried on,
just kept going.

96
00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:18.430
And then the confidence things Kinda gets you through.
He just talks for hours.

97
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.750
Yeah.
