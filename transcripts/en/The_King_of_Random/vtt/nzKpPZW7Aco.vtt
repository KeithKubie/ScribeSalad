00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.660
Caution! Random Experiments In Progress. I don't know how long we're gonna have them

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.860
but they're available now. So go get yourself a King Of Random t-shirt while you can.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.260
Hey guys, welcome back. I'm Nate. Thanks for joining me today on The King Of Random.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.300
In our previous video, we showed you how to take zinc powder and sulphur and mix them together

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.160
into a fast reacting compound that could potentially be used as rocket fuel

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.540
Well today, we're gonna show you how to turn that potential into something highly kinetic

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.430
Rockets made from pens. Rockets are a lot of fun

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.300
but they can sometimes seem a little daunting or tricky to get into.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.740
They have special engines, parachutes, launch pads and groups of engineers who build them.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.480
Well the purpose of today's video is to show you how to easily build a

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.360
rocket at home that can be made for just a few bucks and in very little time

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.299
Here's the materials that we'll be using for this project today

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.260
The body of our rocket is going to be made from a ballpoint pen. Be sure to get the pens with the hexagonal

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.740
cross-section. The six sides will help you line up your fins. We'll need some cardboard

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.270
I got mine from a cereal box, a glue gun

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.069
High heat or low heat will work, some super glue, a straw used for stirring coffee,

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.260
some foam earplugs and of course some of the zinc and sulfur rocket fuel from our last video

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.960
We have all of our supplies now, let's get building

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.120
The first step is to remove the back of the pen.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.660
On the pens I have the back doesn't want to come off easily

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.750
So I'm drilling a hole in the back of it and using a threaded screw to pull the back off

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.869
Once the back is removed, you want to pull off the top of the pen and remove the ink cartridge

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.120
Put a small amount of glue on the top of the pen and put it back in the pen body.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.790
Now let's make our fins. Cut a strip of cardboard five eighths of an inch wide

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.440
Once you have the strip cut, slice off three one-inch lanes

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.229
From one corner, remove a piece at a 45-degree angle

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.259
Once you've got three of these you have your rocket fins

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.109
Cut a small piece of your straw about one-inch long

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.400
if you can't find any of these coffee stirring straws you can also roll up a piece of paper

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.500
about one inch wide and an inch and a half long. The ear plugs will be used as a safety measure

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.679
attached to the top of the rocket. This way when the rock comes down in case it lands somewhere

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.860
We weren't planning it's less likely to break or damaged anything.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.980
To be sure that our foam ear plug stays nicely on the tip of the rocket

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.220
let's melt a small hole in the back of it. Holding a nail with a pair of pliers,

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.910
quickly heat it up in a flame.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.279
While it's still hot, carefully use it to melt a small hole in the center of the back of the ear plug

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.760
We've now got all of our parts ready, let's assemble our rocket.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.340
Apply a small strip of hot glue to one side of the pen

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.160
Secure the fin perpendicular to the body of the pen so that the end of the fin lines up with the end of the pen

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.840
On one of the sides between two of the fins, you'll want to attach your straw

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.120
If you're using a high heat glue gun, let the glue cool a little bit before attaching the straw or it could melt

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.720
Final step is to apply a little bit of super glue to the tip of the pen and use it to secure the earplug in place.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.920
There you have it. You've now built a complete rocket

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.169
It's extremely simple and at this point the only thing left to do is test it out

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.379
We've got our completed rocket and our zinc sulfur fuel

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.229
Let's put some fuel in the rocket and see if we can get it to launch

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.900
Our rocket is now full of fuel

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.220
I'm gonna put it on the launch pad and fire it off using the N64 controller built in a previous video.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.040
Don't worry, we'll explain how to make these igniters in our launch pad in our next video

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.719
Alright here goes nothing. Three, two, one

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.400
Oh!  I see it. I saw it. I don't see it anymore, but I saw it for a second

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.079
It gonna come down over there somewhere if it hasn't already

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.490
Okay, that was really cool. It launched up really fast like that took off like a bullet

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.240
I think I was able to see it up in the sky for just a little bit

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.029
It's a nice sunny day, and they're like the reflective casing of the pen

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.450
I saw some glimmering up there. It looked like it turned a little bit in the sky

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.069
but not like. It didn't go crazy didn't launch off in weird directions just up

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.859
That was a good launch. Several hundred feet up there definitely

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.710
Three, two, one

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.580
Launching in three, two, one

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.360
That did not go straight at all. Hmm

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:58.269
Okay that thing just takes off like a rocket or make like a bullet

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.539
Maybe I don't know these. They launch up super fast into the air

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:05.679
You can barely see where they're going. You just see sort of a plume of green fire and white smoke

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.689
and then they're gone. And you can follow them a little bit

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:11.049
But I should warn you often these Rockets are sacrificial. They launch

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.339
and you can't really find them again unless they happen to go particularly straight up and straight back down

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.480
I'll do my best to strike the drone down out of the air

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.840
That exploded I think. I don't think it went anywhere. I think you just blew up...

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:37.658
Think that was a good launch. That looked like it went pretty straight up. It went fast cuz they always go fast

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:44.949
It didn't look like the pen exploded which might have happened a little bit so far. Nothing, not a big explosion

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:50.619
But we've had something that kind of broke off and went wonky, but that one was good. I liked that one

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.620
I want to see what that looks like from the drone

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.860
Made ourselves a little crater in the grass almost... dusty

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.780
There you have it, we've now had several successful launches with these little pen Rockets

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.120
These things are a blast. Pun intended. To quickly recap how we built this,

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.140
We took a cheap six sided ballpoint pen. Remove the back and the ink tube

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.159
Glued the top on. Added some small cardboard fins and a little guiding straw

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:21.699
Then we added a small foam ear plug to the tip just as a precautionary measure

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.400
so it doesn't cause any damage or injure anything if it comes down

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.560
where it's not supposed to. Using the zinc and sulfur mixture we talked about in our last video.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.180
We filled the pen with the rocket fuel and launched it up. It worked pretty well

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.989
We did have a couple issues with rockets launching off sideways

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.159
I think most of those were caused by the guiding straw breaking off from the pen body

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:43.058
I might have let the glue cool too long in an effort to not melt the plastic

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:45.429
but I think that also made the connection weaker

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:50.828
Reinforcing the connection of the straw to the pen body seems to fix the problem. This has been a great project

00:06:50.829 --> 00:06:55.129
and I'm excited to show you how we built our launch pad and electric igniter in tomorrow's video

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.609
Thanks for joining us for this video today, and we'll see you in the next one. Talk to you then.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:07.840
Okay, here's the rocket that like turned a 90 degree angle and just launched

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.120
I thought it went way more over that way, alright.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.360
The words of Adam Savage, failure is always an option

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.120
