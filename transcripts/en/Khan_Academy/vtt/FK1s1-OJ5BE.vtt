00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.480
Before we go into
possible theories

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.920
as to why plates actually move,
what I want to do in this video

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.610
is think a little bit about why
we see the geological features

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.760
we do see at plate boundaries.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.020
And in particular, I want
to focus on the features

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.040
we see at divergent
plate boundaries,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.120
where the plates are moving
away from each other,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.910
or where new land
is being created

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.400
like we saw in the mid-oceanic
ridges, where we see

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.730
new land being created
right in the center

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.780
and moving outwards from them.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.220
So to do that, let's think
about the different layers.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.290
And actually I want to
make one quick correction

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.430
on the last video.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.160
Over here I had drawn these
arrows going in that direction.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.700
And based on how I
defined them they

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.990
should have been
going into the page.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.920
And so they should have
had these X's there.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.420
Now, with that out
of the way, let's

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.160
draw a little diagram
of what happens

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.130
in the early stages of these
divergent plate boundaries.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:59.070
So you might have
your just your crust,

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.340
and maybe it's
continental crust.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.480
So this right here
is the Earth's crust.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.842
And then you have the
solid part of the mantle,

00:01:08.842 --> 00:01:10.800
and the combination of
them is the lithosphere.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.460
And then you have
the liquid part,

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.420
or the super hot
part of the mantle.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.755
So this down here is magma.

00:01:22.755 --> 00:01:23.630
It hasn't solidified.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.560
It's hot enough to be
in the liquid state.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.520
And all of this combined,
so this right here we

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.375
consider the mantle.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.860
Now, there's some
debate, and we'll

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.276
talk about this
in the next video,

00:01:35.276 --> 00:01:37.350
of how hot spots actually form.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.780
It could be these
mantle plumes that

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.580
start at the border between
the mantle and the core.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.440
It could be some type
of convection currents

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.456
in the actual mantle.

00:01:46.456 --> 00:01:48.330
We'll talk more about
that in the next video,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.750
or maybe a few videos from now.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.500
But let's take it for
granted that hot spots form

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.860
in the mantle.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.030
So let's say we have an
area of magma right here

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.540
that is particularly hot.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.660
Let me do this in another color.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.680
I'll do it in pink.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.130
So this is particularly
hot magma here.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.792
And we know, or
maybe we don't know,

00:02:08.792 --> 00:02:11.250
well, you'll learn right now,
if you take the same material

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.730
and you make it
hotter it's going

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.270
to become less dense, because
the particles essentially

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.720
are going to bump into each
other with more kinetic energy

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.230
and have more space
in between them.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.860
And so this really
hot part of the magma,

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.960
or this really hot
part of the mantle, it

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.650
is going to move upwards,
because it is less dense.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.310
It will have buoyancy.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.160
And as it moves upwards, it will
heat up the things around it.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.750
And it will eventually make
its way into the lithosphere.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.260
And it'll kind of be able to
break through the lithosphere

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.510
because it's so hot it can
kind of melt its way through.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.240
So let's fast forward this.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.220
Let's fast forward
this a little bit.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.150
So this is step one up here.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.620
Now step two.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.975
This hot magma is rising
now through the lithosphere,

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:56.600
and so it's going to
create a hot spot.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.600
It's going to create a
dome in the lithosphere

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.210
and actually on the crust.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.270
And so it might look like this.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.950
So the crust is now going
to have a dome in it.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.270
And this was the
original lithosphere.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.000
And it's now kind of been
broken in two by this hot spot.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.690
So the lithosphere
is now broken in two,

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.060
or it's about to be broken
in two by this hot spot.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.490
So all of this is
still the lithosphere.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.420
I'll just write litho for short.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.050
This up here is the crust.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.355
And if you take any rigid
material, and the crust

00:03:30.355 --> 00:03:32.480
and the lithosphere for
that matter, they're rigid,

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.950
and you push outward on
it, it won't stretch nicely

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.550
like a nice elastic balloon.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.280
It'll start to crack and have
to be pulled apart in order

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.370
to kind of take the
pushing from below.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.909
So this crust is going
to start to crack.

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:47.950
And actually, the best
example where you see this

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.710
is actually in like
sourdough bread

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.600
that has really hard
shells around it.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.760
You see sourdough bread.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.840
Let me see if I can draw
a roll of sourdough bread.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.870
It has all of these
cracks in the surface.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.120
And that's because the
outer layer, the outer shell

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.830
of the bread, is really rigid.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.410
And so the inside heats up and
the surface area has to expand.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.190
These kind of rifts
form in the bread

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.700
to allow that kind of rigid
shell to actually expand.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.940
And that exact same
thing would happen

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.790
to the crust, or actually
the entire lithosphere.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.315
So let me draw this
hot spot again.

00:04:24.315 --> 00:04:26.810
Let me do it in that pink color.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.450
Now the hot spot
has gotten this far.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.930
This is the hot magma
right over here.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.377
And if we fast forward
even a little bit more,

00:04:38.377 --> 00:04:39.960
then you could
actually have the crust

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.340
starting to be
fully pulled apart.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.760
So you fast forward
a little bit more,

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.560
the bottom boundary
of the lithosphere

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.270
maybe now starts to look
something like this.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.160
The magma has kind of broken
through the hardened part,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.860
the rigid part of the mantle.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.640
So maybe it looks
like this right now.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.080
You have your hot
spot right over here.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.630
It's gotten that far now.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.650
And the crust on top, the actual
what we would kind of normally

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.370
see has now been pulled
apart to kind of have

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.960
to cover this new surface area.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.570
So now it kind of looks
something like this.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.420
So it's been pushed apart.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.636
Let me see how well
I can draw this.

00:05:23.636 --> 00:05:25.510
So now it's been pushed
apart, and as it gets

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.434
pushed apart it kind of
thins out a little bit

00:05:27.434 --> 00:05:28.600
as you can imagine it doing.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.110
It's almost exactly
as the bread analogy.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.980
When you look at bread like
this the rift, the depressions

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.380
where it was expanding
most vigorously,

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.440
those parts of the bread
are actually thinner,

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.565
like these parts of the
bread are actually thinner,

00:05:41.565 --> 00:05:44.190
and they're not as hard as
the parts that moved away.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.800
And you see that exact same
thing happening with the land.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.020
And all of this
stuff is continuously

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.550
getting pushed
outward, essentially

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.280
to kind of make space
for this hot spot.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.380
Now, this step
right over here, you

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.120
might have a volcano or
two, but more important,

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.780
you're going to have what's
called a rift valley.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.480
Right now we're assuming that
we're not below sea level yet,

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.010
or we're assuming that
this kind of depression

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.030
in the land that
you see here hasn't

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.210
come in contact with
another body of water.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.310
And so it'll just kind
of become a little valley

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.950
in between higher land.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.930
And you actually
see that on Earth.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.710
And the most famous is
the African Rift Valley.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.126
That's right about
this region here.

00:06:28.126 --> 00:06:29.500
Actually, I have
a better diagram

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.990
that depicts the African
Rift Valley right over here.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.060
It's this whole region
of Africa is actually

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:41.770
kind of a big valley created
by a hot spot right over there.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.720
Now, as the hot spot kind
of keeps maturing eventually

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.420
some of the rift will
become so depressed

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.220
that it will actually
be below sea level.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.200
Remember, all this land up
here is being stretched apart.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.680
So let me go to the next step.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.840
The next step will
be right over here.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.980
The land on top is now
maybe below sea level

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.730
in this next step, and
it comes in contact

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.910
with maybe an ocean or a sea.

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.260
And so now it might
look like this.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.980
So now the land is
super thin on top.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.820
I'll do my best to draw it.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.580
So it's super thin
on top, and remember

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:26.790
it kind of keeps
getting pulled apart

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.290
from this bubble of hot magma
that's essentially coming up

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:32.980
from below.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.970
Let me draw it like this.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.880
This is all solid rock here.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.680
What I drew in
orange is the crust.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:46.320
This is kind of the
rocky part of the mantle.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.350
So the combination
is the lithosphere.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.747
And now you have the hot
magma coming up like this.

00:07:52.747 --> 00:07:54.580
And it might peek through
every now and then

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.780
and create a volcano there.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.946
Maybe it'll peak through
and create a volcano there.

00:07:57.946 --> 00:08:01.570
But in general, it's going
to keep pushing the land up

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:02.231
and outwards.

00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:04.230
And so this land, even
though you're saying hey,

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:06.910
it's being pushed up, because
of the outward motion,

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.580
this land over here
is going to be lower

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.910
than the land around it,
like the loaf of bread.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.400
If it gets low enough
and comes in below sea

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.579
level actually and comes in
contact with a body of water,

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:18.120
or even if it doesn't
actually, water

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.910
will start to gather over there.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.540
And once again, we
actually see that

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:31.070
in the rift forming between
the African and Arabian plates.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:34.809
The Red Sea is actually an
example of exactly that.

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:38.530
The Arabian Plate is moving
away from the African

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.280
Plate because of this hot spot.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.759
This is pushing all of the land
up and out right over here.

00:08:44.759 --> 00:08:45.800
And so this is going out.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.030
That is going out.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.172
It's moving outward
in every direction.

00:08:49.172 --> 00:08:50.630
And so it creates
these depressions

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.860
where water can flow inwards.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.570
The Rift Valley hasn't had
water flow into it the way

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.676
the Red Sea has just yet, but
if it kept happening eventually

00:08:58.676 --> 00:09:00.800
it's going to get low enough
so that the water will

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.460
flow into it.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.269
So the Red Sea is exactly that.

00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:04.810
You essentially have
the Indian Ocean

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:09.060
flowing into this rift that
formed from this hot spot.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.020
And then if you fast forward
a bunch so that finally

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.360
the magma can kind of surface.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.450
So let's fast forward from
even this point even more.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.370
So let's fast forward
even more, and let's say

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.300
now the land has been
pushed a good bit apart.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.720
Now the hot spot has
actually surfaced.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.740
Now the crust might look
something like this.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:34.750
So it's been pushed apart
a good bit at this point.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:38.480
Now we're talking about on the
order of hundreds of thousands

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.270
of years or tens of
thousands of years.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.920
So the land, for example,
the land that was here,

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.850
this part of the land
might now be out here.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:49.890
And this part of the land
might now be out here.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:53.020
What's going to happen
is that this hot spot

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.700
is going to continue
to fuel, and we're

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.940
assuming everything's
underwater at this point.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.790
Since this depression that
was created is now so low

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.380
the crust was stretched thin.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.076
We're going to assume that
all of this is underwater.

00:10:05.076 --> 00:10:06.450
The hot spot is
essentially going

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:13.600
to come out of
underwater volcanoes

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.560
and start creating what's now--
this body of water's gotten

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.410
large enough that we can
call it a mid-oceanic ridge.

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:29.180
And so it'll actually start
creating an actual ridge

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.060
with volcanoes in the center.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:39.770
So that's why one, we see things
like the Rift Valley in Africa,

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:41.565
we see things like the Red Sea.

00:10:41.565 --> 00:10:43.190
And maybe even more
importantly, that's

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.590
why we see something like the
mid-Atlantic rift in the middle

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:49.110
of the Atlantic
Ocean, where you have

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.390
all of this depressed
land that was essentially

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.620
analogous to that Rift Valley
but it's at a much later stage.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.550
And that's why it's
able to collect water,

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.210
because when the
land was pushed out

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:01.630
and stretched thin water was
able to flow into it, going

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.360
back to the bread
analogy, essentially

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.200
when this bread was baking
and this part of the crust

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.704
pushed outwards, you
had this rift form,

00:11:10.704 --> 00:11:12.620
and then if there was
some water on the bread,

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:13.650
or if it was raining,
or if it was connected

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.066
to a body of water,
water would've

00:11:15.066 --> 00:11:17.230
eventually flowed in here.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:19.160
And if that bread
kept growing this rift

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.618
would have kept
growing, eventually

00:11:20.618 --> 00:11:24.710
to the size of the Atlantic
Ocean in our theoretical bread.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.550
And so that's why you have
this huge depressed area where

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.380
the ocean can form,
but in the middle of it

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.180
you kind of have this you
have this submersed you

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.230
have this actual
submersed mountain

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:36.880
chain, this submersed
chain of volcanoes,

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.030
this submersed ridge where
the land actually does go up

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:42.851
a little bit because of all
that magma flowing directly

00:11:42.851 --> 00:11:43.350
out of it.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.058
So hopefully that
clears up a little bit.

00:11:45.058 --> 00:11:47.550
That was always confusing to
me why you see uplifted land

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:51.160
but then everything around the
uplifted land is much lower,

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.280
and why the whole thing is
submersed as it's moving away.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.690
So hopefully that clears
things up a little bit.
