00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
&gt;&gt; WANG: This talk is not really a talk it's
more of a discussion. So, this is going to

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.470
be in a sense led--started, not led but started
by Dan Peterson and I. So, I encourage everybody

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:15.250
to sit as closely in the front row as possible
because this is going to be an interactive

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.660
seminar.
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: Seminar makes it sound very formal.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.210
&gt;&gt; We can just--going to, like all come forward,
so...

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.110
&gt;&gt; WANG: Yeah, just come forward, like...
&gt;&gt; ...take the seats, it will be much better.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.381
&gt;&gt; WANG: So, I don't actually have a lot of
slides for this because the reason for that

00:00:30.381 --> 00:00:33.299
is because...
&gt;&gt; Oh, we're not done going forward, yet?

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:35.910
&gt;&gt; WANG: Yes, okay. Everybody move forward,
move forward.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.860
&gt;&gt; You might fell like, wow...
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.229
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: I think we'll survive. People
are at their power cords.

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:46.800
&gt;&gt; WANG: Yes, yes. Okay, we might have to
pass the mic around. Okay, so the goal of

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.879
this session--it's not a talk, the goal of
this session is really to get everybody to

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.059
participate. We want to be build essentially
a wave as a community and a healthy one as

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.609
well. And this means all of us here in this
room. And so, what this discussion is about

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:11.950
is for us to think about how wave can actually
live on in this open community. So we do have

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.299
a--so Dan and I gave some initial thoughts
on a proposal of how we can potentially do

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:25.159
this for the future. And we would like to
open this up for a discussion on what is the

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.579
right thing.
&gt;&gt; So to be clear, what's Google's involvement

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.570
going to be after the end of this year?
&gt;&gt; WANG: It is--officially speaking, I do

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:38.729
not believe we have a clear statement of Google's
involvement past end of this year so I can't

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:39.729
comment on that just yet.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.678
&gt;&gt; WANG: It's not clear. It's not clear. It's
not clear. I'll take a look.

00:01:41.678 --> 00:01:43.109
&gt;&gt; Okay, the next question.
&gt;&gt; WANG: Yes?

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:47.460
&gt;&gt; Will we have an official statement before
the end of the week?

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.520
&gt;&gt; WANG: I might have to get back to you on
that one. Okay, so.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.290
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: So I think one thing that you
can be confident of is that the code contributions

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.140
that have been, you know, fast and furious
as of late will continue at least until the

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.999
end of the year. And I'll just let, you know,
frankly we're still working at the details

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:10.379
for anything beyond that. But I think that
the--I've been really excited to see the progress

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.000
that Wave in a Box has already made, you know,
since the words "Wave in a Box" became a thing,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.610
right? So it's been interesting. Oops.
&gt;&gt; SOREN: But I think it's best to say that

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.099
there's tomorrow, there are a couple of things
that we're going to announce and that will

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:32.330
I think give a clearer picture of Google's
involvement for them and the lack thereof

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.700
in there.
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: Yes, so, tomorrow morning. Soren

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.940
is just mentioning that I think there's somebody
not in the room today that will be giving

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.420
a talk that is working on something and going
to have an announcement in the morning that

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.249
will help make things a little bit more clearer
around Google's continued involvement.

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:52.569
&gt;&gt; That's good.
&gt;&gt; WANG: So, we do have some--so to--going

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.330
back to the discussion. We don't actually
have--so we have a proposal but we don't have

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.720
a "set in stone," so we want everybody here
to be able to participate. And remember this

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.141
is something that we own in this room together.
Not owned by down the line, all of us here

00:03:09.141 --> 00:03:15.720
own it. And if I could have perhaps someone
in the crowd who's happy to take some notes

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.540
that'll be good, maybe you.
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: Front row.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.370
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; WANG: Yes. By the way there's actually

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.370
a link to this inside the talks wave.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:36.230
WANG: Yes, cool. So we have a very, very--so
we gave a very brief thought about what we're

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.829
going to do with how wave's going to sort
of live on. And so we have a very high level

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:48.140
proposal. And our proposal is that let's let
the code called wave live on Apache Software

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.310
Foundation; the Incubator project. I'm not
sure if you guys have heard of it. I'm certainly

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.890
new to this myself.
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: So I imagine most people are

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.439
familiar with the Apache Software Foundation.
Intel's one big arm they do have is the Incubator

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.439
which is how new projects come about.
&gt;&gt; WANG: Yes.

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:08.890
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: So the Incubator, you sort of--you
get into it by you walking up with the community

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.439
in a some-cases code but not in all-cases
code. In this particular case we would have

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:16.530
a lot of code to bring to the table which
is both good and bad when you think about

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.160
it as sort of revving up new contributors
on an open source project. You don't really

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.800
want the code to be perfect because that makes
the bar to contributing a little bit too high.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.260
So, luckily we do have bugs and so it's a
good opportunity.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.950
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; WANG: So, pretty much you are to contain

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.030
all the code that we currently have which
includes data format, federation protocol,

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.200
the client and the server, the Robot API,
the gadget API, the whole lot. But before

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.160
we move on to details about Apache Software
Foundation, what do people in the crowd here

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.690
think about like how we should move on? How
wave should live on? Is this a good proposal,

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:00.150
like any other suggestions?
&gt;&gt; Does the Incubator be constrained around

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.010
anybody building a commercial?
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: So, no. It's a--as far as I'm

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.670
aware, no. It's--the question was does the
Incubator mean that it can't be commercial.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.220
I mean the Apache license is very much commercial-friendly
so I would have a hard time thinking that

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.921
there is a contradiction there.
&gt;&gt; WANG: Okay. It's a--John.

00:05:16.921 --> 00:05:17.921
&gt;&gt; JOHN: I oppose--no, my opinion on this
is that [INDISTINCT] talking about that. I'm

00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:18.921
also an attorney and I didn't have the ability
to find the list in free organization to be

00:05:18.921 --> 00:05:19.921
able sit in, you can then, you know, have
all the benefits in the recognized body IRS

00:05:19.921 --> 00:05:20.921
can get down. They're just managing, you know,
private entities, charitable entities. It

00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:42.830
can be a real problem and it's in terms of
having, you know, staff funding and that kind

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.700
of things. So, I think you're very wise to
attach yourself to an existing thriving organization

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:54.560
so you don't have to worry about the organizational
aspects and qualifications. If you want to

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.430
make donations that kind of thing, it's all
there. You know it's like getting all the

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.090
hired attorney's to do that.
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: Yes, speaking from my own experience

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.830
I can totally echo that sentiment. I helped
set up the Open Social Foundation and I don't

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.490
know that I necessarily want to go through
the same steps of creating a new intellectual

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.270
property, you know, oh, there's a lot of...
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Like it's a real headache.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.840
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: Right.
&gt;&gt; JOHN: And once you it get started, it's

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.000
a [INDISTINCT] thing to maintain.
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: Can everybody hear John in the

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.040
room? It's going to be real hard to do this
over the Ustream because it's a discussion,

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.040
but was everybody able to hear that?
&gt;&gt; It's our [INDISTINCT].

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.040
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: Okay, cool. All right.
&gt;&gt; What are the other [INDISTINCT]?

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.030
&gt;&gt; IAN: Before the trials [INDISTINCT] method.
The good thing about actually putting the

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:36.040
Incubator to a regular project, that actually
emboldens you to have--I think it was three

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.400
in different companies and in code. So more
often [INDISTINCT] a company joint [INDISTINCT]

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:52.050
they used for the total so you can retire
and [INDISTINCT], correct?

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.530
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: Yes. I think if we were to go
down the Apache Software and Foundation Incubator

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:01.470
path there are really sort of two bars that
we would have to cross before we'd be able

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.680
to graduate from a top level project--to become
a top level project. Number one is diversity

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.880
like Ian's getting at. And that, you know,
I want to make sure that there's a broad set

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.000
of contributors that aren't just funded by
one single company. Then the second one is

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.310
just managing the specifics of a release.
So, I think that one is more on a technical

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.070
end of things and the former is more on the
community end other things. Matt?

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:26.410
&gt;&gt; MATT: I want to know just what are the
other alternatives?

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:31.270
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: Well, I think the other alternatives
there's really anything under the sun, right?

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:35.190
But I think that we could do something where
we continue down the path of having it hosted

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:42.360
at code.google.com and it's more ad hoc basically.
I think we could also sort of the alternative

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:49.180
John is not supportive of, would be creating
our own non-profit and coming up with a system

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:54.500
of governance in that model. I think the--so
those are the three that come to my mind.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.690
I don't know if there are any others.
&gt;&gt; WANG: I mean, one of the reasons for Apache

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:05.170
to me--Dan and I had a talk is that Apache
comes with a set of not just--much as service

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:10.770
or it's code repository that comes with a
set of rules, governance, that's already sort

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:16.190
of pre-established, well proven that it works
in that way. And so just by latching onto

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:20.320
that procedure, the process sort of, could
save us a lot of like not just legality but

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:25.650
just effort as well, all right.
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: Yes. Apache itself is well known

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:31.920
for fostering good communities who happened
to build good software. And I think that's

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.060
exactly what we need here. Like, there is
a fair amount of software in existence but

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:38.210
I think it's more important that we establish
a good, strong, healthy community.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:43.110
&gt;&gt; I guess to reiterate sort of what you're
saying is by associating with Apache you give

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:47.510
more depth in your wave. And they go, "Oh,
yeah. Apache, that's the least successful

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:52.680
open source project." So it's like, you know,
in one cabinet I'd give them to another.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.200
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: Yes, I...
&gt;&gt; And right now the existence of...

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.550
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: Yeah, I think it's even more
that the meritocracy culture that Apache encourages

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:04.240
is even more powerful than their brand because
I think that it's been shown time and time

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.189
again that a great way to grow an open source
project isn't just by saying, "Everybody's

00:09:08.189 --> 00:09:12.850
now a committer," it's more of about saying,
you know, "Man, I'm really sick of taking

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:16.350
your Apaches. You're a committer now," like--and
by, "Sick of taking your Apaches," what that

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:20.810
means is, you've contributed three Apaches
and every time it's just somebody like David

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.829
has have to look through all of them and been
like, "This is just ready to go. It's perfect,"

00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:25.550
so it's like, "Why aren't you a committer
already?"

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:31.440
&gt;&gt; WANG: Right. I mean one change of mentality
here, which is our next slide, are on very

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.930
high level. We noticed that right now, we--I
mean Dan and I are essentially leading the

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:40.029
talk here, right? Because in a sense we've
been doing this for wave [INDISTINCT] but

00:09:40.029 --> 00:09:45.220
once you go to Apache, it's more like a very
flat, very doatocracy system where essentially

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:52.120
peers make decisions, everybody make decisions.
No, not just us. We're no longer--we're just

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:57.009
as equal as you guys. We're all equals. And
all decisions I made down on the mailing list

00:09:57.009 --> 00:10:03.329
everything's public, anyone can just use the
code. You're participation in the project

00:10:03.329 --> 00:10:07.829
is completely based on merit, or doatocracy,
or that's what they call it as well. Say,

00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:11.600
"If you can do it, hey, you have credit. You
own the thing," right? That you yourself,

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.079
who are sitting in the crowd today who are
just listening now becomes owners yourself.

00:10:15.079 --> 00:10:23.830
So this is real power. And we actually want
to have a varied contributors and this actually

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:28.720
top of the Apache process. You have to have
a variety of contributors before you can actually

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.510
graduate. And you see this is not just an
effort by us but--by us two here, but effort

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:38.260
from everybody in the crowd. And so, it can
only happen if everyone in the crowed wants

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.260
to do this.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I was going to say, I think if I

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.260
should get great places to go and you get
a lot of the graphic just by being associated

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.260
with Apache, but one of the things I've seen
on a lot of the Apache incubator projects,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.260
the ones that die are the ones that don't
have a road map.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.260
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: All right.
&gt;&gt; But the in terms of, you know, the Intel

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.260
and Apache where you're in the incubators,
some people would sort of know, it's not really

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.260
a mature project. And in order for that to--we've
got Steve and we've got what Daryl has just

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:50.329
shown, this is where we are, this is where
we're trying to go. And that would certainly

00:10:50.329 --> 00:11:05.120
be an open discussion in blocks of all community.
And even if you don't have that kind of a

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:39.084
sense it's hard for the community to rally
and because you interacting with people just

00:11:39.084 --> 00:11:40.084
by virtue of being an Incubator project, watching
it comes up. It is going to be worth my time

00:11:40.084 --> 00:11:41.084
and my [INDISTINCT].
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: Right, right. Yes, it's a good

00:11:41.084 --> 00:11:43.230
reminder. I think that--I think that's speaks
to two things really. One is that we'd want

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:48.099
to make sure the pace can stay high enough
but not screamingly fast.

00:11:48.099 --> 00:11:49.480
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: But I think--because extremely

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:54.850
fast would scare away new contributors but
then at same time, left with lots of features

00:11:54.850 --> 00:12:00.680
that you can add to Wave in a Box. So, I think
that having topics for a road map is pretty

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:06.230
easy to do. It will be more about who wants
to build X and then put it on the road map,

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:07.230
basically.
&gt;&gt; WANG: Yes.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:12.470
&gt;&gt; Yes, and it can be as simple as, "Here's
things that we've wanted for you and here's

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:15.579
things over the last couple of months that
we have."

00:12:15.579 --> 00:12:18.939
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: Yes. I think the good news is
actually a lot of what we're already doing

00:12:18.939 --> 00:12:22.720
in the community and the starter projects
and things like that are reasonably similar

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.879
to just--reasonably similar to how it would
be set up if we were in the Incubator land.

00:12:27.879 --> 00:12:33.740
The biggest difference being that the code
would be at apache.org instead of code.google.com

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.990
and the issue tracker too, you know, that
kind of thing.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:39.540
&gt;&gt; WANG: By the way, just to put it in more
concrete terms, I think we have a Les session

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:45.399
here on Wednesday, two days from now. How
many people actually want to actually do exactly

00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:50.580
what you said? Let's work out a road map for
this project. Who actually wants to participate?

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:56.180
So, I can see lots of people wants to participate.
Thank you. That's great. So let's--how about

00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:01.149
let's do slides--let's somehow--formal way
we communicate after the session. How we can

00:13:01.149 --> 00:13:05.040
like just write it on a piece of wave or document
or whatever. And when we get together again

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.160
on Wednesday and talk about what a road map
is and share it and get everybody's buy, because

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:16.470
I believe we Googler's have some idea of what
we want to do before the end of the year but

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:24.839
I think contribution for everybody is crucial.
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: And it's back. That's right,

00:13:24.839 --> 00:13:35.129
sweet. VC delay or something, I don't know.
Yes, so in terms of specifics on this proposal,

00:13:35.129 --> 00:13:41.699
the Apache Incubator has like an entry process.
And we--David's done a bunch of work to put

00:13:41.699 --> 00:13:47.589
together a draft proposal which has a bunch
of words that explains in Apache format basically,

00:13:47.589 --> 00:13:50.290
you know, "Here's what we want to do. Here's
why we want to do it. Here's some of the context

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:54.480
for what we're doing." And I think that it's
definitely a straw mat at this point but we

00:13:54.480 --> 00:14:00.130
can add that link into one of the waves with
the notes here and people are going to review

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:04.189
that over the next couple of days. We can
also jump off from there and have some type

00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:10.379
of road map discussion. I would encourage
conciseness on a road map but, you know, that's

00:14:10.379 --> 00:14:12.720
just me. James?
&gt;&gt; JAMES: Can you type for anybody on Apache?

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:19.180
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: Yes. So, I know a few people
who have been doing Apache things in the past

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:24.410
and I was involved with the Apache shindig
project. And I've already lined up a champion

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:29.600
for us which is one of the key things we would
need, via champion net would be the--our primary

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:36.079
mentor or our primary advocate inside Apache.
And then I think one open issue--well, that

00:14:36.079 --> 00:14:41.089
we make sure that we can find a few mentors
who are very familiar who can help us build

00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:46.550
the community in "the Apache way," as they
call it. I don't think that will be--I don't

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:51.529
think that will be the major obstacle. And
I think that--I think--I suspect Apache will

00:14:51.529 --> 00:14:53.990
be interested in having this project as the--in
the Incubator.

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:58.240
&gt;&gt; WANG: And by the way, just out of curiosity,
how many people here in the crowd has actually

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:03.310
worked on Apache project before?
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: Okay. Hey, Andy, you should raise

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:05.999
your hand.
&gt;&gt; WANG: Two people.

00:15:05.999 --> 00:15:09.800
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: What--what? Okay.
&gt;&gt; WANG: Yes. That's good, that's good. We

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.579
have two experienced...
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: Well, but--but, how about this?

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:17.069
Who's worked on an open source project before?
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: All right. All right. See that?

00:15:17.069 --> 00:15:19.779
That's actually, I would say, probably even
more important.

00:15:19.779 --> 00:15:49.290
&gt;&gt; Okay. Can it be if we a--the Apache clearance
is basically just a [INDISTINCT] and it might

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:50.290
be some [INDISTINCT] I'm assuming a hard task.
I--and Apache owning over the hard task, this

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:51.290
could prove to yourself that the [INDISTINCT]
committer, you're a long term committer and

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:52.290
that you [INDISTINCT] in the organization
[INDISTINCT] and I think you definitely have

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:53.290
to [INDISTINCT].
&gt;&gt; WANG: Okay. If we took a poll of people

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:54.290
who are playing muse tell him that this thing
is set in stone so it seems like any proposal.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:57.320
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: Well, I mean--I'm not hearing
any objections to the idea of going down the

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.870
Apache Incubator project.
&gt;&gt; WANG: Yeah.

00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:59.870
&gt;&gt; I believe it's the best option available
at the moment.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:00.870
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: Right.
&gt;&gt; It's the easy--not easiest but it's the

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:11.860
best option that as a supporting note to get
us in a frame way of putting it and go to

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.939
other people and say, "Look, we're still around,
we're not dead." And Apache has a name that

00:16:15.939 --> 00:16:17.009
is probably the best...
