really look at what the great set tires
 

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.049
really look at what the great set tires
are doing and what and what they're not

00:22:23.049 --> 00:22:23.059
are doing and what and what they're not
 

00:22:23.059 --> 00:22:25.360
are doing and what and what they're not
doing what they had to say no to what

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:25.370
doing what they had to say no to what
 

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:27.790
doing what they had to say no to what
they said okay this is a funny idea but

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:27.800
they said okay this is a funny idea but
 

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.200
they said okay this is a funny idea but
it doesn't belong here

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:29.210
it doesn't belong here
 

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:31.870
it doesn't belong here
uh and you compare the two and you see I

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:31.880
uh and you compare the two and you see I
 

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.690
uh and you compare the two and you see I
think you can see just how much more the

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:34.700
think you can see just how much more the
 

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.730
think you can see just how much more the
people in the other great San tires like

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:36.740
people in the other great San tires like
 

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.230
people in the other great San tires like
Young Frankenstein and so forth are

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240
Young Frankenstein and so forth are
 

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.510
Young Frankenstein and so forth are
really trying much harder and they're

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:40.520
really trying much harder and they're
 

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.280
really trying much harder and they're
much smarter and they should be

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:42.290
much smarter and they should be
 

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:44.770
much smarter and they should be
appreciated even more for it I think

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:44.780
appreciated even more for it I think
 

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.169
appreciated even more for it I think

that's sort of where I say no we really
should look at these people that are

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:48.410
should look at these people that are
 

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:51.400
