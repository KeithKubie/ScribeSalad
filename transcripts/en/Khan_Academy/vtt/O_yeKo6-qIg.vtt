00:00:00.351 --> 00:00:01.247
- [Voiceover] Anytime you're trying

00:00:01.247 --> 00:00:03.712
to come up with a
mechanism for a reaction,

00:00:03.712 --> 00:00:06.082
it's worthwhile to study
a little bit of what

00:00:06.082 --> 00:00:08.394
you are starting with
and then thinking about

00:00:08.394 --> 00:00:10.624
what you finish with and
think about what is different.

00:00:10.624 --> 00:00:12.488
So what we're starting
with, we could call this

00:00:12.488 --> 00:00:14.821
one, two, three, four, five,

00:00:17.147 --> 00:00:18.980
so this is, let's see,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.826
we have methyl group on
the number two carbon,

00:00:21.826 --> 00:00:25.325
it is a pentene, and that
is double-bond between

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:27.286
the number two and number three carbons,

00:00:27.286 --> 00:00:30.036
so this is two-methyl-pent-2-ene.

00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:41.441
So that's what we start with,

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:42.274
we're in the presence,

00:00:42.274 --> 00:00:44.189
we're in an acidic environment,

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:47.702
we've got what's gonna be
catalyzed by our hydronium here,

00:00:47.702 --> 00:00:52.023
and we end up with this,
and how is our product

00:00:52.023 --> 00:00:53.798
different from what we started with?

00:00:53.798 --> 00:00:56.810
Well the double bond is now gone,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.194
the number three carbon
gains this hydrogen,

00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:04.525
and now the number two carbon
gains a hydroxyl group.

00:01:04.525 --> 00:01:06.406
So one way to think about this is,

00:01:06.406 --> 00:01:09.474
in the presence of an
acid, it's acid-catalyzed,

00:01:09.474 --> 00:01:12.206
we have gained two
hydrogens and an oxygen,

00:01:12.206 --> 00:01:13.634
which is what we've gained,

00:01:13.634 --> 00:01:16.415
what could be used to make a water.

00:01:16.415 --> 00:01:17.742
And this is actually called an

00:01:17.742 --> 00:01:20.413
acid-catalyzed addition of water.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:22.646
The water isn't sitting on
one part of the molecule,

00:01:22.646 --> 00:01:24.042
but if you take the hydrogen we added,

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:26.054
and the hydroxyl we added,
if you combine them,

00:01:26.054 --> 00:01:29.220
that's what you need to make a water.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.620
So let's think about how we can,

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.367
how this actually happens in
the presence of our hydronium.

00:01:34.367 --> 00:01:38.837
So let me redraw this
molecule right over here.

00:01:38.837 --> 00:01:43.004
So we copy and paste it, so
that's not exactly it yet,

00:01:45.656 --> 00:01:47.972
that is just with the single bond.

00:01:47.972 --> 00:01:50.805
So let me draw, woops, wrong tool.

00:01:51.742 --> 00:01:54.449
Let me draw the double bond there.

00:01:54.449 --> 00:01:58.484
And now let me put it in the
presence of some hydronium.

00:01:58.484 --> 00:02:02.109
Alright, so we have an oxygen bonded, two.

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:06.541
So this would just be water,
as oxygen has two lone pairs,

00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:08.597
but hydronium is a situation where oxygen

00:02:08.597 --> 00:02:11.722
is sharing one of those lone
pairs with a hydrogen proton,

00:02:11.722 --> 00:02:14.179
thus making the entire molecule positive,

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:17.536
because the hydrogen proton is positive.

00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:21.792
So there you go, this now
has a positive charge.

00:02:21.792 --> 00:02:24.909
And this can be pretty reactive,
'cause we know that oxygen

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:28.848
is quite electronegative, it
lives to keep its electrons.

00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:32.315
So what is there was a
way, what if there's a way

00:02:32.315 --> 00:02:36.750
for the oxygen to take back
the electrons in this bond

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.106
right over here, the two
electrons in this bond.

00:02:40.106 --> 00:02:42.079
Well what if one of these carbons,

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.602
especially the ones that
have the double bonds,

00:02:44.602 --> 00:02:47.237
what if some of the electrons
from this double bond

00:02:47.237 --> 00:02:51.032
could be used to snab, to
take that hydrogen proton,

00:02:51.032 --> 00:02:55.237
and then oxygen can hog
its electrons again.

00:02:55.237 --> 00:02:57.097
And you might say, "oh that's reasonable,

00:02:57.097 --> 00:03:00.395
but which of these carbons
would actually do it?"

00:03:00.395 --> 00:03:02.439
And to think about which of
those carbons would do it,

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:05.791
we have to turn to Markovnikov's rule.

00:03:05.791 --> 00:03:08.677
Markovnikov's rule tells us that, look,

00:03:08.677 --> 00:03:11.625
if you have a reaction like
this, and alkene reaction,

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:14.498
the carbon that already
has, that's already attached

00:03:14.498 --> 00:03:17.442
to more hydrogens is more
likely to gain more hydrogens,

00:03:17.442 --> 00:03:19.518
the carbon that's attached
to more functional groups

00:03:19.518 --> 00:03:22.232
is more likely to gain
more functional groups.

00:03:22.232 --> 00:03:23.633
Another way to think
about it is think about,

00:03:23.633 --> 00:03:26.486
well that is the order of the carbons?

00:03:26.486 --> 00:03:28.945
Because the higher order of carbon,

00:03:28.945 --> 00:03:33.660
the more stable it will be if
it forms some type of cation.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.054
So if you look at this
carbon right over here,

00:03:36.054 --> 00:03:39.100
our number two carbon, let me circle it,

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.641
our number two carbon is bonded
to one, two, three carbons.

00:03:43.641 --> 00:03:46.736
So this is a tertiary carbon.

00:03:46.736 --> 00:03:49.003
This one right over here,

00:03:49.003 --> 00:03:50.662
this carbon on the other
side of the double bond

00:03:50.662 --> 00:03:52.971
is only bonded to one, two carbons.

00:03:52.971 --> 00:03:54.953
So this is a secondary carbon.

00:03:54.953 --> 00:03:57.621
So the tertiary carbon is
going to be more stable

00:03:57.621 --> 00:04:00.365
as a carbocation, you can think of it

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:02.855
as it can spread the charge a little bit.

00:04:02.855 --> 00:04:05.756
So it would be more likely
to lose the electrons

00:04:05.756 --> 00:04:08.461
in one of these, in one of these bonds,

00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:11.795
and so the way that we can
think about this mechanism,

00:04:11.795 --> 00:04:13.198
and it might be a little bit clearer

00:04:13.198 --> 00:04:16.865
when we form the
carbocation, is let's have,

00:04:17.954 --> 00:04:20.709
going to do this in blue.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.472
Let's have these two
electrons that form this bond,

00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:28.222
well now they form a
bond with that hydrogen,

00:04:29.797 --> 00:04:33.964
and now the oxygen can take
back these two electrons,

00:04:35.993 --> 00:04:40.286
and what are we going,
what is going to result?

00:04:40.286 --> 00:04:41.860
And I'm drawing it in equilibrium,

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.672
remember all of these things
are going back and forth

00:04:43.672 --> 00:04:46.018
depending on how things
bump into each other,

00:04:46.018 --> 00:04:47.984
but what are we left with?

00:04:47.984 --> 00:04:51.041
So let me copy and paste this again

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:54.011
and I'm copying and pasting
in a way that, just so I,

00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:58.095
this is the backbone, and
I'll add what I need to add.

00:04:58.095 --> 00:05:01.595
So once this happens, we have this carbon,

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.297
the number three carbon, now,

00:05:05.297 --> 00:05:08.384
woops I keep using the wrong tool.

00:05:08.384 --> 00:05:12.551
The number three carbon now
forms a bond with this hydrogen

00:05:15.615 --> 00:05:16.865
just like that.

00:05:17.794 --> 00:05:20.079
This carbon, our number two carbon,

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:24.942
has lost an electron, it's
no longer sharing this bond.

00:05:24.942 --> 00:05:28.785
And so now it is going to
have a positive charge,

00:05:28.785 --> 00:05:30.629
it is a carbocation and once again

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:32.533
is a tertiary carbocation,

00:05:32.533 --> 00:05:35.050
it is bonded to one, two, three carbons.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.067
That is stable, more stable
than if we did it the other way

00:05:37.067 --> 00:05:39.383
around, if this one grabbed
the hydrogen somehow,

00:05:39.383 --> 00:05:41.615
then this would be a
secondary carbocation,

00:05:41.615 --> 00:05:45.433
it'd be harder for it to spread
that positive charge around.

00:05:45.433 --> 00:05:49.124
And what about our, what
about our molecule up here?

00:05:49.124 --> 00:05:51.176
Let's see what it looks like now.

00:05:51.176 --> 00:05:54.363
We have our oxygen bonded
to the two hydrogens,

00:05:54.363 --> 00:05:56.167
it had one of those lone pairs,

00:05:56.167 --> 00:05:58.367
and now the electrons in this bond

00:05:58.367 --> 00:06:00.980
are now going to form another lone pair.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.868
So it took back an electron,

00:06:02.868 --> 00:06:06.991
or you can think of it, it
gave away a hydrogen proton.

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:09.673
And so this is now just neutral water,

00:06:09.673 --> 00:06:12.034
and we see that we have a
conservation of charge here,

00:06:12.034 --> 00:06:13.481
this was positive in charge,

00:06:13.481 --> 00:06:17.284
now our original molecule
is positively charged.

00:06:17.284 --> 00:06:19.596
And what feels good about
this is we're getting,

00:06:19.596 --> 00:06:21.344
we're getting close to our end product,

00:06:21.344 --> 00:06:24.119
at least on our number
three carbon, we now have,

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:26.469
we now have this hydrogen.

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:27.302
Now we need to think about,

00:06:27.302 --> 00:06:31.573
well how do we get a hydroxyl
group added right over here?

00:06:31.573 --> 00:06:33.460
Well we have all this water,

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.333
we have all this water
floating around, let me,

00:06:37.333 --> 00:06:39.050
I could use this water
molecule but the odds of it

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.537
being the exact same water
molecule, we don't know.

00:06:41.537 --> 00:06:42.770
But there's all sorts of water molecules,

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.177
we're in an aqueous solution,

00:06:44.177 --> 00:06:46.454
so let me draw another
water molecule here.

00:06:46.454 --> 00:06:50.368
So the water molecules are all equivalent,

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:53.788
but let me draw another
water molecule here.

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:57.161
And you can imagine, if they
just bump into each other

00:06:57.161 --> 00:07:00.405
in just the right way, this is,

00:07:00.405 --> 00:07:02.955
water is a polar molecule, it has a

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:06.122
partially negative end near the oxygen

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:09.940
because the oxygen likes
to hog the electrons,

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.729
and then you have a partial
positive end near the hydrogens

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:15.973
'cause they get their electrons hogged,

00:07:15.973 --> 00:07:18.343
so you can imagine the
oxygen end might be attracted

00:07:18.343 --> 00:07:23.254
to this tertiary carbocation,
and so just bumping it

00:07:23.254 --> 00:07:27.429
in just the right way,
it might form a bond.

00:07:27.429 --> 00:07:31.291
So let me say these two
electrons right over here,

00:07:31.291 --> 00:07:35.458
let's say they form a bond
with this, with that number two

00:07:36.931 --> 00:07:39.878
carbon, and then what is going to result?

00:07:39.878 --> 00:07:42.795
So let me draw, so what is, what is

00:07:44.397 --> 00:07:47.132
going to result, let me
scroll down a little bit,

00:07:47.132 --> 00:07:49.215
and let me paste, whoops,

00:07:51.521 --> 00:07:56.295
let me copy and paste our
original molecule again.

00:07:56.295 --> 00:07:57.545
So, here we go.

00:08:01.102 --> 00:08:03.040
So what could happen?

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.895
This is the one we constructed actually,

00:08:04.895 --> 00:08:07.800
so we have the hydrogen there.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.195
We have the hydrogen, now this character,

00:08:11.195 --> 00:08:14.508
so we have the water molecule,

00:08:14.508 --> 00:08:16.901
so oxygen bonded to two hydrogens,

00:08:16.901 --> 00:08:19.249
you have this one lone
pair that isn't reacting,

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:21.609
but then you have the lone
pair that does do the reacting.

00:08:21.609 --> 00:08:23.859
And so it now forms a bond.

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:28.114
Woops, let me do it in that orange color.

00:08:28.114 --> 00:08:31.114
It now, it now forms an actual bond.

00:08:32.466 --> 00:08:34.691
And we're really close
to our final product,

00:08:34.691 --> 00:08:37.374
we have our hydrogen on
the number three carbon,

00:08:37.374 --> 00:08:39.912
we have more than we want
on our number two carbon,

00:08:39.912 --> 00:08:41.685
we just want a hydroxyl group,

00:08:41.685 --> 00:08:45.568
now we have a whole water
bonded to the carbon.

00:08:45.568 --> 00:08:48.276
So somehow we have to get
one of these other hydrogens

00:08:48.276 --> 00:08:50.015
swiped off of it, well that could happen

00:08:50.015 --> 00:08:52.236
with just another water molecule.

00:08:52.236 --> 00:08:53.760
So let's draw that.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.204
So another water molecule someplace,

00:08:56.204 --> 00:08:58.230
I'll do the different color
just to differentiate,

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.926
although as we know water, well
it's hard to see what color

00:09:00.926 --> 00:09:03.286
is water if you're looking
at the molecular scale.

00:09:03.286 --> 00:09:05.638
So here we go, and we're really

00:09:05.638 --> 00:09:08.032
in the home stretch at this point.

00:09:08.032 --> 00:09:10.563
You have another water molecule,

00:09:10.563 --> 00:09:13.487
let's say, let me pick a color.

00:09:13.487 --> 00:09:16.063
So let's say these
electrons right over here,

00:09:16.063 --> 00:09:19.790
maybe they form a bond
with that hydrogen proton,

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:23.957
and then these, the electrons
in that bond can go back

00:09:25.427 --> 00:09:28.121
to form a lone pair on that oxygen,

00:09:28.121 --> 00:09:29.873
and then what are we left with?

00:09:29.873 --> 00:09:32.013
And this really is the home stretch.

00:09:32.013 --> 00:09:34.513
So we are in equilibrium with,

00:09:36.205 --> 00:09:39.471
so let me draw my five carbons,
so let's see, I have...

00:09:39.471 --> 00:09:41.971
H3C, carbon, carbon, CH2, CH3,

00:09:48.536 --> 00:09:51.786
I have a CH3, I say H3C instead of CH3,

00:09:54.443 --> 00:09:56.830
I wrote it that way just so
it's clear that the carbons

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.617
are bonded to the carbons,

00:09:58.617 --> 00:10:02.617
you have the original
hydrogen right over there,

00:10:03.885 --> 00:10:05.758
you have the one that we just added

00:10:05.758 --> 00:10:07.925
as part of this mechanism,

00:10:09.459 --> 00:10:13.626
you have this orange bond
to now, this hydroxyl group,

00:10:18.393 --> 00:10:22.424
the hydroxyl group, and it
had one lone pair before,

00:10:22.424 --> 00:10:24.280
it had one lone pair
before, but bound to both

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:28.235
of the electrons from this
bond to form another lone pair.

00:10:28.235 --> 00:10:31.759
To form another lone pair,
which I am depicting in pink,

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:34.800
and then this water is now,

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.929
this water molecule is
now a hydronium molecule.

00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:41.316
So let me draw that, so this is now,

00:10:41.316 --> 00:10:45.235
oxygen, hydrogen, had one
lone pair that didn't react,

00:10:45.235 --> 00:10:46.914
and it had one lone pair that I put

00:10:46.914 --> 00:10:51.081
in blue that is reacting
with this hydrogen proton.

00:10:52.259 --> 00:10:55.176
With that hydrogen, just like this,

00:10:56.737 --> 00:11:00.072
and so since it got the
hydrogen proton it's giving its,

00:11:00.072 --> 00:11:03.677
sharing its electrons now,
now this has a positive,

00:11:03.677 --> 00:11:07.260
this has a positive
charge, just like that.

00:11:08.316 --> 00:11:10.483
I have to be very careful,

00:11:11.475 --> 00:11:14.451
in the last step I forgot
to draw the positive charge!

00:11:14.451 --> 00:11:15.861
We always wanna make sure that your charge

00:11:15.861 --> 00:11:18.499
is being conserved, we started
off with the positive charge

00:11:18.499 --> 00:11:21.011
on the hydronium, then we
have the positive charge

00:11:21.011 --> 00:11:22.515
on the tertiary carbocation

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:24.534
right over here on our number two carbon,

00:11:24.534 --> 00:11:28.001
and now we have the positive charge,

00:11:28.001 --> 00:11:32.005
would be right over here,
because that oxygen,

00:11:32.005 --> 00:11:33.505
what we saw before that oxygen,

00:11:33.505 --> 00:11:36.769
which this water molecule was neutral,

00:11:36.769 --> 00:11:38.431
but you could say, you could view it is

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:40.635
"well now it's going to be,

00:11:40.635 --> 00:11:42.068
it's now sharing these two electrons

00:11:42.068 --> 00:11:43.163
instead of keeping them,"

00:11:43.163 --> 00:11:47.428
so you can view it is maybe
it's giving away an electron,

00:11:47.428 --> 00:11:50.133
and so now it becomes positive.

00:11:50.133 --> 00:11:53.178
And then, and then the positive charge

00:11:53.178 --> 00:11:56.824
finally gets transferred to
that other water molecule

00:11:56.824 --> 00:11:59.090
when it becomes hydronium.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:01.177
But just like that we are done.

00:12:01.177 --> 00:12:04.655
We have added a hydroxyl
group and a hydrogen combined,

00:12:04.655 --> 00:12:08.488
that's a water, so that's why
we call it addition of water,

00:12:08.488 --> 00:12:10.068
and it was catalyzed by acid,

00:12:10.068 --> 00:12:13.735
so it's an acid-catalyzed
addition of water.
