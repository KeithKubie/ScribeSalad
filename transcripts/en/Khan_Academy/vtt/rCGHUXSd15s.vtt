00:00:00.618 --> 00:00:02.418
- [Voiceover] What I
hope to do in this video

00:00:02.418 --> 00:00:05.721
is a reasonably quick
justification of the idea

00:00:05.721 --> 00:00:08.570
that the absolute value of a minus b

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.371
is equal to the absolute
value of b minus a

00:00:12.371 --> 00:00:15.050
for any two numbers a or b.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.321
And before I even break into this,

00:00:18.321 --> 00:00:20.969
I wanna start with a simpler proposition.

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:23.989
The idea that if I have some number x,

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.744
and I'm just using x because
I already used up a and b,

00:00:27.744 --> 00:00:30.344
that the absolute value of x
is going to be the same thing

00:00:30.344 --> 00:00:33.076
as the absolute value of negative x.

00:00:33.076 --> 00:00:36.188
And to feel good about this
we could draw a number line.

00:00:36.188 --> 00:00:38.747
So we could draw

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:41.172
a number line,

00:00:41.172 --> 00:00:43.849
and this is zero.

00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:47.115
So there's one circumstance
in which x is positive.

00:00:47.115 --> 00:00:49.108
Obviously if x was zero
these are both gonna be

00:00:49.108 --> 00:00:51.270
equal to zero, and it would be true.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.569
But one world where x is positive,

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:55.467
then negative x would be the same distance

00:00:55.467 --> 00:00:57.316
to the left of zero,

00:00:57.316 --> 00:01:00.341
so negative x would be here.

00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:03.611
And the absolute value of
x would be this distance.

00:01:03.611 --> 00:01:06.772
And the absolute value
of negative x would be

00:01:06.772 --> 00:01:10.258
that same distance but just to the left.

00:01:10.258 --> 00:01:13.435
So these two things would be equivalent.

00:01:13.435 --> 00:01:16.875
Now if x were negative,
so let me draw that.

00:01:17.948 --> 00:01:21.405
So if x were negative,

00:01:21.405 --> 00:01:23.413
so if this was x,

00:01:23.413 --> 00:01:25.453
then what would negative x be?

00:01:25.453 --> 00:01:27.436
Well negative x would
be the opposite of it,

00:01:27.436 --> 00:01:30.500
so it would be the same
distance to the right of zero.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.206
So I know that this looks weird,

00:01:32.206 --> 00:01:33.989
me putting the negative x out here,

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:36.100
but remember, x could be negative two.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.933
And if x is negative two,

00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:41.376
then negative negative two
is going to be positive.

00:01:41.376 --> 00:01:44.220
But either way you see
that the absolute value

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.523
of these two things are the same.

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:49.179
The absolute value is just
the distance from zero.

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.565
This distance is still

00:01:51.565 --> 00:01:53.948
going to be the same as this distance.

00:01:53.948 --> 00:01:56.483
This distance is the absolute value of x.

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:57.915
This distance, in this case,

00:01:57.915 --> 00:02:00.451
is the absolute value of negative x.

00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:03.932
So hopefully you feel
good that these two things

00:02:03.932 --> 00:02:06.203
are equivalent.

00:02:06.203 --> 00:02:08.580
Now, if you agree to that,

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.310
now let's work on this a little bit.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.510
So we can start

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.863
with the absolute value of

00:02:18.863 --> 00:02:21.250
a minus b.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.242
And there's a bunch of

00:02:23.242 --> 00:02:25.653
ways that we could tackle this.

00:02:25.653 --> 00:02:28.986
But one way we could approach it,

00:02:28.986 --> 00:02:30.876
and actually let me write a little lower,

00:02:30.876 --> 00:02:33.242
so I don't bump into this
stuff right over here.

00:02:33.242 --> 00:02:37.254
So let me start with the
absolute value of a minus b.

00:02:37.254 --> 00:02:41.689
Now a, we could rewrite, this is just a,

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.226
I don't wanna say it's
positive or negative,

00:02:43.226 --> 00:02:45.002
a could be a negative number.

00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:46.474
This is just a right over here,

00:02:46.474 --> 00:02:48.779
but we can rewrite this
as being the same thing

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:51.434
as negative negative a.

00:02:51.434 --> 00:02:55.343
Or I guess negative negative a plus,

00:02:55.343 --> 00:02:58.622
minus b.

00:03:00.142 --> 00:03:03.787
So let's just think
about this a little bit,

00:03:03.787 --> 00:03:05.814
and make sure we feel comfortable

00:03:05.814 --> 00:03:08.958
with what I just did.

00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.981
So this a

00:03:12.735 --> 00:03:15.242
is the same thing as all of this business.

00:03:15.242 --> 00:03:17.969
The negative negative a.

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:20.005
The negative of a negative
is going to be a positive,

00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:21.129
this is positive a.

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.234
So I haven't changed
this in any dramatic way.

00:03:24.234 --> 00:03:27.296
But what's this going
to be the same thing as?

00:03:27.296 --> 00:03:29.993
Well we can factor out a negative sign.

00:03:29.993 --> 00:03:32.184
So let's do that, and actually let me,

00:03:32.184 --> 00:03:35.512
we could factor out, using
a color I haven't used yet,

00:03:35.512 --> 00:03:39.080
we could factor out the negative signs.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.203
So this is going to be
equal to the absolute value

00:03:43.203 --> 00:03:46.314
of, I can factor out the negatives,

00:03:46.314 --> 00:03:48.604
the negative of,

00:03:48.604 --> 00:03:51.127
and then I have open parentheses,

00:03:51.127 --> 00:03:54.328
open parentheses negative a.

00:03:54.328 --> 00:03:56.162
And if you factor out a negative here,

00:03:56.162 --> 00:03:58.424
this is going to be positive b.

00:03:58.424 --> 00:04:00.271
So or plus b.

00:04:00.271 --> 00:04:03.479
Let me just close the
parentheses in the same color,

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.119
just to make them match.

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:07.094
Now why is this interesting?

00:04:07.094 --> 00:04:09.950
Well we just said the
absolute value of a negative

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.026
is the same thing as, the
absolute value of negative x

00:04:13.026 --> 00:04:15.219
is the same thing as
the absolute value of x.

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:17.058
So the absolute value of the negative

00:04:17.058 --> 00:04:19.927
of negative a plus b is
going to be equal to,

00:04:19.927 --> 00:04:22.497
this is going to be equal to

00:04:22.497 --> 00:04:26.041
the absolute value, let
me do that yellow color

00:04:26.041 --> 00:04:29.362
is going to be equal to the
absolute value of this thing

00:04:29.362 --> 00:04:31.081
without the negative right here.

00:04:31.081 --> 00:04:32.033
You see that right over here.

00:04:32.033 --> 00:04:33.548
The absolute value of negative x

00:04:33.548 --> 00:04:35.481
is the same thing as
the absolute value of x.

00:04:35.481 --> 00:04:38.314
So the absolute value of
negative negative a plus b,

00:04:38.314 --> 00:04:41.289
is the same thing as the absolute value of

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:45.112
negative a plus b.

00:04:49.761 --> 00:04:52.160
And negative a plus b,
well that's the same thing

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.193
as b minus a.

00:04:55.193 --> 00:04:57.753
I'm just swapping the
order right over here.

00:04:57.753 --> 00:05:01.753
B minus a.

00:05:01.753 --> 00:05:03.697
And we're done.

00:05:03.697 --> 00:05:05.337
We've just shown that the absolute value

00:05:05.337 --> 00:05:07.304
of a minus b is the same thing

00:05:07.304 --> 00:05:10.121
as the absolute value of b minus a.

00:05:10.121 --> 00:05:12.120
And obviously you hopefully
felt pretty good about it

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.536
by just trying out a bunch of numbers,

00:05:13.536 --> 00:05:14.806
and thinking about the number line,

00:05:14.806 --> 00:05:17.392
and thinking about what the
difference of two numbers mean,

00:05:17.392 --> 00:05:18.968
if one is larger than the other.

00:05:18.968 --> 00:05:21.378
But this is we're literally just really

00:05:21.378 --> 00:05:23.696
factoring out a negative sign here,

00:05:23.696 --> 00:05:25.649
and recognizing this property up here,

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:27.859
to make the same conclusion.
