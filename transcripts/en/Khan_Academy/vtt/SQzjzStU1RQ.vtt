00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.540
Comedian Steven
Wright-- and I guess

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.510
we can credit him with being
a bit of a philosopher--

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.954
once commented that "Black holes
are where God divided by zero."

00:00:09.954 --> 00:00:11.620
And I won't get in
to the physics of it,

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.540
and obviously the metaphor
breaks down in certain ways

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.080
But it is strangely appropriate,
because black holes are where

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.600
our current understanding of
physics seems to break down

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.710
and dividing by zero, as simple
of idea as that seems to be,

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.820
is where our mathematics
also breaks down.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.370
This is "undefined."

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.512
Sometimes when you see
"undefined" in math class

00:00:35.512 --> 00:00:36.970
it seems like a
very strange thing.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.700
It seems like a
very bizarre idea.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.140
But it really means exactly
what the word means.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.570
Mathematicians
have never defined

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.970
what it must mean
to divide by zero.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:46.932
What is that value?

00:00:46.932 --> 00:00:48.390
And the reason they
haven't done it

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.000
is because they couldn't
come up with a good answer.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.230
There's no good answer
here, no good definition.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.090
And because of that,
any non-zero number,

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.950
divided by zero, is
left just "undefined."

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.160
7 divided by 0.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.130
8 divided by 0.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.120
Negative 1 divided by 0.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.940
We say all of these things
are just "undefined."

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.340
You might say, well if
we can just define it,

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.220
let's at least try to come
up with a definition of what

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.590
it means to take a non-zero
number divided by zero.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.220
So let's do that right now.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.417
We could just take the simplest
of all non-zero numbers.

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:26.500
We'll just do it with one.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.810
But we could have done this
with any non-zero number.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.852
Let's take the example of one.

00:01:30.852 --> 00:01:32.685
Since we don't know
what it means-- or we're

00:01:32.685 --> 00:01:35.060
trying to figure out what it
means to divide by zero Lets

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.572
just try out really, really,
small positive numbers.

00:01:37.572 --> 00:01:39.780
Let's divide by really,
really small positive numbers

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.670
and see what happens as
we get close to zero.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.010
So lets divide by 0.1 Well,
this will get us to 10.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:55.530
If we divide 1 by 0.01
that gets us to 100.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.310
If I go really,
really close to zero.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:05.598
If I divide 1 by
0.000001 this gets us--

00:02:05.598 --> 00:02:08.922
so this is not a tenth,
hundredth, thousandth,

00:02:08.922 --> 00:02:10.380
ten thousandth,
hundred thousandth.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.213
This is a millionth.

00:02:11.213 --> 00:02:16.720
1 divided by a millionth, that's
going to give us 1 million.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.090
So we see a pattern here.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.190
As we divide one by smaller
and smaller and smaller

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.020
positive numbers, we get a
larger and larger and larger

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.520
value.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.600
Based on just this you
might say, well, hey,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.310
I've got somewhat of a
definition for 1 divided by 0.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.994
Maybe we can say that 1 divided
by 0 is positive infinity.

00:02:35.994 --> 00:02:38.160
As we get smaller and smaller
positive numbers here,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.240
we get super super large
numbers right over here.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.310
But then, your friend
might say, well,

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.210
that worked when we divided by
positive numbers close to zero

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.380
but what happens when we
divide by negative numbers

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.590
close to zero?

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.180
So lets try those out.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:00.420
Well, 1 divided by negative 0.1,
that's going to be negative 10.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.790
1 divided by
negative 0.01, that's

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.170
going to be negative 100.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.800
And, if we go all the way to 1
divided by negative 0.000001--

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.250
yup, I drew the same
number of zeros--

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.910
that gets us to
negative 1 million.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.270
So you when we keep dividing
1 by negative numbers that

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.010
are closer and closer and
closer and closer to zero,

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.470
we get a very different answer.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.660
We actually start approaching
negative infinity.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.060
So over here we said maybe it
would be positive infinity,

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.600
but you can make an
equally strong argument

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.700
that it could be a
very different number.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.710
Negative infinity is going
the exact opposite direction.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.110
So you could make an
equally strong argument

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.030
that it should be
negative infinity.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.910
And this is why
mathematicians say

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.730
there's just no
good answer here.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.720
Especially one that's consistent
with the rest of mathematics.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.580
They could have just said
it's equal to 42 or something

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.180
like that.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.550
But that would make no sense.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.230
It's neither one
of these values,

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.810
and it wouldn't be consistent
with everything else we know.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.560
So they just left the
whole thing "undefined."

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.570
