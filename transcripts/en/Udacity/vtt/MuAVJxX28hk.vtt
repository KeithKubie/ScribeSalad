[MUSIC]

00:00:15.404 --> 00:00:17.009
Hey, welcome back.

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.068
Have you ever wanted a framework
that comes with its own build tool,

00:00:20.068 --> 00:00:23.398
will automatically generate and
maintain your apps file structure, and

00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:25.127
keep your templates and data in sync?

00:00:25.127 --> 00:00:27.940
Then you're probably looking for
something like Ember.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.990
And we're now going to look
at an Ember framework.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.470
As we go through this lesson,

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.360
I encourage you to work through
each of the steps yourself.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.695
Building up the app along with me.

00:00:35.695 --> 00:00:39.370
You'll learn a lot by watching me
work through building a project, but

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.460
you'll learn so
much more if you build it yourself.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.030
Ember describes itself as a framework
for creating ambitious web applications

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.060
and boy does it help you
easily create ambitious apps.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.290
It's an extremely powerful framework and
is powered sites for companies

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.820
like Netflix, Groupon, Discourse,
Twitch, Yahoo and even Microsoft.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.160
So Ember will be able to handle
anything you could throw at it.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.170
Ember enables you to create
powerful apps with ease

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.260
because it favors convention
over configuration.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.950
You have to name and
organize your files a certain way.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.190
Depending on the kind of file, you also
have to place it in a specific location

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.940
in the project's file structure.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.980
At first, this might seem
daunting to maintain, but

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.150
using Ember's command line tool,
it couldn't be simpler.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.690
Another benefit of this strict
app organization is that

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.830
every Ember apps structure is the same,

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.390
and developers new to your team
will be able to jump right in.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.470
Doesn't Ember sound awesome?

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.150
Let's get going so

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.260
you can build your next project
with this powerful framework.
