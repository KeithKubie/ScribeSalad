1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.953
What will happen?

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.650
The Joe Rogan experience after awhile everyone's just going to watch everybody

3
00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:05.910
do everything.
I really,

4
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.760
I really think within a hundred years that's going to be the case.

5
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.070
That's the case now,
man.
But I think it's getting bloggers and like,
you know,
I'm,

6
00:00:12.071 --> 00:00:14.970
I'm on,
I'm on Youtube.
You know how that goes.
Like everyone wants to see,

7
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.830
oh what are you doing now?
What are you doing now?
Right.

8
00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:19.630
And get a video last week.
What's going on?
What are you doing now?
Yeah,
you know,

9
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.270
it's,
it's,

10
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.200
but we accept is way different than what our parents accepted or would their

11
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:27.120
parents accepted and I think what our children,

12
00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:29.790
except it's going to be waived different and then what their children accepts

13
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:31.110
can be,
we're like two,

14
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:33.990
three generations from it just being ridiculous where there's no privacy.

15
00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:36.870
How do you distance yourself?
Cause you're,
you're a public figure,
right?

16
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.620
How do you distance yourself?
Like where do you draw the line for privacy?

17
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.410
I guess you could say the real problem was when you're eating.

18
00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:46.260
Then when people like come up to you while you have,

19
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.850
like I'll have a kid in my lap and I'll be eating food and talking to the kid

20
00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:55.040
and someone will literally come up to me and tried to take a picture of me,

21
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.090
asked me to take a picture with me.
I'm like,
come on man,

22
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.230
we're all out eating at a restaurant.
Like this is like,
you know,
just say hi.

23
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.410
Just say hi man.
And I always tell people when I'm done,
I'm leaving.

24
00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:07.980
I'll take a picture with you.
But you can't,
you can't just interrupt dinner.

25
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.630
It's insane.
But it's just,

26
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.770
it's just people think like if they don't get a picture with you right now,

27
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.440
going to get it right now,
now,
now,
now fucking don't care.
I'm going in.

28
00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:19.350
I'm gonna just go right.
They don't care.
I mean,
and then they'll say,
hey,

29
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.530
that's the price you pay for being famous.
Well that it's like,
no,
come on guys.

30
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.320
That's crazy.
Like this is the deal.

31
00:01:25.321 --> 00:01:28.140
The deal is someone provides something that you enjoy.

32
00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:32.720
Whether it's stand up or thing and I appreciate that you enjoy it.
Right?

33
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.060
But that's our exchange.
All the other stuff or anything else.

34
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.550
It's like meeting me at a restaurant and shit when,
uh,

35
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.580
when I'm eating with my kid.
Yeah.
Like,
come on man.
That's the,

36
00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:44.310
you're asking for too much.
This is ridiculous.
Here's another question for you.

37
00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:47.460
What kind of restaurants you eat at where people feel need to come up?

38
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:51.020
Td at like either a high end,
right?
Like Applebee's and stuff or like go like,

39
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.380
Hey,
hi.
And I'd be math,
right?
Mostly places.

40
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.890
Normal normal spots.
It's not,
it's not normal that someone does that.

41
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:00.270
Most people are super respectful,

42
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.450
but all it takes is one out of a hundred trucks and the night just gets weird

43
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.930
and most people don't.
Most people are cool,

44
00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:10.410
but it's every now and then people just have this idea that somehow or another

45
00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:12.480
you have to,
if you are a famous person,

46
00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:15.090
you have to abandon everything and start nodding just to PR.

47
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.580
That's the other thing that you're not a person anymore.
Right?

48
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.720
Like a famous person.
Like it's like the regular rules don't apply to him.

49
00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:22.930
Someone don't apply.
Right?

50
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.120
Like you would never just barge in on a regular person that you did.
No.
No.

51
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.870
But if it's a regular famous person,
people,
they don't give a fuck.
She was fine.

52
00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:33.380
Whatever it is.
Life station.
Right where you're,

53
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.180
you and your friend are both crying and talk about someone that died.

54
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.870
I don't give a fuck man.
I'm sorry to interrupt bro.
I get that picture right now,

55
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.720
bro.
Damn.
Can I get that picture bro?

56
00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:45.390
So what's the weirdest interaction you've had with someone?

57
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.620
It's mostly just that kind of stuff here to shit is like people that tell me

58
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.670
that they're going to give me secrets,
like Ufo type stuff,
big foot.

59
00:02:53.671 --> 00:02:55.520
And I know where the bases are really,

60
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.920
those motherfuckers [inaudible] I've had a few of those restaurants just walking

61
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:03.940
on the street.
Just me.
Usually a comedy shows.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Usually a comedy shows.

62
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:06.300
Do you ever walk down the street?
That's a boy thing.
I just asked you that.

63
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.280
I mean,
cause like when you're always either driving,
you're going somewhere,

64
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:12.880
you would go for a casual walk.
Like how's that around at?
Why do I walk my dog?

65
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.990
Right?
But yeah,
I don't walk around La.
Nobody does.

66
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.350
Nobody walks into the pockets of walking in La.

67
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>
