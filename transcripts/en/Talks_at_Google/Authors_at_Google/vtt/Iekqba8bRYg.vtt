[APPLAUSE]

00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:04.210
DR. STEVE JONES: Thanks.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.980
I see that pile of books has
gratifyingly disappeared.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.850
I'm happy to sign them
if you want me to.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.433
But I should warn you that the
unsigned ones are at a premium,

00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:16.530
because they're so rare.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.160
OK, good.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.580
My book is about science
in the French Revolution.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.350
And it's got quite a
lot of science in it.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.340
But it's also got a lot of stuff
which I didn't know at all when

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.330
I started, which is the way
in which scientists actually

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.400
were engaged both before
and during the revolution

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.960
in the political events and
the way in which many of them

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.840
paid a very severe penalty,
including the death

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.830
penalty for their engagement.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.340
And that's what I want to kind
of talk through in this talk.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.450
This first cover
shows-- actually,

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.420
it's a British cartoon.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.180
It's by Gilray, the famous
18th century cartoonist,

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.880
which shows scientists
being attacked by the mob

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.970
and thrown to the mob.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:55.910
OK?

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.030
They're trying to climb
up this pillar to escape.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.270
But they're being
thrown to the mob.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.228
And many of them indeed
were thrown to the mob.

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:03.250
And you can see in
that image-- you

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.334
can see the scientific
instruments coming down.

00:01:05.334 --> 00:01:07.000
You can see a balloon
in the background.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.210
Of course, it was the
age of ballooning.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.860
You see some surveying tools.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.710
And as you'll see,
it was the age

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.740
of the great survey of France.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.810
And so that's the
theme of the book.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.240
Now, in fact, the first
time I went to Paris,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.990
I start the book by
saying, the first time

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.410
I went to Paris,
very coincidentally,

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.330
was in May 1968.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.310
And I was on my
way to the Pyrenees

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.170
where I spent many
years going every summer

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.790
and working on the
genetics of snails.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.430
As I often say, I'm one of
the world's top six experts

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.640
on the genetics of snails,
and the other five agree.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.740
But that's no longer true.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.781
I don't think there's the
six of us left anymore.

00:01:44.781 --> 00:01:46.490
I believe the other
two agree now.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.179
But I was on my way down there.

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:49.720
And I had never been
to Paris before.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.960
And I'd come from Edinburgh.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.040
We're talking 1968, which in
Edinburgh was 1958 effectively.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.720
And I got to Gare du Nord.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.980
I was amazed by
the bright sunlight

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.590
and the busyness of the scene.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.820
I got on the train.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.570
I got on the metro
to get to the station

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.950
to go down to the south.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.199
And when I was on the metro
train, I noticed an odd scent.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.640
And I thought it was a perfume.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.605
It was pungent.

00:02:12.605 --> 00:02:14.000
It wasn't unpleasant.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.270
And it wasn't until I opened
the newspapers the next day

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.130
that, in fact, I discovered
it was tear gas seeping

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.460
into the metro from the
riots which had started on

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.390
that day or the day
before just above.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.030
So that was my
introduction to France.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.410
And here we have the famous
image "Souis les Paves la

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.800
Plage"-- "Under the
Cobblestones of the Beach."

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.680
Well, they pulled up
plenty of cobblestones.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.680
But they didn't find
the beach, I'm afraid.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.910
And that always reminds me
of Marx's great statement

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.640
that history always
repeats itself.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.200
The first time is tragedy.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.990
And the second time is farce.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.140
And the farce, I think, was this
was the [FRENCH] revolution,

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.990
which really went nowhere,
except it generated lots

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.940
of hippies most of
whom are now my age

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.660
and are still grumbling
about revolution.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.640
But the tragedy-- it was
a tragedy in many ways--

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.270
was the French
Revolution itself in 1789

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.490
and the great disasters
and wars which followed it.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.060
As I've said, many
of those triumphs

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.570
and the tragedies
of the revolution

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.080
were motivated by science
and by scientists.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.670
In fact, the very moment
of the revolution,

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.530
every Frenchman knows, is
called the Tennis Court Oath.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.720
And this is a painting
by the French painter

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.560
David of a gentleman
with white hair

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.450
standing and
addressing the crowd.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.180
And this was the moment when
the left wing, as we call them

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.250
today, split away from the
endless discussions with Louis

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.370
XVI, and went into
the tennis court,

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.630
and declared that there was
going to be a revolution.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.540
And in time, there
would be a republic.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.720
And the person who
led that was actually

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.070
an astronomer, Jean
Sylvain Bailly who

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.990
later became mayor of Paris.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.540
And he was actually
quite a good mayor.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.300
Here he is-- Bailly , the first
mayor of revolutionary Paris.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.610
He still did astronomy.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.650
He looked at the
transits of Venus.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.300
He was quite popular in spite
of this rather unkind cartoon.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:25.480
But unfortunately,
there was a riot in 1791

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.770
where his troops shot
down a number of rioters

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.120
on the Champs de Mars, which
is where the Eiffel Tower now

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.860
stands.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.610
And poor Bailly was the first of
many scientists to be executed.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.180
And he was actually guillotined.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.140
Now, in fact, Bailly was
one of many scientists

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.650
who believed that there were
scientific laws of progress

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.240
in human affairs.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.160
And many of them thought
that a revolution was

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.190
inevitable in the
same way as there

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.770
were laws of physics which
could predict the future,

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.430
then there were scientific laws
of society, which would predict

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.200
the future of human affairs.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.170
And here's just a few of
them-- the politics of science.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.390
Lamarck, the famous
biologist-- "There

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.750
is an urge to improve in life."

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.720
De Tracy, who was a
physiologist and an expert

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.170
on the visual system,
invented a word

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.620
which has become quite
widespread-- ideology.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.930
He invented that word, and
he said, as you can see,

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.010
"Ideology is part of zoology."

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.700
Condorcet was a mathematician.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.127
He was murdered in prison.

00:05:34.127 --> 00:05:35.710
"The laws that the
direct the Universe

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.190
are necessary and constant.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.110
Why should this be any
less true for those

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.560
with the intellectual and
moral faculties of man?"

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.800
And Bailly, who was guillotined,
"The universal language

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.500
of science will open
the golden age."

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.010
And in fact, that notion still
pervades the French education

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.610
system.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.180
Condorcet set up what became
the modern French high school

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.960
education system, which is,
although it's rather rigid,

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.480
is fairly effective.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.310
And every French 17-year-old has
to pass an exam in philosophy.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.570
Here is this year's question.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.280
De Tocqueville wrote
that, "Dogmatic beliefs

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.430
are more or less numerous
according to the times."

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.020
Others say, "no dogmatic
beliefs, opinions

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.695
that men receive in
complete confidence

00:06:17.695 --> 00:06:19.910
and without debate"-- Discuss.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.780
I'd like to give that to a
bunch of British 17-year-olds

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.230
and see how they got on with it.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.290
I think the answer
would be not very well.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.280
So this kind of large
view of the Universe

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.830
and a philosophy being important
is certainly very much alive

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:34.810
today.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:40.990
So in 1889, the anniversary
of the revolution,

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.640
there was a contest as
to what the French should

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.450
do to celebrate the centenary
of that great event.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.770
And they wanted to
build a monument.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.950
There were various
entries-- one of which

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:58.040
was a 300-meter tall model of a
guillotine that didn't actually

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.450
win, fortunately.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.970
But what did win
was this here, which

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.376
is of course, the Eiffel Tower.

00:07:03.376 --> 00:07:04.750
Now, the Eiffel
Tower-- that's it

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.850
pictured in 1789--
the Eiffel Tower

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.400
was for 40 years, the tallest
building in the world.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.240
And it was built by an
engineer, Gustav Eiffel,

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.600
who already had built a number
of railway bridges, which

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.670
are magnificent things
in their own rights,

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.420
built out of wrought iron.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.190
And his technique was not to
build a bridge with huge steel

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.220
girders that fought
off the wind,

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.440
but to build lightweight
structures which allowed

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.290
the wind to blow through.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.290
And the Eiffel Tower
is a remarkable place.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.180
It's 300 meters high.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.260
It's very light.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.390
The weight of the air within
the bounds of the Eiffel Tower

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.410
is less than the weight
of the wrought iron used

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:43.440
to construct it.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.720
There are 18,000 girders there.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.570
And the base is 125
meters on every side.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:53.150
And if you were to melt down all
the metal in the Eiffel Tower

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.410
and fill the base with it, it
would be 6 centimeters deep.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.730
That's all.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.580
So it's a very, very
sophisticated structure indeed.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.260
It was very unpopular
when it first appeared.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.670
The novelist Guy de
Maupassant insisted

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:08.970
on having lunch in its
restaurant every day,

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:11.590
or so he claimed, as that was
the only place in Paris where

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.470
he couldn't see
the Eiffel Tower.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.630
Still, however, it's now
of course very popular.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:25.660
And it's just celebrated
his 250 millionth visitor.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.910
Now, Eiffel only had a 20
year lease on the site.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.000
But he had a plan,
which was to turn it

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.640
into a scientific
observatory and a laboratory.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.669
And he did that
with great success.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:38.659
He did a number of observations.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:41.150
For example, he was he
was an aerodynamicist

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.190
as one might imagine,
and he did a number

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.510
of experiments of dropping
heavy weights on wires

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.420
from the top-- weights of
different size and shape--

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.220
measuring how fast they moved.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.050
And from then on,
he went on to build

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.462
the world's first functional
wind tunnel, which

00:08:55.462 --> 00:08:56.920
is at the base of
the Eiffel Tower,

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.210
and was used for some of
the very early experiments

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.280
on aircraft wings.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.580
So he did all that.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.790
So it was a working laboratory.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:08.290
It was the site of the
first ever radio broadcast.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:10.720
And that became
very useful in 1914,

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.610
because the area on
the top of the tower

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:16.600
picked up a message from
the German Army, which

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.920
was advancing on
Paris, and the troops

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.600
were sent out in taxis,
without tipping them very well,

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.870
to get out and stop the army.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.500
And that was the
Battle of the Marne.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.875
So there's plenty
of science that

00:09:27.875 --> 00:09:30.700
went on in the Eiffel Tower.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.480
But if you stand
on the Eiffel Tower

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.960
and you survey the
beautiful view of Paris,

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.830
and I kind of do
this in the preface,

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.160
you see all kinds of
sites around which

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:45.110
are actually monuments to
Paris as the city of science.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.520
Now, you can go on an
artistic tour of Paris.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.666
You can go on a
revolutionary tour of Paris.

00:09:49.666 --> 00:09:51.540
You can go on an
architectural tour of Paris.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.240
But as far as I know, there
are no scientific tours

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.900
of the great sights
in Paris, which

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.108
are of scientific importance.

00:09:57.108 --> 00:09:58.620
But there are dozens of them.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.300
I'll just talk about a few.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.420
Here is a famous experiment
that never actually happened.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:07.030
This is Benjamin
Franklin's kite experiment

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:09.760
where he's supposed to have
held a kite in a thunderstorm

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.820
with a wet string and a key.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.357
If it had been struck, he would
certainly have been killed.

00:10:14.357 --> 00:10:15.440
There's no question of it.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.840
So he didn't do the experiment.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.980
But he wrote a book
in which he mentioned

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.080
that kind of experiment.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.300
It was called "Experiments
on Electricity

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.570
Done in Philadelphia."

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.110
And that book was
read by Louis XV.

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:28.955
That was the last
but one monarch.

00:10:28.955 --> 00:10:30.330
And he was very
interested in it.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.350
And he told some
of his researchers

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:35.420
to test out some of the ideas.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.910
And here's the world's first
lightning conductor in Marly,

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:40.350
which is on the West of Paris.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.410
And what they did was
to put, you can see,

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.860
you can put a metal spike up.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.510
And they paid an unfortunate
volunteer, a dragoon,

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:53.190
to hold a metal baton close
to the spike and sure enough,

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.080
great streams of sparks
moved between the two.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.220
And that was the world's first
lightning conductor in Paris,

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.970
not, in fact, in Philadelphia.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.570
Here is the world's
first measurement

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:06.560
of the speed of light.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.090
That too was done in Paris.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.990
It was done by a
guy called Fizeau

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:15.590
who transmitted a powerful
beam from his laboratory

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.520
to a mirror on the top of
the hill of Montmartre.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.020
And the beam shot out
and came back again.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.430
And in front of
the returning beam,

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.780
he spanned a wheel
with conchs on it.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:29.200
And as the wheel sped up,
suddenly at one moment,

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.690
the returning light
was blocked, which

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:34.430
meant that the cog had come
into place at just the moment

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:35.390
the right of return.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.650
And you could work out the
speed of light from that.

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:40.680
100 years before, people might
imagined the speed of light

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.980
had actually been measured.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.570
And it was remarkably accurate.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:48.570
So that's a physics experiment.

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.180
Here's the Luxembourg Gardens.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.810
Had you gone in the
year of the revolution,

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:55.930
you would have seen
only purple flowers.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.530
And those flowers are, in fact,
the flowers of the potato.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.760
And one of the things
the revolutionaries did

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.200
with the help of a
guy called Parmantier

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.510
was to introduce the
potato as food into France.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.500
It hadn't been
used as human food.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.080
It had only been
used as animal food.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.300
But Parmantier, with a
great deal of difficulty,

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.836
persuaded people to eat it.

00:12:15.836 --> 00:12:17.460
People didn't like
to eat the potatoes.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.410
First of all, it's not
mentioned in the Bible.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:20.930
So you don't really want
to eat something which

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.140
isn't mentioned in the Bible.

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.950
Secondly, it grows
on underground,

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:27.240
which is inconveniently
close to hell.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.480
And thirdly, there are all kinds
of strange beliefs about it.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.720
There's a line in Shakespeare's
"Merry Wives of Windsor," which

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:41.190
Shakespearean scholars
have long puzzled over,

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.230
which Falstaff is there.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:46.060
And he persuaded himself
that he's persuaded two women

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.000
to share his bed.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.300
And he raises his
eyes to the heavens.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.247
And he says, let the
sky rain potatoes.

00:12:53.247 --> 00:12:54.080
What does that mean?

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.780
That turns on the belief, in
Shakespeare's time and later,

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.910
that potatoes were
actually aphrodisiacs.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:02.300
I have to tell you, I've
eaten lots of potatoes.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.970
I've never really
noticed any real effect.

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:10.660
But another aspect
was the first survey

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.650
of France-- first triangulation
of any country, which set up

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:15.510
the metric system--
the meter, which

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:18.910
is 10 millionth of the
distance between the North Pole

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:24.060
and the Equator measured
through Paris and the kilogram,

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.340
which is a cubic
decimeter of water.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.760
So that too was done
at just after-- one

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.630
of the first acts of the
revolution was to set that out.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.630
But the Eiffel Tower itself
records much of that.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:37.560
And there are the names of
many scientists, 72 to them,

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.380
on the tower.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.700
Here we see, for
example, we see Ampere.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.430
And most of all, we see
somebody call Lavoisier.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:46.210
And the rest of my
talk is going to be

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.310
devoted Lavoisier,
who was really

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:50.260
the founder of modern chemistry.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.590
He was the discoverer,
or the co-discoverer,

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:56.550
of nitrogen, oxygen,
and hydrogen.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.570
But however, he was
very much involved

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:01.530
in pre-revolutionary and
post-revolutionary politics.

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:03.800
And in fact, his
fate gives my book

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.900
its title, because
he was dragged

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:10.420
in 1793 before the
tribunal, which

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.490
sentenced many people to death.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:14.887
Quite why that happened
I'll explain in a moment.

00:14:14.887 --> 00:14:15.970
He was sentenced to death.

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:18.540
And somebody very bravely
shouted from the back

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.490
of the room, you
cannot kill that man.

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:21.850
He is a genius.

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:23.870
And the judge said,
the revolution

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.750
has no need for geniuses.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:29.870
That's the title of the book
and the fate of the revolution.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:33.140
So why did people
hate him so much?

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.010
They hated him because before
he became a great scientist,

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:39.750
he'd actually been what's called
a tax farmer-- somebody who

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:43.040
bought the right to collect
taxes from the French state--

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.180
went out and they
agreed to a sum.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.050
They went out.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:48.160
And anything they could
collect above that sum,

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.560
they kept for themselves.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.317
And that led to enormous abuse.

00:14:52.317 --> 00:14:53.900
We have exactly the
same system today,

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.400
of course, with
PFIs on hospitals,

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.730
for example, where it cost 40
pounds to change a light bulb.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.897
So in the end, the hospital
costs four or five times

00:15:01.897 --> 00:15:03.188
as much as it should have done.

00:15:03.188 --> 00:15:05.410
So the system is still
around, although it's actually

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:10.550
disguised in a slightly
nontransparent way.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.790
So here is Lavoisier.

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:16.510
He was a philosophe, or a
scientist we call them now,

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:18.940
who paid the price.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:23.740
And here's a cartoon of him
being carried by his farmers

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.900
to extract taxes from the poor.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.150
And if you didn't pay your
taxes, you were in trouble.

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:29.090
You went to prison.

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:32.180
If your really insisted,
you'd be hanged.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.810
There were riots.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:35.440
People paid all kinds of taxes.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.320
And the one they really
hated most of all

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.490
was called the octroi.

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:42.070
And this was the tax which is
paid, particularly in Paris,

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.150
by all the goods that
came into the city.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:48.110
All the basics of life-- salt,
bread, wine-- had to pay a tax.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:52.100
And in order to
gather this tax, there

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.874
was a wall around
Paris, which you

00:15:54.874 --> 00:15:56.790
were supposed to pass
through and pay the tax.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:00.210
But in Lavoisier's time,
that was very leaky.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:02.840
It could, for example, just
be a terrace of houses.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.400
So all you need
to do was to bring

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.480
in something from the
back door and take it out

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.230
of the front door.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:08.771
And you wouldn't
have to pay the tax.

00:16:08.771 --> 00:16:11.010
So Lavoisier built a wall.

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.640
And this is the 1784 wall.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.366
It's the dotted line.

00:16:15.366 --> 00:16:17.490
And there's a fragment of
it, which is still there.

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:19.210
You can see it wouldn't
be an easy thing

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:22.420
to get over let alone
carrying a barrel of wine.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.780
And he built the wall.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:29.830
And in it were a number
of collection points,

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:31.400
a number of tax
offices, which you

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.050
had to pass through and pay.

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:34.560
And people hated this.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.540
And in fact, on
the 13th of July,

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.570
1789, the first act
of the revolution

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:43.220
was to storm Lavoisier's
wall and burn down

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.540
most of the entry points.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.980
And there are only
two of them now left.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.780
And the following
day was, of course,

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.631
the siege of the Bastille.

00:16:51.631 --> 00:16:53.630
And that's when the
revolution really got going.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:56.590
But it was the wall that
really sparked it off.

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:59.564
So the Bastille just
freed only four prisoners.

00:16:59.564 --> 00:17:01.230
There were only four
prisoners in there.

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:05.109
But it was the moment which
the French now remember.

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:08.690
So Lavoisier was is kind of
forgotten as a politician.

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:11.797
But he's very much
remembered as a scientist.

00:17:11.797 --> 00:17:13.630
And this is another
painting by David, which

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:14.794
is in the Met in New York.

00:17:14.794 --> 00:17:16.190
It's a wonderful painting.

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:19.329
It's said to be the best
painting of glass ever made--

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:21.680
different textures
and colors of glass.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.800
His wife helped him
greatly in his experiments,

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.369
as we'll see in a moment.

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:28.369
And Lavoisier did many,
many striking experiments.

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:29.460
Here is one.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.290
This is Lavoisier's is famous
burning glass experiment.

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:35.040
He invented really the idea
of elements-- particles

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.920
which couldn't be
broken down any further.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.460
He got rid of the
idea of phlogiston

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.530
that somehow there
was a substance

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:46.580
in every chemical, which
when it was burned, was lost.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.666
He got rid of the
idea altogether.

00:17:48.666 --> 00:17:50.040
This is a very
clever experiment.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.050
What he did was to make
a big double burning

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:56.170
glass outside the Louvre and put
a diamond at the focus, which

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:57.240
is what he's doing now.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.970
And when it was opened and
the sun streamed through it,

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:02.760
of course, the
diamond disappeared.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.150
Carbon in its
crystalline form had

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:08.320
been combined with oxygen
to make carbon dioxide,

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.400
then it blew away.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.930
And of course this
greatly alarmed

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:13.690
the grand ladies who were
parading through the Luxembourg

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:15.290
Gardens at the time.

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:17.710
But it was a proof of course
that you could combine things

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:18.540
in this way.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.340
And Lavoisier founded
modern chemistry,

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:25.270
but also founded
modern physiology,

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.750
as we call it, the modern
study of the workings

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:28.780
of the human body.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.690
And his line was, which it
was radical in that day,

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:35.470
but is quite correct is that
life is chemistry that actually

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:38.950
what happened to the diamond
is what happens to us.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:41.230
And he did a
respiration experiment.

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:43.886
And here he is in his laboratory
in the back the there.

00:18:43.886 --> 00:18:46.010
In the rear there is Madame
Lavoisier taking notes.

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:48.800
He's got a subject
sitting in a chair.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.750
You can see him.

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.220
His name was Seguin.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.200
And Seguin has got a mask on.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.540
And he's breathing in oxygen,
which is being generated,

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.440
and breathing out
carbon dioxide.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:03.230
And indeed, Lavoisier was
able to work out that there

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.080
was a balance between the two.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.430
Then they made Seguin exercise
on a thing that looked a bit

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:09.840
like a stationary bicycle.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.300
It pulled up a heavy weight.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.700
And then his metabolic rate,
as we would say today, went up.

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.340
They measured the amount
of heat generated.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.360
Lavoisier invented
the calorimeter,

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.870
which an apparatus with ice in
it into which he put a guinea

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.700
pig-- the first person to
use a guinea pig in biology--

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:30.040
put a guinea pig and measured
the respiration of the guinea

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.700
pig and measured the
amount of heat involved.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.930
So he published his results
in the year of the revolution.

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:39.030
"The animal machine is
governed by three times

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:42.570
the regulator's-- respiration,"
which involves oxygen

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:45.380
and carbon and furnishes
heat, digestion,

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.970
replenishes that which
is lost in the lungs,

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:51.930
and transpiration that increases
or diminishes in accordance

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.960
with the necessity to carry
away more or less heat.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.680
So life was indeed chemistry.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:04.004
Now, there's a balance in that
between the amount of exercise

00:20:04.004 --> 00:20:06.170
you do and the amount of
energy and oxygen you need,

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:07.840
which I'll return
to in a moment.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.430
I'll just mention
another unexpected fact.

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.070
This is Jean-Paul
Marat, who led one

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:17.130
of the vicious
groups of the post

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:18.850
revolutionary years
the group in fact

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:22.110
which the prosecution in
the end executed Lavoisier.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:25.460
And Marat is famous for
having been a politician.

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.300
He died stabbed in his
bath by Charlotte Corday.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.490
But before he was a
politician, he was a scientist.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.430
And he actually
lived in Britain.

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:36.900
Here we have a reprint
of two tracts--

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.130
one "An Essay on Gleets."

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:42.370
Gleets, as we all know, is
nonspecific urethritis ,

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:43.620
or venereal disease.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:47.470
And Marat was a doctor and
was interested in treating VD.

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.630
And actually, was a
rather more successful

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.420
than many of the brutal
techniques then used.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.500
And secondly, he was
interested in the eyes.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.220
And he stopped people
using mercury, which they

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.850
used to use to treat the eyes.

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:02.000
And actually, Marat got a
degree from the University

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.260
of St. Andrews.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.670
All he had to do was to
pay the university do

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:09.540
this, which led Dr.
Johnson, the famous sage,

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:14.190
to say the University of St.
Andrews gets richer by degrees.

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:15.900
And at 9,000 pounds a year.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:19.380
They're still doing it, at least
the English universities are.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.470
So that as Marat.

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.940
Marat's science
was very strange.

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.860
He developed a thing called
the solar microscope, which put

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.290
sunlight through a microscope.

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:31.500
And he persuaded himself that he
could see, if you had a candle,

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:35.720
you could see phlogiston
or elemental fire

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.010
being released by the candle.

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:41.370
So he thought that Lavoisier's
dismissal of phlogiston

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:42.570
was wrong.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:46.020
And that led him to persecute
the poor old Lavoisier,

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.610
and in the end, to kill him.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:50.820
And here he is being
murdered in his bath.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:55.600
So all right, that's the
physiology of Lavoisier.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.900
Here's one of the last two
tollgates in the world--

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.170
La Ratonde, which is a very
good and very expensive

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:03.190
restaurant on the
Canal Saint-Martin.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:04.590
I have eaten in it once.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:08.310
But it was it was too
expensive to go to very often.

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:12.380
If you eat in such places
too frequently, and perhaps

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:15.320
much cheaper places,
what will happen to you?

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:18.290
Your balance in the
Lavoisier equation

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:21.530
will change, because you'll
be taking in too much energy

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.260
and not losing it, OK?

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.700
And what that has done
in the last 30 years

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.691
is lead to an
epidemic of obesity.

00:22:29.691 --> 00:22:31.440
And here we have, and
I'll go very quickly

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.510
through these-- these are
the figures for people

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:34.560
who are morbidly obese.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.710
And that's really obese in
the United States from 1985

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:39.010
until today.

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:42.200
In 1985, plenty of states
didn't have any data in them.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.490
So they're white.

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:47.030
But the warmth of the color
shows what proportion of people

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:48.060
are morbidly obese.

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:51.860
And only a few states
had more than 10%.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.490
That was 1985.

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:59.430
By 1990, a majority of
states had more than 10%.

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:04.540
By 1995, we are getting some
states-- almost half-- about 1

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.202
in 6 are morbidly obese.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:13.790
By 2000, we're getting plenty
of states where it's 1 in 5.

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:19.820
By 2005, states where we're
getting towards 1 in 3.

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:23.970
By 2010, 1 in 3 or so is common.

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:30.710
And in 2015, we've got plenty
of states where it's more than 1

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:32.990
in 3 are morbidly obese.

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:36.480
So that's a major
health problem.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.360
It's not confined to the states.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.710
It happened in Europe too--
liberte, egalite, obesite.

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:44.310
And what's striking
both in the States

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:45.685
and in Europe, of
course, that we

00:23:45.685 --> 00:23:47.540
live in a unique moment
in human history,

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:51.240
because the rich are thin,
and the poor are fat.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:55.950
And that's a complete reversal
of the historical event.

00:23:55.950 --> 00:24:01.570
So that's what happens when
you unbalance the Lavoisier

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:05.781
equation by taking in more
fuel than you are able to burn.

00:24:05.781 --> 00:24:07.530
But there's the other
side of the equation

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:12.200
too when you burn more than
you can take in as fuel.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.630
And the Tour de France is an
absolute exemplar of that.

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:18.930
The Tour de France
at the end circled

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:22.560
some of the monuments of
the revolution, of course.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.710
And the Tour de France
began, as only in France,

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:25.870
as a political gesture.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:30.807
It began in 1903 to do
with the Dreyfus Affair.

00:24:30.807 --> 00:24:32.390
And many of you will
know that Dreyfus

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:36.380
was a Jewish French
senior soldier, who

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:40.260
was accused of treason quite
wrongly-- was sentenced

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.480
to Devil's Island.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.480
There was a huge row in
France that went on for years.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.510
And the whole country
split over Dreyfus.

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:50.040
In the end, Emile Zola
wrote a bitter editorial.

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.860
And Dreyfus was released.

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:55.460
But there had been
a bicycle magazine.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.190
There had been a
bicycle magazine,

00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:00.400
and of course, cycling
was getting popular then,

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.270
I called "The Velo."

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:05.880
Now, one of the advertisers
in that magazine

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.740
was a bitter anti-Semite,
an anti-Dreyfusar.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.480
But that "The Velo"
was pro-Dreyfus.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.450
So the anti-Semite
said, I'm not going

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:14.700
to advertise with you anymore.

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.630
I'm going to start my
own magazine which is

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:19.200
going to be called "The Auto."

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.990
And the first act
of "The Auto" was

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:26.130
to have a bicycle
tour around France.

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:28.230
And the first one was
enormously challenging.

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:31.330
The first lap went
from Paris to Leon.

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:35.560
And it took 18 hours
nonstop cycling to do it.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.890
Now, from the very beginning,
people began to cheat.

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:41.550
Here's the first cheat
in the Tour de France.

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:44.260
He looks like a
bit of a villain.

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.810
And in fact, he took the train.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:49.010
And they found the train ticket.

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:50.880
But he has some noble fellows.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.040
Here is Lance Armstrong, of
course, who was a major cheat.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.700
And in fact, people now suggest
that the whole of the Tour de

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:00.210
France is an uncontrolled
experiment in pharmacology.

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:02.030
Everybody cheats.

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:03.220
Everybody cheated.

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.070
People have died through
taking various drugs.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:08.970
And quite remarkably,
the man in the iron mask

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:12.170
was the first to
isolate morphine.

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.750
Very soon after that,
he isolated strychnine.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:17.530
And these are the kinds of
drugs that have been widely used

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:20.350
by athletes to try and
improve their performance

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:22.340
or to get rid of pain.

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.880
So that's another
time with the history.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.220
Now, it is an
interesting spin on this,

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.980
because I'm coming to
the end of the talk

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.710
now, because Condorcet,
who I've mentioned already,

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:37.710
the philosopher, was actually
a very forward thinker.

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:42.000
He was a particularly
against the idea

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.990
that you could classify
people's rights by biology.

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:49.520
He was very strongly in favor
of women being able to vote,

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.360
for example.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.140
And in the end, he
succeeded-- women

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:56.090
could vote-- to "the claim
that any human group is

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:57.760
of its essence less
or more blessed

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.780
with particular
abilities is an attempt

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.370
to make nature
herself an accomplice

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:04.340
of political inequality."

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.660
Well, that's a very
noble sentiment.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:11.120
But actually, exercise,
physiology, and extreme sport

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.900
shows that he was wrong.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.420
And this really has
placed sports, and perhaps

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:18.890
many other things
with a dilemma,

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:22.960
because it turns out that
people of African origin

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:26.020
have different metabolic
patterns than people

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.420
of European origin.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.110
These are the overall
obesity of frequencies

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:32.010
in the United States for 2010.

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:34.970
If we just do, and as I
say, the warmer the color,

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:37.320
the higher the proportion
of obese people.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.630
So that's white, black and
Hispanics in this group.

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:42.340
And here we have African
Americans in 2010.

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:44.840
And if you compare
that with the overall,

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.700
you'll see there is much more
obesity in African Americans

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:51.060
than in the
population as a whole.

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.437
Now, part of that without
doubt is cultural.

00:27:53.437 --> 00:27:55.270
It's clear that
African-American are poorer.

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:56.540
They have a worse diet.

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.110
They often take less exercise.

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:00.120
And there's more
acceptance of obesity,

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.800
it's said, in that
group than others.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.786
But part of it is
in fact biological.

00:28:03.786 --> 00:28:05.410
I don't know how well
you can see this,

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:09.370
but these are the genetic risks
towards obesity and diabetes

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:12.420
in Africa versus other
countries in the black line,

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:14.620
to the right there, is
the African frequency.

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:15.970
And it's quite a big effect.

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:17.950
Africans have different
metabolic patterns

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:20.570
for reasons we simply
don't understand from us.

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:22.960
Now, that's a
problem with obesity.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.820
But actually, when you're taking
the other side of the Lavoisier

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.380
equation, and you're
exercising like mad,

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:29.730
it's actually a bit of a gift.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:30.830
Right?

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:33.320
Here is where it
shows it most of all.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.260
Here's the Paris
Marathon-- fifth biggest

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:40.403
in the world-- 42 kilometers.

00:28:40.403 --> 00:28:44.460
And it follows the end of the
course of the Tour de France.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.960
And in fact, there's
been a striking shift

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:52.340
in the nature of the world's
top 25 marathon runners.

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:56.070
In the early part of the
century, 50 years ago or so,

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:57.500
almost none came from Africa.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:01.260
Now almost all of them
come from Africa, OK?

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:04.040
Now, that without
question is partly

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:07.560
a social thing in that if you
win one of these top marathons,

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.550
you make a lot of
money and particularly

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:12.160
if you're an African that
maybe wants to buy a farm.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.880
So there's plenty of impetus
from that point of view.

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.160
But there's biology
in there as well.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.710
There is a group
called the Kalenjin,

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:24.710
who have an extraordinary
pattern of physiology.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:28.080
They are super athletes
from the word go.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:32.000
They live very high up in
the mountains of Kenya.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.800
And they have many
evolved adaptations

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.870
to a low oxygen environment.

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:41.340
Most people, most of us, if we
are climbing Everest let's say

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:44.720
and we have low oxygen, your
body does something very odd.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:48.460
It shuts off the blood supply
to about half the alveoli,

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:52.280
the little absorbing
surfaces in the lung,

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.260
to allow the other half
to work efficiently.

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:58.090
However, the Kalenjin
don't have that

00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:01.560
so that all the alveoli work,
because they're constantly

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.430
under the low oxygen. And
they've adapted to it this way.

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:05.790
And that's quite a big effect.

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:08.740
So they can soak up oxygen
much more efficiently

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.440
as well as metabolizing
much more effectively

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.830
than Westerners.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:14.580
They have the mechanical
little advantage

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.270
of having very long limbs.

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:18.710
But that's important,
because they can lose heat

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:20.550
very efficiently as well.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:23.650
And in fact, the Kalenjin
represent 1/2,000th

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:24.940
of the world's population.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:28.350
But they're one-fifth of
the top marathon runners.

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:30.660
They live at 2,000 meters or so.

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.450
Even before they're born,
they're oxygen stressed.

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:40.070
And so they generate more blood
vessels to transport oxygen.

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:41.690
They run from childhood onwards.

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:45.060
Plenty of them run 10 miles to
school and 10 miles back again.

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:47.330
They tolerate higher
body temperatures.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:49.020
They've got lower
pain sensitivity

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:50.740
and various other
things, which means

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:53.120
they are genetically
predisposed to win

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.410
in this kind of operation.

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:57.360
So really, that
idea that we're all

00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:01.950
equal in extreme circumstances
in the Lavoisier sense

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:03.095
is clearly wrong.

00:31:03.095 --> 00:31:05.220
Now, that doesn't mean to
say the environment isn't

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:05.780
important.

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:09.220
It's not widely known that
Mo Farah, probably the best

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:12.450
athlete in the world, has
an identical twin brother.

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:13.700
Mo came to Britain.

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:16.120
His brother stayed
at home in Somalia

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.730
and became a motor mechanic.

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:20.080
Mo tells us that he used
to race his brother.

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.360
And half the time he'd win.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.026
And half the time his
brother would win.

00:31:23.026 --> 00:31:26.027
But of course now, of course,
Mo would win every time.

00:31:26.027 --> 00:31:27.110
The genes haven't changed.

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:28.130
But Mo was trained.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:29.670
So training is important.

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:33.550
But genes and biology
are important too.

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:37.800
Now, let's just remind ourselves
of what happened to the people,

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.360
Lavoisier included, at the
time of the revolution.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.360
These slides, which I'm
going to gallop through,

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.060
are the people who were either
imprisoned, or executed,

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.580
or murdered at the time of the
revolution, each one of which

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.130
was a scientist,
many of whom would

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:52.430
have won Nobel Prizes today.

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:54.440
The ones in black were
merely imprisoned.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.440
The ones in red were killed,
most of them guillotine.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.520
And lots of red splashes
there, and more red splashes,

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.170
and a whole pile
more red splashes.

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:07.120
So it wasn't
actually a rare fate

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.780
for a scientist to be
executed for his behavior

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.227
and his beliefs.

00:32:12.227 --> 00:32:13.810
Now, strangely enough,
we have nothing

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:19.040
at all of that on this
side of the channel.

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.770
There are almost no
examples of scientists

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:23.570
becoming involved in politics.

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:26.740
However, as we all
remember, there is one.

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:28.370
Here we have a
British scientist,

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:31.960
who became a politician
posing for an election

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:35.230
leaflet in 1951.

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:37.440
And she worked on
saponification.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.670
And saponification,
as many of you know,

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:43.070
is treating oils
with alkali to make

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:46.340
soft soap-- a very appropriate
thing for a politician to do.

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:48.730
And that is of course
Margaret Thatcher.

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:51.170
Now, whether or not she
should have been imprisoned

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:53.030
or be executed, I don't know.

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:55.400
But it's kind of a statement
of how extraordinary

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.320
really the world
across the channel

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:01.660
had been in 1789 when scientists
were at the absolute center

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:03.410
of political life.

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:05.180
Now, that's never
happened in Britain.

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:08.890
In many ways I think
we're fortunate in that.

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:11.710
We're quite happy grubbing away
in our own laboratory and our

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:13.680
in front of our own
computer scientists.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:17.670
And that philosophy
was summarized

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:21.080
by a great predecessor
of Margaret Thatcher.

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.742
"Scientists should be
on tap and not on top."

00:33:24.742 --> 00:33:26.140
And I'll stop there.

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:27.750
Thank you.

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:29.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:35.404 --> 00:33:36.820
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
have a question.

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:39.520
What was the most interesting
scientific discovery

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.949
that you came across
while writing this book?

00:33:42.949 --> 00:33:44.490
DR. STEVE JONES:
The most interesting

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:46.450
scientific discovery?

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:51.331
Well, I think there was a
mathematician, many of you

00:33:51.331 --> 00:33:53.205
know, called Laplace,
who was a mathematician

00:33:53.205 --> 00:33:54.630
and an astronomer.

00:33:54.630 --> 00:34:02.420
And he was the guy who
gave us the mathematics

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:03.530
of the Universe.

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:07.680
He worked out the way in
which the solar system worked.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.750
And he was very
strongly of the opinion

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:12.699
that it was all like a
gigantic clock, a machine.

00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:15.400
And Newton, who we
Brits tend to think

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.500
was the originator
of modern astronomy,

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:21.969
actually believed that God
had designed the Universe

00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:23.400
and spun it into motion.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.489
And it was proof of God's works.

00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:29.139
And in fact, Newton
wrote 10 times as much

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:32.250
about the book of
God's words, the Bible,

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:35.810
rather than the book of God's
works, astronomy and gravity.

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:39.020
Laplace solves several problems
that Newton couldn't manage

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:42.170
and persuaded himself that
the whole of the Universe

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:45.110
was ordered and
would be predicted.

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:47.350
And if you knew what
happened on day one,

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:50.300
you could be absolutely certain
of what would happen on day 10

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:52.199
billion and 1.

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:53.840
And that was actually
the philosophy

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.510
that was behind the revolution.

00:34:56.510 --> 00:35:00.960
When Napoleon, who himself
studied with Laplace,

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.090
read Laplace's
extraordinarily dense book,

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:07.100
which is way above my
head, about mathematics.

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:09.710
Napoleon asked
Laplace, why is there

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:11.460
no mention of God in this book?

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.490
And Laplace came up
with my favorite phrase,

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:15.950
which is I have no need
of that hypothesis.

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:17.680
You don't need God.

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:21.360
But of course, the startling
discovery we now know

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.870
is, of course, that Laplace
was completely wrong.

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:27.629
The Universe is chaotic--
Big Bang, black holes,

00:35:27.629 --> 00:35:29.420
all that stuff-- we
can't predict anything.

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:31.780
And amazingly
enough, the discovery

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:33.630
of that chaos--
where was it found?

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:35.870
It was found on the
top of the Eiffel Tower

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:43.080
in 1903 when radiation had been
discovered in Paris, of course,

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.650
by the Curies.

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:46.100
And somebody had
the bright idea--

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.460
they had a radium source.

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.840
And you could measure
it 300 meters away.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.140
The radiation declined
with distance,

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:54.220
as we all know, the
square of the distance.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.440
And somebody had the
bright idea just checking

00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:00.120
of going, say, what happens if
we go vertically 300 meters?

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.040
And what happens to the
radiation source than?

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.470
It turned out it declined.

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:05.150
But it didn't decline enough.

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:07.330
And he suggested,
it was a priest

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:09.660
who did it actually, he
suggested that there was

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.387
radiation coming in from space.

00:36:11.387 --> 00:36:13.220
And that's where cosmic
rays were discovered

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:14.520
on the top of the Eiffel Tower.

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.790
He was laughed out of court.

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:18.670
But he was right on
those cosmic rays

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:21.250
are the crashing and
banging of the chaos

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:23.080
of the Universe,
which is blasting

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.500
the Earth at all times.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.390
So that's another
reason why it's worth

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:28.910
visiting the Eiffel Tower.

00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:29.410
Thank you.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:37.110
AUDIENCE: Do you think that
quote still kind of applies

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:40.110
to British politics
at the moment

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:42.230
considering how
funding potentially

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:45.954
might be going with government
funding and lobbying?

00:36:45.954 --> 00:36:47.370
DR. STEVE JONES:
Well, what's very

00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:49.960
striking about British
politics at the moment,

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.080
depressing though
it is, is there

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.490
are no scientists in Parliament.

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:55.810
There was one last time.

00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:57.480
A time before, there were two.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.372
Now there's none.

00:36:59.372 --> 00:37:02.740
And I think that's unfortunate.

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:07.460
I've forgotten how many lawyers
there are-- 250 or something?

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:09.640
I think we should
be playing a part.

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:14.050
But apparently we're not
interested in playing a part.

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:15.150
It's a difficult problem.

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:17.115
And science funding
is being cut.

00:37:17.115 --> 00:37:18.490
But we have to
remember, it's not

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:23.065
being as cut as much as
many other things are too.

00:37:23.065 --> 00:37:25.510
And I'm not convinced that
if we were on top that

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:27.260
would make much difference.

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:31.930
The only other revolution where
scientists, or maybe there

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:34.170
are two, where scientists
have played a part

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:36.690
was in the Russian
Revolution, there

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:38.330
was an attempt to
bring scientists in.

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:40.630
But that failed
miserably, because as

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:44.700
soon as the Mensheviks, the
moderates, had been ousted,

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:49.670
then we got all this
stuff like Lysenkoism,

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:53.150
where the politics defined what
the science should be saying.

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:55.080
And that, of course,
doesn't work.

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.284
And in the Chinese
Revolution, Chairman Mao

00:37:57.284 --> 00:37:59.200
was interested in getting
scientists involved.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.810
And that didn't
really work either.

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:04.750
So I think the observation is
on the three times it's been

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:06.350
tried, it's failed every time.

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:08.122
So I think we
shouldn't try it again.

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.590
AUDIENCE: What was it in
Paris at the time which

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:16.085
meant that scientists
became politicians?

00:38:16.085 --> 00:38:17.710
You said that didn't
happen in England.

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:19.189
But what was unique about Paris?

00:38:19.189 --> 00:38:21.230
DR. STEVE JONES: I think
what did it was actually

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:22.180
quite straightforward.

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.570
It was money.

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:28.540
Now, Louis the XIV had
founded the Royal Academy

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:32.160
of Sciences, which had
its home in the Louvre.

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:35.440
And that was just
after 661, which

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.709
was when the Royal Society
of London was founded.

00:38:37.709 --> 00:38:39.750
But there was a great
difference between the two.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:43.550
Now, the Royal Society in London
was a private gentleman's club.

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:47.490
And there were great scientists
of astonishing ability

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:50.380
who help found it--
Christopher Wren included,

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:51.860
and Boyle, and all these people.

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:54.790
But they joined the club,
which they paid to belong to.

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:57.650
And I say with a
certain amount of shame

00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:59.610
that I actually belong
to the club myself.

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:01.474
And every year I
curse and swear when

00:39:01.474 --> 00:39:03.890
I have to pay 150 pounds to
do all this work for the Royal

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:04.700
Society.

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:06.690
Whereas in Paris, it was
the other way around.

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:08.750
What happened in the Royal
Academy of Sciences--

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:11.770
if you were elected to the
Royal Academy of Sciences,

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:14.140
you were paid a very
generous salary.

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:16.280
So of course, that
allowed plenty of people

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:19.060
to spend their lives full
time working on science.

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:21.750
There were no professional
scientists in Britain

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:25.120
really until probably
the 1860s, I would say.

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.230
They were all either rich
amateurs like Darwin,

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:30.900
who was extraordinarily
rich, or a few of them

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.970
were employed by the Royal
Institution, let's say.

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:36.604
But beyond that, they
were all dilettantes.

00:39:36.604 --> 00:39:38.645
Whereas in Paris, they
had this scientific class.

00:39:38.645 --> 00:39:42.360
And I think that a
lot to do with it.

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.390
AUDIENCE: I was
interested in what

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:48.330
you thought about the balance
between politics and science

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:51.530
and how much scientists
have removed themselves

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:53.160
from politics to
the extent that when

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:56.540
we have, for instance,
medical research, scientists

00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:00.190
often now will kind of correct
for confounding factors, which

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:01.150
are probably political.

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:03.980
So they'll say, OK, let's
strip out the effect of this--

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:08.020
this poverty, whatever it is,
and produce recommendations

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:10.880
which are about changes
that the individual can make

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:14.730
that has profound political
effect if all of the scientist

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:16.642
recommendations
are all about what

00:40:16.642 --> 00:40:18.850
the things we do that when
we strip out those effects

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:20.950
rather than make perhaps
easier-to-implement

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:24.340
recommendations, which change
the politics that causes

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.600
those confounding factors.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.400
DR. STEVE JONES: Yes,
I think you're right.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.860
There's a long and
ignoble history

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:34.280
of science itself being
used, being abused,

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.650
to political ends.

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:40.030
RA Fisher, who worked at
University College, London,

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:42.960
who really was, as I'm
sure all of you know,

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.140
was a central figure
in the development

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:46.240
of modern statistics.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.560
He spent most of his career
working for the tobacco

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.080
industry.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.120
And he was a chain smoker
himself, incidentally,

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:55.670
saying there was no link
between smoking and lung cancer,

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:58.000
because that was correlation
and not causation.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.470
Now, of course, if you want
to wear your Bayesian hat,

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:03.570
he was right, It is a
correlation, not causation.

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:06.060
But the correlation
is so damn strong,

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:10.230
that you really should
take some notice of it.

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:13.810
But the tobacco industry managed
to stay ahead of the game

00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:17.090
by appealing to this
great statistician.

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:21.410
So science has been abused.

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:23.170
Scientists make recommendations.

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:24.900
They've made
recommendations about sugar,

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:29.790
for example, which simply shown
no sign of being implemented.

00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:34.490
And that obesity epidemic
is much more serious

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:36.930
than the lung cancer
epidemic, because lung cancer

00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:37.950
is a great way to go.

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:40.040
You go to your doctor--
got a bit of a cough.

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:43.580
The doctor says, oh, dear, don't
start reading any long books,

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:46.572
because your survival
chances are low.

00:41:46.572 --> 00:41:48.030
You're not going
to last very long.

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:49.970
And you're not
going to cost a lot.

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:52.780
With type 2 diabetes, it will
probably kill you in the end.

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:55.200
But it's going to take
15 years of increasingly

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.200
expensive treatment.

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.240
So it's a real, real problem.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:00.840
And yet all governments,
almost without exception,

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.710
have failed to act on sugar.

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:07.330
Now, people like us--
we're aware of the risks.

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:09.090
And so we behave properly.

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:11.750
But other people aren't.

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:13.850
I've mentioned
Somalia and Mo Farah.

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:21.540
The average male life expectancy
in Britain and Somalia--

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:24.600
in Somalia, it's 28 years
less than in Britain.

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:26.795
And Somalia is a country
torn apart by civil war.

00:42:26.795 --> 00:42:28.240
It has famines and the like.

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:29.430
Let's go to Glasgow.

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:32.050
The average life expectancy
in the center of Glasgow,

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:35.110
in what used to be the
Gorbals, is 28 years less

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:37.710
for men than life
expectancy in Lenzie,

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:40.160
which is five miles away,
which is a nice suburb.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.600
So over five miles
in Glasgow, we've

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:47.300
got a mortality slope equivalent
to a poor African country

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:49.120
and a rich European country.

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:51.830
And that's because people
are not being told the truth.

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:54.500
Or maybe they are being told
the truth by scientists,

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.690
but the truth is being
disguised from them by people

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:57.730
who want to make money.

00:42:57.730 --> 00:43:02.670
So I think really
science can only advise.

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:05.290
I think as long as science
is advisory, then it works.

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:08.320
But once like as
in the revolution,

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.050
science thinks it
knows the answer,

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:11.390
because they are the scientists.

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:13.734
Then I think then
you get into trouble.

00:43:13.734 --> 00:43:15.400
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK,
thank you professor.

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:16.525
DR. STEVE JONES: Thank you.

00:43:16.525 --> 00:43:18.390
