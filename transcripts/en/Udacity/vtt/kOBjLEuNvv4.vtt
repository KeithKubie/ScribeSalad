00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.590
The answer is not the first one, please
do not cross the Canadian border and

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.710
start driving 100 miles an hour.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:06.600
And it's not the third.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.800
Pretty much all around the world,
people use seconds, minutes, and

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.700
hours to measure time but
there is a difference

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.250
in how people in the United States and
people in Canada measure distance.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.980
In fact, most of the world uses
the kilometer to measure distance,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.980
whereas in the United States
people use the mile.
