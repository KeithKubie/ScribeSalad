00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:03.360
Water… water…

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.790
I’m so… thirsty…

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.970
Is that tap?

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.839
Nah, I’m good.

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.330
Hey there parched party people, Jules here
for DNews.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.609
There’s a theory that when you’\e hungry
and you eat a meal, your body takes about

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.590
20 minutes for the “I’m full” signal
to reach your brain.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.680
This “fullness gap” can lead to overeating,
which can lead to fatness.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.980
But despite this slow moving phenomenon with
hunger, the same doesn’t seem to exist with

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:33.980
thirst.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.409
Quenching thirst happens immediately, and
over watering isn’t really something people

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:38.409
do by accident.

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:42.190
So… what’s the difference and why do we
get thirsty in the thirst place?

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.660
Well, mainly so we don’t die.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.750
Water is THE most important nutrient for basically
all animals, it’s one of the big reasons

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.210
we are all able to live and survive on earth,
which is roughly 71% of water.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.150
Humans, are about 60% water and this proportion
matters.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.670
Because when water leaves your body by sweating,
pooping, peeing, breathing, and crying, as

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.360
we all do every day, it needs to be replaced.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.340
The brain is able to control your body through
electrical impulses that run through electrolytes,

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.600
like salt, in your cells.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.070
When the balance of electrolytes is off and
you become dehydrated, it may be harder to

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.420
move, think, see, and it can literally kill
you.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.990
So, simply enough, thirst, is the body’s
response to unbalanced fluid levels in your

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.990
bloodstream.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.960
At least, that’s what we’ve always thought.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.180
See when your brain detects that your blood
is too salty, neurons fire and generate a

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.180
“thirst response”.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.960
But once you’ve had some water, just like
with food, it takes at least a little bit

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.040
of time for your blood levels to normalize.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.180
Yet, drinking water, especially COLD water,
seems to immediately satisfy the feeling of

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.720
thirst, even before your blood levels are
healthy again.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.440
Why is thirst instant, but hunger takes time?

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.220
Well, it turns out that brains are a little
smarter than us.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.090
See, overeating is actually kind of a good
thing -- at least to the brain.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.690
We can store food as fat and use it later
for energy, and there’s no reason to stop

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.930
eating when we’re hungry because our mammalian
ancestors didn’t have swimsuit season.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.780
On the other hand, drinking too much water
in too short a time can literally kill you.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.960
According to the American Chemistry Society,
it can take less than two gallons of water

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.560
to kill a 165-pound person.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.990
So how does the brain know when to stop drinking?

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.900
Well, a 2016 study on thirst in mice by researchers
from the University of California, San Francisco,

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.500
found that an area of the brain called the
subfornical organ, reacts immediately to oral

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.670
stimulation.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.890
Neurons within the SFO are actually able to
predict your future fluid levels based on

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.680
your current blood composition and how much
water or food is in your mouth.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.190
When they think you’ve had enough, they
stop firing and you stop feeling thirsty.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.750
That’s pretty amazing, since a miscalculation
on your brain’s part could literally kill

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.750
you.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.040
What’s even more amazing is that these neurons
don’t just react to moisture, but to temperature

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.370
as well.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.959
Researchers found that in mice, cold liquids
dulled the thirst neurons faster than warmer

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.319
liquids, and even just cooling the mouth could
inhibit the thirst response, without introducing

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.599
any liquid at all.

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.660
These thirst neurons are an incredible discovery,
because not only are they able to parse data

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.430
from a number of different, and tangentially
related sources; the mouth, the brain, the

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.730
blood, but they also automatically make predictions
based on that information.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.660
But despite the incredible nature of thirst,
there’s absolutely nothing the subfornical

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.880
organ can do about how thirsty we are for
Channing Tatum.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.050
So what happens when all that crying and pooping
leaves you dehydrated?

thirst?
