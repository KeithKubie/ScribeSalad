00:00:01.802 --> 00:00:03.837
GENE'S BEST FRIEND
WAS ABSURD,

00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:06.974
AND HE PROPOSED AN INTERESTING,
IF UNORTHODOX, WAY

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:08.342
TO SETTLE THE ISSUE.

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:10.244
- YOU KNOW, BACK IN BASIC,
WE HAD A SAYING.

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:13.413
"DON'T TALK THE TALK
IF YOU CAN'T WALK THE WALK."

00:00:13.447 --> 00:00:15.682
- MEANING?

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:18.585
- I'M CHALLENGING YOU
TO A FRIEND-OFF.

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.153
- WHAT IS THAT?

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:21.922
- WE WILL TRY TO OUT-FRIEND
EACH OTHER WITH GENE

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:25.359
UNTIL ONE GUY CAN'T FRIEND
ANYMORE, AND THEN HE GOES,

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:27.928
FOR GOOD.
- OKAY.

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.129
YOU'RE ON.

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:30.764
I CAN OUT-FRIEND YOU ANY DAY.

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:31.999
- HEY, GUYS, CAN YOU REMIND ME

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.767
TO GET TOILET PAPER
ON THE WAY HOME?

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.169
- YES, ABSOLUTELY.

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:36.770
IN FACT, I WILL SET
AN ALARM ON MY PHONE

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:39.006
TO REMIND ME TO REMIND YOU
TO GET TOILET PAPER.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.543
- I'LL GET YOU ENOUGH
TOILET PAPER TO LAST 100 YEARS.

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:44.011
- I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GONNA KEEP

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.712
ALL THAT TOILET PAPER.

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:49.283
SO I POURED IT ON, FRIENDING
AS HARD AS I COULD FRIEND.

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:51.385
HEY, GUYS!
[chuckles]

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:52.953
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MY FRIEND.

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:54.988
- OH, MY BIRTHDAY
WAS TWO MONTHS AGO, FORREST.

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:56.290
- HOP ON, MY FRIEND.
- OH, MY--

00:00:56.323 --> 00:00:58.492
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL, FORREST.
- IT IS.

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:00.294
YOU KNOW, THIS IS WHAT
BEST FRIENDS DO.

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:01.828
- YEAH.
- THAT'S REALLY NICE,

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:03.630
BUT YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL
WITH THESE THINGS.

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:05.232
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN
READING ABOUT 'EM,

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:06.967
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
RUNNING OVER THEIR KIDS.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.502
- YEAH, WELL--
- KID LOST PART OF HIS FACE.

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:10.070
- I-I'VE BEEN READING
ABOUT 'EM TOO.

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:11.572
THEY SAID IT WAS NO BIG DEAL.

00:01:11.605 --> 00:01:13.540
WHAT THEY'RE DOING
WITH FACES THESE DAYS--

00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:15.409
THEY TAKE SOMEBODY'S FACE, AND
THEY PUT IT ON SOMEBODY ELSE,

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:16.877
SO THEY GET
THIS FACIAL RECONSTRUCTION.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.312
I'M NOT SAYING
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:19.313
- RIGHT.
- I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA

00:01:19.346 --> 00:01:20.581
RUN OVER CLAYTON'S FACE

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:22.649
OR HE'S GONNA LOSE
ANY OF HIS FACE.

00:01:22.683 --> 00:01:24.318
BUT I'M SAYING IF IT DID HAPPEN,
THEY'VE GOT THE SCIENCE NOW--

00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:25.986
BUT CARLOS PROVED
TO BE A WORTHY ADVERSARY.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.588
THE BEST PLACE IN TOWN.
- OH, MY GOD.

00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:28.856
WHAT IS THAT
IN THE BACKYARD?

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:31.191
- OH, YOU'RE HERE.

00:01:31.225 --> 00:01:33.227
- WHAT IS THAT?
- WAIT A SECOND.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.195
ISN'T THAT THE NEW GRILL
THAT I JUST GOT YOU

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.730
THAT YOU SHOULD BE MAKING
BURGERS ON RIGHT NOW?

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:40.767
COME ON.
- CARLOS! YOU ARE AWESOME!

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:43.737
- BURGERS?
- DON'T TOUCH IT!

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.105
I WANT TO TOUCH IT.
I WANT TO TOUCH IT.

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.406
HEY, MAN,
THIS THING'S AWESOME.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.841
- WELL, IT'S STAINLESS STEEL.

00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:49.676
IT'S GONNA LAST 100 YEARS.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.879
- THAT'S A LONG TIME
TO EAT FLAVORLESS MEAT.

00:01:51.912 --> 00:01:56.350
YOU KNOW, CHARCOAL GRILLS HAVE
MORE OF A SMOKY TASTE, I FIND.

00:01:56.383 --> 00:01:58.519
- OH, HEY, SUZANNE.

00:01:58.552 --> 00:01:59.720
- SUZANNE.

00:01:59.753 --> 00:02:01.455
HEY, COME JOIN US FOR A BURGER.

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:02.689
- NO, THANK YOU.

00:02:02.723 --> 00:02:04.958
- OH. YOU GOT PLANS?
- NOPE.

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:07.794
- SO FAR, SPENDING TIME
WITH GENE HADN'T DONE ANYTHING

00:02:07.828 --> 00:02:09.897
TO IMPROVE MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH SUZANNE.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.833
SHE'S ALWAYS GOT
SOMETHING GOING ON.

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:16.069
THANKS, GENE.

00:02:16.103 --> 00:02:17.838
BUT I WAS NOT ABOUT TO GIVE UP.
