00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.230
It's tempting.

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.520
Especially when you're starting to
look at screen reader accessibility,

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.420
to add tab index to seemingly
important elements like headers, for

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.320
instance, in order to help out the user.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.350
That's actually counterproductive.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.940
Normally, you only want to add focus
behavior to interactive controls like

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.640
buttons, tabs, drop downs, or anything
that the user might provide input to.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.590
If you're worried about visually
impaired users missing out on your

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.220
content, don't be.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.940
We're going to show in the next few
lessons how screen reader users

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.690
explore non interactive content.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.950
So when you're adding a tab index
attribute, stop and ask yourself,

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.050
is this something the user
is going to interact with?

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.220
If the answer is no, you almost
certainly want to leave it alone

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.200
with the exception of a few caveats
which will cover in just a moment.
