ALEX DANILO: I really
enjoy building websites

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.540
that run nicely on
all sorts of devices.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.657
From phones to
tablets to desktop.

00:00:05.657 --> 00:00:07.490
For me, one of the
hardest things to do well

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.906
is to debug how
my site would look

00:00:08.906 --> 00:00:10.250
on different sized screens.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.690
I'm sure you know
how hard that can be.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.190
Hi, I'm Alex Danilo from the
Google Developer platform team.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.481
And I'm going to show you a
great feature in the Chrome

00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:19.395
DevTools called Device Mode.

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:22.020
Device Mode makes it super easy
to experiment with your content

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.590
and get your site looking
fantastic on any screen.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.370
I've saved so much
time using Device Mode

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.070
that I get to spend a lot more
time making the perfect coffee.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.670
Now, Device Mode lets you try
out your CSS media queries,

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.336
provides a bunch of
built in screen size

00:00:34.336 --> 00:00:35.980
presets for lots
of devices, lets

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.324
you simulate retina displays
on a non-retinal device,

00:00:38.324 --> 00:00:40.240
and even has a Network
Throttling feature that

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.155
lets you simulate slow
cellphone networks.

00:00:43.155 --> 00:00:45.030
So let's take a quick
tour through the Device

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.895
Mode features to show you how
to get going quick [? smart. ?]

00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:49.270
The first thing
you need to do is

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.610
click this little mobile phone
icon in Chrome Developer Tools

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.870
while looking at your site.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:53.870
As soon as you've
done that, you'll

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.286
notice that your
site is displayed

00:00:55.286 --> 00:00:56.820
in a completely different view.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.710
Now is a good time to refresh
your browser window so that it

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.090
gets reloaded with the correct
viewport and user agent

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.040
string settings.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.890
It's really easy to remember
to do that since you'll

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.800
be prompted to refresh it
in a little yellow warning

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.216
window at the top
of the DevTools.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.430
Device Mode changes a
bunch of different things.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.090
Like the user agent
string is modified

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.790
to match the device
it's simulating,

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.589
the viewport gets sized to be
the same as your target device,

00:01:16.589 --> 00:01:18.755
the device pixel ratio gets
set to the correct value

00:01:18.755 --> 00:01:21.630
for high DPI displays,
your text gets autosized

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.080
if the target does so,
and the content window

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.330
displays mobile scroll bars
that look the same as they

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.302
would on the real target device.

00:01:28.302 --> 00:01:29.760
Not only that, but
touch events get

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.480
turned on so that your mouse no
longer triggers hover events.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.090
So no [? colored ?] hover
CSS styles will be applied.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.720
And the touch emulation delivers
events in the exact same order

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.553
as on a real device.

00:01:39.537 --> 00:01:41.745
Now, the main control settings
you use in Device Mode

00:01:41.745 --> 00:01:42.530
are here.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.370
You can choose from a number
of different device preset

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.760
simply by selecting one of
the drop down device options.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.100
You can also set your
viewport to a custom pixel

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.220
width and height by
changing the values shown.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.360
It's easy to change the
device pixel ratio here,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.040
which is also
super useful if you

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.706
want to test that
your site is supplying

00:01:56.706 --> 00:01:58.590
retina optimized
images, for example.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.930
You can also easily flip the
orientation from portrait

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.020
to landscape and back
with this rotation widget.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.360
This makes it so easy to
try out different devices

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.901
and test that your media queries
are working as you'd expect.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.405
Another really handy feature
are these drag handles.

00:02:11.405 --> 00:02:14.030
Now using Device Mode, it's not
necessary to resize the browser

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.424
window to see the site in
different viewport sizes.

00:02:16.424 --> 00:02:18.590
You can just grab these
handles and move them around

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.685
to see the size change.

00:02:19.685 --> 00:02:21.060
Now, what you
might have noticed,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.350
too, is that the pixel size
displayed in the main control

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.433
area updates to tell you
what the current size is.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.430
Now one thing to note here is
if I choose a preset target

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.110
and then drag one of
the sizing handles,

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.050
it'll reset the preset,
since we no longer

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.697
match the size of the
target device we picked.

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:37.780
You might have noticed
this little icon at the top

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.030
here, as well.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.545
What that does is enable
the media query inspector.

00:02:41.545 --> 00:02:42.920
Each of the lines
here represents

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.780
the CSS media query
pixel breakpoints

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.852
that the browser's
detected in your content.

00:02:46.852 --> 00:02:48.310
Now if you click
any of those bars,

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.250
the content window
resizes to match the media

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.260
query breakpoint size
so that you can quickly

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.310
see how media queries
effect layout.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.587
This is so quick and
convenient it's fantastic.

00:02:56.587 --> 00:02:58.420
But even better, you
can right click on them

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.892
to jump to where the media
query is defined in your CSS,

00:03:00.892 --> 00:03:03.225
just in case you want to do
a quick edit of your styles.

00:03:04.626 --> 00:03:07.000
Now, one of the main differences
between a desktop device

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.541
and a mobile device is the kind
of network it's connected to.

00:03:09.541 --> 00:03:11.250
And Device Mode
provides a great feature

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.180
called Network Throttling
to help simulation

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.880
of different
network connections.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.580
Now, as you can see,
there are a number

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.130
of different types
of networks supported

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.296
in the throttling drop down.

00:03:20.207 --> 00:03:22.540
So typically when you're
testing load time on your site,

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.260
you'd use the dev tools
waterfall view, like this.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.400
That tells us all about our page
load and resource load timings.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.840
Now, if I choose a different
network speed simulation

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.520
and reload, you'll
see the page get

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.340
loaded under simulated
network conditions.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.048
Now, as you can see
in our new waterfall,

00:03:36.048 --> 00:03:37.669
it took a lot longer to load.

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:39.335
You can even set no
network connectivity

00:03:39.335 --> 00:03:42.470
to help debug your site if
you expect it to work offline.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.710
No more turning off of
your network required.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.790
Now, even better, this
network throttling only

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.290
applies to the
currently opened tab,

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.440
so you can continue to use
your browser as normal,

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.860
since only the
tab being debugged

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.370
that is affected by
the network throttler.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.890
Now, of course, since we're
simulating mobile devices,

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.780
chances are they're
touch enabled.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.660
Device Mode enables proper touch
simulation using your mouse.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.562
The content gets sent touch
events instead of mouse events.

00:04:04.562 --> 00:04:07.020
So let's take a look at this
text with the Device Mode off.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.990
Now, as you can see,
when I hover over it,

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.380
the text changes color.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.685
If I turn Device Mode
on, no hover events

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:13.719
are sent to the content.

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:15.510
More importantly, the
order of touch events

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.843
sent to the content is identical
to a real device, which

00:04:17.843 --> 00:04:20.800
makes it really easy to
debug your touch handlers.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.887
There are even more
controls for you to explore.

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:25.220
From emulating hardware sensors
that are on your device,

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.514
changing the user agent
stylesheet, and plenty more.

00:04:27.514 --> 00:04:29.680
You can also add screencast
from a connected device,

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.846
and view the rendered content
right inside DevTools.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.490
Device Mode brings
really, really powerful

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.770
debugging capabilities
inside Chrome DevTools.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.090
And it's something I'm sure
you can't wait to explore.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.840
You'll find the links
to our documentation

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.190
here, and as always,
feel free to reach out

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.180
for more information
and feature requests.
