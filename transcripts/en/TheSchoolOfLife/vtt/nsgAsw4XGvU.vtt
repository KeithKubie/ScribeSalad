00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.119
Immanuel Kant is a philosopher who tried
to work out how human beings could be

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.940
good and kind outside of the
exaltations and blandishments of

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.029
traditional religions. He was born in
1724, in the Baltic city of Königsberg,

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.940
which at that time was part of Prussia
and now belongs to Russia, renamed

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.380
Kaliningrad. Kant's parents were very
modest, his father was a saddle maker

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.289
Kant never had much money, a fact he
dealt with cheerfully by living very

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.210
modestly. It wasn't until he was in his
fifties that he became a fully salaried

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.660
professor and attained a moderate degree
of prosperity. His family were deeply

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.780
religious and very strict. Later in life

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.649
Kant did not have any conventional
religious beliefs, but he was acutely

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.489
aware of just how much religion had
contributed to his parents' ability to

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.579
cope with all the hardships of their
existence and how useful religion could

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.370
be in fostering social cohesion and
community. Kant was physically very

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.960
slight, frail, and anything but good
looking, yet he was very sociable and some

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.590
of his colleagues used to criticize him
for going to too many parties. When

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.430
eventually he was able to entertain, he
had rules about conversation at his

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.759
table. At the start of a dinner party he
decreed that people should swap stories

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.430
about what had been happening recently,
then there should be a major phase of

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.090
reflective discourse in which those
present attempted to clarify an

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.939
important topic, and finally there should
be a closing period of hilarity so that

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.770
everyone left in a good mood. He died in
1804 in his eightieth year in

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.150
Königsberg, having rarely felt the need
to spend any time outside the city in

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.930
which he was born. Kant was writing at a
highly interesting period in history we

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.360
now know as The Enlightenment. In an
essay called "What is Enlightenment?"

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.640
published in 1784, Kant proposed that
the identifying feature of his age was

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.420
its growing secularism. Intellectually,
Kant welcomed the declining belief in

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.290
Christianity, but in a practical sense he
was also alarmed by it. He was a

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.390
pessimist about human character and
believed that we are by nature intensely

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.430
prone to corruption. It was this
awareness that led him to formulate what

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.120
would be his life's project,

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.710
the desire to replace religious
authority with the authority of reason,

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.120
that is human intelligence. When it came to religion, Kant summed up his views in a

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.490
book entitled "Religion within the bounds of reason alone". Here he argued that

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.150
although historical religions had all
been wrong in the content of what they

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.090
believed, they had latched onto a great
need to promote ethical behavior,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.180
a need which still remained. It was in this context that Kant came up with the idea

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.940
for which he's perhaps still most famous, what he called the "Categorical

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.240
Imperative". This strange sounding term
first appeared in a horrendously named

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.750
work "Groundwork of the metaphysics of
morals". The Categorical Imperative states:

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.390
What did Kant mean by this this? This was only a very

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.890
formal restatement of an idea that's
been around for a long time,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.700
something we meet within all the main
religions:

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Kant was offering
a handy way of testing the morality of

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.860
an action by imagining how it would be
if it were generally practiced and you

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.580
were the victim of it. It might be tempting
to filter a few pads of paper from the

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.660
station recovered at work, it seems like
a small thing. But if everyone did this,

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.330
the cupboard and society at large would
need a lot of guards. Similarly, if you

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.870
have an affair and keep it quiet from
your partner you might feel that's okay

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.990
but the categorical imperative comes
down against this because you would then

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.640
have to embrace the idea that it would
be equally okay for your partner to have

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.240
affairs and not tell you. The categorical
imperative is designed to shift our

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.400
perspective, to get us to see our own
behavior in less immediately personal

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.840
terms and thereby recognize some of its
limitations. Kant went on to argue that

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.000
the core idea of the categorical
imperative could be stated in another way:

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.190
This was intended as a replacement for the
Christian injunction for universal love,

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.780
the command to "love one's neighbor." To
treat a person as an end, for Kant meant

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.800
keeping in view that they had a life of their
own in which they were seeking happiness

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.670
and fulfillment and deserve justice and
fair treatment. The categorical

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.600
imperative, Kant argued, is the voice of
our own rational selves. It's what we

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.400
all truly believe when we're thinking
sensibly, it's the rule our own intelligence

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.470
gives us. Kant extended his thinking
about the categorical imperative into the

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.900
political sphere. He believed that the
central duty of government is to ensure

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.630
liberty, but he sensed there was
something terribly wrong with the

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.250
ordinary definition of freedom or
liberty, it should not be thought of in

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:10.110
libertarian terms as the ability to do
just whatever we want. We are free only

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.080
when we act in accordance with our own
best natures, and we are slaves whenever

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.800
we are under the rule of our own
passions or those of others. As Kant put it,

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:29.740
So freedom isn't an absence of government, a free society isn't one that allows people more and

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.600
more opportunity to do whatever they
happen to fancy. It's one that helps

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.570
everyone become more reasonable. The good
state represents the rational element

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.320
in us all. It rules according to a
universally valid will

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.130
under which everyone can be free, so
government ideally is the externalized,

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.520
institutionalized version of the best
parts of ourselves. It might be a bit

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.520
surprising at first to discover that in
1793, Kant published a major work on

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.190
beauty and art, "The Critique of Judgment." It might seem like a bit of a sideline

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.990
for a thinker otherwise concerned with
politics and ethics, but Kant held that

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.230
his ideas about art and beauty were the cornerstones of his entire philosophy

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.200
As we've been seeing, Kant thought that life involved a constant struggle between our

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.950
better selves and our passions, between
duty and pleasure. Beauty, Kant

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:26.340
especially liked roses, vines, apple trees and birds, delights us in a very special

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.750
and important way. It's a reminder of
and goad to our better selves, unlike

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.410
so much else in our lives, our love of
beauty is in Kant's word "disinterested,"

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.560
it takes us out of our narrow, selfish
concerns but in a charming delightful

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.919
way without being stern or demanding. The
beauty of nature is a continual, quiet,

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.360
and insistent reminder of our common
universal being. A pretty flower is just

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.120
as attractive to the tired farm worker
as to the prince. The graceful flight of

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.800
a swallow is as lovely to a child as to
the most learned

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.030
professor. For Kant, the role of art is to embody the most important ethical ideas

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:09.419
It's a natural extension of philosophy.
Kant held that we needed to have art

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:14.490
continually before us, so as to benefit
from vivid illustrations and memorable

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:20.150
symbols of good behavior and thereby keep the wayward parts of ourselves in check

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:24.950
Kant's books were dense, abstract, and highly intellectual, but in them he

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.690
sketched a very important project that
remains crucial to this day. He wanted to

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.700
understand how the better, more
reasonable parts of our natures could be

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:38.169
strengthened so as to reliably win out
over our inbuilt weaknesses and

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:43.220
selfishness. As Kant saw it, he was engaged
in the task of developing a secular,

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:48.530
rational version of what religions had,
very imperfectly, always attempted to do,

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.670
help us to be good
