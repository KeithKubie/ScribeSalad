1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Videos, boom. And we're live, uh,
ladies and gentlemen, Charlemagne,

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,280
Tha God my man, Andrew Schultz. Yeah. For
being here. Thanks for setting this up.

3
00:00:08,281 --> 00:00:11,700
Thank you for having me sir. My banker.
I've been a fan of yours for a while. You,

4
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:16,290
I think you're the last great radio host
and you will be the last famous radio

5
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:19,950
host cause I think radio is a dying thing.
You're the last great one. You're the,

6
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:24,510
you're the one who made it
famous from radio. Who the
fuck else? Yup. In this era.

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,600
I mean, I, yeah, I think radio
was like one of those, uh,

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,430
one of those rare lanes way.

9
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:33,840
It's really not a lot of people who
prosper in it. You know what I mean?

10
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:36,750
Like especially in the black radio
space. I mean, you've got the,

11
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:41,540
Tom Joyner is Doug banks to Wendy
Williams, you know, so it's,

12
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,110
it's rare in that lane.
But I think,

13
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:45,830
I think you've got people that have
established good careers and radio,

14
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,320
but that's a great question. When
was the last one? He's the last one.

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,500
Famous from rating on last
Samurai hundred percent.

16
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,410
Gotta give Bobby bones Bobby bones.
That's nice. I don't know who that is.

17
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,220
[inaudible] shots fired.
Shots fired. I know.

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,410
Sorry. Bobby knows somebody. Fuck,
I suspect. I'm sure he's great.

19
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,020
He's a nationally syndicated radio host,
but he's on the country states.

20
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:12,900
He just want to marry. You want to
definitely just start, so, okay. Yeah.

21
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,960
Joe was like, I don't give a shit. I
only know Bobby is, you talk about them.

22
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,850
Really? Yeah. Yeah. He's got two national
New York Times bestselling books season.

23
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,650
That's one of those things though.
It's like Comedians, like you know,

24
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:26,310
just talking about a comic that
everybody loves and people are like,

25
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:30,020
I've never heard of them. Like
amongst comics, she began expected,

26
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,170
Bobby has the oldest on the idol now.
Okay. Yeah. And we're around the same age,

27
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:36,930
so I would have to give it, I would have
to put him in that fight. You and Bob,

28
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,810
you're a gracious man. Yeah. In my
opinion. You're the last Samurai

29
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,460
guys like you. I just want to snatch
you up and bring you over to podcasts.

30
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:50,100
Like get the fuck out of there.
Get out of that censored boss man,

31
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:53,550
world interacting with it.
What's he calling you guys?

32
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:56,060
I know you guys have a podcast together.
The brilliant idiots,

33
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,070
you know Podtrac right?
You know that Short, short,

34
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,580
like we just crack Podtrac the breakfast
club. He was number 20 on Potrero. Okay,

35
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,950
so you put that online as well?
Yeah, we put it out of the pocket.

36
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:06,630
That's a good cause. I feel like
we're radio. That's what it is.

37
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:08,460
Like people still listening
to terrestrial radio,

38
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,730
but you have to go where the people are,
so you have to have the podcast,

39
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,470
you have to have the youtube following.

40
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:15,520
Like you can't wait for people
just to come to radio. Everything.

41
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,260
I wish you could swear though. So that's
the problem they do. That's the thing.

42
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:23,430
He so they release all the interviews
they do on breakfast club and those things

43
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:27,750
explode on youtube. They have all the
curse I just found out about, exactly.

44
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:32,550
That's where most people
globally with watch and listen.
I mean, yeah, right. Yeah.

45
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:34,110
That's what separates this radio,

46
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:37,500
this era of radio from other arrows or
radio like I was starting didn't have

47
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,160
youtube. You know what I'm
saying? If I was 30 I had youtube,

48
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,780
wouldn't be no question.
He'd still be the motherfucking guy.

49
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,140
Even though he is the guy.
Right.

50
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,300
But he's still be like Super Super Guy in
this era. Right. He's in that pay wall,

51
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:51,780
which is very strange to a
serious paywall. That's the
strangest paywalls. Yeah.

52
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,470
Yeah. He took the check and then you
get financial independence. Mac check.

53
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,440
Let's be realistic. He was
already financially independent.
So why do you do it?

54
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,710
You just the numbers that
are thrown at him. Yeah.

55
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:04,450
That was a different 300 million.
Right?

56
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,200
Well I think that was just
initially you'd have to do,

57
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,080
I think he makes like 100 million
every year or something crazy.

58
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,120
300 was flat and then another hundred
[inaudible] like your kids be in a

59
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:18,520
straight and like your great, great, great
grandkids being a straight right. Yeah.

60
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:21,400
But Sears stock and serious as
me is like blockbuster stock.

61
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:28,240
Hang on to that
messed up match.

62
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,630
Something like that.
Yeah.

63
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,140
I remember when Netflix used to have those
DVDs that you would get like in front

64
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:39,490
of the fucking [inaudible]. You
have to send them back. He was like,

65
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,900
I'm not sending this back now. I was
so funny. I was home this weekend.

66
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,880
I was in Moncks corner,
South Carolina,

67
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,950
and like there was a black panther DVD
from the library in my mom's house.

68
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:52,750
I'm like, what? The Fun Library,

69
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,760
Black Panthers in the original Black
Panthers or oh, I was like, Yo,

70
00:03:57,761 --> 00:03:59,710
she was true from back in the day.

71
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,140
That's an original Black Panther.

72
00:04:03,141 --> 00:04:06,430
Like who got the Black Panther DVD that
they checked out from the library and

73
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:08,940
have not bought it back yet? You didn't
bring it back to the library yet.

74
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,960
Now you don't have to like
what are they willing to do?

75
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:15,490
Why you the Black Panther from the
library because you wanted it and it was

76
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:16,720
there and you were at the library.

77
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:20,260
I'm still trying to understand why you
call it library. What is it? Library?

78
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,910
I don't fucking know. I mean, graduated
guide. It's like a library. Yeah.

79
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,440
It's one of those words, you
know, don't bail him out.

80
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,510
[inaudible] blackberry. Especially
talk variable in Texas to say special,

81
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,841
but everyone,

82
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:39,000
even like George Bush when
he was president would say
x specially extensionally

83
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,420
yeah.
Yeah.

84
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:43,180
I think a lot of it has to do with
region cause I still say straight street

85
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:46,120
strong.
Yeah.

86
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,280
That's or nothing. Screech, screech, crawl

87
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,410
scrumptious say pacifically Oh,

88
00:04:56,411 --> 00:05:00,820
specifically specifically instead of
specifically cause everybody knows then

89
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:05,530
it's fun. That's the point
of view. It's a little Dick.

90
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,140
It's like, um, dialects.

91
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,680
Like my grandparents were from Sicily
and they would talk and dialects and even

92
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:14,320
people that knew Italian wouldn't
know what the fuck they were saying.

93
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:19,390
Like just like people that knew pure
Italian at some weird like pig Latin type

94
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:21,550
shit. You know. I mean
my mom's Scottish, like,

95
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:23,410
have you listened to a
real Scottish people talk,

96
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,330
you don't understand what the fuck
they're talking about, that accent.

97
00:05:26,331 --> 00:05:30,610
So the way they rolled their words
together and then they get them drunk.

98
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:35,430
Well it's impossible. Where you from
Joe? I was born in New Jersey and uh,

99
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,770
I grew up mostly in Boston,
but most really all over the country.

100
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,680
Stubborn sensibilities.
Like before we started the podcast,

101
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:43,360
she was talking about all the hunting,
hunting.

102
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,050
I didn't get into that until 2012 wow.
Why?

103
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,420
Cause I was thinking about
being a vegetarian. I was like,

104
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,530
I was watching these animal rights
videos, Peta videos, and I was like,

105
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:56,980
I don't want to participate.
And it's factory farming
shit. It just, it's fucked.

106
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,003
You Watch these

107
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,760
pigs slammed into these cages together
and cows and chickens. I was like,

108
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,210
this is inhumane. It's, it's
insane. Decided to go on a thought,

109
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:07,850
killing them yourself. I decided one
of two things. Either I was gonna,

110
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,130
I was gonna try hunting and either I was
going to become a vegetarian or I was

111
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,470
going to become a hunter and so I became
a hunter. I did it. I killed a deer.

112
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,200
I ate it. I was like, this is perfect.
I love this call. I'm trying to fix.

113
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:18,920
Make sense?

114
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,750
I'm trying to forget the thought process
when you saw that it was inhumane for

115
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:27,410
these animals would be dying. No, no, not
you want to kill him. Factory farming.

116
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,190
Factory farming. And not that
they're, look, every animal dies.

117
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,060
They don't live forever and become angels.
They live in the wild. When you hunt,

118
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:39,800
you dip your feet into the wild. You
go out there and you, you fair chase,

119
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:44,300
you'll find them. You track them, you stay
down wind, you get in a good position,

120
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:48,210
you kill them and then you eat them
and it's a different animal when you're

121
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,730
eating that. Like if I eat an elk steak,
I know it's good that it's delicious.

122
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,200
I know that I was there.
Can I see a picture of this?

123
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,280
I'm still trying to imagine what it is
because I understand dear and understand

124
00:06:59,310 --> 00:06:59,860
Moose.

125
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,860
A giant deer is that those antlers
pipes froze antlers on like an 800 pound

126
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:09,440
animal. How tall is it? It's huge. They're
big. Like six feet. Oh, taller. Yeah.

127
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,210
Yeah. Elk can mushroom
training. The Moose is crazy.

128
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,650
I saw the first time I saw him moose,

129
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:18,830
it was like that scene in Jurassic Park
with Jeff Goldbloom looks out the jeep

130
00:07:18,831 --> 00:07:22,760
and sees the dinosaur. It's like you
can't believe how big a MOU says.

131
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,400
I don't think I've seen a moose in prison.
Double and elk.

132
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,160
The double the size of a note. Yeah.
Yeah. We need to go hunting, man.

133
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,410
You want to go? I'm being dead
serious to take you hunting,

134
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:34,490
camping and hunting where it's one or
the other. But you could do both. Okay.

135
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:39,170
Well you could camp or you could hunt
rather and then stay in a nice lodge.

136
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,123
That's the move.

137
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,330
But also kind of want to do like the
full outdoor cause sometimes I'll watch

138
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:47,080
those shows on like nat geo or
something like that and it's,

139
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,550
they're just living off the land and they
got to like make a hunt or make a year,

140
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,710
you know, make it out of snow. Yeah,
don't do that. Don't do that. No,

141
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,800
but what for what for like two days.
Like a cool, you want what you want.

142
00:07:57,801 --> 00:08:02,360
It's like a real tent with a real sleeping
bags and stay warm and you're healthy

143
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:06,770
and you're not worried about fucking
freezing to death or anything weird like

144
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:07,300
that.

145
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,790
And make sure you have water filters
so you can drink out of a stream if you

146
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:14,000
really want to do that.
Yeah. I want to try.

147
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:16,520
You should try hunting in New
York like nobody's ever done that.

148
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,970
Like hunter rats.
I'm saying.

149
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,980
I'm saying think about all
them big ass rats in New York.

150
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,260
Like nobody's ever done that.
I'm not going to lie.

151
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:26,330
He'll probably get a lot of
attention for this. Back in the day,

152
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:29,270
you could go to 120 fifth street and
like Spanish Harlem and you could buy

153
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:30,104
pigeons.

154
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,130
People were like catching pigeons and
they were selling them and trying to front

155
00:08:34,131 --> 00:08:36,610
like they were exotic pigeons.
Shit, I swear to God. No.

156
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,470
Pigeons were brought over here for food.
That's what squad is.

157
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,431
That's what the fuck is.

158
00:08:40,431 --> 00:08:45,170
Squad squad is like of like a Bougie
restaurant item and it's actually young

159
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:49,640
pigeons. Really? Yeah. That's
what, that's what squat is. Yeah.

160
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,080
I didn't know that.
All pigeons,

161
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:54,770
all pigeons you see in the United States
or all brought in from somewhere else

162
00:08:54,771 --> 00:08:56,360
for food and then they released

163
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,280
it become feral.
They like the wild hogs of the bird world.

164
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,050
What a young rats called that are
used for food. It's a good question.

165
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,160
Who uses young rants for food? I
don't know. Yeah, but there's a,

166
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:07,380
there's a cousin that rats documentary.

167
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,780
What does this is just the dog
that hunt rats in New York, right?

168
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,110
I don't believe that shit.
What do you mean you don't believe it?

169
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:17,420
That they're really guys sending their
dogs out to go get rats OCR paper.

170
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,120
Because that's halls. I mean,
they're not going to fix it.

171
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,840
There's no way to fix it. But you like
Jack Russell terriers, they fuck rats up.

172
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:26,220
They're designed to fuck routes up,

173
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,970
but it's gotta be people who live up
north in New York who have the same desire

174
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:33,330
to hunt. They just, they just go down
south. So why did I go here? Right.

175
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,410
They hunt deer in New York
has a lot of deer. Jersey,
jersey, or got allowed. Yeah.

176
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:37,830
I live,

177
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,950
I live in Jersey and that's one of the
reasons I loved yard because I'm from

178
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:41,431
South Carolina,

179
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:45,480
so I'm used to seeing deers and possums
and just different types of wildlife

180
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:48,270
running through the streets. I, that's
why I like living in Jersey. Yeah.

181
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:49,730
The Jersey is an unusual play.

182
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,040
Jersey has more black bears per capita
than any state in the United States.

183
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,920
I don't know if that's a
fact, but I believe you cause
I've seen it myself. Yeah,

184
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,070
they're everywhere. You seen bears
on your property? Not on my property,

185
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:02,280
but when I used to uh,
stay with my aunt in the Poconos,

186
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,640
the bears used to come in her backyard
cause there was like a scream in the

187
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:08,400
backyard and they would like come in
and just grab fish out of the screen.

188
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,330
They kill the kid.

189
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,150
One bear killed a kid a couple
years ago from one of the colleges.

190
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,490
What colleges or was it
the one near New Brunswick?

191
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,320
What was it you didn't see in the video?
In Jersey at a walking bed bed.

192
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,320
I would walk on two feet through people's
back yards. They had a bad friend.

193
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,430
Paul was so hell yeah.
Shit happen there.

194
00:10:25,431 --> 00:10:29,790
It is looking at the video, the
bear walking around. Oh yeah,

195
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:33,730
that's a foot. You know who
believes in bigfoot? Yeah.

196
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,930
You have a believer in the studio
right now who believes in bigfoot.

197
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,970
Do you really? Yeah,
absolutely. 100% believes it,

198
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,420
but you know why I believe in bigfoot?
Because it shit like mousses.

199
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,513
You know what I'm saying?

200
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,070
[inaudible]
you see something?

201
00:10:52,071 --> 00:10:54,790
If you see a fucking
a species like a moon,

202
00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:00,180
God believe. Look at this shit.
Yeah. At some point in life,

203
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:02,700
somebody was trying to explain that
to somebody else. He's like, man,

204
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:05,550
get the fuck Outta here right now.
When he's trying to explain it to me,

205
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,930
we look at the size of that. God Damn,
that's insane. Was the legs work?

206
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,220
They'll fuck you up to.
There's a,

207
00:11:11,221 --> 00:11:15,030
those are the rare deer species that
will fucking stuck to death. Yeah.

208
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:17,520
They used to dealing with wolves.
If they think you're a threat,

209
00:11:17,521 --> 00:11:19,440
they just run up on you
and stomp you to death.

210
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,840
Why don't you believe in bigfoot that?
Well,

211
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,420
I actually did a television show
where I went hunting for them.

212
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,960
You going to do it? I'll
find it. No, no, no. I was,

213
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,920
I did a show called Joe Rogan questions.
Everything.

214
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:32,640
We spent a whole week in the
Pacific northwest talking
to big foot hunters. Yeah.

215
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,590
We camped out there.

216
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,980
Me and Duncan Trussell went
and interviewed scientists
and interviewed all these

217
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:39,720
different archeologists,

218
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,410
all these different people that didn't
believe and didn't believe it wasn't real

219
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:47,160
animal. At one point in time. I don't
think it exists now. I think it existed.

220
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:50,100
It's just a primate in the fucking woods.
Yeah. Okay. You don't think it exists?

221
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,260
You believe that exists now?
I did up to a certain point,

222
00:11:53,261 --> 00:11:54,280
but I was like in this era

223
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,130
with all the cameras and everything else,
somebody would have caught one. Okay,

224
00:11:57,131 --> 00:12:01,540
that's good. Yeah. I was a little worried.
No, I don't. I don't believe in it now.

225
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,780
I believe it existed at some point,
but I don't believe it exists.

226
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:05,730
Let me tell you something.

227
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,300
Charlemagne has this amazing
power to manifest shit. Okay,

228
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,320
so I see how it could lend itself.

229
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,440
When you believe something so much,
it becomes real. Right? Right.

230
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,410
I could see how it manifests
itself into things like big foot,

231
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,400
like you believe in things.
I mean Sasquatches wasn't,

232
00:12:23,401 --> 00:12:27,150
it's not a far fetched idea. It's
literally just a primate in the woods.

233
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm just saying when you were young and
you believe that you were a teen wolf,

234
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,000
yeah.

235
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,220
That was like, no, no, no.

236
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,630
I did third grade.

237
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,160
He believed that his ears actually
changed shape. No, they did.

238
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:46,161
I was sitting at the list and I will sit
at the lunch table telling everybody I

239
00:12:46,801 --> 00:12:51,420
was going to turn into this Werewolf at
lunchtime and I was saying this for like

240
00:12:51,421 --> 00:12:54,690
a week straight and we was all sitting
at the table and I was just sitting there

241
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,480
like this going to happen.
It's happening.

242
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:02,400
And my ears actually went from round
to points into like two seconds.

243
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:07,050
And when all the kids at the table
saw it in, jumped up and ran.

244
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,290
So they fucked up my concentration. So if
I hadn't kept that concentration going,

245
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,610
I probably would've turned full fledge
where within that moment and maybe

246
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,920
levitated possibly. I've done that
before. Really? Oh yeah. I used to,

247
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,850
I grew up Jehovah witness.

248
00:13:17,851 --> 00:13:20,820
So I used to leave the kingdom hall and
I would walk outside of the kingdom hall

249
00:13:20,821 --> 00:13:24,310
and I would like jump in the air and
be looking down at the kingdom hall.

250
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:26,190
And not stay up there for awhile
and then I would come down.

251
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,620
But here's the thing, he's not,
he's not doing bits. Right.

252
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,990
He really believes this shit. I'm just
telling you what happened in my life.

253
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,990
If you believe what you believe it,
if you don't,

254
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:38,400
you don't memories a strange thing.

255
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,630
Ah, you think it's one of those
like you recreate the past

256
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,940
well,
memories of strange thing.

257
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:47,170
Like you couldn't believe something and
know something to be true when it didn't

258
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:51,730
actually happen. Mm. You can absolutely
do that. I mean there's what you have.

259
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,190
People have memories in their
head that never happened.

260
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,100
You have memories that people
positioned in your head.

261
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,220
They proven that you can
talk someone into a memory.

262
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,600
You can change someone's memory.

263
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,210
That's why it's particularly
dangerous for kids when you know,

264
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:07,480
there's a whole case where they were
talking kids into saying that their

265
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:10,210
teachers molested them and all these
people like lost their careers,

266
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:14,110
lost their lives, turned out it was all
100% made up. But those kids believed in,

267
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,780
they believed when they were telling
them that they were molested,

268
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:17,823
they believed it.

269
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,270
Yeah.
That's gone into it.

270
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,300
What is that called when you give
that information to the police?

271
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:25,870
What is it called when they interrogate
you? Interrogations can be bull shoe.

272
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,910
Yeah, the course you, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

273
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,940
The article I was reading the other day
about why people make false confessions,

274
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,630
why did they just get talked into
believing that they actually,

275
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,610
you scared the devil.
If you a kid,

276
00:14:35,611 --> 00:14:38,970
especially a young kid from the hood and
you like 1516 years old and the police

277
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,200
like, yeah, you went to jail for 20 years.

278
00:14:40,201 --> 00:14:42,660
If you don't tell us what we need to know,
you don't fucking know no better.

279
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:43,560
They put

280
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,020
you under duress.
They put you in a room,

281
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,850
they sit you across from a position of
authority and this person questions you.

282
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,980
You start, you start, you start saying

283
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,290
things that aren't true. You've seen
beyond scared straight. They tell you,

284
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,030
you gonna get 20 years and get bunched.
Fuck foot.

285
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:01,090
15 of them show the first five 15 they
let they let you kind of settle in for

286
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:01,910
the first

287
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,900
fine. Yeah. You know what? Let's
let that bucket nice and tight.

288
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:11,090
But five year birthday
you might like some elk,

289
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,160
you might go listen,
you might go in under age,

290
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:18,161
you know there's these criminals got moral
[inaudible] a few but not too come on

291
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,690
up monsters.

292
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,370
When I was young,
I used to have a red tractor trailer.

293
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:27,870
It was a red plastic trailer with a
farmer on top of it and like of those hard

294
00:15:27,871 --> 00:15:28,704
plastic trailers.

295
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,060
Now farmer used to get off that trailer
in fuck with me and I took it in the

296
00:15:33,061 --> 00:15:37,110
yard one day, put kerosene on it
and set it on fire. And in my mind,

297
00:15:37,111 --> 00:15:40,530
I remember hearing that
farm farmers scream,

298
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,010
my mom even tell you the story of how
I used to always talk about how this

299
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,050
fucking farmer used to come off
of his tractor and fucking me.

300
00:15:46,051 --> 00:15:51,051
And she saw me set it on
fire and I thought I was
crazy until years later I met

301
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,910
Tiffany Haddish and she said
she had experiences with her.

302
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:57,900
Teddy bears used to come to life and
fuck with her. So I'm just saying,

303
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,180
I'm just saying shit happens.
Is All this happening?

304
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,330
I haven't heard this started happening
at night. When did it happen? Ah,

305
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,690
I don't remember.
I can't remember.

306
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:10,200
I don't remember like the details of
when it was at night or during the day.

307
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,930
That's why these things are trying
to figure out with Ufo abductions,

308
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,140
you know almost all those
UFO abductions happened.

309
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,230
My people are sleeping and they think
what's happening is your brain is

310
00:16:19,231 --> 00:16:22,590
releasing and dodginess
psychedelic chemicals and
it's forcing you to have these

311
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:25,950
hallucinations and that you really
do believe you're taking the board,

312
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,530
the CFOs and gone away. But if someone
is watching you with the camera,

313
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,380
nothing actually happens.
Questions, people swear by it.

314
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:36,530
Have you ever had one of those dreams
where it feels as if someone's holding you

315
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:38,980
down to the Hag Hag riding you?

316
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,590
I mean that's a term they really
call it a sleep paralysis,

317
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,410
but growing up in South Carolina they
would say to hag was riding you. Okay,

318
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,770
what do we have to take salt is
that you would easily put us,

319
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:52,470
you need to put a straw broom at your
door or you would take salt and sprinkle

320
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:54,300
salt at your door. Because when
the Haggins, there's your room,

321
00:16:54,301 --> 00:16:55,890
you got to pick up every criminal assault,

322
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,590
so by the time he picks up
every kernel of thought,

323
00:16:57,591 --> 00:17:02,591
it's fucking date I ag was like these
little old women that they say would come

324
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:06,900
and ride people in the middle of the
night. I think I've seen them before,

325
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,020
but it's really looks like just the
shadowy figure and it's the same feeling.

326
00:17:10,021 --> 00:17:14,220
You get that feeling like your body is
frozen. They can't, your eyes are open,

327
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:18,370
but you feel like you're talking,
but nobody here. That's, that's it.

328
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,180
They said that's the Hag, right?
What did they say that is like what?

329
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,060
The scientists,

330
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,020
the blood's not flowing in your body
looks like when you're sitting on the

331
00:17:25,021 --> 00:17:27,510
toilet too long and your
fucking leg legs go. Yeah. Yeah.

332
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,900
I think it's a psychological thing.
[inaudible] your,

333
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,130
your brain is just not
sending signals to your body,

334
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:36,600
but you want to move and you just
don't move, but I can't knock.

335
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:40,790
That shit is frightening.
I had that before and I've
had that before and I had a,

336
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,800
when I woke up it was just,
you seen the movie signs? Yeah.

337
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,620
So it was this creature that looked
like he was from the movie signs,

338
00:17:46,621 --> 00:17:49,620
but it was purple and black and it
was standing over me and I couldn't

339
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,590
move. And so I was making noise,
just trying to get it to go away.

340
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:54,510
And as the sun came up,
it just faded away.

341
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,540
Now that I don't know if
it was a dream or an actual

342
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,620
visit from extra extraterrestrial,

343
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:04,350
it could be the thing about extra
terrestrials. Well, you know,

344
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:06,240
I believe in him.
Will you believe in everything?

345
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,400
The reality than toys that can harass
you as a child? There's no evidence.

346
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,830
But the numbers of humans,

347
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,210
I mean the numbers of planets rather
that could support humans are there.

348
00:18:17,211 --> 00:18:20,820
They're pretty well just
what we've documented so
far, it's pretty interesting.

349
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,390
Just what they know about the thousands
of plants to discover this hundreds it

350
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:25,920
could possibly support human life.

351
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,580
And then there's hundreds
of billions of galaxies.

352
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,140
So the idea that we're the only one,

353
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:35,330
not only that Neil degrasse
Tyson's explaining this to
me is this is a mind fuck

354
00:18:35,331 --> 00:18:40,331
and a half that the universe is so big
that not only is there another you out

355
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:46,851
there that has done everything exactly
as you've done to every pause like that.

356
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:52,800
Pause every pause down to the
second. An infinite number, right?

357
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,180
Yeah. Yeah. You're talking
about, is it called the, uh,

358
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,850
infinite in an infinite universes,
there's this exact conversation happens.

359
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:00,230
My name look,

360
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,150
people look exactly like that because
infinity implies that that can be a

361
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:04,620
million variations.

362
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,710
There's one where you get up right now
and you have to take a piss right out of

363
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:09,630
the room or Charlemagne today.
There you are. Here I'm there.

364
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,300
There's one would you get up and you're
mad that we don't believe you that you

365
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:15,480
saw big foot or something. You
know, that kind of shit. Yeah. This,

366
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,650
the idea that when you think of
infinity, right, we think about it.

367
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:23,760
It's being really big. It's not, it's
impossible to put in your head. Yeah.

368
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,340
The infinite,
infinite universes,

369
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,340
like the size of the universe
is 14 billion light years apart.

370
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,290
Infinite numbers of those.
Not only that,

371
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,890
they think that inside every galaxy
is a supermassive black hole.

372
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,870
And inside that black hole,

373
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:41,820
maybe another universe with hundreds of
billions of galaxies with hundreds of

374
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,000
billions of black holes inside each
one of those hundreds of billions of

375
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:47,850
galaxies, hundreds of billions of
black holes, that it's fractal.

376
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,460
And that it's impossible
for you to even conceive.

377
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,660
Yeah. I think it's very, so you're
saying just based on the numbers,

378
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,280
there has to be something. The
question is, as you gotta be,

379
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,620
to think that would have only life in
his book was only life in the universe.

380
00:20:00,621 --> 00:20:04,580
I'm just saying like, hmm, whether
or not it's reached us. Well, yeah,

381
00:20:04,581 --> 00:20:06,530
I don't think it's reached us.
And if it has reached us,

382
00:20:06,531 --> 00:20:09,000
it's like they have to find
a way to bend time. Right?

383
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,660
Because time is the biggest issue.
I'm gonna tell you what the problem,

384
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,710
like where earthlings, right? Yeah. And if
you look at how diverse the earth he is,

385
00:20:15,711 --> 00:20:17,630
like there's different
species of shit in the woods,

386
00:20:17,631 --> 00:20:18,940
different pieces of shit in the water,

387
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:21,020
different species that shouldn't
have jungle, different species.

388
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:23,360
That shit in the sky.
Why wouldn't the earth be,

389
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,910
I mean the university just as diverse
and is where assuming shortage,

390
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,500
we're assuming we're the smartest
life form in the universe. No, no, no.

391
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:35,180
I'm not at all. And sure it is all
I'm saying is life has an end, right?

392
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:39,710
What is the oldest species on the earth
right now with the turtles lived like

393
00:20:39,711 --> 00:20:42,700
200 or some shit like that.
What pool is Morgan Freeman?

394
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,560
The doors on the Goddamn Room. So
let's say it's 200 300 years, right?

395
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,360
Let's say that's the Max.
Now we have 300 years to travel,

396
00:20:52,361 --> 00:20:55,660
millions of light years away to get to
another galaxy to see other planets,

397
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:58,870
to see if they have some shit
and they have the same for us.

398
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,220
So let's say there is another species,
did somehow found a way to take your,

399
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:08,221
the consciousness that they have and
put it in a robot that can then last for

400
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,550
thousands of years, then they would
have the opportunity to come here.

401
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:17,350
But we're limited by time. Right. You
will die before you get somewhere.

402
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:19,110
Like you can go to Mars,
we can't come back.

403
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,700
I think we're basing that
off our intelligence.

404
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:25,030
There might be a species in this universe
that can fly to earth the way we fly

405
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:26,700
to la. But that's what I'm
saying. They would have done

406
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,570
Ben time. Not necessarily what they
could do is fold time or full time,

407
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,321
whatever.
You know what I mean?

408
00:21:31,321 --> 00:21:35,550
Create that wormhole fact where you're
going where instead of it's not linear,

409
00:21:35,551 --> 00:21:37,350
it's whatever.
Send somebody

410
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:41,370
time like it was in um, event horizon.
They talked about how they did that.

411
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,030
Remember that movie?

412
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,520
Yeah. But, and there was another
one to add. Matthew mcconaughey.

413
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,500
Interstellar. Interstellar. Yeah.
Where they get into like space time,

414
00:21:49,501 --> 00:21:52,500
space time is really interesting,
right? It's like the faster you go,

415
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,800
the less you age. Right? Like,

416
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:58,050
so somebody on a plane flying over us
into someone here on the earth, right?

417
00:21:58,051 --> 00:22:01,530
So someone's flying around the earth
on a plane versus us sitting on earth,

418
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,810
they will age fractionally less,
right.

419
00:22:03,811 --> 00:22:07,770
So if you just increase their
speed and decrease hours, uh,

420
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,610
when that or keep ours at the
same, they will, let's say not yet

421
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,700
at all compared to us aging like
30 years even crazier. Brian Cox,

422
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,080
I went to see his cosmos
exhibit and that's the fastest,

423
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,570
oh is a physicist from cern,

424
00:22:21,571 --> 00:22:26,100
from the large Hadron collider is a bunch
of differentiate podcasts and shows.

425
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:29,550
He said that if you were
born and right next to you,

426
00:22:29,551 --> 00:22:33,870
like your mother and you both put on a
watch at the moment you were born and

427
00:22:33,871 --> 00:22:37,740
then you checked that watch 30 years
later, if you have a perfect watch,

428
00:22:37,741 --> 00:22:38,760
it was never out of time.

429
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,420
Your watch would have a different time
than her watch because you have gone

430
00:22:42,421 --> 00:22:47,421
through time differently than she has
fracture fractionally because the amount

431
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:52,560
of speed, how fast you
travel it. Ew, ew, ew.

432
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,830
Experienced time in a different way.
The Path you take in life,

433
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,770
the different terrain you
travel over the earth,

434
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,370
all those factors play in
to how much time has passed.

435
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,730
Let's say you're locked on the top of
a mountain and she lives at the bottom,

436
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:09,210
you're actually traveling
at a faster rate, right?

437
00:23:09,211 --> 00:23:13,650
Because it's no different than like let's
say there's a ball on a tether, right?

438
00:23:13,651 --> 00:23:16,230
And you're just swinging it
around in a circle, right?

439
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,800
The ball at the end is actually going
faster than your hand in the middle of

440
00:23:19,801 --> 00:23:22,500
swinging around. Gotcha. Right?
So since you're going fast,

441
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:25,950
you're actually aging slower and we're
talking about fractions of seconds. Yeah.

442
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,260
But over the course of time,

443
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:31,140
it proves that everyone experiences
time and a slightly different rate,

444
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,610
which proves Einstein's theory that
if you have to travel very fast in a

445
00:23:35,611 --> 00:23:37,140
spaceship and then come back,

446
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,800
you would look at your brother who was
your age and now he's a hundred years old

447
00:23:40,801 --> 00:23:44,880
and you're only at 30 so I think I figured
it out how we can time travel time,

448
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,090
but I think I figured out,
all right,

449
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:49,360
so we're trying to create, okay.
And again, I don't know shit,

450
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:52,180
but this is just me like you know
pontificated logic. This is brilliant.

451
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,380
Lydia chip right here.
Okay,

452
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:56,470
so we have to do is go faster than the
speed of light in order to time travel.

453
00:23:56,471 --> 00:23:57,430
I don't know how to do that just yet,

454
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:02,350
but what I think we can do is we're trying
to use like rockets to propel us at a

455
00:24:02,351 --> 00:24:05,380
certain mile per hour to get
close to the speed of light.

456
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,230
Fuck the fuck the rockets.

457
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,620
Why don't we use light as
wind and create a sale?

458
00:24:11,621 --> 00:24:16,621
That harness light and that sale will
naturally take us the same speed or as

459
00:24:17,531 --> 00:24:20,200
close as we possibly could
get to the speed of light.

460
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,440
He did it in a movie called Sunshine.
I'm a fucking genius.

461
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:27,950
You somebody shipper just
sunshine and didn't tell anyone

462
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,660
I'm shine. How could you see that movie?
I don't even know where the milk is.

463
00:24:33,661 --> 00:24:38,460
Science fiction come on the
show. It's fiction movie.

464
00:24:38,461 --> 00:24:39,080
I'm talking about

465
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,060
Bob Lasar tonight.
That was the guy I was telling you.

466
00:24:41,061 --> 00:24:43,730
I'm wanting to bring you to dinner.
I'm going to as well if you want to gum.

467
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,620
He's the guy who worked at area 51 and uh,

468
00:24:46,621 --> 00:24:49,500
I mean I didn't even know if he's
talking about the test tomorrow. Yeah,

469
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,400
I'm going to bring it
up. Oh, area 51 is real,

470
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:56,950
but this guy literally worked on what
he says or alien spacecraft. Spacecraft.

471
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:00,470
That sale on sunshine could be
the next big thing is Caitlyn Bro,

472
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:04,640
you should work for now and this is
public school education gets you a job at

473
00:25:04,641 --> 00:25:07,310
Trump space for us to do any of the math.

474
00:25:07,311 --> 00:25:09,890
I just want to throw the ideas
out there and I think I got it.

475
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:14,840
This is a legit space for shirt
from Trump's from Trump tower.

476
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:18,950
Tim Dillard bought me this. Yo, shout
out to Tim. I love Tim. This is real.

477
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:21,740
This is what the real fucking
space for us. This is the logo.

478
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:29,220
I didn't know
how I missed that one cartoon of

479
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,280
the wheels space

480
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,910
for us.
This fucking goofy shit.

481
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,520
[inaudible] you had a friend who
works on alien spacecraft. Oh,

482
00:25:36,521 --> 00:25:39,850
I don't know [inaudible]
on the podcast tomorrow.

483
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,810
He worked at area 51 is he allowed to
talk about that shit when I'll get you is

484
00:25:43,811 --> 00:25:45,900
because he's been talking
about it for decades. Yeah.

485
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,660
And they've tried to discredit him.
There's a very controversial,

486
00:25:49,661 --> 00:25:52,510
a lot of people think he's full of shit,
but the more,

487
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,840
there's a recent documentary by Jeremy
Korbel and the more you look at the

488
00:25:55,841 --> 00:25:57,520
documentary,
he knows too many things.

489
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:02,230
He knows too many things that that prove
that he absolutely worked at area 51 he

490
00:26:02,231 --> 00:26:07,090
got arrested for bringing people to a
lookout peak to look over where the area

491
00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:10,540
where they would launch these spaceships
and he's got video of these things

492
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:11,321
flying through the air,

493
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:15,250
doing all these maneuvers that no
conventional spacecraft could do in 1980

494
00:26:15,251 --> 00:26:18,000
whatever the fuck it was where you got
arrested. They must have some type of uh,

495
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:22,350
like, like, like a Nda with extra
terrestrials or they don't talk about,

496
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,890
I feel like the US government,
it just,

497
00:26:23,891 --> 00:26:28,210
governments in general throughout the
world have some type of NDA will kill you.

498
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,160
I don't know. Probably is the same one
Leonardo Dicaprio uses on his girlfriends.

499
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:37,010
He's got the greatest NBA history now.
Holy Shit.

500
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:40,750
I mean, Shit. No one
gives a fuck about NDA.

501
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,010
So we had pay people and they don't care.
They'll out and talk about it

502
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,400
later. We had Lisa Ann on
a, on a podcast, right?

503
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,070
I just parked the porn star
go playground too. Right.

504
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:55,200
And Lisa and came on and she was talking
about Ndas and how stupid women are for

505
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:58,110
a obeying them. And I was like, what
are you talking about? And she's like,

506
00:26:58,111 --> 00:27:02,070
what are they have to lose? They don't
have any money. Exactly. So she's like,

507
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,290
you have a bunch of fucking
heels in your apartment.

508
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:06,630
You think that Leonardo Dicaprio
is going to take your heels.

509
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,930
You can break any fucking India.
But for whatever reason he gets scared.

510
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:12,840
You pay a woman to half a million dollars.
Tell her to keep her mouth closed.

511
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,280
She breaks the NDA. An NDA says she
has to pay you back when you exactly.

512
00:27:17,281 --> 00:27:20,400
You mean we don't have money forever.
One money he wrote one is bill O'Reilly.

513
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:24,690
He had to pay a lady $32 million.
There's no pussy worth that.

514
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,970
I need to see what she looks like.
Can we look at this woman?

515
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:31,830
I need to see no bail is into some wild,
wild shit.

516
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,370
Can we? There's no picture
of this woman. I don't know.

517
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,670
I need to see $32 million policy on blast,
but I love to,

518
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,350
I would love to see what she looks
like 32 million. He agreed to it.

519
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:47,460
He agreed to it.
He must've did something.

520
00:27:47,461 --> 00:27:52,461
He didn't want nobody to be even
remotely bills getting packed 100% yet.

521
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:57,390
It's not even about what actually happened
is about what the person said they

522
00:27:57,391 --> 00:28:01,160
did the you that can ruin your reputation.
She's texting me in 2019 Scott Pick's,

523
00:28:01,161 --> 00:28:05,790
she's got picked, she's got
videos. Something's going to
meals, ask guaranteed DNA.

524
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,790
She's got his shit under her thumbnail,
I guarantee.

525
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:12,240
And then a guy like bill has to keep
a certain, like, I guess you know,

526
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,770
standard about himself,
right?

527
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:17,660
You have to look at him a certain way in
order to listen to what he's saying and

528
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,510
what to take his, his information, you
know, correctly, I guess. Seriously. Yeah.

529
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:26,490
Yeah. So he could lose all
that equity in his audience.

530
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,660
He's out there doing wild shit. He
actually didn't tell him he's gone anyway.

531
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:34,330
Is it over from bill while he's not
on Fox News anymore, he's podcasts.

532
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:39,030
He was the number one guy and they
were like not worth it. Yeah man.

533
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,830
Y'All be talking about cancer culture.
Bell really got canceled.

534
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:52,310
Real came over in a big way and I think
he does do some type of broadcast and

535
00:28:52,311 --> 00:28:54,360
now,
but nobody cares.

536
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:58,590
Well he let out a book and the book was
Number One New York time best sellers.

537
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:03,290
Fox history books. Yes. You know, like,
I don't even think he ran into him.

538
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,180
I think he just puts his name on it.
I wonder about a guy like bill though,

539
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,360
because think about it like
you started your own platform.

540
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,790
You know what I'm saying?
And people really care about your voice.

541
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:16,620
Did people ever really care about bill's
voice? The thing, check it. Right.

542
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:20,430
So it's like sometimes you
become a mouthpiece for a
network or foreign ideology

543
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:22,500
they believe in and
this is the difference.

544
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:25,470
This is how you find out if people
really fuck with you the second you leave

545
00:29:25,471 --> 00:29:25,980
that network.

546
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,800
It's like when people leave ESPN and you
never hear about them again. It's like,

547
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,630
Oh,
you thought you were bigger than ESPN.

548
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,670
You thought you were
bigger than the sports.

549
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:37,000
They just want you to say
strike ball. That's it. Yeah,

550
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:42,020
so I think we learned that bill really
didn't have all that cachet that we

551
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:45,190
thought we hit. Yeah. That's why
I like ESPN is a good analogy.

552
00:29:45,191 --> 00:29:47,410
That's why you got to get people
like skip Bayless props. Yeah.

553
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,040
You got to get your mail hill prop so
they can go other places and people still

554
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:54,220
care about what they have to say.
Even if it's just in tweets. Right.

555
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,410
I don't even know what Bill
O'reilly's Twitter handle is.

556
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:59,380
I imagine something around it
like below where I'm sure it is,

557
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,720
but you know what I mean? I see
him, he's never known for like, Oh,

558
00:30:01,721 --> 00:30:04,480
Bill O'reilly said this on social
media when the last time you heard bill

559
00:30:04,481 --> 00:30:07,510
O'Reilly say something, he might
not even be, I made some news. Yeah.

560
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:10,090
He might not even be own.
It's tough bro. Yeah,

561
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:13,660
he's podcasting from his like apartment
or something like that. Dude is like,

562
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:16,120
it's no background. Nothing
really. Yeah, it's bad.

563
00:30:16,121 --> 00:30:19,790
He's not even wearing like
suits. Skylar, NASA wealthy shirt

564
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,100
below Rogan.
Well we gotta look him up.

565
00:30:27,101 --> 00:30:28,000
We got to see the girl,

566
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:30,880
he fucking him and see how they're
living right at the top. Guys like that.

567
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:33,640
They say we'll just lay low for a couple
of years and then someone will scoop

568
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:35,010
you up again now,
which is only right

569
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:38,540
one fox and Fox lets you go.
Yeah. If you're one of those guys,

570
00:30:38,541 --> 00:30:42,540
those neo-con guys like you don't
really have any place else to go. Hey,

571
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:47,300
too old to really understand the
landscape of like how to navigate this new

572
00:30:47,301 --> 00:30:50,210
Internet space cause you've got
plenty of conservative voices.

573
00:30:50,211 --> 00:30:54,400
We don't have those big platforms right
to Candice on Tommy Lauren's bitch bro.

574
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:59,030
I don't even look at them. Well no makeup.
He really look at the, on the shirt.

575
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:02,960
He's wearing a nurse's outfit
underneath that fun pants on for sure.

576
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:07,870
Guarantee that aura is based
for a shirt for real under the

577
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:14,570
what size is that button up? Shirt
did that. You'd take his wardrobe.

578
00:31:14,571 --> 00:31:17,930
He's got old fat gut now. It's been
drinking. No, this is not good.

579
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,920
Those are the news. Watch
the film fold. No Spin News.

580
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,670
Nobody low riley.com now we
need to get some new shorts.

581
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,270
81,000 views on whatever video that is.
What is what is on Twitter?

582
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,290
There are no charges.

583
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:36,240
You are presumed innocent in this country.
This is not what the left wants.

584
00:31:36,241 --> 00:31:38,880
What is this about? Was he renting
them out as April 19th well,

585
00:31:38,881 --> 00:31:43,320
maybe we turn your report. Scroll down.
How many people are watching that?

586
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,620
How many people have him on Twitter?
How many

587
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,630
Oh, so you may million followers. He
has and that video had 581,000 views.

588
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,970
10 you look at them right there
in that video right now. Go down.

589
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:55,580
Now scroll down. Do you think he's doing
the orange thing to reflect triangle?

590
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:59,440
100% he's bringing them in. We'll look
at that. That's 100% the orange thing.

591
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,090
He looks like turmeric.
Yeah,

592
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,880
but he don't look anything like it looks
in real life. That's like an Instagram.

593
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:04,440
Whoa.

594
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,440
[inaudible] come on Bro.

595
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,050
If you met him at a restaurant, you'd
be like, wait, okay, wait a minute.

596
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:18,190
Not Update your picture son.
You had to pay that woman $32 million.

597
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:23,980
Fucking disappointed. Just it keeps
getting more orange. Go down raw.

598
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,510
That's [inaudible].
People are watching video watching it.

599
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,330
He's got 500,000 views. Yeah, definitely
watching it. But now he's in a vacuum.

600
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,790
But it's those crazy old white
people that live in Kansas. Yeah,

601
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:38,020
but they don't have Twitter. Hey man, I
went in when, you know what I'm saying?

602
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:40,940
If you got 580,000 people that can
watch it when you put up a video and you

603
00:32:40,941 --> 00:32:43,490
could still get paid for it.
I'm cool with that. It's true.

604
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,121
You know what I'm saying?

605
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:48,260
I think we put too much emphasis
on like whatever mainstream it is.

606
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,530
There's no such thing as mainstream
cause there's not just one scream anymore

607
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:54,560
that's over. That's why.
And shouts at Brennan Shab.

608
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,800
That's why we wanted you guys to connect
because I feel like you guys represent

609
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:04,880
the most. I think you will are both the
most influential people in media. Right?

610
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:08,240
And you represent, put that
kind of pressure on me. Well,
I think that evil on me,

611
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:12,590
Ricky, Bobby, I think it's important. No,

612
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:14,210
because I think you guys represent,

613
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,730
and I think the illusion
was before I went on,

614
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,410
before I went on here for the first time,

615
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,290
the illusion was that these things
operated in separate spheres, right?

616
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:24,350
That there are these different vacuums,
like the Charlemagne world, right?

617
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:26,060
And then the Rogan world.
And then I went on,

618
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,790
I found all these people that
knew me from our podcast.

619
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,980
They also listened to yours, right? So
it turned out in that moment I was like,

620
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:37,940
Oh shit. It's not as fractured as people
thing now because everybody's aware.

621
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,270
People will always been hitting
me for years. Like, yeah,

622
00:33:40,271 --> 00:33:42,020
you got to go on Joe Rogan.
You've got to go on Joe Rogan,

623
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:42,920
or you've got to go on Joe Rogan.

624
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:47,360
So there's clearly that the
worlds collide connected,

625
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,820
especially this internet
wave that we're on right now,

626
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,670
the Internet we have people are
craving this type of information.

627
00:33:52,671 --> 00:33:55,460
They're craving the type of interviews
you guys are doing and talking to the

628
00:33:55,461 --> 00:33:58,610
people you guys are talking to.
Right, and I don't know, for me,

629
00:33:58,611 --> 00:34:02,240
this is really cool just to see people
like the fact that everybody could do

630
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:03,410
everybody show.
It's not like,

631
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,970
like Jimmy Kimmel never does psych the
Seth Meyer show, but you know what I mean?

632
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:12,180
It's like everything is not, that
world is very disconnected. Yeah.

633
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,980
Whereas this world, the Internet world
is like for the comics and podcasts,

634
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,770
it's like there's no competition.
Everybody helps everybody.

635
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,780
Everybody supports everybody.

636
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,420
I mean that's one thing I've
always noticed about your platform.

637
00:34:23,421 --> 00:34:28,421
Like you've always bought on up and coming
Comedians who just needed that extra

638
00:34:29,121 --> 00:34:31,880
push to for people to know who the fuck
they are. You know what I'm saying?

639
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:34,040
This is important.
That's why you have ms paddling yesterday.

640
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,500
[inaudible]

641
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:43,250
genuinely funny.
[inaudible] is insane.

642
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:47,450
Like you can only take a story that sad
in that tragic and turn it into a sitcom.

643
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,343
She was talking,

644
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:53,520
she was talking yesterday about her ex
husband who shot her in the [inaudible]

645
00:34:53,521 --> 00:34:56,830
her in the head, shot her in the titty
shot in the back of the head, shot in the,

646
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,800
he got her pregnant.

647
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:01,100
It was fucking her when she was 12 got
her pregnant when she was 14 with two

648
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:04,640
kids by the time she was 16 she had an
abortion when she was 16 with with his

649
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:09,200
third kid. She called him up to
try to get him to apologize to her.

650
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,340
He wouldn't apologize to her.

651
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:14,270
So she forgave him and she said it
released like this huge weight off of her

652
00:35:14,271 --> 00:35:14,581
shoulder.

653
00:35:14,581 --> 00:35:19,070
She was talking about it like you can't
believe her story she's laughing about.

654
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,950
Of course not. Yeah, I'm not. I'm the, I
got, yeah, def whole forgiveness thing.

655
00:35:21,951 --> 00:35:22,940
We talk about that all the time.

656
00:35:22,941 --> 00:35:26,900
I'm not with that whole like I forgive
you and it makes me feel better.

657
00:35:26,901 --> 00:35:31,460
I'm fine not fucking with you.
I'm fine saying, fuck this guy.

658
00:35:31,461 --> 00:35:33,040
Fuck this person. Like, I don't care.

659
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:37,250
Like why I have to give you when
I a manual movie just came out,

660
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:38,120
you know,

661
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,650
uh,
the shooting that happened in Charleston,

662
00:35:39,651 --> 00:35:43,850
South Carolina and like all of the
family members for gave Dylan roof.

663
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:47,900
And I'm like, there's one dude in there
that's like, fuck him. He killed my mom.

664
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:52,850
I'm like, yes, that's PR.
That's a perfectly fine emotion.

665
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:56,360
You go talk to your therapist about it,
you allow yourself to feel like, yes,

666
00:35:56,361 --> 00:35:57,050
fuck him.

667
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:01,160
Why do we feel like we got to forgive
and in a way that comes off our shoulders

668
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:05,520
for her, it was like she was carrying
around her whole life, you know?

669
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:08,490
I think for her it just helped her and
she knew he was a piece of shit when she

670
00:36:08,491 --> 00:36:10,290
was talking to him.
She said to him like,

671
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,410
you are fucking me when I was 12 years
old. And he literally said this to her,

672
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:18,480
your mind, your body wasn't
12. That's what he said to
her. And she was just like,

673
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,490
so she decided after that like,

674
00:36:20,491 --> 00:36:24,900
I'm not going to invest my energy in this
cause I'm gonna let it go. Let it go.

675
00:36:24,901 --> 00:36:27,780
So she just doesn't fuck with him.
Doesn't talk with them and she doesn't,

676
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,020
she doesn't carry around the hate.
That was a, it was poisoning her.

677
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,520
Yeah. I get it. And I understand
the power of forgiveness.

678
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:36,400
There's a reason why it exists. Right.
There's a reason why it's, you know,

679
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,180
it's still here for thousands
of years. This idea of, hey,

680
00:36:40,181 --> 00:36:43,150
let's forgive so that we could feel
better. Right. I think, I think,

681
00:36:43,151 --> 00:36:45,550
I think usually things get
weeded out if they don't work

682
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,710
well. It's hard to forgive someone that
doesn't feel bad about what they did.

683
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:52,910
It's one thing if you like,
man, I fucked up. I'm sorry.
Please forgive me. I get it.

684
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:55,310
You're a person. Human beings
make mistakes. I forgive you.

685
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:59,570
But if someone is like you were, you
weren't, you weren't 12 with your mind,

686
00:36:59,571 --> 00:37:03,170
your body, and he's talking about
fucking you when you were 12 years old.

687
00:37:03,171 --> 00:37:05,570
Like I have an 11 year old daughter.
The idea of I'm a grown man,

688
00:37:05,571 --> 00:37:07,110
fucking her violin.

689
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:10,070
Yeah. Yeah. You're not
gonna forgive him. You know,

690
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,570
you might fuck him up and then after you
fuck him up, he'd be like, you know what?

691
00:37:13,571 --> 00:37:14,100
It's all good.

692
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:18,740
Well, no, I'm saying you put a fucking
hour on his fucking gun. That's it.

693
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,620
So maybe forgiveness is misconstrued.

694
00:37:21,621 --> 00:37:24,440
Maybe you're not actually forgiving the
person and letting them offer what they

695
00:37:24,441 --> 00:37:27,560
did, but you may be just re removing
them from your consciousness.

696
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,210
People forgive when
they not gonna do shit.

697
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:33,810
[inaudible] realize I'm not
going to slap the shit out there.

698
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,510
Punches you in the face.
You're like,

699
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:40,530
I forgot to you go [inaudible] I'm
attaching myself to Jesus because I can't

700
00:37:42,241 --> 00:37:46,980
carry this no more. [inaudible]
I don't know. We do.

701
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:51,390
We don't know. We do. Sometimes we make
mistakes. We all make mistakes out here.

702
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,880
And when somebody who gets punched in
the face and be like, Yo, you got it.

703
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:59,260
You got Sam [inaudible] forgive me.
I'm a Christian.

704
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:03,810
You're fighting. You might attach
me to the worst part, my state.

705
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,081
By the way,

706
00:38:05,081 --> 00:38:07,570
that's probably when I would get to that
point of forgiveness when you want to

707
00:38:07,571 --> 00:38:08,770
do something to somebody so bad.

708
00:38:08,771 --> 00:38:12,400
But when you get the opportunity you
don't and you realize it's not that

709
00:38:12,401 --> 00:38:16,150
important to you, then at that moment I
might be like, you know what, God bless.

710
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,583
I wish them the best.

711
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:21,250
When you guys have like surpassed people
in your career that were pieces of shit

712
00:38:21,251 --> 00:38:23,200
to you as you were coming up,
did,

713
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,610
did the anger that you had towards
him totally leave your body? No,

714
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,880
absolutely not. Hold onto
that. She books about it.

715
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:35,400
Yeah, totally. Like Jordan at the press
conference, I need you. And by the way,

716
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,240
God bless

717
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,250
you with the facts are the
facts. You did fire me. Right.

718
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,640
You know Boogie d from an it
firm in Philly going [inaudible]

719
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,730
you did fire me for no fucking reason.
You did that happen.

720
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:56,010
You're listening what you're doing
right now. How are you feeling?

721
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,620
He goes over, he does radio in
Saint Louis. He does. Yeah. Yeah.

722
00:38:58,621 --> 00:39:00,330
Cause they told him that if he,
um,

723
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:03,750
if he fired me and whatever
he bought in didn't work,

724
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,540
they were going to send him back to
Saint Louis cause he had moved from Saint

725
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,660
Louis to do be the PD in Philly.
And so he fired me.

726
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:11,140
What he bought in didn't work right.

727
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,770
And they kept their word
and they sent it back.

728
00:39:13,771 --> 00:39:16,080
And Saint Louis Garbage is probably
the best thing for them though.

729
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,800
But everything worked out for everybody.
He's living a great life in Saint Louis.

730
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,360
I'm living a great life.

731
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,610
Oh life. Have you seen
that? Uh, uh, Jordan, uh,

732
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:29,750
what does it get into [inaudible]
what was it? A training.

733
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,720
He wouldn't stop talking about journalists
Brown cause they remember every

734
00:39:34,721 --> 00:39:37,300
single thing and that was his,
he's Bernard Hopkins.

735
00:39:37,301 --> 00:39:40,270
Remember we were putting on happens a
fighter. He needed to be the villain.

736
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:43,490
He needed to be the heel for the
motivation. Y'All don't have people that

737
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,830
shitting on y'all and like,
you know,

738
00:39:45,831 --> 00:39:48,460
when I surpass them it
goes away and not for me.

739
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,810
And when I start passing it goes
away. It's weird. It's like bullying.

740
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,800
I'm not saying it goes away,

741
00:39:51,801 --> 00:39:56,801
but I have to remind you to remind you
because you told me I wasn't going to

742
00:39:57,431 --> 00:39:58,880
make it.
I'll tell you this.

743
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,820
When I was starting out as a comic and I
was, you know it was rough in New York,

744
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,770
motherfuckers are just dickheads.
Teacher used to carry a,

745
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:08,610
a list of people who are
pieces of shit in my wallet.

746
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:13,740
All the people I was going to say fuck
you to when I passed him and as I would

747
00:40:13,741 --> 00:40:17,550
start to pass them, I felt
zero, I felt was your anger.

748
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:21,600
I almost start to feel bad. I go,
Shit, you're still in the same place.

749
00:40:21,601 --> 00:40:22,620
That's why you were addicted me.

750
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:26,290
Cause I was all you had to be a dick to
well that's the type of person that is a

751
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:29,200
dick to someone who's coming up.
The person who is your fee.

752
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,430
This famine mentality. Yes. She
think there's not enough. Yes.

753
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:34,740
So you try to keep people
away, get away, get away.

754
00:40:34,741 --> 00:40:37,880
Whereas the people that don't have
famine mentality like, come on, come on,

755
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:40,950
come on. Let's do it. Plenty
for everybody, for everybody.

756
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,690
Like if you like I'm been five, four times
from radio, you know what I'm saying?

757
00:40:44,691 --> 00:40:46,500
So I'm not angry at the
people that fired me,

758
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,180
but the people who told me things like,

759
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:51,060
like there was a guy named Dj Cath
and Sean's the sideline who told me I

760
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,770
wouldn't be my first time I got fired.

761
00:40:52,771 --> 00:40:55,570
He told me I would never work in
radio again cause I was an asshole.

762
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:59,310
And then you know, Boogie Dee told me,
this is why you'll never make it in radio.

763
00:40:59,311 --> 00:41:02,580
So those two individuals
just need to be reminded.

764
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:08,270
So people need to know that they may
[inaudible] you like to know the person

765
00:41:10,111 --> 00:41:13,020
that cut Michael Jordan from the
basketball team. He had eyes glow.

766
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:16,110
Wouldn't you like to know the
person that didn't hire Oprah?

767
00:41:16,111 --> 00:41:18,630
The news cast the back and they would
you like to know if people just want to

768
00:41:18,631 --> 00:41:22,740
know these people. By the way,
I've had other executives in radio,

769
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,420
you know like [inaudible],

770
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:27,180
my God dark winters doc when it's
told me that one person in particular,

771
00:41:27,181 --> 00:41:32,181
he would never hire because they fired
me and couldn't give him a reason why.

772
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,010
When he asked him why,

773
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,540
he was like, I just did. I just, I didn't,

774
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:38,360
they didn't like what he was doing and
he was like, I never hired that person.

775
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,200
So that's why certain
people need to be told,

776
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,070
being reminded about the decisions.
They made it like a cycle.

777
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,300
Know Francis

778
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:54,060
also that you get hired for these jobs
and you can get fired by these assholes

779
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,540
and there's always that weird power
play between producers and executives.

780
00:41:57,541 --> 00:42:01,000
That happens with television shows and
networks and it happens with radio.

781
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:04,470
It happens. This, this a power play.
Yeah. The thing about comedies, it's like,

782
00:42:04,471 --> 00:42:07,650
you know, you just work at a different
club. There's no real, the only,

783
00:42:07,651 --> 00:42:09,930
I mean there's a little weird struggle
between you and the other comedians,

784
00:42:09,931 --> 00:42:13,190
but there's no where real struggle between
you and a club. When you go in there,

785
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,180
you sell out,
you kill and you're friendly to everybody.

786
00:42:15,181 --> 00:42:18,000
They don't give a fuck 100% thank you.
Here's your money

787
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:22,100
bro. They lash fucking care. And it
doesn't matter how much of a diva you are.

788
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,580
Everybody knows this story in comedy.
Eddie Griffin, you know Eddie Griffin,

789
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:28,790
writer anywhere has the best
rider in comedy. He has a writer.

790
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:30,470
Oh did he give me writer?
Oh he's had it forever.

791
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:33,240
Oh, so he had a ride. A ride.
No rider mean like the thing,

792
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,050
it's all about me
pronounce this shit wrong.

793
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:41,230
[inaudible] go man.

794
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:47,360
And he's great. So, but
apparently his his rider,

795
00:42:47,361 --> 00:42:49,160
which means like the shit
that's in the green room. Yeah.

796
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:52,800
Any needs a brand new pair of
air force ones for every show.

797
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:58,640
A lot of people do that. What? Yeah. Yeah.
A lot of people have like sneaker riders.

798
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,533
Wait a minute.
Yeah,

799
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:02,450
fucking up. Cause I haven't
asked for anything but water.

800
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,730
You would think sneakers are the most
important thing in standup, right?

801
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,720
Like you need to fucking shoot
when you're on that page. Hold on.

802
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:12,010
There are more than just Eddie
has some guys have it where they

803
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:16,230
want a fresh pair size eleven's
whatever. They were right there. So they,

804
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,470
they get to the plate,

805
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,350
they number one to wear them at all
until right when they get on stage.

806
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:21,730
That's it.
Yeah.

807
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:26,830
What's in your either I just
was like Jack Daniels wine meet,

808
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:32,440
um, water, simple sugar free,
red bull kind of meat. You're
not specific with me? No.

809
00:43:32,441 --> 00:43:35,340
Like, like meat plates, like
roast beef and shit like that too,

810
00:43:35,341 --> 00:43:40,270
just so I don't eat garbage, you
know, stuff like that. Nothing. Nuts.

811
00:43:40,271 --> 00:43:44,620
Macadamia nuts and pistachios.
Normal Shit. Red M and m's,

812
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:49,100
Kelly Green ones pick out
the green ones. They, I mean,

813
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:52,010
that is what you're saying about standup
is the beauty of independence though,

814
00:43:52,011 --> 00:43:53,510
right? Yeah. That's why.

815
00:43:53,511 --> 00:43:56,360
That's why everybody who gives me to
run through the standup stage afterwards

816
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,400
because the comedy clubs still accepted.

817
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,450
Did you see that tweet?
I thought he was, uh,

818
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,120
I forget what word or something
like that and he was like, oh, Jay,

819
00:44:04,121 --> 00:44:07,300
we'll be doing stand up in three
months, dude. Do you watch those?

820
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:11,360
No. Why do you, why do we it? She love it.

821
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,800
I love that term Twitter world.

822
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:21,490
There's a lot of bs out there.
Now there's me off that.

823
00:44:21,491 --> 00:44:24,850
He does videos on Twitter.
That shit to Instagram doesn't know.

824
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,240
He thought he thinks Twitter is bad.
Thanks.

825
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,450
He's holding his reading glasses in
his hand. I mean he's going blind.

826
00:44:30,451 --> 00:44:32,380
He's 71 old.
He

827
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,490
just see the, the, the DME sent
that dude amazing with all the,

828
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:38,550
all the knife emojis. What'd y'all do you
understand that with strategic, right?

829
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:39,780
He sent that on Monday.

830
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:43,050
Monday was the 25th anniversary
of the fucking Bronco Chase.

831
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:46,910
So you think that he didn't just want
to be in the news like that was a,

832
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:48,480
that was a strategic move.

833
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,610
I don't think he's that smart.

834
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:53,660
I think what's going on is he reacting
to someone fucking with him and he

835
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:56,840
doesn't, he doesn't know
how to just let shit slide.

836
00:44:56,841 --> 00:45:01,250
So somebody makes a parody video or he's
doing his Twitter hello Twitter world

837
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,230
and then someone's got hell please

838
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,170
background. That's a great deal
to me. He gets mad and new DMS.

839
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:09,390
That person who made that video?
I'm going to cut you.

840
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:13,650
I don't think they said I'm going
to cut. Yeah. Yeah. Strategic Man.

841
00:45:13,651 --> 00:45:15,560
I think he knew it was
the 25th anniversary.

842
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:20,400
The Bronco Chase and old ojs only
relevant is the fact that he got away with

843
00:45:20,401 --> 00:45:20,731
murder,

844
00:45:20,731 --> 00:45:25,190
so he has to remind us of that fact all
the time in order for us to give a fuck.

845
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:27,330
Did you ever see the videos
he did when he was doing rap?

846
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:32,230
When he's dressing up like King in Miami?
Yeah. He dressed up like a rapper. Yeah.

847
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:37,720
You said no yet Jamie. We
can't, we can't play it. Right.

848
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:39,300
You get pulled off of youtube real quick.

849
00:45:39,301 --> 00:45:41,620
That stuff was faked
that DM stuff at the end.

850
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:46,570
Oh Wow. Yes. I listened to Jim
and Sam yesterday actually like

851
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:50,060
rub it down instantly. He made an
a fake account with like it though.

852
00:45:50,061 --> 00:45:53,360
It was the real Oj. He just
made the l a capital. I

853
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,840
Ah,
[inaudible] gave him

854
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,650
he day for no fucking reason.

855
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:03,080
God Damn Lucky your I'm and I'm back.
I'm glad.

856
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,790
I'm glad he's not that stupid.
Right donkey today. The second one,

857
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:06,550
I'd go in the breakfast club.

858
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:08,490
I get somebody to the credit they
deserve for being stupid. I'm like, yeah,

859
00:46:08,491 --> 00:46:12,690
you can't be that stupid, that thirsty
for attention Oj. So, so it's kind of,

860
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,780
it's kind of a relief that he's not

861
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,920
that thirsty. This is Oj when he
was doing rap music, all right,

862
00:46:17,921 --> 00:46:20,650
well no we can't and now he is.
He can't play the music.

863
00:46:20,651 --> 00:46:24,520
But he had girls out there dancing around
their underwear and the Oj was rapping

864
00:46:24,521 --> 00:46:26,200
to me.
Have like a crown on or something.

865
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:29,050
There he is dressed up in like
white face and all sorts of things.

866
00:46:29,051 --> 00:46:30,520
There's naked girls in it.
Oh God.

867
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:33,400
You don't think Oj man riding a wave of
killing these two people for too long,

868
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:36,850
Bro. Crazy bitches will
still fucking guarantees.

869
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:40,300
I don't understand this, this,
this part of women at all.

870
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:43,740
Like the women that like meet people
in jail and then they're like getting

871
00:46:43,741 --> 00:46:46,240
married to them in jail.
Like what is this about?

872
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:49,320
It's thinking about that Jill Dick,
when they come home and jail,

873
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,790
those guys never get to
give them that jail Dick.

874
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:55,030
They're in jail forever and then get your
conjugal visits and they still want to

875
00:46:55,031 --> 00:46:58,840
marry him. But why are attracted
to killers? So they want killers.

876
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:03,660
They want killers in specifically they
want killers that kill women. What? Yeah,

877
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,660
that's a thing with some women
with really fucked up women. They,

878
00:47:07,661 --> 00:47:10,030
they're attracted to men who kill women.

879
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,660
God Damn happened. The girl just wanting
to get choked. No. Why? Why? Why go?

880
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:20,370
Why you got to go to that extreme? Spanky
that's all I'm going to just ranking.

881
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,090
Do you think all the choking

882
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:23,850
they know and like,

883
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,160
you know how like some girls have like
rape fantasies and shit like that.

884
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:29,220
Do you think that's all because
men have just become such pussies,

885
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:33,650
they want to see if they have
the ability to even do it?

886
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:38,120
No. I think some girls have this primal
need to know that you can kill them.

887
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:42,680
But what don't they know that this
turns him on? Turn Your Daddy,

888
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,980
right? Yeah. Protect them. It's
a tech kill them. Yeah, for sure.

889
00:47:45,981 --> 00:47:47,780
But they want to know you could kill them.

890
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:50,510
Not that you're going to kill
them or kill someone else.

891
00:47:50,511 --> 00:47:53,720
Trying to get them that hand
on your neck choking you.

892
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:57,680
They want to be like close to the door
of you doing something viable to them

893
00:47:57,681 --> 00:48:01,580
while you're fucking them. So it feels
good. Why you got control over their life?

894
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:03,760
You really have like you're
holding their natural. Yes.

895
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:07,140
So why do we up too

896
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,060
dudes that like jerk off with like
a belt on her neck and choke them.

897
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:15,230
We call them Weirdos. Women.
Yeah. But that's different. Does,

898
00:48:15,231 --> 00:48:19,400
that's on our erotic is
fix the [inaudible] it is.

899
00:48:19,401 --> 00:48:22,820
But I think the choking is, you're
doing it. A man is doing it to you.

900
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,300
It's not just that you're running out of
oxygen because someone is squeezing the

901
00:48:26,301 --> 00:48:27,420
blood out of your brain.
Right.

902
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:30,750
But it's also that someone's doing
it to you while you're while there.

903
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:32,900
Do you guys go for the whole choke?

904
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,920
Because what I do is I like put my hand
there and then I kinda just tense my

905
00:48:36,921 --> 00:48:40,430
forearm. But I don't really squeeze
the fingers cause I want, you know,

906
00:48:40,431 --> 00:48:42,830
cause it's way to really show like
that she won't let me do that.

907
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:46,110
She wants the whole choke. No, she doesn't
like that. She doesn't like that. Yeah,

908
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,620
because she knows you could do it.
Well it's not just that,

909
00:48:48,621 --> 00:48:51,560
it's like she just did. You took people
out regularly. She knows you're capable,

910
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:53,780
but the kind of girl that wants
you to children like that,

911
00:48:53,781 --> 00:48:56,900
I think you should leave that one alone.
Dude. My wife liked the load shogun.

912
00:48:57,030 --> 00:49:00,710
I mean we've got, we've got no did all
of that stuff and kind of like subsided,

913
00:49:00,711 --> 00:49:02,280
but she used to like a lot of choking.

914
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:04,320
You know we've been together 22
years though. Yeah. You want to play,

915
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:06,520
you have a John Doe she likes,
she's nice.

916
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:12,850
Did I do?
It's enough for us.

917
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:16,870
It's happening to you. Some
girls love it, man love it.

918
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:19,840
But I think it's really because
they see men as pathetic.

919
00:49:19,841 --> 00:49:23,530
Now they see men as babies and the more
pathetic and like cocked up a guy is

920
00:49:23,531 --> 00:49:26,470
there like, okay, choke me,
slap me around, show me that
you have some testosterone,

921
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,730
show me you have some sort of frame
gotta go give. Oh Jason Placido. Mike.

922
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,780
That's right. That's right.
They're asking. Oh, take the token.

923
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,430
Richard Ramirez used to have
girls visiting him Manson
that was married when he

924
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:39,270
died. [inaudible] Manson had charm.
He must have had something. No,

925
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:44,130
he must've had some, I've had fame.
Fame has always been in attraction.

926
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,480
People are famous in the beginning when
he was getting people to do all that

927
00:49:46,481 --> 00:49:51,430
wild shit, man in Manson, right? Well he
wasn't famous. Buddy was a cult leader,

928
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:55,090
so, right. So he was the leader of
a small group. So he was infamous.

929
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:57,160
Infamous amongst that group of people.

930
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,760
But you got to at least turn a couple
of people to turn it into a cult.

931
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:03,280
Like eventually it becomes part of them.
But if you look at social media,

932
00:50:03,281 --> 00:50:05,950
you realize that ain't really shit
right and ain't really shit to have a

933
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:10,150
following. You know what I'm saying? 500
followers on social media is pathetic.

934
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:14,360
Right, but 500 in real life. Yo, you
champion a man, Jim Jones. He's like,

935
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,680
especially in 67 yeah man,
you get 10 people,

936
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:22,870
you get 10 people to kill herself is 67
man.

937
00:50:22,871 --> 00:50:25,510
Some people can't get 10 people to
accommodate you. That's what I'm saying.

938
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:28,360
That's a different kind
of captive audience. Yeah.

939
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:31,640
You would have met and know like you got
a fax them like there's no organization.

940
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:35,990
Everything has to happen in real
life. Yeah. Peach, like that's wheel.

941
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:38,900
He must have the speech when he made
everybody drink the Koolaid, bro.

942
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:42,360
Let me tell you something about
some he that must've been,

943
00:50:42,361 --> 00:50:45,060
they know they were drinking. That
wasn't even cooler. You know? Cool.

944
00:50:45,061 --> 00:50:48,110
I took a bad rap.
It was some like cheap Costco brand,

945
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:50,900
which koolaid existed even back
then I think who laid existed,

946
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:53,530
so he went with the generic to
me was some bullshit clerks.

947
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,850
It's like they didn't have enough
money for all Koolaid. Hey,

948
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:00,850
whatever the fuck they drink, they serving
it in the Dominican Republic. Every

949
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:07,470
cocktail in sandals,
performance is happening in the Dominican.

950
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:13,160
All these people are dying. They should
try to get that big PAPI. No, no, no, no.

951
00:51:13,161 --> 00:51:16,520
This is a dye that resorts,
that was an assassination attempt hold.

952
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:18,280
People are dying at these resorts there.

953
00:51:18,281 --> 00:51:20,270
They're listening to all these
Americans that are being poisoned.

954
00:51:20,271 --> 00:51:22,430
One lady got beaten to death and raped.

955
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,160
She didn't get beaten to death but like
beaten half to death. She survived,

956
00:51:25,161 --> 00:51:29,240
but like her whole head was just big
swollen, massive blood and injuries.

957
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,630
Everyday at the worked at this resort,

958
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,120
she saw him where at least
he was wearing an outfit,

959
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:39,080
clubbed her over the head and did all
kinds of crazy shit to her and left her

960
00:51:39,081 --> 00:51:41,410
for dead.
I read a story today.

961
00:51:41,411 --> 00:51:45,710
It was a group of high school kids who
went to the Dr of celebrating graduation

962
00:51:45,711 --> 00:51:46,370
or whatever.

963
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:49,700
All of them ended up in the hospital and
nobody knows why this shit is happening.

964
00:51:49,701 --> 00:51:52,670
Nine people have died at these
resorts and nobody knows what.

965
00:51:52,671 --> 00:51:56,090
A lot of them are dying from
pulmonary edema and heart failure.

966
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,690
It's like some blood issue
and the drinking things from
the Minibar, the Minibar,

967
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:06,200
you know,
we'll do a walk around the yard a minute.

968
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,450
What is the number of buildable puts?

969
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:12,980
The number of people if tied over
then now it's like seven nine, nine,

970
00:52:12,981 --> 00:52:17,390
nine nine and it's happening in
the resorts. The safe spots. Yeah,

971
00:52:17,391 --> 00:52:21,110
it's happening in the
resorts. Fuck the dog off of.

972
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:23,880
We got to go to Dr. What?
What?

973
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:29,060
That's hunting right there. Let's
get into it. This is, this is,

974
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,950
let's get to the bottom of it. Do you
want really want to do some nature shit,

975
00:52:31,951 --> 00:52:34,040
Joe,
you want to go do some major shit?

976
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:36,860
Let's go hunt some rapists in the
Dr. I wonder what's happening.

977
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:39,800
I don't think it's just right back and
got his right as people die from drinking.

978
00:52:39,801 --> 00:52:42,650
If they started drinking at these mini
bars and drink it at these bars and like

979
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:46,430
they've been testing the alcohol and
it's like fake alcohol or some shit like

980
00:52:46,431 --> 00:52:49,220
that. I don't know what the fuck is going
on. I just know nine people lived. Died.

981
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:52,350
Yeah. I'm not gone. Nah. Yeah, I'm
not going. Yeah, you can't take it.

982
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,860
That's all it takes.
It takes us nine people going,

983
00:52:54,861 --> 00:52:57,650
Oh fuck up your whole tourist economy,
you would think.

984
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:01,100
But we live in this era where
people are like, Oh shit,

985
00:53:01,101 --> 00:53:03,470
let's go over there and see
if we can survive the DVR.

986
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:08,420
Like it's become like a fucking
game almost. Yeah. Yeah.

987
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:11,620
Well this one, anybody dies of a cocaine
overdose. Everybody wants to shit.

988
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:15,910
[inaudible] right where you want the good
shit. You know what the shit they, no,

989
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:19,730
never ever done it. You ever do coke? I
fixed enough cold coins. I smoked in it,

990
00:53:19,731 --> 00:53:22,820
a blunt with some weed. Okay. Back
in the day. But I fixed nifty,

991
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:26,040
like it was like the lines are
on the table and I just wanted

992
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,350
to make the people I was around feel
comfortable almost like on some training

993
00:53:28,351 --> 00:53:30,320
day shit. I don't want them to think
I was like gone to a couple of copies.

994
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:35,240
So some mother fucking, you just do like
this. Yeah. And you knock it off. Yeah.

995
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,050
I just get a little on your face and
you just go, whoa. Everybody's high,

996
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:43,620
but it's not like they really do.
Black does say Wu after doing coke too.

997
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,311
I don't know.

998
00:53:44,311 --> 00:53:49,311
I did [inaudible] ric flair movie.

999
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:54,620
I saw it. He let out a Goddamn
ric flair. Woo. I've had that

1000
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:58,630
t that Mata de cocoa tea tea
made out of cocoa leaves.

1001
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,050
Yeah, those, yeah, the
apparently the leaves,

1002
00:54:02,051 --> 00:54:05,440
if you just chew them are actually good
for you and they have the phytonutrients.

1003
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:08,710
It's like cop, it's like a cup of coffee.
Okay. It's like, but it's healthy.

1004
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,280
It's actually good for you. Right though.
Those high, those high altitude herders,

1005
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:14,380
they put a big wad of
that shit in their mouth.

1006
00:54:14,381 --> 00:54:18,040
They chew on it and then it releases
into their bloodstream and it's actually

1007
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:21,640
healthy. It's not bad for you. It's when
they process it and turn it into cocaine.

1008
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:26,110
That is bad. That's when it gets, what
I've had is coca leaves in a tea form,

1009
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:29,740
so you just take the leaves and it's like
you're in a tea bag and you drink the

1010
00:54:29,741 --> 00:54:32,560
tea. It just makes you kind of
like hyper and he talked to me.

1011
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:35,790
I'm not gonna lie. When I smoked that
cocaine with that weed by accident,

1012
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:39,990
that was the best high I've ever
had in my mother. Really? Yes.

1013
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:44,220
I used to always say I would do it again
by accident if it was all by accident

1014
00:54:44,221 --> 00:54:49,050
on purpose. What? I think I'm too old
for that shit now, but back then my God,

1015
00:54:49,051 --> 00:54:50,820
I remember that high
like it was yesterday.

1016
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:56,550
He said if you just feel like very alive,
like you feel aware,

1017
00:54:56,551 --> 00:54:58,170
like everything just seems bright.

1018
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:02,520
Even when it's dark out and it's just
like you feel like you're actually on top

1019
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:07,260
of something. It's just like you just feel
mad hypo. But when you crash you crash.

1020
00:55:07,261 --> 00:55:10,100
Came over when he crashes.
Tried Molly.

1021
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:15,260
Yeah. Want to try them DMA and Dma yet?
Yeah, same shit. It was once though.

1022
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:18,470
You like it or no,
I love the feeling when I was on it,

1023
00:55:18,471 --> 00:55:20,660
I did not like the next
day I couldn't read.

1024
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:24,700
I was trying to read a magazine and I
couldn't read. I was like, I just can't,

1025
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:28,310
I couldn't follow it. Yeah. My
brain was so dried out to shut down.

1026
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:31,820
Just it was just debt. And then I've been
on stage that night and ate shit. Yeah.

1027
00:55:31,821 --> 00:55:36,320
Cause the synapses are firing
up. I was slow and sloppy.
My, my delivery was, yeah,

1028
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,150
all fucked up. Cause when you say shit,
I thought literally I was like, Oh,

1029
00:55:39,151 --> 00:55:41,950
I can't wait to hear this story.
I was like,

1030
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:47,050
you started reaching in your fucking pants
and you pull it out of my mind, dude.

1031
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:51,120
So I've been going to burning man last
few years. Right. Real and uh, yeah.

1032
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,820
Got, get the hippie pussy bro. Dude, it's
not even really like for me at least.

1033
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:59,170
I haven't even really been fucking
there. No, no duty. You don't,

1034
00:55:59,171 --> 00:56:01,890
you're not showering, you're all fucking
hopped up on drugs and check. Yeah.

1035
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:05,550
I think like the fuck communities exist,
but I don't want to sell it. It's,

1036
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,600
it's weird to like sell it,
but it's a really cool experience.

1037
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:10,990
You would probably really
love it. But, um, and I tried
Molly and it was, you know,

1038
00:56:10,991 --> 00:56:14,740
people say like when you
try drugs it gives you, um,

1039
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:18,220
this heightened version of reality that
you can't come to naturally. Right.

1040
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:19,870
And then you have a new
perspective because of it.

1041
00:56:19,871 --> 00:56:23,980
Some people say that about like acid or
mushrooms at these types of things. Um, it

1042
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,990
was weird used for the
first time in my life,

1043
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:29,650
I felt past emotionally fill full.

1044
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,880
It was like excess. Does
that make sense? You don't,

1045
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:36,700
you kill on stage and you walk off and
you just want to like help people because

1046
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,750
you filled up the void and then you
have a little extra, right? Yeah.

1047
00:56:40,751 --> 00:56:42,670
So Molly put me there and I was like,
oh,

1048
00:56:42,671 --> 00:56:46,510
this is how people who
feel no void operate.

1049
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,250
Like I was just calling my parents,

1050
00:56:48,251 --> 00:56:51,220
I was calling my best friends and tell
him I love him and I'm gonna take care of

1051
00:56:51,221 --> 00:56:54,580
your kids if anything happens.
Like w what the flow. Yeah.

1052
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:58,660
Maybe they gave you the courage to
do things you want to do before,

1053
00:56:58,661 --> 00:57:01,750
whatever reason you choose not
to. Right. Because you know,

1054
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:04,990
before I'm busy trying to fill the void,
right,

1055
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:07,210
be it through laughs or through content,
whatever we're doing.

1056
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:10,450
And here I had the excess and it was an
interesting experience to make me okay,

1057
00:57:10,451 --> 00:57:14,440
I can probably hit this maybe without
the drug, I can do things in my life.

1058
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:16,240
Exercise or gratitude.

1059
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:21,420
Gratitude 100% that's the ultra hundred
percent Dr Wayne w dies said that you

1060
00:57:21,881 --> 00:57:25,390
won't find your true purpose. Your true
purpose in life is service to others.

1061
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:30,430
So I think most people that are public
servants and like give their lives to

1062
00:57:30,431 --> 00:57:33,700
other people, like I think that's
the ultimate high, but it's so crazy.

1063
00:57:33,701 --> 00:57:36,370
It's like you don't get to
notice that until you're there.

1064
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:38,350
Like it's so easy to sell.
If you tell people, hey,

1065
00:57:38,351 --> 00:57:39,970
you should be grateful and
then you'll feel better.

1066
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:44,290
But if they're not able to feel
the sensation of gratitude,

1067
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,880
you're explaining to them.

1068
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:48,880
You're explaining Chinese to someone
who doesn't even know what the fuck the

1069
00:57:48,881 --> 00:57:51,050
languages. Yeah. It's like we're,

1070
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:54,760
we're all in this like unique situation
where we've probably experienced that

1071
00:57:54,761 --> 00:57:58,180
and we probably, you know, it tried
to find ways to give back, et cetera.

1072
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:00,570
And then we felt really good because of
it, where like, I should keep doing this,

1073
00:58:00,571 --> 00:58:02,040
this,
this is a really good feeling thought.

1074
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:06,210
But imagine someone who's like
barely surviving. They don't, yeah,

1075
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,470
but they still have something to give.
They just don't realize it.

1076
00:58:08,471 --> 00:58:10,720
Like you might have $10 in your
bank account, but guess what?

1077
00:58:10,721 --> 00:58:14,320
It's a homeless person on the street that
has zero. Right? You give him a dollar,

1078
00:58:14,321 --> 00:58:17,320
you might feel great, and
then we take that dollar and
he's so appreciative. Like,

1079
00:58:17,321 --> 00:58:20,380
thank you. Thank you. Like that'll
make you immediately feel better. Yeah.

1080
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:24,550
Really just helping people without any,
you know, you'd have no alter your motive.

1081
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:28,540
It's a great feeling. It's addictive.
I thought about that with Karma, right?

1082
00:58:28,541 --> 00:58:30,040
Like we always look at Carmen,

1083
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:33,160
we think that calm is what you put out
is what you're supposed to get back.

1084
00:58:33,161 --> 00:58:36,640
No calm is just an action and you're
supposed to do those things just because

1085
00:58:36,641 --> 00:58:38,950
it's the right thing to do,
period.

1086
00:58:38,951 --> 00:58:43,270
Like also Karma involves you feeling
the way you feel about yourself because

1087
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:46,610
when you do shitty things,
you feel you have a bad self image.

1088
00:58:46,611 --> 00:58:49,450
So you live in your Karma that
people don't get. It's not like,

1089
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:50,830
here's a dollar for a homeless guy.

1090
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:54,550
Five minutes later I should get $10
it's not an investment Karma, right?

1091
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:59,440
It's I feel better when I'm acting right.
It's simple as that.

1092
00:58:59,441 --> 00:59:02,530
You can't run from yourself. You
do. You go to sleep every night,

1093
00:59:02,531 --> 00:59:05,140
you look in the mirror like,
and when you jack off,

1094
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:07,930
you know what you're thinking about
your Jackson. I'm like, you know you,

1095
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:11,910
and I think a lot of people
don't understand that
concept. Like once you like,

1096
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:15,640
I can't do people dirty because
I know I did somebody do it.

1097
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:19,170
I can't do something. I'll
carry that. Cause I know I
did something foul. You know?

1098
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,100
And even when somebody
does something to me, I've,

1099
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:22,870
I've got to go through my
files and my mind like,

1100
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,680
did I do something
fucked up to this person?

1101
00:59:24,681 --> 00:59:28,070
Did I do something to cause them to
run yet this, wait, no, I didn't.

1102
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:32,930
That's their problem and that's
the competitive advantage
of sociopath's is they

1103
00:59:32,931 --> 00:59:37,460
don't carry the negative Karma. Sure.
Right. They have the interaction. We,

1104
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:39,200
the three of us would walk
around afterwards like, man,

1105
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:41,390
I shouldn't have fucking done that.
What the fuck was wrong with me?

1106
00:59:41,391 --> 00:59:43,850
I feel like a piece of shit. They
just go, no. All right, that happened.

1107
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,060
I don't believe that. No. That's why
they, if they're effective in business,

1108
00:59:47,061 --> 00:59:48,620
that's why they're effective in politics.

1109
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,240
That's why you see these
personality types succeed. No,

1110
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:54,600
with the ability to just destroy
thousands of lives, you would just say,

1111
00:59:54,601 --> 00:59:56,900
but I think eventually it
catches up to all of them.

1112
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:59,630
I don't think it does emotional
just suppressing shit so much,

1113
00:59:59,631 --> 01:00:00,920
but eventually I think that just,

1114
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,890
I think that should just explode in them
and causing them to go crazy if they

1115
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:04,724
don't fucking get killed.

1116
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:09,620
There are people though that
don't experience any emotions
the way we experience.

1117
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,930
No empathy. Yeah. There's,
there's, they're broken.

1118
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:15,110
There's something wrong with the synapses.
Yeah. Stuff like that for a long time.

1119
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:17,090
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. When I,

1120
01:00:17,091 --> 01:00:20,600
when I started going to therapy is when
I started like piecing things together,

1121
01:00:20,601 --> 01:00:21,260
but I,
I,

1122
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:26,030
I made myself cold just because
of how to protect yourself. Yeah.

1123
01:00:26,031 --> 01:00:29,200
And how I felt like the world and
the business was treating me. Yeah.

1124
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:30,980
At a certain point.
Yeah.

1125
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,090
I mean I was purposely making myself code
and I thought that was the way that I

1126
01:00:35,091 --> 01:00:37,700
had to beat you fucking around and read
books like the 48 laws of power when

1127
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:38,660
you're young and you know,

1128
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:42,620
you study all of these people who got
to a certain point and they all had like

1129
01:00:42,621 --> 01:00:46,580
this, this, this, this, this coldness
about them. Like this ruthlessness.

1130
01:00:46,581 --> 01:00:49,010
Like I'll step on anybody to
get to where I need to be,

1131
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:54,110
but then you realize these motherfuckers
up miserable. That's the theme saying,

1132
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:57,740
Dude. So you're on the island,
right? Lanai. Yeah. Right.

1133
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:00,320
And were you hanging out with
any gallon folks? All. Yeah.

1134
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:04,180
So there's this a comic and
little Duvall. He's, he's,

1135
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:07,100
I really think he's one of the people
who understands life better than anybody

1136
01:01:07,101 --> 01:01:10,360
on this planet. My guy and good breeze.
Yeah. He's a good buddy of ours. He's,

1137
01:01:10,361 --> 01:01:14,150
he's fucking and brilliant.
And um, he says, he goes,
dude, for the smile bitch song.

1138
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:15,430
[inaudible] you go,
okay Joe,

1139
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:20,360
when I'm telling you stop vendor comes
out to that song easy man, let's talk.

1140
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:23,750
We were on is pious last time we were
talking about how is he was going to do it

1141
01:01:23,751 --> 01:01:25,250
man. Yeah. But um,

1142
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:29,870
he's one of these guys, I promise you,
his understanding of life is unparalleled,

1143
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,830
unparalleled to anybody I've ever seen.
And you see a song like smile bitch,

1144
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,600
and we see it maybe on surface value,

1145
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:39,290
but everything he does has a purpose
and he's aware of the purpose, right?

1146
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:42,110
He's aware of the energy puts out in
the ecosystem and how it affects the

1147
01:01:42,111 --> 01:01:45,470
ecosystem. And he was telling me
how he likes to go to the islands.

1148
01:01:45,471 --> 01:01:48,350
I visit him and Bahamas and he likes
to be in the moms. And I was like, why?

1149
01:01:48,351 --> 01:01:51,590
Why do you like to be here?
He goes, because people
understand what life is. Here.

1150
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:52,910
I go, what are you talking about? He goes,

1151
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:57,020
they don't get caught up in the bullshit
that we caught it get caught up in the

1152
01:01:57,021 --> 01:01:58,430
states. Right? And like in the states,

1153
01:01:58,431 --> 01:02:00,890
everybody here thinks they're going
to be a millionaire. Everybody. Yes,

1154
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:04,070
we have a lottery or reality show,
some viral video,

1155
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:06,980
and you'd go to the island and they
understand that they're gonna live and die

1156
01:02:06,981 --> 01:02:09,290
there. And then they
start to realize, hey,

1157
01:02:09,291 --> 01:02:13,130
I got to just maximize happiness in life
to try and get some chicken tenders on

1158
01:02:13,131 --> 01:02:15,320
the island. When we were in
Bahamas, it takes 50 50 minutes,

1159
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:17,930
an hour for fucking five chicken tenders.
I'm like,

1160
01:02:17,931 --> 01:02:19,980
why the fuck is it taking so
long? And he looks at me. He goes,

1161
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,180
why should they hurry? It's philosophy.
The purpose is real Buddhist.

1162
01:02:24,181 --> 01:02:27,570
Like it's a lot of it is a lie. He
doesn't know. He doesn't know that.

1163
01:02:27,571 --> 01:02:29,930
But his philosophy is like he's,
he's aware of it.

1164
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:32,650
He don't even know what you call my nephew
who was Buddhist. He'd be like, Hey,

1165
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,450
I didn't go to school. No Buddha. No.

1166
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:38,490
He thinks he knows instinctively.

1167
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:43,520
He no formal education comes from nothing
and the way that he's found a way to

1168
01:02:44,311 --> 01:02:47,520
understand humanity. It says competitive
advantage in the industry is in.

1169
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:51,540
He just truly understands. It's fast.
We've complicated this shit dude.

1170
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:54,390
We had that like capitalism
is complicated things,

1171
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:59,250
you know the cultures that we strive
to be a part of of complicated things.

1172
01:02:59,251 --> 01:03:02,430
The truth of the matter is life
is about treating people good,

1173
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:06,220
being a public servant and dying.
That's how I,

1174
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,690
the crazy thing he goes, he goes, I love,

1175
01:03:09,691 --> 01:03:11,820
I love it and this is what's hard to
understand because I love hanging out with

1176
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:12,870
old people. I'm like, why? He goes,

1177
01:03:12,871 --> 01:03:14,760
because they understand life
like what do you mean? He goes,

1178
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:18,810
you eventually get to a certain point
where you realize you're going to die and

1179
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,210
all these things that you want to
accomplish that you thought you had to

1180
01:03:21,211 --> 01:03:23,520
accomplish and all this shit that you
thought you had to get done in order to

1181
01:03:23,521 --> 01:03:26,100
value yourself as is meaningless. It was
just distraction. Until we get there.

1182
01:03:26,290 --> 01:03:29,830
Yeah. That's the concept. I could
you not believe hard to swallow too,

1183
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:33,030
cause you have to let go of Ego, right?
You have to go, you have to go, okay,

1184
01:03:33,031 --> 01:03:37,150
I'm okay as I am and I'm okay having a
quick conversation with somebody or a

1185
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:40,620
good interaction today or just fucking
sitting on the beach and looking at the

1186
01:03:40,621 --> 01:03:42,510
stars. Right. These are cool things.

1187
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:46,770
That's just as valuable as
having a youtube clip hit
a million or something like

1188
01:03:46,771 --> 01:03:49,830
that. These, these things aren't
any different in the grand scheme.

1189
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:52,620
A grand scope of things, right? Yeah. I
believe in the law of attraction, right?

1190
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:53,700
Your thoughts become things.

1191
01:03:53,701 --> 01:03:56,310
So that's why it's hard for me
to grasp the concept of, okay,

1192
01:03:56,311 --> 01:03:57,150
when are you going to die?

1193
01:03:57,450 --> 01:04:01,440
Because in my mind I want to die when
I'm 90 or 100 years old. But you know,

1194
01:04:01,441 --> 01:04:03,690
you read certain things and you're
like, no, you have to embrace it.

1195
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:05,640
You have to tell yourself
every day you're going to die.

1196
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,410
Cause then you'll live your life
like every day is your laugh.

1197
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:13,310
I that's a hard concept. You know CT
Fletcher, I've heard that name. So

1198
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:20,180
he had a heart transplant last year and
he came on the podcast a year after his

1199
01:04:20,401 --> 01:04:21,234
heart transplant.

1200
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:26,480
And you've never seen a guy more than
loving and open and friendly and thankful

1201
01:04:27,601 --> 01:04:31,440
and tells everybody loves him and he's
hugging everybody and just genuinely

1202
01:04:31,441 --> 01:04:34,730
grateful because he was at death's
door like legitimately on death's door.

1203
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:36,080
His heart was failing him.
His father,

1204
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:39,780
his heart had failed him
is his brothers is like,

1205
01:04:39,781 --> 01:04:43,440
he's got congenital heart disease in his
family and he knew that his heart was

1206
01:04:43,441 --> 01:04:45,030
going.
He had had heart attacks,

1207
01:04:45,031 --> 01:04:48,660
he'd had surgery and they transplanted
his fucking heart and they put a woman's

1208
01:04:48,661 --> 01:04:52,890
heart inside from two. Wow. Also fucked
with him. That's why his lines. Wow. No,

1209
01:04:52,891 --> 01:04:56,090
but I mean it's just like just that's
one. The one that fit, you know,

1210
01:04:56,100 --> 01:05:00,460
there was like this is matches you and
we're ready to do it. Bam. So now here,

1211
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:01,800
here he is a year later,

1212
01:05:01,801 --> 01:05:06,630
but that guy has like this renewed lease
on life and he just, he glows like a,

1213
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:09,300
like a, like a religious
figures. He got close.

1214
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:13,800
Tell concept for a movie like somebody
who was a male chauvinist all his life

1215
01:05:13,801 --> 01:05:18,150
and shitting on women and then had to get
a woman's heart as a whole. [inaudible]

1216
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:21,780
move yourself. Put Nail Polish. I'm

1217
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:28,750
jealous for no reason. Wow.
Yeah. Interesting. Crazy. Yeah,

1218
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:32,440
it is interesting. It's like that's why
now we're getting to the fuck up thing,

1219
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:35,920
right? Like this idea of there is no
good and bad things just are et cetera.

1220
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:40,780
Right. But like, but there's good and bad
and how the, the energy that you put out,

1221
01:05:40,781 --> 01:05:41,830
how it affects people.

1222
01:05:41,831 --> 01:05:44,750
If you do a bad thing and it
hurts a bunch of people's lives,

1223
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:45,641
that's you're really,

1224
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:48,280
you're changing how those people are
going to interact with all the people they

1225
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:50,310
experience as well.
You fuck up the ecosystem.

1226
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,000
There's a ripple effect
with the ecosystem. Right?

1227
01:05:52,001 --> 01:05:53,860
But like let's say you look
at like you were early,

1228
01:05:53,861 --> 01:05:55,780
we were talking about like bears,
right?

1229
01:05:55,930 --> 01:05:57,750
Or maybe I was watching a clip
of your show, but you're talking,

1230
01:05:57,770 --> 01:05:59,290
I think it was who you and
Duncan and you're like,

1231
01:05:59,291 --> 01:06:03,640
bears really just attract baby animals.
That's what they eat. They eat baby deer,

1232
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:08,720
whatever they can, but the, the most,
most of the baby deer, that dog and Eaton,

1233
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:11,860
they just, they're like animal pedophiles.
They're just killing fucking kids,

1234
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:15,850
right? That's what they do, right?
That's what they fucking do. Coca Cola,

1235
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:20,080
Coca Cola sponsor is an animal
pedophile, just eating baby seals. Right?

1236
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:23,260
So that in our culture
would be a piece of shit.

1237
01:06:23,290 --> 01:06:27,280
What if there was a group of people
that just killed kits? Right?

1238
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:30,100
We would call them pieces of shit.
That would be a bad thing. Right?

1239
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:33,430
But that's just, you've
acknowledged within the, you know,

1240
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:38,230
the ecosystem of that with those
animals, it's necessary, right?

1241
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,100
The bears need to,
how do we know though?

1242
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,810
How do we know there's not fucking
groups of animal rights activists,

1243
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:48,400
animals in the woods saying
he's fucking man video.

1244
01:06:48,410 --> 01:06:51,640
We don't know what these
animals are really talking
about and really discussing,

1245
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:56,350
you know the shark fin soup, Yo
Charlotte, you know what? Shark fin soup.

1246
01:06:56,690 --> 01:06:57,370
So they cut,

1247
01:06:57,370 --> 01:07:00,730
they just cut the fins off the shark and
then they'd let the sharks sink to the

1248
01:07:00,731 --> 01:07:03,640
bottom of the ocean and die and die.
Right. It just sing to them. I can't swim.

1249
01:07:03,641 --> 01:07:07,300
It just sinks to the bottom and there
was somebody tweeting about how horrible

1250
01:07:07,301 --> 01:07:10,270
it is. But I bet there's a bunch of fish
that are pulling up on that shark. Like,

1251
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:13,250
Oh look what we got here.
You know what I mean?

1252
01:07:17,090 --> 01:07:21,250
Right. So say you've been there,
don't just stay there when they see,

1253
01:07:21,251 --> 01:07:24,880
you know they get the fuck on and hit
them and fucking humans with them guns

1254
01:07:24,881 --> 01:07:29,230
again, like I think animals are way
smarter than we give them credit for.

1255
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,530
Well they have instincts. I think they
got a little more than, than things. Some,

1256
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,840
some do, some animals are smart.
You know what's interesting?

1257
01:07:34,841 --> 01:07:37,240
Moose are some of the dumbest,
the dumb as fuck,

1258
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:42,010
but because why so big? Cause who's
gonna take them out? There's so big.

1259
01:07:42,011 --> 01:07:45,160
All they have to do is stomp, stomp
wolves. That's all they have to do.

1260
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:48,640
Wools try to come after him and then
they just came off. If I was a moose,

1261
01:07:48,641 --> 01:07:51,130
I'd beat them too though. Cause I'll
be looking at y'all like y'all dumb.

1262
01:07:51,131 --> 01:07:53,830
Y'All really out here with us. Yeah.
And I just, motherfuckers got the,

1263
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:58,690
you don't have the nerve
to try me shooting at them
more than you're like fuck

1264
01:07:58,691 --> 01:08:02,290
he shot. It's like from game of Thrones.
What that, what's that guy's name?

1265
01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:07,120
Thorn and [inaudible]. No, his Iq,
but I can't imagine. It's incredible.

1266
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:12,550
You think six, nine, 300 pounds.
You've got to figure shit out.

1267
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:15,980
It might not have to, but some dudes
choose to this giant dudes that are

1268
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:20,030
smart as fuck. Small Cox. That's what
level people would like to think.

1269
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:23,280
That's what I have to think. You have
to make yourself feel better. Maybe six,

1270
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:26,480
900 hammer. Always say that about
Shaq. Someone saying that about, oh,

1271
01:08:26,481 --> 01:08:30,080
he's got a little Dick. Uh, compared
to who or no, I ran, I ran, I ran.

1272
01:08:30,081 --> 01:08:31,640
I would compared to a bear

1273
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:35,870
current stuff is book current stuff
and said she had sexual relations with

1274
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:41,200
superhead. She said it's not
little, it's just regular.

1275
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:44,110
So it's like his dick
probably look big on me

1276
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,640
when on shack,
right?

1277
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,130
Like nine inches ain't really big for you.

1278
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:54,150
Shag Chris Rock joke about
the background and he's like,

1279
01:08:54,151 --> 01:08:57,510
I don't have a big Dick but I've got a
small background or something like that

1280
01:08:57,511 --> 01:09:01,170
so it looks like he's so skinny. That
is Dick. Oh, got you. Got You. Got You.

1281
01:09:01,171 --> 01:09:02,910
Got You got to check.

1282
01:09:02,911 --> 01:09:07,020
Needs to come through at the time Warner
remote check the 15 inches on his dick.

1283
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:09,510
Yeah, that should be
set. That boring company.

1284
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:13,450
What does that call Joe the barn
complaining. A lot of flame thrower that,

1285
01:09:13,470 --> 01:09:15,780
that's what shocked me.
Ain't got to disappoint a woman.

1286
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:16,673
I guess what I'm saying it's like,

1287
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:18,190
like with CT Fletcher,
right?

1288
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:22,900
He needed to see death in order to like
have this amazing revelation about life

1289
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:25,930
and maybe the fucked up things
that happened in the world. Right?

1290
01:09:25,931 --> 01:09:28,090
Maybe if there is some sort
of designed to all this,

1291
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:31,390
maybe the fucked up things that happened
in the world allow us to have a little

1292
01:09:31,391 --> 01:09:34,570
bit of empathy and joy
for being able to be here.

1293
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:36,280
But you got to give a fuck
about life first of all,

1294
01:09:36,281 --> 01:09:39,160
because I can think about all
the near death experiences I had,

1295
01:09:39,161 --> 01:09:41,840
whether it was somebody pulling a
gun on me, whether it was, you know,

1296
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:45,700
me being drunk as shit and wrecking my
mom's White Lumina Caravan and literally

1297
01:09:45,701 --> 01:09:48,910
the only reason I survived because I
didn't have a seatbelt on it because I was

1298
01:09:48,911 --> 01:09:51,040
so drunk at the impact didn't kill me.

1299
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:55,570
I didn't think about stuff like that until
decades later when it happened in the

1300
01:09:55,571 --> 01:09:58,270
moment. It was just like, all
right, whatever. I got into a wreck.

1301
01:09:58,330 --> 01:10:00,810
Oh I got a gun pulled on me.
But when you're old and you know,

1302
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:03,160
I've got three daughters and I look at
my wife and I looked at people that love

1303
01:10:03,161 --> 01:10:05,560
and care about me and I really
appreciate and value life.

1304
01:10:05,561 --> 01:10:09,970
Now I started thinking back on that shit
like what the fuck was I think like I

1305
01:10:09,971 --> 01:10:11,890
didn't give a shit about life back then,

1306
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:16,920
but I can get an anxiety attack thinking
about those past moments because those

1307
01:10:16,931 --> 01:10:21,460
past moments would have caused so
much not to happen if I died. Yeah.

1308
01:10:21,461 --> 01:10:22,294
So you've got to care,

1309
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:24,470
you got to care and you have
to have something to care for.

1310
01:10:24,471 --> 01:10:26,720
And that's one of the things that
really changes when you have children.

1311
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:29,990
Oh absolutely. Just change.
Chappelle said the best thing to me,

1312
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:33,680
he said not only did it change
how much I love, he goes,

1313
01:10:33,681 --> 01:10:35,630
it changed my capacity for love.

1314
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:37,330
It teaches you how to love.
Yeah.

1315
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:40,190
You might not even know what real love
is until you have children and you

1316
01:10:40,191 --> 01:10:43,830
realize like, man, this is like my heart
walking around outside my body. Yeah.

1317
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:46,810
And you feel a different level of love
with different level of empathy. Like,

1318
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:48,003
like I remember my,

1319
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:51,740
my daughter had attracted me like two
or three years ago and she was learning

1320
01:10:51,741 --> 01:10:53,690
the long jump and you know,

1321
01:10:53,691 --> 01:10:56,630
it was like the first time she ever
did the long jump. So it was literally,

1322
01:10:56,631 --> 01:10:58,430
it wasn't even a meet with like practice,
right?

1323
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:02,210
And so she goes and do the jump and I
just, I go, oh my God, that was horrible.

1324
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:05,360
And she just burst out into tears.
And I'm like,

1325
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:08,660
well what the fuck did I just do? What
did I say? My wife was like, Yo, what's,

1326
01:11:08,661 --> 01:11:11,390
what's your, what's your problem? And
then other parents would come in like, oh,

1327
01:11:11,391 --> 01:11:14,770
it'll be fine. You did perfectly. I
said the fuck up. She didn't do good,

1328
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:19,900
but I didn't understand that my
word meant everything though.

1329
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:22,300
Her like everything.

1330
01:11:22,301 --> 01:11:26,890
So I just took all her confidence out of
her and just that one snap of a finger

1331
01:11:26,891 --> 01:11:30,370
like fails and that shit, even thinking
about that shit now hurts my heart,

1332
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:33,370
but I've never made that mistake again.
Now I'm the father of that,

1333
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:37,180
that that overly tells
her how great she is.

1334
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:40,870
And I know how to explain to her if she
does something that I necessarily don't

1335
01:11:40,871 --> 01:11:41,561
think it's great.

1336
01:11:41,561 --> 01:11:45,400
I know how to explain it to her in a way
where she can do better and she's very

1337
01:11:45,401 --> 01:11:49,150
receptive to that changes who you are.
You how many kids?

1338
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:52,550
Three daughters too. Oh, you
as a whole in the past life.

1339
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:57,390
Let me see. Go wrong. I'm telling you this
is Carol. You versus meeting right now.

1340
01:11:57,450 --> 01:12:00,160
I swear to [inaudible] girls.

1341
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:04,540
[inaudible] I know,

1342
01:12:04,541 --> 01:12:05,980
I know for my whole,
when I see

1343
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:08,910
about how much it changed,

1344
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:11,790
the way I feel about life is
that when my daughter was little,

1345
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:16,820
there was two bananas and a one of them
was brown and fucked up and old and one

1346
01:12:16,831 --> 01:12:18,120
of them was perfect.

1347
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:21,630
And I looked at those who bananas
and I know my daughter loves bananas,

1348
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:24,780
so she'd probably want that Nice
Banana, I'm sorry, eight that fucked up.

1349
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:29,790
And so while sitting there eating
this mushy mashed potato texture,

1350
01:12:30,241 --> 01:12:33,840
banana, I was thinking about this
and not another person in this world.

1351
01:12:33,841 --> 01:12:37,560
I would do that for because I love my
wife. My wife is an amazing person,

1352
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:41,100
but it was just me and my
wife. I'd be like, Ooh,

1353
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:42,850
I guess that bitch is getting the shit.

1354
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:49,000
You had asked her three times.
You show baby sure you set it on.

1355
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:54,020
The [inaudible] is perfect.

1356
01:12:56,470 --> 01:13:00,130
He just asked the wife three times.
They get it from the start.

1357
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:04,010
You would literally, I'd jump in front
of a bus for her. It's a different thing.

1358
01:13:04,011 --> 01:13:04,850
So like this,

1359
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:09,140
people say I would die for you don't
mean it most of the time unless they're a

1360
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:12,200
Serb soldier who's wanting to
dive in a fucking grenade. Yes.

1361
01:13:12,230 --> 01:13:15,920
But if I could die and I knew that
my kids would be happy and healthy,

1362
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:17,990
but if I lived, they would die. I would.

1363
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:21,020
Dot. I flew out. I flew out.
Uh, I flew out here. I left.

1364
01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:24,770
I left New York five 30 this morning
simply because I was supposed to fly out

1365
01:13:24,771 --> 01:13:28,120
last night, but my daughter had
attract dinner, which I forgot about,

1366
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,930
and it was literally like attract dinner.

1367
01:13:30,931 --> 01:13:35,540
It's in a fucking gym and they're serving
chicken tenders and Lasagna and pizza

1368
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:37,870
and listen to the old town rolled Tinder

1369
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:42,650
different times. Everybody gets
to participate. Participation,

1370
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:45,260
trophy talk, please go
11 places. I'm like,

1371
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:49,290
ah,
but I stayed just to be there.

1372
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:52,410
I changed my flight and everything just
to fly out this morning because I needed

1373
01:13:52,411 --> 01:13:54,810
to be there for that track.
Then that's dope.

1374
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:58,470
You don't do that for people that
you don't absolutely love and adore.

1375
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,610
So here's a question.

1376
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:04,760
You both have these kids and you need to
balance loving them so much and telling

1377
01:14:05,371 --> 01:14:09,240
them to the most amazing people in the
entire world and not making them horrible

1378
01:14:09,241 --> 01:14:10,074
human beings.

1379
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:12,050
Well more than that,
and making them weak

1380
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,110
and not making weak.

1381
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:15,610
You have to give them a diversity or
they'll never know what to do with.

1382
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:17,480
I think sports is the key.

1383
01:14:17,481 --> 01:14:20,870
The key to that make them do not
know that it's difficult. Well,

1384
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:22,780
I know what you're saying
about participation trophies,

1385
01:14:22,781 --> 01:14:26,230
but get them involved in something
competitive where they have to struggle so

1386
01:14:26,231 --> 01:14:28,400
they'll learn what it's like to lose,
to learn what,

1387
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:31,930
what life is like in a kind of controlled
environment and then you can still

1388
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:33,700
nurture them and love them.

1389
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:36,850
The difference between people
who participate in sports
and people don't as you

1390
01:14:36,851 --> 01:14:38,280
learned what losing is.
Yeah.

1391
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:41,530
Some people never learn what losing
is and they just are terrified of it.

1392
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:45,010
But they're not teaching these kids how
to lose no more. Some in schools, schools,

1393
01:14:45,011 --> 01:14:48,310
but I mean like competitive things like
get your kids involved in martial arts,

1394
01:14:48,311 --> 01:14:52,000
get your kids involved in these
things that are just, it's very clear.

1395
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:56,950
The binary one or zero. Either you win or
you lose. Those are important. You learn,

1396
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:00,520
you learn. Like what struggle is if
you have a race riot, attract mates.

1397
01:15:00,521 --> 01:15:04,400
Perfect example. Someone fucking want
and someone did not win. That's it.

1398
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:08,620
You know like who? Oh you got to
cross the line and I'm second. Fuck,

1399
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,990
I gotta be first.
How the fuck can I be first?

1400
01:15:10,991 --> 01:15:14,770
I've got to figure out how to run
fast. That's it. Will you guys ever,

1401
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,500
will you guys ever be
openly disappointed in them?

1402
01:15:17,501 --> 01:15:19,930
Will you show them that they let you down?

1403
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:22,570
The only time I'm that way with my kids,
when they're mean to each other,

1404
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:26,740
I tell them I go, this is unnecessary. I
know while while you're feeling this way,

1405
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:29,710
I know why you're mad at each other.
Be can't be shitty to your sister.

1406
01:15:29,711 --> 01:15:31,990
You can't do that.
It's a bad thing.

1407
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:35,790
You've got to learn how to take a deep
breath and think about the consequences

1408
01:15:35,791 --> 01:15:38,530
of what you're saying and every time you
do do something Shitty, learn from it.

1409
01:15:38,531 --> 01:15:40,930
Yeah. You know it's a learning
experience. I think for me,

1410
01:15:40,931 --> 01:15:43,660
I'm just like that when I, when I think
that there'd be an ungrateful, okay,

1411
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:46,200
am I going, oh my oldest daughter
is 10 my second oldest is three,

1412
01:15:46,201 --> 01:15:47,730
but so she doesn't really understand.

1413
01:15:47,731 --> 01:15:49,620
The concept behind the
daughter is nine months old,

1414
01:15:49,621 --> 01:15:54,621
but my 10 year old is had lived a very
privileged life and sometimes you see

1415
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:57,890
that Bougie shit come out.
And like I'm saying like,

1416
01:15:58,210 --> 01:16:01,710
like little things like,
like I love this island called Angola,

1417
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:04,590
you know what I mean? And we vacation
like two, three times a year.

1418
01:16:04,591 --> 01:16:09,060
Like these long, 10 day vacations,
just like ugh man. Quilla cane. Oh,

1419
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:14,230
you know, we was on the Isle
of, uh, we was on green,

1420
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:17,100
we was in Grenada and her and my niece
because my niece comes with me all the

1421
01:16:17,101 --> 01:16:18,000
time and they're just talking like,

1422
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:21,960
the food is so much better and
cooler than here. I'm like, Yo,

1423
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:22,911
no,

1424
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:27,911
the fuck I was doing when I was
[inaudible] toys on fire and my thanks

1425
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:32,930
[inaudible] road in Moncks corner,
South Carolina,

1426
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:35,970
single wide.
Fucking try to like that.

1427
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:40,290
The only thing that pisses me
off to his lack of gratitude,

1428
01:16:40,291 --> 01:16:41,670
but that's perspective issue though.

1429
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:43,670
They'll never there.
They're wealthy.

1430
01:16:43,671 --> 01:16:45,520
They'll never gonna understand
what it's like to be surprised.

1431
01:16:45,570 --> 01:16:49,460
You instilled that in us. Impossible.
You know, there's gotta be ways Ms Man,

1432
01:16:49,490 --> 01:16:52,500
all of my favorite people
have fucked up childhood,

1433
01:16:53,090 --> 01:16:54,860
but I don't want my kids to have a child.

1434
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:55,970
You're not supposed to.
My mom,

1435
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:59,330
my mom told me we're here to
make our children's lives better.

1436
01:16:59,331 --> 01:17:03,890
Like my mom actually showed me like
my great great grandfather's taxes.

1437
01:17:03,891 --> 01:17:05,660
He had to pay one year and
that she was like a quarter.

1438
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:09,890
What I'm saying like it was just something
to light but back then was a lot of

1439
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:10,610
money.

1440
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:11,690
So she was just saying that to me.

1441
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,480
Just tell me that every generation is
supposed to be better cause I got this

1442
01:17:14,481 --> 01:17:19,481
thing sometimes where I feel guilty
about doing so well cause I don't have no

1443
01:17:19,521 --> 01:17:22,550
fucking skill set. Like I didn't go
to college. You know what I'm saying?

1444
01:17:22,551 --> 01:17:26,690
Like I'm not, I don't feel special. Like
why am I in the position that I'm in?

1445
01:17:26,691 --> 01:17:28,830
My mother was a school
teacher with 30 plus years.

1446
01:17:28,930 --> 01:17:31,130
Most she ever made was $30,000 a year.
So I can line up.

1447
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:32,810
I get that for a fucking appearance.

1448
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:36,440
So it's like that shit will
make you feel bad sometimes.

1449
01:17:36,441 --> 01:17:39,560
Like you'll feel a sense of guilt. So
she was just showing me that to say, Hey,

1450
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:41,840
every generation is supposed to be
better than the next generation.

1451
01:17:41,841 --> 01:17:44,530
So our kids are supposed to
be way better than us. Yeah,

1452
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:47,390
but don't you want to
prepare them for that life?

1453
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:50,450
Like you look at any one of these
movies or even stories about, uh,

1454
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:53,480
a king that took power and
then the son that he has,

1455
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:56,780
Sonny has only some spoiled little
bitch who ruins the kingdom.

1456
01:17:56,850 --> 01:18:00,030
Well, that's the thing. Find me a
great man as a son of a great man,

1457
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:04,980
find me a man who's the son of a
great man who's the son of a great man

1458
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:07,710
because I'm great man. Always has
these weak little sons. And it's like,

1459
01:18:07,711 --> 01:18:11,640
how do you like maybe you do need
to create adversity for your kid.

1460
01:18:11,641 --> 01:18:13,650
Maybe you do need to
be a Dick a little bit,

1461
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:18,120
and maybe it's selfish to be sweet to
your kid all the time because you're not

1462
01:18:18,121 --> 01:18:20,010
preparing them for the
world when you're not there.

1463
01:18:20,730 --> 01:18:23,610
I think you've prepared them for the world
when you let them find their own way.

1464
01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:27,000
Meaning like you got to cut the
cord. Yeah. I don't want my,

1465
01:18:27,001 --> 01:18:30,480
I don't want my daughter to get into
media, you know, if they choose to. Cool.

1466
01:18:30,510 --> 01:18:33,450
You know, my daughter likes the right
now, so she wants to be an author. Fine.

1467
01:18:33,451 --> 01:18:36,570
I'm not loving. I'm not really an
author. I wrote a couple of books,

1468
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:38,220
you know what I'm saying?
When it goes rider,

1469
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:39,253
right.

1470
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:44,910
I think I'm not really an audit.
That's all I want. I want them.

1471
01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:50,340
I want them to find their own way.
When they find their own

1472
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:51,050
wait,

1473
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:54,230
then that gives them that integrity in
that purpose and everything else that

1474
01:18:54,231 --> 01:18:57,160
they're looking for them. I think
when you hand them things, yeah,

1475
01:18:57,230 --> 01:18:58,350
that's when the Eagle,

1476
01:18:58,770 --> 01:19:01,170
all that other shit I have to work for.

1477
01:19:01,171 --> 01:19:05,820
What I see in the communities that I live
in is I always like the rich kids that

1478
01:19:05,821 --> 01:19:08,640
have nannies that take them everywhere
and they don't see their parents very

1479
01:19:08,641 --> 01:19:12,000
much because the parents work all the
time and their parents vacation without

1480
01:19:12,001 --> 01:19:15,030
the kids. They like to go places
without the kids all the time.

1481
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:16,170
You see a lot of that.

1482
01:19:16,410 --> 01:19:18,990
Those kids are getting fucked up
and you see them as they get older,

1483
01:19:18,991 --> 01:19:23,050
they're more and more vacant, more and
more weird. More and more detached. Yes.

1484
01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:23,490
You know,

1485
01:19:23,490 --> 01:19:27,210
but the kids that around the family all
the time and they do things with the

1486
01:19:27,211 --> 01:19:29,290
family, then they get a
richer experience. It's,

1487
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:34,230
it's neglect and it's the parents that
are like super driven and they're never

1488
01:19:34,231 --> 01:19:34,561
home.

1489
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:37,830
They're working 16 hours a day and that's
why they live in this fucking giant

1490
01:19:37,831 --> 01:19:39,390
mansion and drive around in a Bentley.

1491
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:43,080
Like though those kids get fucked up
and they wound up getting on drugs and

1492
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,930
empty and looking for
something to fill them up.

1493
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:48,900
Imagine your parents sent you to
boarding school. I have a buddy of mine,

1494
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:51,270
30 minus Brian County is a,

1495
01:19:51,271 --> 01:19:54,030
his parents sent him to fucking boarding
school in the United States and they

1496
01:19:54,031 --> 01:19:57,510
didn't even live in the United States.
They send him to another country. Jesus,

1497
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:02,550
where's Brian from? I love Brian.
Brian is from all over the world.

1498
01:20:02,551 --> 01:20:07,551
His Dad was a banker and international
banker air quotes and uh,

1499
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:13,010
traveled everywhere and was involved in
some weird foreign shit weapon deals.

1500
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:15,593
We can talk later.

1501
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:20,250
But he was involved in some weird
weird shit and then sent his,

1502
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:21,630
was fucking 13 years old.

1503
01:20:21,631 --> 01:20:24,420
Set Him to the United States to go to
boarding school and Brian to this day,

1504
01:20:24,421 --> 01:20:28,050
still a little shell shocked cause of it
dude. And at your parents send you away.

1505
01:20:28,051 --> 01:20:29,860
You feel like when you're 13 it's,
yeah.

1506
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:33,320
Imagine if he was at that boarding school
and got fucking molested or something.

1507
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:38,340
You would really hate life each
parents molested. No, I'm just saying,

1508
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:44,480
let's just say listen somebody
that's funny. That hasn't been, yeah,

1509
01:20:45,310 --> 01:20:49,200
you got to get that funny diddled in.
Something fucked up happened. Yeah.

1510
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:54,090
If you're fucked up, if you're funny,
something fucked up. Some, some pain,

1511
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:58,710
some struggles. You have to
learn it, you have to learn it.

1512
01:20:58,711 --> 01:21:00,950
Why would you need funny? It's like, it's,

1513
01:21:01,070 --> 01:21:04,200
it's why it's so rare to see
people always say this about women,

1514
01:21:04,201 --> 01:21:07,560
but like even attractive dudes.
Like have you ever seen like a male model?

1515
01:21:07,561 --> 01:21:11,180
That was funny. I was to say about
girls carrot top, unless you fat,

1516
01:21:11,190 --> 01:21:15,780
your stories suck. Real talk. It's
true. Unless you have to earn pussy,

1517
01:21:15,781 --> 01:21:19,150
like lesbians are hilarious.
[inaudible]

1518
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:23,920
right fucking to talk to Tiffany Haddish.
Yes. Tragic is, fuck. Sorry. Yes.

1519
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:28,840
She's not fat. No, no, she's not. But
she had that tragedy. The tragedy. Yeah.

1520
01:21:28,841 --> 01:21:32,780
Yeah. That does. The tragedy is the, that
y'all say being a fat is a tragedy. Yes.

1521
01:21:32,850 --> 01:21:35,100
Oh, for Shit. That's why miss
pat is hilarious because she's,

1522
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,330
that's why.

1523
01:21:43,050 --> 01:21:48,050
That's why you would never want
your kid to become Miss Pat,

1524
01:21:48,121 --> 01:21:50,970
but you love Miss Pat.
He's not miss you.

1525
01:21:50,971 --> 01:21:54,270
Let me spread only because like that's
when you go through that kind of trauma.

1526
01:21:54,271 --> 01:21:57,240
When you come out on the other side,
you're really unstoppable. Yeah.

1527
01:21:57,930 --> 01:22:00,240
Especially when you deal
with what's going on in here,

1528
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:03,180
which is the toughest part, right?
Yeah. I think that's what comedy does.

1529
01:22:03,181 --> 01:22:04,650
Comedy is therapy for a lot of people,

1530
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:09,270
a hundred percent therapy for a lot of
people. It gives you an escape. Well,

1531
01:22:09,271 --> 01:22:13,380
that's why she was able to accept what
that guy did to her and forgive him

1532
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:17,270
because she just, she's passed it.
Yeah, she's on the other side. Yeah.

1533
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:20,220
She's gotten through on the other side
and it forces you to deal with the

1534
01:22:20,221 --> 01:22:21,060
reality of the world.

1535
01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:24,600
Like I think comics better than most
people deal with the reality of the world

1536
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:28,920
and often it's because we went through
some kind of real shit, right? So we go,

1537
01:22:28,921 --> 01:22:32,220
Oh yeah, these things happen so I
can let my mind even operate in it.

1538
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:36,630
When you exist in like a really privileged
life, emotionally and even mentally,

1539
01:22:36,631 --> 01:22:37,920
when you exist in that space,

1540
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:40,320
you don't want to imagine that
there are people starving.

1541
01:22:40,321 --> 01:22:42,600
You don't want to imagine there are
people hungry or that their parents are

1542
01:22:42,601 --> 01:22:44,940
abusing their kids. You don't even want
to go there because you don't have to.

1543
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:47,760
When you grew up in it, you're like, yeah,
that's what the life is. Where's the fun?

1544
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:51,390
My Dad could hit me for shit.
My mom, when you travel,

1545
01:22:51,391 --> 01:22:56,100
you can appreciate where you're going.
Is your daughter's like again,

1546
01:22:56,440 --> 01:23:00,600
he'll go again. I went to
South Africa in December. Um,

1547
01:23:00,690 --> 01:23:02,400
it was like the hundred view of Mandela.

1548
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:05,930
It had been his hundredth
birthday or something like
that and I took my daughter,

1549
01:23:05,970 --> 01:23:06,060
my

1550
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:06,810
10 year old daughter.

1551
01:23:06,810 --> 01:23:10,380
So like a few months later she had a
project in school where she had to do a

1552
01:23:10,381 --> 01:23:15,381
project about Nelson Mandela in South
Africa and so she had printed this picture

1553
01:23:16,261 --> 01:23:20,340
of the Nelson Mandela statute and from
Mandela Square and had it as the cover

1554
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:24,180
and I'm like, where's the picture of you
next to the statue? And she was like,

1555
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:25,230
I don't want to use that.

1556
01:23:25,430 --> 01:23:30,430
What the fuck do you mean you don't want
to use the picture of you standing next

1557
01:23:30,631 --> 01:23:33,930
to the actual statue in
a Nelson Mandela Square?

1558
01:23:33,990 --> 01:23:37,680
That's the point of these
experiences because you're
able to do things like that.

1559
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:40,290
I had to explain that to her.
You have to teach her how to flex,

1560
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:45,470
teach a class on how to
start, Bro. You got a kid now,

1561
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:52,660
but think about how normal that
moment seem to her as she was.

1562
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:56,350
Don't even need to use this as a cover
for my book. I think she's embarrassed.

1563
01:23:56,351 --> 01:24:00,880
You don't think she didn't want the
other kids to be like Kansas rich private

1564
01:24:00,881 --> 01:24:04,510
school in Jersey. All these kids are doing
well or not the kids, but the parents,

1565
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:11,260
all the parents are doing
well. Like, yeah, like what
did I, I yo would you guys,

1566
01:24:11,261 --> 01:24:13,540
you guys got, you guys got
some money and you've got kids.

1567
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:15,220
What'd you guys pay to get
your kid into a good school?

1568
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:16,660
Cool.
Oh,

1569
01:24:16,661 --> 01:24:20,890
like that lady didn't know no fucking
chance actually earn that shit. Yeah.

1570
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:22,810
You got to earn that shit.
You can't do that.

1571
01:24:22,811 --> 01:24:25,000
Cause they're not going to enjoy
it and they're not going to do,

1572
01:24:25,010 --> 01:24:26,540
they're not going to work hard.
Yeah.

1573
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:30,070
Some of those people paid a half a
million dollars. Right. To get up,

1574
01:24:31,130 --> 01:24:35,440
get a Shitty, shitty kid into some
schools that they didn't deserve.

1575
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:38,390
Yeah. And the kid's not going to have
no passion for what they know in,

1576
01:24:38,391 --> 01:24:40,850
you know what I'm saying?
They just dare like they gotta fuck.

1577
01:24:40,851 --> 01:24:42,800
It's just like having a regular
piece of paper like I want,

1578
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:45,590
I want my kids to do things
that they really want to do.

1579
01:24:45,591 --> 01:24:46,730
That's how you change the world.

1580
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:49,730
You change the world when you're doing
things that you, that you want to do.

1581
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,100
Yeah. What's funny, I thought,

1582
01:24:51,101 --> 01:24:55,720
isn't it those kids that went to the
school like did fine at them. So yeah,

1583
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:57,580
so school's just a big fucking hustle.

1584
01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:59,650
It's like if they didn't
earn it based on grades,

1585
01:24:59,651 --> 01:25:01,450
they should feel right the
fuck out of the school.

1586
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:04,720
It's becoming a hustle just because
of the way the world is working.

1587
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:07,460
Jane went to school for audio engineering,

1588
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:10,960
not a Goddamn thing he learned in
school he could use today. Really?

1589
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:13,660
Yeah. Yeah. I mean for the
most part I got the touch.

1590
01:25:13,661 --> 01:25:15,300
Some stuff I could never
have touched before.

1591
01:25:17,090 --> 01:25:17,910
No.

1592
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:22,910
[inaudible] at that time it was,

1593
01:25:24,030 --> 01:25:28,920
it's like 2005 maybe youtube didn't
exist and there wasn't the plethora of

1594
01:25:28,921 --> 01:25:32,050
knowledge out there that 12 year olds
are teaching you how to record audio now.

1595
01:25:32,450 --> 01:25:35,190
Whereas I had to learn from the guy
that was recording mnm and Jay z and all

1596
01:25:35,191 --> 01:25:36,690
these guys, doctor tray. Right.

1597
01:25:36,810 --> 01:25:40,200
Like they can't really do much with that
job either, besides teach it now either.

1598
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:40,990
So

1599
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:44,470
that's why I like the go back to Joel's
point when he said I'm the last and

1600
01:25:44,471 --> 01:25:45,010
radio to reason.

1601
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:48,280
I'm probably the last thing radio is
because I'm the guy that steering people

1602
01:25:48,281 --> 01:25:51,150
away from radio when she's come up to
me and I'm like y'all want to get in the

1603
01:25:51,151 --> 01:25:55,120
radio? I'm like full what? You can
start a fucking podcast and like,

1604
01:25:55,121 --> 01:25:57,580
you know what I'm saying? Like it's
all type of different ways to be heard.

1605
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:00,130
You can go on youtube and if
you want to be a VJ on TV,

1606
01:26:00,131 --> 01:26:04,200
you can start doing your
own video countdown's on
Youtube. Like why you need TV

1607
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:08,220
or radio to do middle man gone. Yeah.
We didn't have any of that growing up.

1608
01:26:08,490 --> 01:26:11,760
I had to be on the radio. You had
to be on radio, you had to be on TV.

1609
01:26:11,761 --> 01:26:12,960
We didn't have that shit

1610
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:13,843
growing up.

1611
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:18,440
Now I'm even experiencing
that with commentary for
the UFC because I love doing

1612
01:26:18,441 --> 01:26:21,650
commentary for the UFC. Be Known. I love
even better. I do these fight companions.

1613
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:23,550
Yes. When you want to get
in here we get hammered.

1614
01:26:23,570 --> 01:26:26,510
He start smoking weed and talking shit
and we watched the fights on the screen.

1615
01:26:26,511 --> 01:26:29,900
We have the best time.
It's way more fun than being there live.

1616
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:33,680
Do you think that's the future
of all live events? Right.

1617
01:26:33,681 --> 01:26:38,681
So you could watch the NBA finals
and instead of listening to the guys,

1618
01:26:38,751 --> 01:26:40,460
you know Marv Albert or whoever do it,

1619
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:44,790
you could choose your guys that
you watch the commentary with. Oh,

1620
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,440
so fight companion for basketball.
Football.

1621
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:50,330
Well Dana Hart was doing
that with Snoop Dogg. He had,

1622
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:54,440
he had a the Tuesday night contender
series and snoop Dogg and Uriah Faber.

1623
01:26:54,441 --> 01:26:58,520
We're doing commentary and snoop would
just have a constant blunt lit and he was

1624
01:26:58,521 --> 01:27:02,450
drinking tankaray and getting
hammered hot and talking crazy shit.

1625
01:27:02,810 --> 01:27:06,410
That was an option for the commentary.
You should listen assumption snoop cast,

1626
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:07,191
it should be right.

1627
01:27:07,191 --> 01:27:10,370
It should be every single one like got
tired of doing it though. Stop doing it.

1628
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:13,750
He'll snoop is thought to be
around Dana White. Ah, it's bright.

1629
01:27:13,790 --> 01:27:17,750
I think he just got tired of
having to be there every Tuesday.

1630
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:21,200
Well that's a beautiful thing.
Like we showed you the, excuse me,

1631
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:23,210
the NBA did this during
the finals this year.

1632
01:27:23,390 --> 01:27:26,150
They tried an alternative stream
using the ESPN APP. Right.

1633
01:27:26,151 --> 01:27:29,510
So the thing about this as you're doing it
with ESPN guys, right? Correct. Correct.

1634
01:27:29,511 --> 01:27:34,511
So it's like what would be great is do
it with like the funniest commentary guys

1635
01:27:34,641 --> 01:27:37,030
that you like in your life.
Hear them too.

1636
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:39,140
Just the reason why people
tune into your thing. Right.

1637
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:43,380
I'd guarantee they'd probably mute the
TV. Right? The people who are watching,

1638
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:46,820
they listen to both.
I think that's what people probably do.

1639
01:27:46,940 --> 01:27:50,840
So they never let the good commentators
commentate anything like Todd Bockley,

1640
01:27:50,850 --> 01:27:51,591
kidneys, movers, shacks.

1641
01:27:51,591 --> 01:27:54,200
You'd be actually commentating dorm
the NBA and it would be incredible.

1642
01:27:54,890 --> 01:27:57,500
It would be incredible for them talking
shit to each other. Matter of fact,

1643
01:27:57,501 --> 01:27:59,900
put them on a little screen in the
bottom so we can actually look at them

1644
01:28:00,050 --> 01:28:02,590
visually what they're doing.
I Dunno, I just think of that

1645
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:06,190
UFC, they have the best guys doing like
Daniel Cormier. He does it and he's great.

1646
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:10,260
Dominick Cruz, Paul Felder, you
know, they have good fighters. Uh,

1647
01:28:10,261 --> 01:28:13,760
Michael Bisping that do commentary
now. Columbia is the best though. Yeah,

1648
01:28:13,761 --> 01:28:16,960
he's great. He's hilarious. Yeah.
And you used to fight fuck gaze.

1649
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:19,160
The heavyweight champion.
He comments.

1650
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:22,980
He's the light heavyweight champion and
then the, he vacated his title and the,

1651
01:28:23,050 --> 01:28:24,980
he's the heavyweight champion.
Yeah, he does commentary.

1652
01:28:24,981 --> 01:28:28,420
We do it all the time together. Wow.
Together. Cause you guys get fucking,

1653
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:32,540
we're also good friends so we're always
talking shit and we're laughing about

1654
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:36,630
things like whether it's a judge who's
a nice lady but a terrible judge Europe.

1655
01:28:36,910 --> 01:28:40,060
But this is like when, when
Rose Nama, une is one the title,

1656
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:43,150
he starts screaming out thug row.
Yeah.

1657
01:28:43,310 --> 01:28:45,860
It's not like you guys turn
into fans. Yeah. Well we are.

1658
01:28:45,970 --> 01:28:48,140
I mean neither one of us
are real professionals,

1659
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:50,270
but we do it for a living and it's weird.

1660
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:51,340
That's my worst nightmare.

1661
01:28:51,341 --> 01:28:55,210
Like to be out somewhere and fucking
get into a argument with an MMA fighter.

1662
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:59,390
You don't realize that name if me
no, don't say, oh she's terminates.

1663
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:02,100
Propel show where he got folded
when keeping it real goes

1664
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:07,050
wrong. When the got to hold
him up. [inaudible] girl.
I'm telling you. Got To chop.

1665
01:29:07,051 --> 01:29:11,730
Forgive you bro. [inaudible] or other
signs other than ears. Here's a good one.

1666
01:29:11,731 --> 01:29:13,770
But, but the thing is you
can wear at your cards.

1667
01:29:13,771 --> 01:29:16,470
I don't have any cauliflower ear.
I have a little bit on this year,

1668
01:29:16,471 --> 01:29:19,590
but I wear ear guards.
Get changes the way you hear things.

1669
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:24,600
You don't want that cauliflower ear the
case your stick out already too much. Oh,

1670
01:29:24,601 --> 01:29:28,930
they would stick out like a bat. Yeah,
you'd have a big old knots and cancer.

1671
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:33,120
There's no other signs of, of what? Of
a guy could be an MMA. No, not really.

1672
01:29:33,130 --> 01:29:36,750
Like hands. What about knuckles? No, I
mean you can tell and not tell. You know?

1673
01:29:36,751 --> 01:29:39,930
It's not. You don't know. See, that's the
way it's gotta be nice to people. Be Nice.

1674
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:42,370
Nice. Are you going to find yourself
in one of those? You got it, Bro.

1675
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:45,550
Fucking Andy Ruiz,
the new high champion.

1676
01:29:46,290 --> 01:29:49,890
[inaudible]

1677
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,540
you look at his body, he would think no
fucking way. And you look at Anthony.

1678
01:29:54,541 --> 01:29:58,600
Joshua was sculpted out of marble.
Ben Thought he was trashed, Bro. Yeah.

1679
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:03,390
It been saying we've Saint Anthony's
hospital was not that guy. Never.

1680
01:30:03,610 --> 01:30:08,070
He never had it. Never. He is
literally Ivan Drago. Literally,

1681
01:30:08,071 --> 01:30:12,390
he's the UK. Ivan Drago. He
looks the part, ladies love him.

1682
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:14,910
He never had that skill in the ring.

1683
01:30:14,911 --> 01:30:17,250
I told him that when he came on breakfast
club. I don't think that's true.

1684
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:20,100
He got dropped by Klitschko and
he came back to knock them out.

1685
01:30:20,101 --> 01:30:23,610
Let's go with [inaudible]. She was a
old ass man dude. And he's Ukrainian.

1686
01:30:23,611 --> 01:30:26,410
He's got Chernobyl and them and shit.
He was seminar.

1687
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:29,580
That's nuclear poisoning and shit.
He was very old.

1688
01:30:29,581 --> 01:30:32,580
He was trying to win an election
for like this, you know, crazy.

1689
01:30:32,581 --> 01:30:34,380
Because she's got a lot of
things going on in his life.

1690
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:37,470
The real fight is to Deontay wilder Tyson.
Fewer to,

1691
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,770
how about this tight security
closest thing we've, we've had, uh,

1692
01:30:40,771 --> 01:30:44,490
in the heavyweight division to Ali. I'm
not going to say, I said after that,

1693
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:47,070
I said a couple of fights.
I think he is the head movement.

1694
01:30:47,071 --> 01:30:50,640
The foot movement at his size and weight.
I leave was doing that 212 pounds.

1695
01:30:50,641 --> 01:30:55,200
His head moves. That last fight was
very Ali, like on an amazing deal,

1696
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:59,760
but Ali did that with George Foreman.
You see there's a difference.

1697
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:04,470
The guy that he was fighting like
that Guy Deontae Deontae he did it,

1698
01:31:04,471 --> 01:31:06,540
but he also got dropped
and almost murdered.

1699
01:31:07,830 --> 01:31:11,700
He died every time I look at 12th round
when Deontae connected and then walked

1700
01:31:11,701 --> 01:31:12,000
back,

1701
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,990
went like that game over and the fact
that he just rose up and then outboxed him

1702
01:31:15,991 --> 01:31:19,470
for the rest of the round when I
was over all those years of therapy.

1703
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:21,300
That's all those years of
therapy and meditation.

1704
01:31:21,301 --> 01:31:22,590
When did he say he hit
him and knocked him out?

1705
01:31:22,591 --> 01:31:24,960
He was in that place of stillness.
Oh, he knows how to come up.

1706
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:31,090
Absolutely chaos. It was chaos are
weird, man. It's like sometimes the,

1707
01:31:31,091 --> 01:31:34,890
the a punch does not look like much
and it drops you and puts you away and

1708
01:31:34,891 --> 01:31:38,670
sometimes you get fucking flat line like
right there and it looks like you're

1709
01:31:38,671 --> 01:31:42,450
over watched. I was amazed at
the ref and gave him a cal,

1710
01:31:42,451 --> 01:31:44,130
thought it was going to call him out.
I thought,

1711
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:46,620
I thought the ref was going to
wave their hands. Meanwhile,

1712
01:31:46,621 --> 01:31:50,100
this motherfucker rises up
and doesn't even look wobbly.
Unbelievable. By the way,

1713
01:31:50,101 --> 01:31:51,900
Anthony,
Joshua can't beat Tyson fury.

1714
01:31:51,930 --> 01:31:55,500
He can't beat Deontae while I know
he can't beat Louis Ortiz. Well,

1715
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:59,890
well I don't have, Louis is all too,
here's a good 90 years old. The word is,

1716
01:31:59,891 --> 01:32:03,270
and I get this from a reliable sources
inside the fight community. Yeah.

1717
01:32:03,271 --> 01:32:07,960
That Anthony Joshua got dropped in
training camp right before the fight. Bad.

1718
01:32:08,030 --> 01:32:12,620
Yeah. From Philly. Right. I
don't know who, but bad to
the point where he was chaos.

1719
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:13,570
Yeah,
essentially.

1720
01:32:13,571 --> 01:32:17,260
And that's why his dad went after
the promoter after the fight was,

1721
01:32:17,261 --> 01:32:19,450
you see his dad's screaming
at the provider in the ring.

1722
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,510
Apparently he was just not, he's
not prepared to fight. And he had,

1723
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:26,100
he was looking bad in the locker
room that they were worried about.

1724
01:32:26,110 --> 01:32:28,590
So we'll totally get a panic attack.
Yeah. That's what I heard too.

1725
01:32:28,740 --> 01:32:31,060
He had a panic attack before
to fight and if you remember,

1726
01:32:31,390 --> 01:32:33,250
we know it took him a
while to come to the ring.

1727
01:32:33,251 --> 01:32:35,740
Like they even played dance music and
everything, but he never came out.

1728
01:32:36,190 --> 01:32:38,260
And I was told that when,
if you notice when he was walking out,

1729
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:40,300
he was rubbing his back and
they were rubbing his head.

1730
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:43,450
I already had a panic attack,
fainting attack.

1731
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,980
If you've been Kao like within a week,
you,

1732
01:32:46,030 --> 01:32:48,400
it takes months to get your
shit back together again.

1733
01:32:48,580 --> 01:32:52,210
The whole world is like shaky
to you. Well, equilibrium's off.

1734
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:55,150
So he was in there and then when he
dropped him, he was like, Jesus Christ,

1735
01:32:55,151 --> 01:32:59,410
can I go get him? No, no. When he
dropped me or whatever, he's like, good,

1736
01:32:59,620 --> 01:33:01,360
we've got it.
Let's get this motherfucker out here.

1737
01:33:01,361 --> 01:33:03,550
And then he went right
at them and then boom,

1738
01:33:03,551 --> 01:33:07,630
he got clipped and then it was over.
There's a, uh, there was a, the biggest,

1739
01:33:07,631 --> 01:33:11,760
what is it? The biggest upside
heavyweight history is typing, right?

1740
01:33:11,890 --> 01:33:16,290
Guess who got dropped and
training camp. Tyson did, did he,

1741
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:19,180
I'm strapped and trends, right? I
forget the guy's name who dropped him,

1742
01:33:19,181 --> 01:33:22,090
but his sparring partner track them
and training camp. There's video of it.

1743
01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:23,770
This video, the Human
Kao. Let me took a knee,

1744
01:33:24,130 --> 01:33:28,240
but still it's like got dropped your
body shut down for a second and it takes

1745
01:33:28,241 --> 01:33:30,520
time to recover from that shit and that
dimension in the night before he was

1746
01:33:30,521 --> 01:33:34,030
fucking a bunch of Japanese women would
Bobbi Brown in the hotel room and doing

1747
01:33:34,031 --> 01:33:37,710
drugs by the fives five at a time.
Take a toll out.

1748
01:33:38,670 --> 01:33:42,880
Yeah. They'll take a toll. Bobby Bobby
said, Mike told him, I'll be right back.

1749
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:45,460
Bobby was like, don't you got to fight
tonight? And he's like, yeah, yeah,

1750
01:33:45,461 --> 01:33:47,290
I'll be right back. I'm going knock
the guy out and I'll be right back.

1751
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:51,610
And he still got up and he
still dropped buster Douglas.

1752
01:33:51,611 --> 01:33:55,930
That's even crazier because you have a
watch the 30 for 30 about Buster Douglas.

1753
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:58,530
No,
they had the 30 for 30 in me.

1754
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:01,670
I didn't realize how much
he dominated Mike Tyson,

1755
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:07,380
like round four round. He was
punishing Mike Tyson. Yep.

1756
01:34:07,780 --> 01:34:09,220
I remember that when I was just a,

1757
01:34:09,221 --> 01:34:13,450
Douglas is like one of the most talented
guys that just didn't have the kind of

1758
01:34:13,451 --> 01:34:17,440
drive and discipline that you needed to
be a champion. But when his mom died,

1759
01:34:17,590 --> 01:34:20,810
mom or dad is mom.
That's what gave him all the drop dead.

1760
01:34:20,811 --> 01:34:25,210
He was hooking off the jab on
Tyson popp like in a beautiful way.

1761
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:28,390
His skill was incredible and wasn't
afraid. It was a world beater.

1762
01:34:28,810 --> 01:34:32,380
He was a world beater in that fund. We
needed the motivation. No, totally feel.

1763
01:34:32,381 --> 01:34:36,770
Fucked him up after that and
yeah, basically done. No, he
didn't. He was done. Yeah,

1764
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:41,450
but he's a, he's infamous.
He beat Mike Tyson when it,

1765
01:34:41,451 --> 01:34:44,560
when it meant something to beat Mike.
I found out about it after the fact.

1766
01:34:44,561 --> 01:34:47,600
I didn't watch the fight live. I had
a Gig that night, not in real time.

1767
01:34:47,650 --> 01:34:50,830
And then I watched it later and I still
was waiting for Tyson to get up and beat

1768
01:34:50,831 --> 01:34:53,710
him. I didn't believe him,
believe it. I remember,

1769
01:34:53,711 --> 01:34:56,320
I remember watching that
fight and in my mind,

1770
01:34:56,321 --> 01:34:58,070
I guess I wasn't really paying attention.
I was just like,

1771
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:01,910
this is longer than most
Tyson fights always so low.

1772
01:35:02,150 --> 01:35:04,910
You can have a dinner
reservation on a Tyson. I'm like,

1773
01:35:04,911 --> 01:35:06,980
and then when you finally got
knocked down, I'm like, Oh shit.

1774
01:35:06,981 --> 01:35:08,990
Mike just laws doesn't
mean you've got to think.

1775
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:11,420
Not only did we grow
watching Mike Fuck people up,

1776
01:35:11,930 --> 01:35:14,380
we grew up trying to beat him
on my Titan Punch. As you say,

1777
01:35:14,570 --> 01:35:18,450
that shit was impossible.
So it's this like dad,

1778
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:20,770
that was an unbelievable moment.
I didn't feel like that we were weeding

1779
01:35:20,830 --> 01:35:23,620
Joshua though.
Well there's certain times of people lose.

1780
01:35:23,621 --> 01:35:24,790
You can't believe they lost.

1781
01:35:24,791 --> 01:35:28,360
Like for me it was Roy Jones when
Tarver knocks him out. I was just like,

1782
01:35:28,450 --> 01:35:32,890
what on fucking White Jones?
They stopped to this day, man.

1783
01:35:33,010 --> 01:35:36,010
Unreal. If you watched in the second
round. It's really interesting thing.

1784
01:35:36,011 --> 01:35:37,420
It happens.
They both,

1785
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:41,800
they both throw hooks and
Tarver just gets there. Yeah.

1786
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:44,500
And we'll Tarver was
actually a south pole rights.

1787
01:35:44,501 --> 01:35:46,630
I think it's his is kind
of like a looping left,

1788
01:35:46,990 --> 01:35:51,040
but they exchange and Tarver
just hits first. Roy timed
it and this, what happens?

1789
01:35:51,041 --> 01:35:54,550
I think when fighters get a little bit
older they lose a fraction of a second

1790
01:35:54,990 --> 01:35:57,280
and that fraction of a second
earlier and Royce career,

1791
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:59,890
he's checking them and then he's
moving out of the way. Well,

1792
01:35:59,891 --> 01:36:04,780
I think the real there is is fine. Do you
see it? Oh look at them. Exchange ready.

1793
01:36:04,781 --> 01:36:09,280
It's an yep. Boom. At one point
it changes everything. Well,

1794
01:36:09,281 --> 01:36:13,990
you know what Tarver coach said that
Tarver beat him in basketball. Yes.

1795
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:18,430
And then when he saw that he beat him in
bed, the bed or after, who was his coach?

1796
01:36:18,450 --> 01:36:22,870
Mcgurk is buddy. Yeah. I
think find that's true.

1797
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:27,220
Did we had, we had Roy on a,
on a on flavor and two and
a, I asked him, I was like,

1798
01:36:27,221 --> 01:36:29,500
were you ever worried about like
getting knocked out in like a, you know,

1799
01:36:29,501 --> 01:36:32,980
losing something, leaving something in
the ring and he takes a second. He goes,

1800
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:33,970
I'll be honest with you,
man.

1801
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:37,360
I didn't come in the rain
with much sense to begin with.

1802
01:36:37,390 --> 01:36:39,130
So I wasn't really worried about losing it

1803
01:36:41,980 --> 01:36:46,390
straight up. I've got a crazy
competitive nature to Roy last,

1804
01:36:46,450 --> 01:36:47,141
was it last year?

1805
01:36:47,141 --> 01:36:50,890
Last year Roy was hitting me because he
really wanted to fight Michael B. Jordan.

1806
01:36:51,190 --> 01:36:52,870
Yeah.
Would be Jordan say that he thinks

1807
01:36:55,300 --> 01:36:57,560
we were talking about
on the podcasts like,

1808
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:01,460
no, I really want to
fight him. Road was like,

1809
01:37:01,461 --> 01:37:03,020
y'all got the sponsors
that can put them money up.

1810
01:37:03,030 --> 01:37:04,520
I think it was like $30 million.

1811
01:37:05,310 --> 01:37:09,900
I made the call for him
and Michael was like, Nah.

1812
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:14,380
He was like, Nah, we good on that. Like,
Yo Roy would fuck Michael B. Jordan. Oh,

1813
01:37:14,410 --> 01:37:17,390
don't let creed fool you. Don't let
fucking kill mom game black pants.

1814
01:37:18,290 --> 01:37:20,240
You still run up on one of
them old boxes right now.

1815
01:37:20,241 --> 01:37:22,740
Muscle memory will get you not them.
Right.

1816
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:24,910
And some would even be close.
So horrific.

1817
01:37:24,940 --> 01:37:27,040
And isn't that what happens
is like some guys start,

1818
01:37:27,130 --> 01:37:29,230
they start fight fighting
or they start to an MNA,

1819
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:31,840
they start doing a little
Brazilian Jujitsu or some
shit like that. Right? Yeah.

1820
01:37:31,841 --> 01:37:33,000
And they put a couple of jokes in it,

1821
01:37:33,010 --> 01:37:37,300
like a safe controlled environment and
you get that like delusional. Yeah.

1822
01:37:37,390 --> 01:37:40,270
Confidence.
And that's why sparring so important.

1823
01:37:40,330 --> 01:37:44,110
Do you remember the first time you guys
sparked? Sure. I'm not the first time.

1824
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:46,570
Well you were doing since
you're a kid, right? Yeah. Okay.

1825
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:49,360
I mean the first time I started
before I went in the ring I was like,

1826
01:37:49,390 --> 01:37:52,840
oh I got this. It's just combos,
whatever. I almost fucking frightened.

1827
01:37:53,890 --> 01:37:57,720
Frightened when the we're coming back.
Yeah. I was just a shell. I just stopped.

1828
01:37:57,750 --> 01:38:00,360
Yeah. Miss bought since the last time I
was born. I swabbed with Shawn Porter.

1829
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:05,910
Really? Yeah. This was nuts.
He was actually throwing
punches. Yeah. Cause I was mad.

1830
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:07,640
But this shit don't mean nothing.
He was dodging.

1831
01:38:08,580 --> 01:38:12,690
I'm surprised he didn't knock your
ass. Hell Bro. And this is one of the,

1832
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,930
there's this guy's head
movement is impeccable them.

1833
01:38:15,210 --> 01:38:17,560
I mean people have tried to tack them
on the street and they missed it every

1834
01:38:17,561 --> 01:38:20,560
single time. Cho, Cho, Cho.

1835
01:38:20,630 --> 01:38:23,790
It's unfucking real cute is what
do you got here? Here it is. This,

1836
01:38:23,791 --> 01:38:27,480
you guys far look at him going forward.

1837
01:38:27,870 --> 01:38:31,470
This is a PR move that's got a
PR move I was trying to show.

1838
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:33,120
I know you're sweating.

1839
01:38:33,690 --> 01:38:38,490
Mm Nah.
That shit is in Brooklyn.

1840
01:38:38,491 --> 01:38:40,590
And you gotta be focused cause
there's people yelling in there.

1841
01:38:40,710 --> 01:38:42,840
You're showing me and got on,
make up.

1842
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:46,930
[inaudible]

1843
01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:50,990
can I get a drop from the army? You
lefthanded? No, I'm right handed.

1844
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,490
I'm just trying to throw him
off a little bit. Really? Yeah.

1845
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:57,300
He did that on purpose, man.
He'll know what he's doing.

1846
01:38:57,301 --> 01:39:01,760
I don't know what the fuck
[inaudible] bouncing word his mind.

1847
01:39:01,780 --> 01:39:03,150
Do you know movement.

1848
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:06,480
Do you train in boxing or are we
just doing this for a goof? Nah,

1849
01:39:06,481 --> 01:39:09,180
I just wanted to go in there and I was
like, fuck it. This is Shawn Porter.

1850
01:39:09,181 --> 01:39:11,280
I'm a boxing fan. I'm like, you
know what's the worst can happen?

1851
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:14,670
You get knocked the fuck out. Worst can
happen. Is these mean? Yeah, you're right.

1852
01:39:15,210 --> 01:39:18,260
That could be terrible. I'm just sitting
there flat footed. Yeah. He's now,

1853
01:39:18,270 --> 01:39:22,040
we not even really and we
went three rounds. Wow.

1854
01:39:22,110 --> 01:39:26,730
That was about to die at the end of
the three rounds bolted a few times.

1855
01:39:27,780 --> 01:39:31,080
That's why I haven't spots.
It's like stay in my fucking lame.

1856
01:39:31,081 --> 01:39:31,501
You know what I mean?

1857
01:39:31,501 --> 01:39:35,700
I hit the punching bag callins bars all
the time and I'm like, Bro, doing? Yeah,

1858
01:39:35,701 --> 01:39:38,240
Brian on that pry can DJ count?

1859
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:42,780
Oh no one person is not doing any cardio.
It's Dj Cally

1860
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:47,850
Ruiz, one cal getting out of
a car with a gun hanging out.

1861
01:39:47,851 --> 01:39:49,170
It's like all the big guys.

1862
01:39:49,171 --> 01:39:53,040
The day after the release was the title
Kaolin Kaolin Kaolin been working out on

1863
01:39:53,041 --> 01:39:55,220
snapchat for a whole year and
didn't lose her motherfucking pants.

1864
01:39:55,550 --> 01:39:58,260
This guy and got a weight watchers deal.
God left the marriage,

1865
01:39:58,261 --> 01:40:02,120
didn't really steal a weight watchers.
I mean we are just watching this weight,

1866
01:40:02,210 --> 01:40:04,110
this plus size models,
right?

1867
01:40:04,111 --> 01:40:07,500
And they're doing that now like Nike and
the Nike store has like a big mannequin,

1868
01:40:07,501 --> 01:40:11,100
like a fat mannequin, but they don't,
they don't have plus size models from men.

1869
01:40:11,150 --> 01:40:14,730
Chill. There's nothing that
enrages me more than fat models.

1870
01:40:15,690 --> 01:40:19,700
There is nothing that enrages
me more than fat for. Okay,

1871
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:23,520
let me just say something. As
a comic, we want attention.

1872
01:40:24,090 --> 01:40:27,210
We don't feel like we deserve it.
So we make you laugh.

1873
01:40:27,270 --> 01:40:32,240
So there's an even exchange. I get my
attention. You get some joy. Okay, actor,

1874
01:40:32,310 --> 01:40:34,800
they want attention and I'm
willing to write the script,

1875
01:40:34,830 --> 01:40:35,880
but they'll memorize some lines.

1876
01:40:35,881 --> 01:40:39,120
So do a little bit of effort to
get the attention. A regular model.

1877
01:40:39,330 --> 01:40:42,840
It least she's willing to lose
weight so that she can be looked at,

1878
01:40:42,990 --> 01:40:45,570
but these fat bitches are just like,
look at me.

1879
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:52,020
Stop using the word bitches in 2019
what the fuck that's, that's a,

1880
01:40:52,021 --> 01:40:53,980
that's the plus sized model

1881
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:55,500
mannequin.
This is the all

1882
01:40:56,150 --> 01:40:57,500
dentist rage.
You guys.

1883
01:40:57,510 --> 01:41:00,150
The only thing I don't like about
that in Rachel that they're like,

1884
01:41:00,151 --> 01:41:05,150
just stare at me. I'm going to eat bread
all day, but you should stare at me.

1885
01:41:05,210 --> 01:41:06,630
The only thing that
bothered me about that,

1886
01:41:06,650 --> 01:41:10,940
that's out of context because that's the
oversize mannequin in workout clothes.

1887
01:41:10,970 --> 01:41:15,410
Right? Right. She's going to
lose the weight. Now she's
trying to lose weight. Okay,

1888
01:41:15,411 --> 01:41:17,780
so I need needed some context.
This is workout gear.

1889
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:21,170
So overweight women who want to go
lose weight. Cool. Other than that,

1890
01:41:21,171 --> 01:41:24,080
why are you wearing workout gear?
Because she's trying to lose weight.

1891
01:41:24,081 --> 01:41:26,810
That's the only reason you'd be
wearing it. She, she even bigger,

1892
01:41:26,811 --> 01:41:29,280
if she didn't work out,
she like Allen.

1893
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:32,060
Cal didn't Jay,
Jay,

1894
01:41:40,190 --> 01:41:44,280
you gotta have a Dj Khaled
level of annoyance to succeed
in life though, do you?

1895
01:41:44,330 --> 01:41:44,920
Yes you do.

1896
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:49,030
Oh, wait, you do? You do so much.

1897
01:41:49,860 --> 01:41:53,260
It's so much in your fucking shirt.

1898
01:41:53,261 --> 01:41:57,010
He's the no way. You didn't know
you could button your shirt.

1899
01:41:57,011 --> 01:42:00,100
He's the epitome of not being
afraid to ask for things,

1900
01:42:00,101 --> 01:42:04,630
but it looks like French toast.
Jesus. Every time I look at him,

1901
01:42:04,780 --> 01:42:07,660
it's French toast and he has no,

1902
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:11,650
Oh cal it minus the butter
and the maple syrup. It

1903
01:42:11,690 --> 01:42:16,550
says the lost 15 kilograms. What does
that 34 pounds? Yeah. Yeah. There you go.

1904
01:42:16,551 --> 01:42:20,330
Lost 34 pounds. Listen, congratulates.
You can see his dick now. Congratulations.

1905
01:42:20,810 --> 01:42:23,120
Slimmer on the ride. He does
look a little slimmer. Oh, okay.

1906
01:42:23,121 --> 01:42:28,090
Maybe it's a little bit rose Christ's.
I don't even know what that is. Our,

1907
01:42:28,091 --> 01:42:31,110
we watch her. I respect that
cal came from radio. Oh Dude.

1908
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:34,840
Cal came from Radio College, used
to do 12 midnight to 2:00 AM, uh,

1909
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:38,330
on weekends at w Edr and Miami,
if I'm not mistaken.

1910
01:42:38,331 --> 01:42:42,500
He used to do Friday and Saturday night
and then that was like 15 years ago.

1911
01:42:42,710 --> 01:42:46,300
Right. So radio is a lot like comedy
in a way. Right. And not like this,

1912
01:42:46,310 --> 01:42:50,060
like a sort of a
fellowship of radio people.

1913
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:52,880
You respect people who
did it. Yeah. It's so,

1914
01:42:53,060 --> 01:42:55,670
it's so few and far between that actually,

1915
01:42:56,030 --> 01:43:00,590
I guess make it so to speak that
you know who those players are.

1916
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:03,860
You know what I'm saying?
So yeah, in a way. Yeah.

1917
01:43:03,861 --> 01:43:06,140
And there's so few like national ones,

1918
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:11,030
like who's like nationally
known radio guys, Elvis Duran,

1919
01:43:11,270 --> 01:43:16,120
there's maybe a dozen. Um,
you, Elvis, Bobby, Tom,

1920
01:43:16,260 --> 01:43:21,080
us. Tom Is retiring this year. What about
Steve? Is Steve National TV national?

1921
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:22,080
Obviously those,

1922
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:24,890
and I respect Steve and I respect Ryan
Seacrest and I don't really count those

1923
01:43:24,891 --> 01:43:26,780
guys cause they didn't start in radio.

1924
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:30,800
They in grassroots cause didn't start
in radio, wasn't he on own radio guy?

1925
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:35,420
Dan have no, a radio guy a lot. I did
his radio show in the nineties. Okay.

1926
01:43:35,450 --> 01:43:38,820
So he might've, he might've been
none. He doesn't tell him on the show.

1927
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:42,650
He doesn't radio five
jobs from American idol.

1928
01:43:42,810 --> 01:43:46,670
He does radio day. Yeah,
it does it in the morning.

1929
01:43:46,671 --> 01:43:50,780
And he does that secretary radio.
What do you like it like, hey,

1930
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:52,370
you're the one who won,

1931
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:56,060
you know, come on be thing like that kind
of shit. Why don't we run is never off.

1932
01:43:56,580 --> 01:43:58,150
No, we work for the same company. I heard,

1933
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:02,570
I've seen Ryan walked out the bathroom
like he's walking on stage to introduce

1934
01:44:02,571 --> 01:44:05,960
the next guest on American idol.
Like he's always on.

1935
01:44:05,961 --> 01:44:08,650
Like how is a perfect example
where like you're gay?

1936
01:44:08,651 --> 01:44:11,420
Rumors trumped tear me to rumors.
What happened?

1937
01:44:11,450 --> 01:44:14,900
Remember when he called the me too and
like a girl said that he meets who'd or

1938
01:44:14,901 --> 01:44:17,030
whatever and then a girl who worked
with right, something like that.

1939
01:44:17,031 --> 01:44:21,620
And then everybody was like the gay guy.
Okay,

1940
01:44:21,630 --> 01:44:26,320
sure. He's, he's not
okay. What is he know?

1941
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:29,690
What is he, what do you call it? I
don't know. Ryan is one of those people.

1942
01:44:30,380 --> 01:44:33,860
He is a handsome, those fucking teeth.
But you don't think about sex with him.

1943
01:44:34,370 --> 01:44:39,260
So what is he right out with a letter.
So what? ASEXUAL sexual, sexual. Oh,

1944
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:43,880
that's the old, it's a
positive. Positive. Is Oh,

1945
01:44:43,881 --> 01:44:48,860
closet to he's, oh, he's like, oh,
you don't fuck dudes or chicks.

1946
01:44:48,890 --> 01:44:52,850
Okay. I see what it is. Yeah.
He's always on. I've, I've, uh,

1947
01:44:52,910 --> 01:44:56,510
can you imagine him choking the
girl? No, no. Absolutely not.

1948
01:44:56,660 --> 01:44:58,460
I can imagine she's beating him to death.

1949
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:04,670
[inaudible] down in the
middle of Bolivia, right.

1950
01:45:04,671 --> 01:45:08,060
Is One of those people that when you hear
something about him, you'd be like, Nah,

1951
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:09,620
not right.
You know what I'm saying?

1952
01:45:09,621 --> 01:45:12,590
Like you have that kind of personality
was actually worked in a lot of people's

1953
01:45:12,591 --> 01:45:15,170
favorite. Yeah. What's
great for top 40 radio?

1954
01:45:15,510 --> 01:45:19,310
It's great for secretaries that call
in. Yes. You're the seven color.

1955
01:45:19,340 --> 01:45:23,660
Congratulations. What'd you think
about the finals of game of Thrones?

1956
01:45:29,030 --> 01:45:31,190
That kind of

1957
01:45:32,990 --> 01:45:36,360
shit that some people thrive in that,

1958
01:45:36,710 --> 01:45:41,710
that frequency so good at being like
authentic in the most inauthentic

1959
01:45:42,321 --> 01:45:44,810
situations.
Explain like,

1960
01:45:44,980 --> 01:45:48,500
like hosting a show is why like America's
got talent, all that kind of stuff.

1961
01:45:48,501 --> 01:45:51,620
When you've got to be like really excited
about somebody like juggling deldot's

1962
01:45:51,621 --> 01:45:54,110
or some shit that's really inauthentic,

1963
01:45:54,350 --> 01:45:57,300
but he kind of comes across as believable,

1964
01:45:57,310 --> 01:46:01,100
like sincere that matter,
meaning like this.

1965
01:46:01,101 --> 01:46:03,350
His reactions and knows moments matter.

1966
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:07,980
I just [inaudible] care that no one cares.

1967
01:46:08,270 --> 01:46:12,380
Chief man, that's a pretty man.
He's America's host. He is, yeah.

1968
01:46:12,381 --> 01:46:17,240
He's America's holes man. He said host
some den in that slot, that's for sure.

1969
01:46:17,870 --> 01:46:20,870
Big.
The Rowan's say what did put him on Clark?

1970
01:46:25,420 --> 01:46:29,960
Does he do the New Year's countdown now?
I've got a lot of jobs, man. Listen,

1971
01:46:29,961 --> 01:46:32,900
they was [inaudible] they was probably
in Dick's Kopeks cops up for like 10

1972
01:46:32,901 --> 01:46:35,210
years before they finally say,
Ryan, just do it yourself.

1973
01:46:35,211 --> 01:46:38,390
Right when he had a stroke and he was
still do it. Not that your dick been dead,

1974
01:46:38,391 --> 01:46:42,400
Bro. Wait, he had a stroke. He was doing
out the side of his mouth, like to phase.

1975
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:44,780
He was struggling.
He was definitely struggling to talk.

1976
01:46:44,781 --> 01:46:49,200
I said it was so they kept them bad. Yeah,
like they, and it went from he would it,

1977
01:46:49,201 --> 01:46:50,100
but then it was just like they would

1978
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:53,580
pop in on him and like some studio and
he'd be like sitting there struggling and

1979
01:46:53,581 --> 01:46:57,990
talking. I'm like, why do they keep
willing Dick Clark out for New Year's Eve?

1980
01:46:58,050 --> 01:47:02,400
Like you're actually depressing
people before the ball drops. Oh,

1981
01:47:02,610 --> 01:47:05,370
and then they had Kathy
Griffin and Anderson Cooper.

1982
01:47:05,371 --> 01:47:09,100
That was a great combination.
It annoys me. No Man can

1983
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:16,050
shut up. I love Kathy Griffin. She
enrages me. Just like the fat model,

1984
01:47:16,350 --> 01:47:19,320
Kathy, because Kathy don't give a shit. I
like Kathy would the same reason I like,

1985
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:21,480
I used to like join rooms. I mean,
I say used to because she's dead,

1986
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:25,350
but I mean like, oh no. John Legend,
they both didn't give a shit.

1987
01:47:25,351 --> 01:47:26,670
They will cut from the same cloth.

1988
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:30,750
I don't know if they're cut from
the same cloth. So man, I think so.

1989
01:47:30,751 --> 01:47:32,550
I used to love Anderson
and Kathy Griffin together.

1990
01:47:35,250 --> 01:47:36,210
You've never heard anybody say that

1991
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:44,360
you're guilty pleasures.
Anderson Cooper and cat.

1992
01:47:44,690 --> 01:47:45,720
Look at that chemistry.

1993
01:47:47,090 --> 01:47:51,340
You breakfast club. Now I'm saying she
cut. She cut Trump's fucking head off.

1994
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:53,920
That was, that was a strange
thing that would change.

1995
01:47:54,190 --> 01:47:57,310
What was strange about it is the fact
that she didn't think she was going to

1996
01:47:57,311 --> 01:48:00,880
suffer any consequences from that.
I think people forget that Donald Trump,

1997
01:48:01,150 --> 01:48:04,810
even though he is the ex
executive producer of celebrity
apprentice and he was a

1998
01:48:04,811 --> 01:48:08,530
reality star, he's the president
of the United States of America.

1999
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:12,670
It's rules about threatening
heads of state. Yeah.

2000
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:16,280
That you just can't do things like that.
But it's hard.

2001
01:48:16,510 --> 01:48:20,010
It's almost like a fucking flavor
flavor became president. Right.

2002
01:48:20,030 --> 01:48:23,470
And it would be hard for you to look at
him as anything other than flavor flavor,

2003
01:48:23,770 --> 01:48:26,860
but you better respect his position
before those God damn minutes suits come

2004
01:48:26,861 --> 01:48:29,260
knock on your fucking door
at flavor becomes president.

2005
01:48:29,530 --> 01:48:33,310
Well Donald's the first guy who was
famous like other than Ronald Reagan,

2006
01:48:33,370 --> 01:48:37,690
I guess Ronald Reagan was famous as an
actor, apparently. Really famous, famous.

2007
01:48:38,180 --> 01:48:39,430
I don't think he was famous,
famous.

2008
01:48:41,490 --> 01:48:45,790
He was in big movies and then to the
governor of California. You know,

2009
01:48:46,780 --> 01:48:48,130
it's a weird one,
right?

2010
01:48:48,131 --> 01:48:52,900
I mean just having a famous person in a
popularity contest is strange cause you

2011
01:48:52,901 --> 01:48:54,280
got a built in advantage.

2012
01:48:55,120 --> 01:48:57,200
That's how all of them are going
to visit popularity contracts.

2013
01:48:57,560 --> 01:48:59,660
Not all of them are going to be
moving forward. Someone could say.

2014
01:48:59,770 --> 01:49:02,170
Some people might say Obama was
the first celebrity president.

2015
01:49:02,380 --> 01:49:06,820
He became a celebrity though.
I don't think he was one
before now. No, absolutely.

2016
01:49:06,910 --> 01:49:10,330
I think there was some, Nah, not
Trump is on a different level.

2017
01:49:11,290 --> 01:49:15,280
Domino's commercials, Bro. He has Trump
had rap songs named after him like,

2018
01:49:15,281 --> 01:49:19,660
hey Caroline. Yeah, an
airline. I'm fucking hotel.

2019
01:49:19,661 --> 01:49:24,160
I'd show him is on buildings all
across the world. Giant Trump letters.

2020
01:49:24,161 --> 01:49:26,560
He was a brand troubles.
He might not have been the first thought.

2021
01:49:26,610 --> 01:49:29,050
Trump was the first brand
to run for president.

2022
01:49:29,050 --> 01:49:31,980
Reagan might've been the first star.
Trump was the first brand,

2023
01:49:32,050 --> 01:49:33,590
but he was definitely a
bigger star than Reagan.

2024
01:49:33,591 --> 01:49:35,920
I think easily it's
Megan is before our time.

2025
01:49:35,921 --> 01:49:38,290
It's hard to understand what it
was like when he was a movie star,

2026
01:49:38,291 --> 01:49:39,520
but I don't call it,

2027
01:49:39,580 --> 01:49:42,670
it's called Betty White and after
it's up to how big is still alive?

2028
01:49:42,810 --> 01:49:46,030
She's still alive. Still kicking,
checking. Do we have to like,

2029
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:49,750
do you have these people's Joe?
I don't have her number. Okay.

2030
01:49:49,930 --> 01:49:53,730
Was anybody in a while? You become
famous. You get on a Rolodex like here,

2031
01:49:53,860 --> 01:49:57,340
here's a list of all these
famous Keanu Reeves, Betty White,

2032
01:49:57,370 --> 01:49:59,290
some famous people where I
texted him and I call him.

2033
01:49:59,291 --> 01:50:03,490
I'm just like this so strange.
[inaudible] feel like that. Mm.

2034
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:07,420
Steven Tyler's a weird one from Aerosmith
and text each other and I'm like, Huh,

2035
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:11,460
okay. All right. That's the most
surreal feeling that while it was weird,

2036
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:14,320
I never get youth today. No.
It's humbling though. Yeah,

2037
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:19,680
but that's why I always say
I don't, I don't do shit. I
got no wait. I talk. Right.

2038
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:21,220
I know people who have real talent

2039
01:50:22,820 --> 01:50:26,800
actually looked up to growing up that
people like about you is that you

2040
01:50:26,801 --> 01:50:30,340
recognize that in yourself.
Yeah. You know that you're not,

2041
01:50:30,850 --> 01:50:33,580
you're not oblivious to that.
You're not delusional. I mean,

2042
01:50:33,581 --> 01:50:35,250
I kind of wanted the room to be
like, well, no, you are talents.

2043
01:50:35,310 --> 01:50:40,310
[inaudible] you weren't fucking normal.

2044
01:50:43,700 --> 01:50:48,700
[inaudible] just double
down on [inaudible]

2045
01:50:53,260 --> 01:50:57,790
let's change it. Came up a little
bit like that in that regard.

2046
01:50:59,040 --> 01:50:59,220
For

2047
01:50:59,220 --> 01:51:02,600
people listening, they want to
know that, you know, you know the,

2048
01:51:02,610 --> 01:51:06,840
you can't play musical instruments
sing or do something crazy.

2049
01:51:07,060 --> 01:51:10,770
They want to feel like reflected like
often, often at times I think they had a,

2050
01:51:10,771 --> 01:51:12,600
your audience resonates to you like that.

2051
01:51:12,601 --> 01:51:15,480
It's like you are asking a lot of times
the questions that they would love to

2052
01:51:15,481 --> 01:51:17,550
ask people. When I,
when I listened to you,

2053
01:51:17,610 --> 01:51:20,760
I hear somebody who is still a fan
and that's how I, that's how I feel.

2054
01:51:20,761 --> 01:51:25,140
Like I'm curious, I'm curious. I
have a curiosity about things and,

2055
01:51:25,460 --> 01:51:29,240
and I'm not afraid to, I don't, I don't
know shit I don't have, yeah, I don't,

2056
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:32,640
I just got some experiences. I'm not
an expert at nothing. Everybody did.

2057
01:51:32,641 --> 01:51:36,060
I sit across from is way smarter
than me and I'm fine with that.

2058
01:51:36,270 --> 01:51:39,860
Let's have a conversation I want to learn.
That's good. That's no, that's what,

2059
01:51:39,870 --> 01:51:42,720
that's probably why you're successful is
the way to thing where people be like,

2060
01:51:42,721 --> 01:51:44,940
oh,
I can't believe you would say.

2061
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,850
You would ask you Elizabeth Warren
about her native American ancestors.

2062
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:52,350
Did you see that? What do
you call the original, well,

2063
01:51:52,970 --> 01:51:56,230
Rachel's by now too, but did you see
the interview with him and, and uh,

2064
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:59,210
Elizabeth Warren? Yes. He calls her out
on the native American Shit. But you know,

2065
01:51:59,220 --> 01:52:00,600
here's the weird thing about her.

2066
01:52:00,630 --> 01:52:03,690
It's like I don't necessarily think she
told the truth in that interview and I

2067
01:52:03,691 --> 01:52:07,560
don't know how she did away with it when
she said that the Boston Globe did an

2068
01:52:07,561 --> 01:52:09,770
investigation.
They said that she didn't it,

2069
01:52:10,110 --> 01:52:13,170
she didn't in any way profit off
of that or have an advantage.

2070
01:52:14,130 --> 01:52:18,300
She got hired for apart from Harvard and
she wrote native American on a resume.

2071
01:52:18,540 --> 01:52:22,950
Like they hired her based on her at this
city. Yeah. Yeah. She's a liar. Yeah.

2072
01:52:22,951 --> 01:52:23,784
That's a lie.

2073
01:52:24,120 --> 01:52:27,010
Which is fine cause I don't have no
problem with my politicians lying.

2074
01:52:27,011 --> 01:52:27,900
They do it all the time.

2075
01:52:27,930 --> 01:52:31,410
But I want you to acknowledge your
lie and hold yourself accountable.

2076
01:52:31,411 --> 01:52:34,230
Like none of this shit is disqualified.
It's not the eighties anymore.

2077
01:52:34,231 --> 01:52:38,570
It's not the 90s where shit like that
ruins you. Just be honest. Like, look,

2078
01:52:38,790 --> 01:52:41,760
I'm American. I've cheated
before. I've taken shortcuts.

2079
01:52:41,761 --> 01:52:44,970
I fucking used to put the cheat code in
Mike Tyson all the time just to get Mike

2080
01:52:44,970 --> 01:52:47,500
Tyson, give everybody else.
That's what we're based on.

2081
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:50,470
So if she did that at some point in her
life, was it a horrible thing to do?

2082
01:52:50,471 --> 01:52:52,870
Absolutely. Does it make it a title for
her? Make her a terrible person for ever?

2083
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:56,920
No, I buy what you saying though that
she was told that she was native American

2084
01:52:56,921 --> 01:53:00,130
because many people were and then they
find out when they get a DNA test at this

2085
01:53:00,131 --> 01:53:01,180
time.
Didn't happen to you,

2086
01:53:02,440 --> 01:53:05,610
didn't have to you? Well it hasn't
been disproven yet, but yeah.

2087
01:53:05,890 --> 01:53:07,380
What are you native American?
Yeah.

2088
01:53:07,381 --> 01:53:10,470
It was like growing up around
the time I was going to college.

2089
01:53:10,530 --> 01:53:13,140
My it guy that works with
my dad found out that he,

2090
01:53:13,180 --> 01:53:15,130
he like filed the paperwork to,

2091
01:53:15,170 --> 01:53:18,690
to his college 10 years after the
fact and got a bunch of money back.

2092
01:53:19,140 --> 01:53:20,730
And so my dad's like, well,
we're native American.

2093
01:53:20,731 --> 01:53:24,000
That's what we've been told our whole
time. So we're trying to prove it right.

2094
01:53:24,090 --> 01:53:26,580
Birth certificates and whatnot.
And it's really hard to,

2095
01:53:26,581 --> 01:53:28,830
because they didn't keep a lot
of information back then. Right.

2096
01:53:28,860 --> 01:53:32,610
So I put it on an application,
got into Ohio state that way,

2097
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:37,170
caught them and it was real weird when
I was in like the minority, uh, hauling.

2098
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:39,210
There's like on the orientation day,
they was like,

2099
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:41,550
they gave me a letter to
say show, but this, uh, like

2100
01:53:41,660 --> 01:53:44,010
you pulled out me and Elizabeth,
you got your photo.

2101
01:53:44,680 --> 01:53:48,740
That's exactly what might have, I didn't
take a position from a hardworking,

2102
01:53:48,860 --> 01:53:51,170
exactly.
Cherokee kid did it in good faith.

2103
01:53:51,250 --> 01:53:53,260
I did. I had no idea. And
it was the first time,

2104
01:53:53,261 --> 01:53:55,570
just like when I sit him application
and it was like, what's your race?

2105
01:53:55,580 --> 01:53:56,320
I was like,

2106
01:53:56,320 --> 01:54:00,490
I just found out I'm native American I
guess so I'm going to put that and no one

2107
01:54:00,491 --> 01:54:04,060
checked. No one asked. That's hilarious
that people notice it. Yeah. I,

2108
01:54:04,270 --> 01:54:05,380
I didn't know I was doing anything wrong.

2109
01:54:06,130 --> 01:54:10,070
The w the wild thing about that is like,
that that conversation was like,

2110
01:54:10,071 --> 01:54:11,330
people would ask me why I said that.
I'm like,

2111
01:54:11,331 --> 01:54:14,420
I'm just too dumb to know that that wasn't
a question I wasn't supposed to ask.

2112
01:54:14,421 --> 01:54:18,820
If you were supposed to ask
that [inaudible] having a
conversation. Yeah, I did.

2113
01:54:18,870 --> 01:54:23,120
You're not as ridiculous. That's a huge
thing. We need to find out how she reacts.

2114
01:54:23,121 --> 01:54:26,540
The fact that she told a lie cause
the rest of her life is her family.

2115
01:54:26,570 --> 01:54:29,120
Did that fuck up the whole lineage.
Ditto.

2116
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:31,730
Family Start Tearing Shit down
off the wall like, oh my God,

2117
01:54:31,731 --> 01:54:32,650
we're not native American.

2118
01:54:32,670 --> 01:54:37,220
How many dream catchers were in the
garbage that we can talk some saying holy

2119
01:54:37,221 --> 01:54:40,100
shit,
just feather sticking out a hefty bags.

2120
01:54:40,750 --> 01:54:43,790
Once she learns that the whole family
have to realize that we're not native

2121
01:54:43,791 --> 01:54:44,210
American.

2122
01:54:44,210 --> 01:54:47,870
I had to fuck up some family reunions
or had to fuck up some tradition too.

2123
01:54:48,020 --> 01:54:51,170
Oh my Lord. There's a lot of people who
were shaking their head after that one.

2124
01:54:51,710 --> 01:54:53,750
She actually got the DNA test.
Okay.

2125
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:56,690
Can we talk about how fucked up
Ticketmaster is real quick? Yeah.

2126
01:54:56,691 --> 01:54:58,380
You went through and talked
about the dealing Maltitol.

2127
01:54:58,460 --> 01:55:01,070
I just figured out it just put
my mind to get on this thing.

2128
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:04,910
There's a text he sent me. Oh
my God. Model Ticketmaster.

2129
01:55:05,110 --> 01:55:07,870
We're going to take them all down.
Okay, so take a master. You know what?

2130
01:55:07,871 --> 01:55:10,460
The place where you buy tickets. I had
no clue about this ticket master thing.

2131
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:12,500
I'm just starting to do some
theaters and shit on the tour.

2132
01:55:12,501 --> 01:55:14,450
So I'm starting to look at
like what they charge to do.

2133
01:55:14,451 --> 01:55:17,600
Like the processing and
servicing, right? You buy,

2134
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:21,590
it's like a 30 or $40 ticket. I
looked at yours, 40 odd tickets.

2135
01:55:21,860 --> 01:55:26,090
$16 in servicing for a service charge.
Yeah.

2136
01:55:26,570 --> 01:55:29,080
Is it per ticket? Personal
fucking tickets. We got it.

2137
01:55:29,090 --> 01:55:33,320
They got to pay 40% don't they gotta pay
for Shit in a venue? Like no you don't.

2138
01:55:33,321 --> 01:55:35,390
That's the venue cost
that you also got to pay.

2139
01:55:35,750 --> 01:55:38,270
It's just a process that ticket and if
you want to pick it up and we'll call

2140
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:42,950
another $3 it's unfathomable, right?
So I'm starting to think I'm going,

2141
01:55:43,590 --> 01:55:44,070
okay.

2142
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:45,870
So for the first time in my life I'm like,
okay,

2143
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:48,270
I'm selling some tickets and everything's
good and I'm just getting a piece of

2144
01:55:48,271 --> 01:55:51,360
the door so I'm happy. Right. And my
boy who's like this genius fucking kid,

2145
01:55:51,361 --> 01:55:54,690
Oj Nigerian, all these
Nigerians are geniuses. And
he comes up to me. He's like,

2146
01:55:54,780 --> 01:55:57,080
okay, but what about the
processing fee for Ticketmaster?

2147
01:55:57,120 --> 01:55:59,250
How much are you getting off of
that? And I go, what is like,

2148
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:01,740
what percentage are you getting off
of that? I go, nothing. He goes, wait,

2149
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:03,720
but you're bringing all the tickets sales.

2150
01:56:03,810 --> 01:56:07,080
Why aren't you getting a piece of it's
40% of your ticket price? And I'm like,

2151
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:08,010
well I don't know.
And he goes,

2152
01:56:08,220 --> 01:56:10,770
and what about the data from the tickets
being sold? Are you getting that? I go,

2153
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:15,690
no. He goes, hold on. So they're fucking
you and getting paid to fuck you.

2154
01:56:16,290 --> 01:56:18,870
I go, what do you mean? He
goes, the game is data. Now,

2155
01:56:18,900 --> 01:56:22,170
any businesses successful right now
was all about data acquisition, right?

2156
01:56:22,230 --> 01:56:25,650
Any business and data is not how
many followers we have on Instagram.

2157
01:56:25,651 --> 01:56:27,300
Because they could take your
account away in a second.

2158
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:30,090
How many subs that you get on Youtube?
Cause they could throttle your search.

2159
01:56:30,091 --> 01:56:33,600
We can see that happen all the time.
It's direct connect to fan. Right?

2160
01:56:34,020 --> 01:56:37,860
And what Ticketmaster has done
is they're your ticketing site.

2161
01:56:37,890 --> 01:56:41,220
They get your email, they get your
data set, they get all your fans,

2162
01:56:41,221 --> 01:56:42,510
they know exactly who your fans are.

2163
01:56:42,700 --> 01:56:45,810
May email them and tell them when you're
coming into town or when somebody else,

2164
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:47,720
they might like this like you.
Exactly,

2165
01:56:47,850 --> 01:56:49,560
and then they're getting paid
an absorbent amount of money.

2166
01:56:49,590 --> 01:56:51,270
They're fucking over the fans on it.
So I'm like,

2167
01:56:51,450 --> 01:56:52,520
I'm talking to him and he's like,
Yo,

2168
01:56:52,521 --> 01:56:53,820
we've got to just create
another one of these.

2169
01:56:53,940 --> 01:56:57,000
We've got to create another system
that gives all that data to the comic.

2170
01:56:57,420 --> 01:56:58,890
Why is the middle man even there?

2171
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:04,110
We could create a way cheaper ticketing
service that gives every one of those

2172
01:57:04,111 --> 01:57:06,870
emails to a comic and it's like comics
used to do back in the days by putting a

2173
01:57:06,871 --> 01:57:09,390
comment cards on the tables and
you collect them afterwards.

2174
01:57:09,570 --> 01:57:12,690
You can have an email list for every
time you go to Idaho and email lists for

2175
01:57:12,691 --> 01:57:15,640
every time you go to New Jersey and email
lists for all these different prices

2176
01:57:16,050 --> 01:57:19,440
the most authors do. And Kevin Hart,
Kevin Hart, Kevin Hart came up,

2177
01:57:19,441 --> 01:57:21,930
Kevin Hall was going into all of
these comedy clubs and he was getting

2178
01:57:21,990 --> 01:57:23,730
everybody's mother fucking email.

2179
01:57:23,731 --> 01:57:27,090
And people wonder why whenever Kevin
would launch on these social media sites,

2180
01:57:27,091 --> 01:57:30,960
he'd get all of these crazy followers
immediately is because of that road work

2181
01:57:30,961 --> 01:57:34,890
you put in in those comedy clubs and
everybody's, you know, before anybody,

2182
01:57:34,891 --> 01:57:36,480
I think Louie CK did that as well.

2183
01:57:37,330 --> 01:57:40,800
We had this massive email and that you
have direct connection with your fans and

2184
01:57:40,801 --> 01:57:41,700
that's what your fans want.

2185
01:57:41,701 --> 01:57:44,340
Your fans don't want ticket master telling
them that led Zeppelin's come through.

2186
01:57:44,430 --> 01:57:46,080
They want to know enrollments
come through. What do you know?

2187
01:57:46,081 --> 01:57:48,900
Pearl jam tried to fight them back
in the day. And what they have,

2188
01:57:48,910 --> 01:57:53,730
they have exclusive deals with certain
venues. They are top to bottom, they own,

2189
01:57:53,850 --> 01:57:56,370
they own live nation and
live nation owns a venue.

2190
01:57:56,450 --> 01:57:57,990
So that complete vertically integrated.

2191
01:57:58,170 --> 01:58:01,710
So if you want to plant the garden or
whatever the fuck it is, right? So you go,

2192
01:58:02,250 --> 01:58:05,420
we're going to process your tickets.
The only way you do is perform here.

2193
01:58:05,421 --> 01:58:09,510
So you do it with our promotion company,
which is alive the nation. And um,

2194
01:58:09,990 --> 01:58:13,440
you're going to have to use our
ticket processings fee and our venue,

2195
01:58:13,441 --> 01:58:15,390
they actually own the venues now.
But here's the thing,

2196
01:58:15,660 --> 01:58:18,840
there's a handful of you guys to
get to play those venues. Now,

2197
01:58:18,841 --> 01:58:21,510
I think with podcasts
now shows are 300 people.

2198
01:58:22,050 --> 01:58:27,050
There's going to be thousands of comics
that have 300 fans and the venue where

2199
01:58:27,361 --> 01:58:30,780
we perform, it's not imperative
that it's this specific one.

2200
01:58:30,810 --> 01:58:34,770
It can be a comedy club. It could be a
hall, it could be some conference center.

2201
01:58:34,771 --> 01:58:36,390
It could be anything.
It could be Airbnb,

2202
01:58:36,750 --> 01:58:39,270
but aren't you only know in Ticketmaster
and when you're doing these big ass

2203
01:58:39,271 --> 01:58:42,070
venues, well, sometimes now that
they're nation, they own some certain

2204
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:46,850
clubs. I work with live nation. So now
I make sure all your shit is that up.

2205
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:49,070
Yeah. Really? Yeah.

2206
01:58:49,150 --> 01:58:52,930
Why not just do the podcast live
every fucking where different man,

2207
01:58:53,020 --> 01:58:54,400
it's not the same.
Yeah.

2208
01:58:54,401 --> 01:58:59,190
I like podcasts like this where
it's just people talking you,

2209
01:58:59,240 --> 01:59:01,200
you do it differently when
you're playing for an audience.

2210
01:59:01,210 --> 01:59:04,010
He's performed for them.
And it becomes this weird days an issue.

2211
01:59:06,900 --> 01:59:10,690
It just is not. Um, it's not the
same. It's not a real conversation.

2212
01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:12,460
Like I think the intimacy of podcast,

2213
01:59:12,461 --> 01:59:14,980
one of the things that people like about
as they listen in their ear, right?

2214
01:59:14,981 --> 01:59:17,830
They've got to leave your plug. It's like
you're talking to them. They're like,

2215
01:59:17,831 --> 01:59:20,760
you're right there. When you're doing
it live, it becomes a different thing.

2216
01:59:20,761 --> 01:59:23,170
There's reaction reactions, a bad
thing, but it's different thing.

2217
01:59:23,171 --> 01:59:25,750
But standup is way better way.
It's just way more fun.

2218
01:59:26,010 --> 01:59:29,290
I'm saying is what are we doing with
this, right? It's like you should,

2219
01:59:29,350 --> 01:59:31,270
you should have a direct
connect to all your fans.

2220
01:59:31,271 --> 01:59:33,760
I should have a direct connect to all
my fans. Right? We should be able to,

2221
01:59:33,761 --> 01:59:36,970
even the venue should have
that as well. Why? Why do we,

2222
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:40,240
why are we giving away all the data
to a company that's really not,

2223
01:59:40,241 --> 01:59:42,460
I know my agent's going to call me right
after. This thing's going to be like,

2224
01:59:42,461 --> 01:59:46,360
why the fuck we have to shut the fuck up?
So you want their email,

2225
01:59:46,361 --> 01:59:47,830
do you want your audience with emails?
Basically.

2226
01:59:47,831 --> 01:59:50,110
And that's what the audience wants and
I don't want my audience to get charged

2227
01:59:50,111 --> 01:59:52,870
16 bucks every time they buy a ticket.
Where does that money go?

2228
01:59:53,680 --> 01:59:57,790
It costs $16 to process a ticket,
40% of the ticket price.

2229
01:59:57,820 --> 02:00:01,300
Why not just create an email
and when you're at these venues,

2230
02:00:01,301 --> 02:00:03,100
just put it up on the
jumbotron and be like, Yo,

2231
02:00:03,101 --> 02:00:06,940
email me after the email me after
the show. I mean that's, yeah,

2232
02:00:06,941 --> 02:00:07,780
that's one more step.

2233
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:11,050
Or we could just create the ticket process
and the charters. I'm way letter left.

2234
02:00:11,051 --> 02:00:11,830
Excuse me,

2235
02:00:11,830 --> 02:00:16,360
and Andy already starts aggregating the
emails and then if you want to get real

2236
02:00:16,361 --> 02:00:20,200
crazy with it, you have a boy of yours
that like let's say my buddy Aakash right.

2237
02:00:20,201 --> 02:00:23,560
I do the podcast with. It's like, Hey, I
caught you. You were about to go on tour.

2238
02:00:23,740 --> 02:00:25,240
Yeah,
why don't you just use my dataset man.

2239
02:00:25,390 --> 02:00:27,940
They're going to know you from doing
the podcast with me. Maybe you can,

2240
02:00:27,970 --> 02:00:28,601
they'll want to see you.

2241
02:00:28,601 --> 02:00:30,940
It's like we get to empower
each other through that shit.

2242
02:00:31,990 --> 02:00:33,370
Am I making sense or no?

2243
02:00:33,670 --> 02:00:37,390
It makes sense to think
specifically about data,

2244
02:00:37,670 --> 02:00:41,500
about the email list and about they get
that if you show up in these different

2245
02:00:41,501 --> 02:00:43,960
places, they get the email address because
that's how people get their tickets.

2246
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:47,290
But you get that, that you get the option
of saying like, cause they'll ask you,

2247
02:00:47,291 --> 02:00:50,530
they'll say,
can Ticketmaster reply to you all?

2248
02:00:50,531 --> 02:00:53,590
Can ticket master's send you the
latest updates and news and events?

2249
02:00:53,620 --> 02:00:57,160
You can click no. Yeah and I could
go all the time. Let's take a master.

2250
02:00:57,161 --> 02:00:58,180
But you would click yes.

2251
02:00:58,240 --> 02:01:02,290
If it was us and there was somebody who
are invested in going to see you just

2252
02:01:02,291 --> 02:01:04,000
don't want to take a master
promoting random events.

2253
02:01:04,001 --> 02:01:04,834
Depends what you're sending me.

2254
02:01:05,020 --> 02:01:08,830
You click no Ticketmaster's still gets
your email address and might sell it.

2255
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:10,090
Absolutely.
Yeah.

2256
02:01:10,240 --> 02:01:14,110
Even if you just click no like you do
you want updates from Ticketmaster.

2257
02:01:14,260 --> 02:01:18,790
You're not saying is it okay if this
company just starts selling my email

2258
02:01:18,791 --> 02:01:22,120
address because that's what
they do. That's what they
do. Yeah. Rodi own us anyway,

2259
02:01:22,330 --> 02:01:23,770
but they don't have to.
I'm saying now,

2260
02:01:23,771 --> 02:01:26,860
like everybody that's coming out to your
shows is coming out from this podcast.

2261
02:01:26,890 --> 02:01:30,220
They're not coming up cause
the Ticketmaster and if
you use a different email

2262
02:01:30,221 --> 02:01:33,070
service or ticketing service,
they would come out with that one.

2263
02:01:33,520 --> 02:01:35,830
There was a Sam Harris' podcast
where he talked about this,

2264
02:01:35,831 --> 02:01:40,010
where they had on this expert and
they were discussing how data is. It's

2265
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:42,740
like a commodity that no
one knew was a commodity.

2266
02:01:42,741 --> 02:01:44,810
And we signed off on it
before we realized it.

2267
02:01:44,811 --> 02:01:48,740
And these people that don't provide any
service or getting that data and it's

2268
02:01:48,870 --> 02:01:52,280
worth billions and billions of dollars,
which is essentially what Facebook is.

2269
02:01:52,310 --> 02:01:52,940
It's Facebook,

2270
02:01:52,940 --> 02:01:56,450
but it's also shaping the
way we communicate with each
other because the things

2271
02:01:56,451 --> 02:01:59,480
that attract people there are conflict,
right?

2272
02:01:59,540 --> 02:02:02,140
So things that get you to
engage our conflict, right?

2273
02:02:02,150 --> 02:02:05,870
So that's the stuff that shows up
in your email or your Facebook feed.

2274
02:02:05,871 --> 02:02:07,600
They find out what's going to know you.
Yep.

2275
02:02:07,820 --> 02:02:09,160
And that's the shit that they show people.

2276
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:12,920
Click on Oj has 800,000 followers
in two fucking date overnight,

2277
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:15,960
instantly on Twitter, which nobody
grows on Twitter anymore. No,

2278
02:02:15,990 --> 02:02:19,050
but at least we're trying at least
Twitter. At least. At least Facebook,

2279
02:02:19,220 --> 02:02:22,710
they're not charging. Right. My
issue, if Ticketmaster was like, hey,

2280
02:02:22,711 --> 02:02:25,880
here's a free service, we just want to get
your data. I bet. All right, boom. Cool.

2281
02:02:25,881 --> 02:02:27,960
If Facebook is,
you want to charge me,

2282
02:02:27,961 --> 02:02:31,270
you gonna fuck me in my ass and make me
pay you. I think Facebook gets you all.

2283
02:02:31,271 --> 02:02:35,400
Did they just not charted ads? Yeah,
and also like think about it there.

2284
02:02:35,610 --> 02:02:38,880
They've stolen a lot of that data
from people. Yeah, a lot of ways.

2285
02:02:39,230 --> 02:02:42,240
So that is a charge because you signed
up with something but you didn't know you

2286
02:02:42,241 --> 02:02:44,830
were signing up for that. I didn't
know I was giving you all it is. Right.

2287
02:02:44,850 --> 02:02:45,370
What's weird

2288
02:02:45,370 --> 02:02:46,840
to me,
man is fucking,

2289
02:02:46,930 --> 02:02:50,500
when you're talking about something and
then those ads show up in your Google

2290
02:02:50,501 --> 02:02:53,250
feed, Bro, we were just
talking about coolers, Bro.

2291
02:02:53,620 --> 02:02:56,470
And I looked at my Google newsfeed
and there's ads for coolers. I'm like,

2292
02:02:56,471 --> 02:02:58,510
how does my phone, no, I was talking about

2293
02:02:58,580 --> 02:03:01,310
cool. That's why I say date long
as you know. What else is crazy.

2294
02:03:01,550 --> 02:03:06,110
When you get in your car and you look
down at your phone and it says 32 minutes

2295
02:03:06,111 --> 02:03:07,900
to where ever the fuck you're going.

2296
02:03:08,890 --> 02:03:11,240
That shit happens to me all the time.

2297
02:03:11,260 --> 02:03:14,120
Knows what you're going to go and
that was where you look at your phone.

2298
02:03:14,150 --> 02:03:16,970
It'll be like 32 minutes to whatever gym.

2299
02:03:16,971 --> 02:03:21,410
I go to a now, I used to tell me
40 minutes to work in the morning.

2300
02:03:21,420 --> 02:03:24,800
Now it says 40 minutes to Starbucks Brown.
I'm like,

2301
02:03:24,801 --> 02:03:28,190
I drink Starbucks every morning and
there's a Starbucks by my job in the

2302
02:03:28,191 --> 02:03:30,500
building,
but that's the way it tells me I'm going.

2303
02:03:30,501 --> 02:03:34,220
I'm going every morning I watch
one video of Robbie Williams,

2304
02:03:34,221 --> 02:03:35,540
you know that like English singer.

2305
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:39,980
It was a youtube video with him
and Tyson fury. I just clicked.

2306
02:03:39,981 --> 02:03:44,280
It was two minutes long. Every other ad
on Instagram is Robbie Williams life,

2307
02:03:46,100 --> 02:03:50,330
so it's not good. The targeting
isn't perfect. I'm not
going to buy those tickets,

2308
02:03:50,630 --> 02:03:51,680
but my point is it's scary.

2309
02:03:51,710 --> 02:03:55,590
One Youtube video and then a
completely different platform. Yeah,

2310
02:03:55,640 --> 02:03:59,440
and this is all within the last decade.
They figured out how to do this. Yeah.

2311
02:04:00,290 --> 02:04:01,940
Even if we unplug was still plugged in.

2312
02:04:02,450 --> 02:04:04,980
If we were all to delete everything
that we have on social media. Right.

2313
02:04:04,981 --> 02:04:06,020
And I ain't got us already,
Bro.

2314
02:04:06,410 --> 02:04:09,260
That's why I don't like all that snapchat
shit with their face filters and all

2315
02:04:09,261 --> 02:04:11,420
that. And you can see what they
did to him. What'd they do to you?

2316
02:04:11,480 --> 02:04:13,420
What they're doing, the
shit where they are. Yeah. I

2317
02:04:13,420 --> 02:04:15,480
think this was nuts.
He made a,

2318
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:18,580
a complete deep fake with they take,

2319
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:23,880
they basically took all the recordings
of me talking and it's made me say words

2320
02:04:24,071 --> 02:04:25,920
that I've never said before and I was,

2321
02:04:25,960 --> 02:04:30,460
it talked about me sponsoring a hockey
team made of entirely of chimpanzees and

2322
02:04:30,461 --> 02:04:33,940
a bunch of other crazy shit that I
might actually say, but it said it.

2323
02:04:34,150 --> 02:04:35,560
I've never said those things.
Okay.

2324
02:04:35,561 --> 02:04:38,640
So they use my voice with
artificial intelligence.

2325
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:43,530
They've all the sounds that my mouth
winks and they use it with all the right

2326
02:04:43,531 --> 02:04:47,310
inflections and they create the sentences
and the Pharaoh is out of a job.

2327
02:04:50,640 --> 02:04:53,610
They just passed the legislation
about that, about deep faith,

2328
02:04:54,300 --> 02:04:56,070
congresswoman from Brooklyn,
I can't remember her name,

2329
02:04:56,071 --> 02:04:58,350
she just passed the
legislation about defects.

2330
02:04:58,410 --> 02:05:02,550
They also did video of the Mona Lisa
talking, bro. They got the Mona Lisa.

2331
02:05:02,551 --> 02:05:05,970
They took the painting of the Monalisa
and start and now she's like opening her

2332
02:05:05,971 --> 02:05:08,700
mouth and saying things they
can do with Abraham Lincoln.

2333
02:05:08,701 --> 02:05:10,760
And how can you believe anything
you hear on social media anymore?

2334
02:05:10,850 --> 02:05:13,920
It's going to be in a few years.
You're not going to be able to.

2335
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:17,160
No Man. You don't know
what's true, what's not true,

2336
02:05:17,161 --> 02:05:20,150
and nobody cares about the truth and
the life more in a table that's better.

2337
02:05:20,240 --> 02:05:21,530
Maybe now we could say fucked up shit

2338
02:05:21,620 --> 02:05:25,300
like, Bro, what are you talking about?
Definitely deep. Thanks. Well it's,

2339
02:05:25,330 --> 02:05:27,910
you're already getting
porn with actresses.

2340
02:05:27,911 --> 02:05:31,510
They're taking actresses face and putting
them on porn stars and you can't tell,

2341
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:35,110
whoa, wait a, yeah. Oh, you
could fuck everyone. Yeah.

2342
02:05:35,111 --> 02:05:37,240
And now they're going to be able
to do that with virtual reality.

2343
02:05:37,390 --> 02:05:40,870
So you're going an ar porn. Yeah,
they have that. Yeah. Vr Porn.

2344
02:05:40,871 --> 02:05:43,870
And they put something on your Dick so it
feels like, yeah, they could put a logo,

2345
02:05:43,960 --> 02:05:45,550
one of them little things
that jerks you off.

2346
02:05:46,580 --> 02:05:47,413
Eh?

2347
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:53,320
[inaudible] got the same,

2348
02:05:53,660 --> 02:05:54,950
it's not the same old school.

2349
02:05:54,980 --> 02:05:59,240
You like your Paul just started fucking
listen to the audible books too because

2350
02:05:59,500 --> 02:06:01,550
I'm old school.
I like flipping the page and get a book.

2351
02:06:01,700 --> 02:06:05,450
I just started listening to audible only
because of time purposes and it's like,

2352
02:06:05,540 --> 02:06:08,240
it's like listening to the long form
podcast. I'm like, you know what? Fuck it.

2353
02:06:08,241 --> 02:06:10,970
I'm still getting the information
and I feel like at this age I retain

2354
02:06:10,971 --> 02:06:12,690
information more by hearing it.
Right.

2355
02:06:12,770 --> 02:06:16,430
So I'm not bought that gold start
fucking virtual reality pussy.

2356
02:06:17,450 --> 02:06:19,280
Here's the shit that's not porn.
But it could be interesting.

2357
02:06:19,281 --> 02:06:22,130
Have you seen the one about the
basketball games? What? Okay,

2358
02:06:22,131 --> 02:06:26,750
so they put a few cameras so you
can sit front row. But in Vr, Ooh,

2359
02:06:26,900 --> 02:06:30,170
I don't think I would mind that.
That's the best you're looking around.

2360
02:06:30,171 --> 02:06:33,980
You're seeing all the people that are
actually there and your front row at the

2361
02:06:33,981 --> 02:06:37,490
game. Oh, last month I went to,
um, I could use the bathroom
cause I went to Disney,

2362
02:06:37,491 --> 02:06:40,580
I went to Disney and I went
to that fucking, that Avatar,

2363
02:06:40,740 --> 02:06:45,500
avatar flights of passage.
Right, right. It's Weiss. Yeah,

2364
02:06:45,501 --> 02:06:50,420
me too. That shit was incredible.
And you know, I got anxiety, right.

2365
02:06:50,421 --> 02:06:53,750
So I'm on it and I'm like,
Holy Shit.

2366
02:06:54,020 --> 02:06:57,980
Until you just remember I'm not even
moving. Right. And then it's just like,

2367
02:06:57,981 --> 02:07:02,120
it settles everything for you and then
you can just enjoy the actual experience.

2368
02:07:02,121 --> 02:07:04,430
And that helped me.
I was telling my therapist about it,

2369
02:07:04,431 --> 02:07:06,680
cause that helps me when I, when I'm
dealing with my anxiety because it's like,

2370
02:07:06,830 --> 02:07:08,150
you know,
breathing exercises,

2371
02:07:08,151 --> 02:07:11,570
things that get you back to center even
though you're falling and you can feel

2372
02:07:11,571 --> 02:07:13,610
to the dragon breathing on you.

2373
02:07:13,611 --> 02:07:17,570
It's just like when you realize
you're really not moving,

2374
02:07:18,050 --> 02:07:21,980
it just brings you right back to center,
then you're okay, then you're fine.

2375
02:07:22,160 --> 02:07:26,420
You can't do that on a rollercoaster.
No, really, yes, it's real.

2376
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:28,800
But if they have a roller
coaster with virtual reality,

2377
02:07:28,801 --> 02:07:31,450
like if you're wearing virtual reality
goggles and they put you on a roller

2378
02:07:31,451 --> 02:07:32,284
coaster.

2379
02:07:33,060 --> 02:07:35,780
Yeah, but I can enjoy, I can
enjoy the, what do you mean?

2380
02:07:35,900 --> 02:07:39,860
Like they put these goggles on and then
while you're on this roller coaster,

2381
02:07:39,861 --> 02:07:41,810
you're experiencing things
that aren't really there,

2382
02:07:42,050 --> 02:07:42,900
but you're explaining like you,

2383
02:07:42,910 --> 02:07:45,280
you like going through
wormholes and you're traveling,

2384
02:07:45,710 --> 02:07:49,730
you're seeing things happening and I'm
a heart attack. Have a panic attack.

2385
02:07:50,680 --> 02:07:52,430
That's not,
that's not something I want to experience.

2386
02:07:52,460 --> 02:07:53,930
I'm glad you talk about anxiety.

2387
02:07:53,990 --> 02:07:56,540
I'm glad you're talking about the way you
do because I think you've opened it up

2388
02:07:56,541 --> 02:07:58,740
for a lot of people.
I think [inaudible] get,

2389
02:07:58,750 --> 02:08:01,190
you've made it a subject
that's okay to talk about.

2390
02:08:01,191 --> 02:08:04,520
For someone like you who
would like a cool guy.

2391
02:08:04,580 --> 02:08:09,580
It was a smart dude who is successful
and talks openly about anxiety and about

2392
02:08:10,730 --> 02:08:13,010
how it's affected you.
That's, I think that's a,

2393
02:08:13,020 --> 02:08:14,780
you're doing a very big service for that.

2394
02:08:14,890 --> 02:08:18,760
I didn't even know what the anxiety was
until 2010 because growing up in the

2395
02:08:18,761 --> 02:08:21,430
environment that I grew up in, I just
thought all those feelings were normal.

2396
02:08:21,460 --> 02:08:24,370
I thought all those feelings
of paranoia or you know,

2397
02:08:24,371 --> 02:08:26,320
being anxious all the time like you know,

2398
02:08:26,340 --> 02:08:29,860
and I used to smoke weed so you know
when you smoke weed and you have a panic

2399
02:08:29,861 --> 02:08:31,610
attack, you just blame
it on the weed. Know.

2400
02:08:31,820 --> 02:08:34,360
I remember driving the Burger King
one time with two of my home boys.

2401
02:08:34,361 --> 02:08:36,520
One of them is dead now.
His name is Darell rest in peace.

2402
02:08:36,760 --> 02:08:41,760
My Man Zeke and I was high as hell and
my steering wheel needed like steering

2403
02:08:41,861 --> 02:08:42,181
fluid.

2404
02:08:42,181 --> 02:08:47,181
So it was shaking so it was shaking my
legs and I'm bugging out just driving the

2405
02:08:47,501 --> 02:08:50,200
burger king, a two mile ride. I'm
like, Yo, one of y'all got to drive.

2406
02:08:50,210 --> 02:08:53,050
We're all gonna die right now.
Take the wheel right now.

2407
02:08:53,051 --> 02:08:55,420
I'm going to crash this motherfucker.
Call them tripping the fuck out.

2408
02:08:55,570 --> 02:08:57,850
And they looking at me like, Yo, don't
let this motherfuckers smoke no more.

2409
02:08:58,340 --> 02:09:01,450
But I had nothing to do with the weed.
It was, we'd probably accentuate. It.

2410
02:09:01,710 --> 02:09:04,180
Definitely did. Because
when I, after, you know,

2411
02:09:04,240 --> 02:09:07,600
when I found out what anxiety was in
2010 and I didn't start going to get,

2412
02:09:08,050 --> 02:09:12,130
you know, going to therapy until like two
years ago, because back in 2010 when I,

2413
02:09:12,180 --> 02:09:14,920
when I got diagnosed with my
first panic attack that somebody,

2414
02:09:14,921 --> 02:09:15,790
the doctor was saying,
Hey,

2415
02:09:15,791 --> 02:09:19,300
this is a panic attack because I had just
gotten fired from radio for the fourth

2416
02:09:19,301 --> 02:09:22,330
motherfucking time and I was back at
home living with my mom and like 31 years

2417
02:09:22,331 --> 02:09:26,430
old with a two year old daughter and you
know, collecting unemployment checks.

2418
02:09:26,431 --> 02:09:29,260
So when I'm having this panic attack and
I go to the doctor and he's like, Yo,

2419
02:09:29,261 --> 02:09:32,800
your heart is fine. You've got a
perfectly fine hardening, you're healthy,

2420
02:09:32,801 --> 02:09:35,860
you got an athlete's heart. He was like,
Yo, are you stressed about anything?

2421
02:09:35,861 --> 02:09:39,610
I'm like, fuck yeah. You know,
so in my mind, all I gotta
do is get me another job,

2422
02:09:39,910 --> 02:09:42,400
get back in position and
everything will be okay.

2423
02:09:42,790 --> 02:09:46,570
But when you get back in position and
you know you've made more money than

2424
02:09:46,571 --> 02:09:47,470
you've ever made in your life,

2425
02:09:47,471 --> 02:09:50,440
and you've got books that are selling
in TV shows and all of this other shit,

2426
02:09:50,450 --> 02:09:52,570
you still having no same panic
attacks. She's like, well,

2427
02:09:52,571 --> 02:09:56,350
what the fuck is going on? I'm sure
that's it. That's exactly what it is.

2428
02:09:56,800 --> 02:09:58,210
You think you're going to lose everything.

2429
02:09:58,380 --> 02:10:00,400
It's also you experienced
pressure that uh,

2430
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:03,870
most people never experience because
you experienced pressure at this,

2431
02:10:04,200 --> 02:10:06,750
this public scale.
It's not just pressure,

2432
02:10:06,751 --> 02:10:11,130
it's pressure with people's eyes on you
and expectations and criticisms and all

2433
02:10:11,131 --> 02:10:14,190
these different things that the average
person is not gonna experience that from

2434
02:10:14,191 --> 02:10:17,700
millions of people. And you do.
And it's just like it's always on.

2435
02:10:17,701 --> 02:10:20,430
And if you're one of those crazy
fucks that reads comments, good

2436
02:10:20,730 --> 02:10:24,660
Lord have mercy. God love. That
was my problem with you. At first.

2437
02:10:24,661 --> 02:10:28,890
I used to enjoy it because I was the guy
who came up on Youtube looking at all

2438
02:10:28,891 --> 02:10:32,100
these worlds thought hip hop conspiracy
theories about people and you'd be like,

2439
02:10:32,101 --> 02:10:35,200
oh my God, it's motherfuck
sacrifices hamsters. And
that's how he got successful.

2440
02:10:35,320 --> 02:10:36,153
You know what I'm saying?

2441
02:10:36,490 --> 02:10:41,490
I know you take all that shit is cool
until you get old and then you start

2442
02:10:41,561 --> 02:10:46,010
seeing things about you and you laugh
at it at first until you realize like I

2443
02:10:46,140 --> 02:10:47,920
not even really starting
to say some wild shit.

2444
02:10:47,950 --> 02:10:50,830
What was the craziest one that you
heard about you? I mean for me,

2445
02:10:50,831 --> 02:10:54,040
you know what it is when they tried to
meet to, to fuck over the last year,

2446
02:10:54,041 --> 02:10:57,310
try to get him Outta here. You know
that that was, that was the most,

2447
02:10:57,550 --> 02:10:59,560
that was the wildest one to me
cause I was always the person,

2448
02:10:59,561 --> 02:11:02,350
I say live your truth so nobody
can use your truth against you.

2449
02:11:02,770 --> 02:11:06,070
So it's not like they bought up anything
that I hadn't spoken about numerous

2450
02:11:06,071 --> 02:11:10,340
times before or written about in my books.
They just decide to attack, oh my God,

2451
02:11:11,440 --> 02:11:16,300
targets. Oh man, it can happen. It can it.

2452
02:11:16,360 --> 02:11:19,510
So that for me, that was like,
I, this is going too far,

2453
02:11:19,511 --> 02:11:22,060
but it then it's like you really
can't do anything about it.

2454
02:11:22,390 --> 02:11:24,760
That's the other thing. Like there's
no, there's no way to fight it.

2455
02:11:24,761 --> 02:11:26,200
Once the toothpaste is out of the tube,

2456
02:11:26,560 --> 02:11:28,420
there's no way to put the
toothpaste back in the tube.

2457
02:11:28,740 --> 02:11:32,680
So the only thing you could do is just
either let it consume you and, and, and,

2458
02:11:32,700 --> 02:11:36,340
and probably ruin you just
because you took it all in. Oh,

2459
02:11:36,341 --> 02:11:37,990
you just keep it to fuck moving like you,

2460
02:11:38,170 --> 02:11:41,500
you how you have to be confident enough
to know what's the truth and what's not

2461
02:11:41,501 --> 02:11:42,334
the truth.

2462
02:11:42,370 --> 02:11:44,620
And so now you don't read
any comments anymore.

2463
02:11:44,850 --> 02:11:48,330
I don't go on Twitter at all. What
is too toxic? That shit like yeah,

2464
02:11:48,420 --> 02:11:51,420
we were in verbally abusive relationships
with our fucking smart phones.

2465
02:11:51,490 --> 02:11:54,670
Yeah, I agree. Yeah, it's not, it's
definitely not healthy. You know,

2466
02:11:54,671 --> 02:11:57,400
we were talking about it yesterday,
me and Duncan Trussell,

2467
02:11:57,550 --> 02:12:00,730
we were saying that it's like your diet,
like your diet,

2468
02:12:00,731 --> 02:12:03,220
if you take in junk food all the time,

2469
02:12:03,350 --> 02:12:06,700
eat a bunch of shitty things that are
unhealthy. It's not good for your body.

2470
02:12:06,701 --> 02:12:08,580
What your mental diet,
it's important to.

2471
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:12,340
And if you're always taking in
these toxic arguments and yeah,

2472
02:12:12,640 --> 02:12:16,060
I mean half a Twitter is just people
screaming at each other and just yelling

2473
02:12:16,061 --> 02:12:20,140
and insulting each other and trying to
find ways in this person's being shitty

2474
02:12:20,141 --> 02:12:23,230
or wrong or negative and it's
like that's not real life.

2475
02:12:23,770 --> 02:12:27,790
The real life that we experienced that
were designed experiences like this,

2476
02:12:28,090 --> 02:12:29,900
people interacting with
each other reasonably.

2477
02:12:30,160 --> 02:12:32,710
It's one of the reasons why I
think people like podcasts so much,

2478
02:12:32,711 --> 02:12:36,670
especially good podcasts where people
have real conversations is because you go,

2479
02:12:36,700 --> 02:12:40,380
oh, okay, this is, this is, this
is v resonates with me. Yeah.

2480
02:12:40,420 --> 02:12:42,280
Whereas Twitter does
not resonate with you.

2481
02:12:42,580 --> 02:12:46,840
Twitter just gets you anxious and gets
you upset and conversations where people

2482
02:12:46,841 --> 02:12:50,920
actually being nice to each
other in person. Look, I
don't do podcast over Skype.

2483
02:12:51,040 --> 02:12:54,600
I don't like it. I don't. I want to see
you. I want you to be in the room with it.

2484
02:12:54,610 --> 02:12:57,250
I want everyone to know we're going
to be okay. You know when you,

2485
02:12:57,251 --> 02:12:59,950
when you have these conversations
and people listen to them,

2486
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:03,370
like just one on one like
this or two on one to this,

2487
02:13:03,371 --> 02:13:06,490
this kind of what we're doing now.
This makes sense to people.

2488
02:13:06,680 --> 02:13:09,290
That's one of the reasons when I,
when I'm out and about and you know,

2489
02:13:09,291 --> 02:13:11,690
like if I'm at the airport and somebody
comes up to me and talks to me,

2490
02:13:11,990 --> 02:13:12,900
I speak to them.
Yeah.

2491
02:13:12,960 --> 02:13:15,440
Because I feel like that interaction
was supposed to happen. Right? Yes.

2492
02:13:15,530 --> 02:13:18,020
You know what I mean?
Normal Twitter, Instagram,

2493
02:13:18,021 --> 02:13:20,110
I ain't supposed to be talking
to you on this shit. Yeah.

2494
02:13:20,120 --> 02:13:23,690
With a Vegan you are not supposed to be
human beings are not wired to be that

2495
02:13:23,691 --> 02:13:26,660
wired. No. Everybody should not have
that kind of access to, you know,

2496
02:13:26,780 --> 02:13:27,660
so it's just like we got us,

2497
02:13:27,661 --> 02:13:31,160
we've got to take back to them that see
the facade fall apart when you respond

2498
02:13:31,170 --> 02:13:33,690
to one of their tweets,
like someone would be like fuck you,

2499
02:13:33,691 --> 02:13:36,120
Charlemagne you a shit and then
you can be like, why in the bag?

2500
02:13:36,630 --> 02:13:39,570
I'm just playing bro. I'm a fan. I
didn't really know what to say though,

2501
02:13:39,571 --> 02:13:43,380
is that they're just trying to get a read.
They just, one reaction I, in my mind,

2502
02:13:43,381 --> 02:13:47,310
if people, if you like
somebody, right, you see him,

2503
02:13:47,670 --> 02:13:48,990
you're going to go up to
them and speak to them.

2504
02:13:49,120 --> 02:13:52,290
I just try to gauge things on how
I would do it. Right. For example,

2505
02:13:52,930 --> 02:13:57,290
I was on a plane with Steve Nash this
morning. Okay. Steve Nash. I'm like, why?

2506
02:13:57,300 --> 02:13:59,520
He's like, Oh shit, where's my boy?
He's like, Oh shit. That's Steve Nash.

2507
02:13:59,521 --> 02:14:04,380
And I'm like, Oh shit. That
Steve. I didn't speak to
Steve. Did you say hello? No.

2508
02:14:04,470 --> 02:14:08,590
Nothing. No. Okay. I didn't feel, I
didn't feel it. Even I respect them. No,

2509
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:10,770
he's a great player and
I feel John Stockton,

2510
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:15,800
that's a little like [inaudible]
have to say hi to say what?

2511
02:14:17,940 --> 02:14:22,940
There's some people you have to say hi
to Rachel Dolezal [inaudible] Seattle.

2512
02:14:24,720 --> 02:14:28,200
Absolutely. Where was she? Was I started
with a, I think she had at least one kid.

2513
02:14:28,201 --> 02:14:31,590
Maybe another one. She was just at
the airport. Where? Online? No Tsa.

2514
02:14:31,591 --> 02:14:35,910
Precheck sexual. Now she's bought. Yes.
She bisexual biracial shoes. Oh, no shit.

2515
02:14:35,911 --> 02:14:38,160
Not biracial.
Transracial she is black.

2516
02:14:39,110 --> 02:14:43,140
She's got both transracial I know,
but what I'm saying is she's bye.

2517
02:14:43,470 --> 02:14:46,830
So she's straight and gay with the
thing, but I said hello. Said what's up?

2518
02:14:46,860 --> 02:14:49,470
Amazing forehead. One of the best
port has you'll ever see in a game.

2519
02:14:49,471 --> 02:14:52,060
I want to ignore her.
That's what I would have known her.

2520
02:14:53,550 --> 02:14:55,640
You want to got the Selfie?
No,

2521
02:14:57,730 --> 02:15:02,040
I saw Jessie Smollett took a picture of,
oh my goodness.

2522
02:15:02,041 --> 02:15:05,610
In Lafayette Bakery. What do you think's
going to happen with him? Nothing.

2523
02:15:06,900 --> 02:15:10,410
Nothing. It's amazing. Nothing
legally. It's amazing legal.

2524
02:15:10,411 --> 02:15:11,790
I think Chicago was coming after him.

2525
02:15:11,791 --> 02:15:14,610
Now you think so now didn't they say
that they were going to get them for the

2526
02:15:14,611 --> 02:15:17,910
money? For the money that they spent?
There's no such thing as cancer coaching.

2527
02:15:17,950 --> 02:15:22,530
No more cancer coach was absolute
bullshit. Ooh. O J Simpson proved that.

2528
02:15:23,270 --> 02:15:26,580
Ooh. You know what I'm saying? Like,
Hey, when bill Cobb, he comes home,

2529
02:15:26,581 --> 02:15:29,820
he'll be on the road doing motherfucking
standup or Kelly's still out here

2530
02:15:29,850 --> 02:15:32,910
selling shows like Charlie
Sheen is still out here.

2531
02:15:32,940 --> 02:15:36,150
Flourishing like it's
really sheen duct it all.

2532
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:42,180
Wait a minute.
Not all he did get.

2533
02:15:42,181 --> 02:15:47,181
That ain't [inaudible]

2534
02:15:50,960 --> 02:15:55,320
blue man.
And what is HIV?

2535
02:15:55,910 --> 02:15:58,510
Some say the greatest endorsement deal.
Magic Johnson ever sign.

2536
02:16:01,310 --> 02:16:05,760
I'm saying we're not going to act
like his career and it looks great.

2537
02:16:05,761 --> 02:16:08,230
Take this age. You're going to get some
movie theater though. I was in my head

2538
02:16:08,270 --> 02:16:12,860
car the day they announced on the radio
that Magic Johnson had HIV and I was

2539
02:16:12,861 --> 02:16:14,360
shitting my pants. I was like, oh my God,

2540
02:16:14,361 --> 02:16:16,550
this is like the beginning of a Zombie
movie. We're all going to get it.

2541
02:16:16,910 --> 02:16:19,910
If Magic Johnson with all his money
and all his fame, if he's got it,

2542
02:16:19,911 --> 02:16:22,520
I'm going to get it. We're all
gonna get it. I was terrified.

2543
02:16:23,390 --> 02:16:26,700
I remember in my car driving
and then hear it on the radio.

2544
02:16:26,820 --> 02:16:30,310
Holy Shit. Holy. This is insane.

2545
02:16:31,300 --> 02:16:34,400
30 years later he looks great.
He looks amazing. It's great.

2546
02:16:34,420 --> 02:16:38,280
He's on TV telling us why he
left the motherfucking Lakers.

2547
02:16:38,640 --> 02:16:42,610
The Lakers not once did somebody say Yo,
you know magic got HIV.

2548
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,610
This is how you shut it. Let you did
that. That's all I was thinking about.

2549
02:16:45,611 --> 02:16:50,030
Every time he, cause he looks incredible.
He does look incredible. Incredible. Yeah.

2550
02:16:50,400 --> 02:16:55,210
It's not even positive and tests anymore.
Wait, what? Yeah, I heard that. Yeah.

2551
02:16:55,211 --> 02:16:59,410
If you give them a test for HIV comes
up negative because apparently these

2552
02:16:59,411 --> 02:17:02,950
protease inhibitors and all these
different things that they take to to the

2553
02:17:02,951 --> 02:17:07,510
different medications, you don't even
test positive for HIV anymore. By the way,

2554
02:17:07,540 --> 02:17:08,780
Dan, listen, it was just,

2555
02:17:08,900 --> 02:17:12,400
it was this older white dude and I
forgot what TV show I was on the set up,

2556
02:17:12,401 --> 02:17:16,510
but he was explaining to me the whole
situation with magic and he was like the

2557
02:17:16,511 --> 02:17:18,730
reason that they chose magic with,

2558
02:17:18,750 --> 02:17:21,400
because they want it to
erase a lot of these stigmas.

2559
02:17:21,401 --> 02:17:26,160
People thought that HIV and AIDS was
a gay disease and he needed like a,

2560
02:17:26,170 --> 02:17:29,380
an Alpha male.
I guess to have it,

2561
02:17:29,440 --> 02:17:33,790
to kind of erase that stigma and to let
people know that you can live with it

2562
02:17:33,791 --> 02:17:37,590
like HIV. They gave it to him.
Well this is what he told her

2563
02:17:37,840 --> 02:17:38,680
nuts by the way,

2564
02:17:38,681 --> 02:17:43,681
is it [inaudible] I'm telling
you what somebody told me.

2565
02:17:44,870 --> 02:17:48,680
They said to me was magic had got
caught up in some type of scandal and

2566
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:53,420
[inaudible] right? Yeah. And we'll
put in before the scandal came out,

2567
02:17:53,620 --> 02:17:58,620
just because the person that he was with
was like some allegedly some big wigs

2568
02:17:58,940 --> 02:18:01,040
child or something like that.
And so this,

2569
02:18:01,080 --> 02:18:03,740
they said this is what you're
going to do so we don't ruin you.

2570
02:18:04,440 --> 02:18:08,180
I'm just now on this show before you
take this in, he believes in Sasquatch.

2571
02:18:08,520 --> 02:18:12,230
[inaudible] believe Sasquatch was real.

2572
02:18:12,260 --> 02:18:14,900
That just started right now on this
podcast. If I asked him yesterday,

2573
02:18:14,910 --> 02:18:19,430
he did 100% there. I'm not saying
I believe that magic theory,

2574
02:18:19,580 --> 02:18:22,940
I'm just repeating what I was told that
that is a common rumor that's out there.

2575
02:18:22,941 --> 02:18:26,300
I've heard that. I've heard that rumor.
It's guy, he doesn't actually have it.

2576
02:18:26,510 --> 02:18:28,100
But then it was either that or,

2577
02:18:28,210 --> 02:18:31,580
but we just got done saying how you read
rumors about you that are ridiculous

2578
02:18:31,581 --> 02:18:34,580
and go, what the fuck? And then you
realize, oh this is what happens.

2579
02:18:34,610 --> 02:18:35,780
People just make shit up.

2580
02:18:35,781 --> 02:18:39,530
And then people repeat the shit that
people make up cause he can't fathom that

2581
02:18:39,531 --> 02:18:44,360
he beat aids. Bro Aids was bodying people
back in the day like shooting mercury.

2582
02:18:44,450 --> 02:18:48,560
Freddie gone? Yeah. Who
else? He's he. He's he,

2583
02:18:48,561 --> 02:18:51,880
he my downstairs neighbor.
Downstairs neighbor? No, no.

2584
02:18:51,890 --> 02:18:53,150
I had it downstairs neighbor who had aids.

2585
02:18:53,350 --> 02:18:58,350
[inaudible] I learned
about it really young.

2586
02:19:07,760 --> 02:19:08,020
That's

2587
02:19:08,020 --> 02:19:11,110
definitely Andrew with his thirties
I'm like either he was just out

2588
02:19:13,290 --> 02:19:18,100
looking at him. Yo Book Charlie Sheen
for 350 bucks. Book them where I came.

2589
02:19:18,101 --> 02:19:20,500
Yeah.
Oh on cameo,

2590
02:19:21,730 --> 02:19:26,410
cameo sunglasses on like what is
happening here? What is, what is he doing?

2591
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:29,930
Yeah, it is strange stuff. Just
showing you what is that too?

2592
02:19:30,140 --> 02:19:32,720
He aged very quickly.
It's like,

2593
02:19:32,721 --> 02:19:35,690
see he seemed to be fine when he was
doing two and a half men when he stopped

2594
02:19:35,691 --> 02:19:39,920
doing that show. He aged like a
hundred years old. He had HIV.

2595
02:19:40,040 --> 02:19:44,240
We don't know how it's affecting her
too. I forgot. I forgot. Everybody has,

2596
02:19:44,270 --> 02:19:48,730
everybody's not magic Johnson here.
Okay. Come. Same Magic. That's why

2597
02:19:48,980 --> 02:19:49,521
that,
by the way,

2598
02:19:49,521 --> 02:19:53,960
that is why I say magic is like the
greatest NBA player of all time.

2599
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:59,090
Why? Because of that, he
played 13 seasons in the NBA,

2600
02:19:59,300 --> 02:20:03,350
went to nine NBA finals, won
five of them. One in college,

2601
02:20:03,351 --> 02:20:08,000
came in one his rookie year and went
one on one with HIV and fucking one

2602
02:20:08,120 --> 02:20:11,240
destroyed. He destroyed the
stigma of HIV. Definitely did.

2603
02:20:11,390 --> 02:20:12,860
Anybody that catches HIV right now,

2604
02:20:12,861 --> 02:20:15,650
the first thing you're going to say
to yourself is give me a magic style.

2605
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:17,630
I can live through anything of magic.
Made it real time.

2606
02:20:17,710 --> 02:20:19,900
You know what I'm saying?
30 years later he's okay.

2607
02:20:19,901 --> 02:20:23,600
What did the death sentence anymore
and by the way, what's worse?

2608
02:20:23,601 --> 02:20:26,750
Herpes all over your Dick for life.
Not that it comes back and forth,

2609
02:20:26,780 --> 02:20:31,550
but it's always there. The open
blisters forever, forever or having HIV,

2610
02:20:31,880 --> 02:20:36,370
definitely the herpes,
it's worse because the HIV,

2611
02:20:36,730 --> 02:20:40,190
they could basically cure it
pees on your dick forever.

2612
02:20:40,191 --> 02:20:44,170
Meaning those boosters don't go away.
You can't even fuck, it'll hurt. No,

2613
02:20:44,171 --> 02:20:47,390
let's just go away.
Nobody's saying that you get it do today.

2614
02:20:48,990 --> 02:20:51,590
Yeah. Breaks. He said,

2615
02:20:51,630 --> 02:20:56,270
I'm saying this specific type of like
real hardcore herpes, they never go away.

2616
02:20:56,271 --> 02:20:59,680
They're just always, they have one
that doesn't go away hypothetically,

2617
02:20:59,710 --> 02:21:01,650
which is herpes.

2618
02:21:01,700 --> 02:21:05,960
You ever see the Damon Wayans bit about
magic when magic came back to the MBA?

2619
02:21:05,990 --> 02:21:09,110
No, no. Nobody wanted to block
him, but second Dennis Rodman,

2620
02:21:09,290 --> 02:21:10,520
Dennis Rodman was like,
fuck y'all.

2621
02:21:10,550 --> 02:21:12,480
Spit in your mouth and
accelerate your symptoms.

2622
02:21:15,050 --> 02:21:19,230
[inaudible] enough credit.
David's a goat man.

2623
02:21:19,231 --> 02:21:21,960
He's one of the greatest of all times.
I don't give them enough credit.

2624
02:21:22,460 --> 02:21:26,860
We had to actually delete a Damon Wayans
joke from the breakfast club. Well,

2625
02:21:26,960 --> 02:21:30,340
because it used to play like, you
know, you have stuff that plays,

2626
02:21:30,670 --> 02:21:33,730
has the loop and he had to delete it.
Wants to meet two times up. Eric Cain,

2627
02:21:33,731 --> 02:21:36,460
can you say it? I mean, I'll say dammit.

2628
02:21:36,560 --> 02:21:40,070
Damon Wayans Damon Wayans.

2629
02:21:40,580 --> 02:21:43,870
It was on the breakfast club and he was
talking about the bill copy situation.

2630
02:21:43,880 --> 02:21:47,330
He just goes, Yo man, have you seen
the women that are accusing bill Cosby?

2631
02:21:47,331 --> 02:21:48,240
They're all on [inaudible]

2632
02:21:50,700 --> 02:21:53,730
Damon Wayans that day I was like, you
know what I mean? For the authentic.

2633
02:21:53,930 --> 02:21:57,990
Always have. She doesn't
give a fuck man, but we do.

2634
02:21:58,050 --> 02:21:59,040
So that's why we took this shit.

2635
02:22:01,290 --> 02:22:04,110
Taking the heat for somebody else's words.
Dennis Rodman's said,

2636
02:22:04,111 --> 02:22:06,990
I'll spit in your mouth and
accelerate your symptoms,

2637
02:22:07,770 --> 02:22:10,550
bro. I think about when call him
alone. Think about calling alone.

2638
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:13,440
Everybody right now call Malone
would get so much flack for this,

2639
02:22:13,890 --> 02:22:18,600
but in the 90s what he said made sense.
Oh, none of us really knew what HIV aids.

2640
02:22:18,601 --> 02:22:21,660
What? Do you remember what he
said? Oh, about? I was like,

2641
02:22:21,661 --> 02:22:22,860
I'm not playing basketball with him.

2642
02:22:22,890 --> 02:22:26,040
Like what if I hit him and he starts
bleeding and he gives me like, but that

2643
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:28,200
was what a lot of people were thinking.
Sure.

2644
02:22:28,201 --> 02:22:31,920
How could you be mad at him
for not knowing? For being
ignorant about mosquitoes?

2645
02:22:31,921 --> 02:22:35,130
Remember that? Yes, I do. What about
mosquito? That's, I mean, yeah,

2646
02:22:35,131 --> 02:22:39,270
that's reasonable though, right? I think
what works with Ebola and other shit,

2647
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:42,000
they can give you birthday
or some shit or malaria.

2648
02:22:42,001 --> 02:22:45,300
Why can't they give you some HIV? We used
to be. We used to be, as somebody said,

2649
02:22:45,301 --> 02:22:47,550
you can't get it in your mouth.
I thought this was propaganda,

2650
02:22:47,551 --> 02:22:50,430
but like you can't get it in your mouth
when someone comes in your mouth. Yeah,

2651
02:22:50,431 --> 02:22:51,620
you can't get it back and tell you that.

2652
02:22:54,800 --> 02:22:59,180
Free tickets to the movie theater for
life. What are you talking to that show?

2653
02:23:00,540 --> 02:23:02,770
If you got HIV aids, like
look, you can't get it.

2654
02:23:02,771 --> 02:23:07,150
You can't just come in your mouth.
It's calling your mouth. Don't worry

2655
02:23:10,600 --> 02:23:15,340
bro. Oh my God. Did you just put it up?

2656
02:23:15,580 --> 02:23:18,340
All the mosquitoes are carriers
or yellow fever, dengue fever,

2657
02:23:18,341 --> 02:23:21,310
Japanese encephalitis and
sinful itis encephalitis.

2658
02:23:21,490 --> 02:23:23,860
There's no evidence of
mosquitoes can transmit HIV.

2659
02:23:23,861 --> 02:23:27,700
Studies with HIV have shown clearly
the virus disappears the mosquito after

2660
02:23:27,701 --> 02:23:31,480
about one to two days. But what if that
shit bites you and invites you right bro?

2661
02:23:31,481 --> 02:23:33,940
Look at that last line.
I've never heard it described like that.

2662
02:23:33,941 --> 02:23:37,240
The time required for them to
scuttle the digest, the blood meal.

2663
02:23:37,330 --> 02:23:42,280
Oh Jesus Christ. You don't even talk about
vampires is like that. The blood meal.

2664
02:23:42,340 --> 02:23:47,340
So that means if they get someone who's
got HIV and then they get to you within

2665
02:23:47,591 --> 02:23:50,770
one to two days, doesn't that
seem like it would get you bro?

2666
02:23:52,540 --> 02:23:55,300
That's all I'm saying. It's,
it's a reasonable thing to ask.

2667
02:23:55,840 --> 02:23:57,760
These are reasonable things to do.
I have to worry about shit like that.

2668
02:23:57,761 --> 02:24:02,150
I'm married. Well, the real
fear is pandemic diseases.
I'm out the gate. Yeah, yeah,

2669
02:24:02,170 --> 02:24:04,550
yeah, but that's his fucking, we're
talking about. You're on the beach and,

2670
02:24:04,580 --> 02:24:09,070
and some dude with Charlie Sheen's next
to you spitting in your mouth. Yeah.

2671
02:24:09,580 --> 02:24:14,580
Just from Tiger Blood
Hashtag Tiger Blood Hashtag

2672
02:24:16,660 --> 02:24:19,920
oh Charlie had a moment.
You had a moment. Moment.

2673
02:24:19,950 --> 02:24:22,200
HIV cases moment count was the thing.

2674
02:24:22,960 --> 02:24:27,960
The only thing we could have handled
similar thing like [inaudible] the hell

2675
02:24:29,960 --> 02:24:34,690
there. That winning shit don't sound
too, I don't believe you ready Bro.

2676
02:24:34,860 --> 02:24:35,990
Yeah,
he was wild.

2677
02:24:36,050 --> 02:24:39,440
Do you know why don't match the
difference between magic and Charlie?

2678
02:24:39,441 --> 02:24:40,920
I don't think Charlie was ever recruited

2679
02:24:40,980 --> 02:24:44,640
anybody because people,
yeah, like we wanted,

2680
02:24:44,790 --> 02:24:47,700
we wanted to be magic at
some point in our lives.

2681
02:24:47,701 --> 02:24:48,930
Everybody wanted to be Magic Johnson,

2682
02:24:48,931 --> 02:24:53,440
his live show showing stand up in
2011 was when he was on that thing.

2683
02:24:53,540 --> 02:24:54,373
But that's crazy.

2684
02:24:55,020 --> 02:24:59,280
What fixed that those Russell Peters
fixed that Russell Peters fixed it because

2685
02:24:59,281 --> 02:25:00,114
he went with him.

2686
02:25:00,540 --> 02:25:04,170
So what happened was Charlie was trying
to do it by himself and really didn't

2687
02:25:04,171 --> 02:25:06,090
have anything to say.
And people get bored after a while.

2688
02:25:06,091 --> 02:25:09,330
They would boo him and like he was
like, Oh fuck you, I have your money.

2689
02:25:09,331 --> 02:25:13,050
And he's like a bunch of dumb shit cause
he tried to do this live tour but he

2690
02:25:13,051 --> 02:25:16,650
didn't plan it out. So then we did as
you brought Russell Peters with them.

2691
02:25:16,830 --> 02:25:19,910
So Russell, who's the best
at work in the craft, right?

2692
02:25:20,040 --> 02:25:22,100
He could just make something
out of nothing. Right.

2693
02:25:22,230 --> 02:25:27,230
So Russell got Tim to talk
and then Russell would start
talking shit and making

2694
02:25:27,941 --> 02:25:31,310
fun and someone would say southern
Russell incorporate that and Russell are

2695
02:25:31,311 --> 02:25:35,140
treated like a comedy show and turned it
into something that was actually good.

2696
02:25:35,410 --> 02:25:39,400
I have a bunch of people go see him live.
He should Russell's there.

2697
02:25:39,520 --> 02:25:41,520
So it's going to be good
cause Russell's though, right?

2698
02:25:41,700 --> 02:25:44,020
Russell's going to handle
it and turn it into funny.

2699
02:25:44,190 --> 02:25:48,780
So I want you to just do the
podcast. Yeah, yeah. Hi Cass.

2700
02:25:48,790 --> 02:25:53,020
Back then nobody cared about podcast
early. Have some stories though, Dude.

2701
02:25:53,080 --> 02:25:56,730
Oh yeah, those cracked stories and the
workers if you willing to tell him though.

2702
02:25:56,800 --> 02:25:59,300
Oh he's telling he was all that
had already got aids. What's worst?

2703
02:25:59,310 --> 02:26:00,640
Do you remember when he was on television?

2704
02:26:00,641 --> 02:26:04,350
He was talking about just smoking rocks
and just all this and the people are

2705
02:26:04,351 --> 02:26:06,070
like, what? Like what you're saying,

2706
02:26:06,071 --> 02:26:09,440
but did that excite people in 2019
like we've seen all the crackheads? No.

2707
02:26:09,460 --> 02:26:12,820
Back then it was the right window of time
and it was like him coming through and

2708
02:26:12,821 --> 02:26:17,821
just being unapologetic about doing drugs
and you don't pay hookers to fuck you.

2709
02:26:18,061 --> 02:26:21,880
You pay him to leave if you're kind
of shit that he was saying it was

2710
02:26:21,970 --> 02:26:24,610
unapologetic and that's why it resonated.

2711
02:26:24,760 --> 02:26:27,730
And that's also why no one could get
him with like a me too thing. It's like,

2712
02:26:27,760 --> 02:26:30,430
what are you going to say? Of course he,
he'll tell you what he did. First of all,

2713
02:26:30,431 --> 02:26:33,840
no woman is going to say they slept
with [inaudible] for sure. Yeah.

2714
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:34,840
Maybe he did that too.

2715
02:26:35,010 --> 02:26:35,350
Oh,

2716
02:26:35,350 --> 02:26:40,350
[inaudible] you about to catch that?

2717
02:26:43,671 --> 02:26:47,460
Me Too. You just got, I got heat and
those girls get quite here real quick.

2718
02:26:48,390 --> 02:26:53,310
Holy Shit. That's what you
found a way around the system.

2719
02:26:53,340 --> 02:26:57,810
Oh, my show. What did, that's
what Leo says. Every time a
girl leaves the house. Oh,

2720
02:26:57,811 --> 02:26:58,644
by the way,

2721
02:26:58,850 --> 02:27:03,770
positive. Oh my Jesus. Really
nice to them. They like them.

2722
02:27:03,830 --> 02:27:06,290
They don't want to fucking throw him
under the bus. So some guys are like,

2723
02:27:06,291 --> 02:27:10,670
the Leo would like that. Drake, I don't
know about Drake. Derek Jeter. Oh,

2724
02:27:10,671 --> 02:27:13,700
Derek Jeter was given a gift bags,
baby. You know what I'm saying?

2725
02:27:13,820 --> 02:27:17,430
Can you imagine the number that came out?
He was getting signed baseballs. Yeah.

2726
02:27:17,540 --> 02:27:21,950
Think about how many guys have gotten a
signed baseball from their girlfriend as

2727
02:27:21,951 --> 02:27:22,784
a gift.

2728
02:27:22,940 --> 02:27:25,640
Think about what was going through
their head when they read the post that

2729
02:27:25,641 --> 02:27:29,380
moment. And there's this sign, Derek Jeter
baseball one. They're fucking Nantel.

2730
02:27:29,710 --> 02:27:31,210
Oh Dude.
Yeah.

2731
02:27:31,700 --> 02:27:36,320
And your girls like no other girls
might have, but he was just nice to me.

2732
02:27:36,380 --> 02:27:40,460
He's a gentleman, but what you've
got to earn that gift back, Joe. Joe,

2733
02:27:41,240 --> 02:27:42,410
Joe saying is very true though.

2734
02:27:42,411 --> 02:27:46,220
That's why I always like when I see dudes
still treating women like shit in 2019

2735
02:27:46,221 --> 02:27:49,210
like, yeah, fucking them and kicking
them out the room. Oh my God. No,

2736
02:27:49,220 --> 02:27:51,740
I'm not answering the phone for
after, but I'm like, you're wiling.

2737
02:27:52,220 --> 02:27:55,970
You should be treating her with the
utmost respect and being extremely nice

2738
02:27:56,230 --> 02:28:00,680
because you just never know. Uber, Uber,
she's your friend. She's your friend.

2739
02:28:01,280 --> 02:28:04,130
She, she should be. She
should be your friend.

2740
02:28:04,640 --> 02:28:08,300
Like I don't understand why guys,
like I said at the time said,

2741
02:28:08,360 --> 02:28:09,770
why are y'all still calling women bitches?

2742
02:28:10,160 --> 02:28:14,270
Some of them are bitches bitches
out like it in a positive way.

2743
02:28:14,330 --> 02:28:17,540
Like check this bad bitch
out. Yes, that's okay.

2744
02:28:17,720 --> 02:28:19,330
But some of them are just
old school bits of stuff.

2745
02:28:19,331 --> 02:28:23,090
There's some bitches where it's
like you're in a derogatory way.

2746
02:28:23,330 --> 02:28:25,130
Like you could say it in a positive way.

2747
02:28:25,131 --> 02:28:28,670
You're laughing about it or you could
say it in a derogatory way. Yeah.

2748
02:28:28,790 --> 02:28:33,060
Sometimes I'll say it in a derogatory way
as a man. Cause I mean it because man,

2749
02:28:33,061 --> 02:28:37,130
it's 2019 no. What about Twat?
I've never used that ever.

2750
02:28:37,340 --> 02:28:39,530
What about content now?
I've never used car.

2751
02:28:39,560 --> 02:28:43,070
He got in trouble for using the word cunt.
I didn't trouble me in trouble.

2752
02:28:43,071 --> 02:28:46,670
You get, but you got
outraged. He's, yeah, he's,

2753
02:28:47,250 --> 02:28:50,000
he's not a match. I want to
ask you this, first of all,

2754
02:28:50,060 --> 02:28:53,600
I think what you're doing with
youtube is genius. It's brilliant.

2755
02:28:53,601 --> 02:28:57,770
You're the first comic to
really capitalize on using
you to, you know, Netflix.

2756
02:28:57,771 --> 02:29:00,410
They want to give you a special like,
fuck, I don't need you. Let me do this.

2757
02:29:00,440 --> 02:29:03,290
It'll get more views. And it
has, and it's been amazing.

2758
02:29:03,291 --> 02:29:04,940
It's been beautiful to watch.

2759
02:29:05,180 --> 02:29:07,910
But are you experienced because
of the popularity increased?

2760
02:29:07,940 --> 02:29:12,020
Are you experiencing some push back on
some of your material because you go hard

2761
02:29:12,160 --> 02:29:17,140
bro? The weirdest thing? No, it's like
we've curated an expectation for it.

2762
02:29:17,400 --> 02:29:20,200
Mm. So the people that are
going there are waiting for it.

2763
02:29:20,800 --> 02:29:24,390
It's not people who like got free
tickets from the funny bones website. No.

2764
02:29:24,400 --> 02:29:26,920
What you do, they're there for
things that they didn't watch.

2765
02:29:26,921 --> 02:29:30,430
You talk about eating ass either ass.
Yeah, I was just talking about this on,

2766
02:29:30,431 --> 02:29:32,020
on a pod on the part of the other day,

2767
02:29:32,021 --> 02:29:33,580
but like we were just
talking about privilege.

2768
02:29:33,581 --> 02:29:37,090
You have to be to eat at no serious
sign because think about all these third

2769
02:29:37,091 --> 02:29:40,430
world countries where they can't even
eat food, but we're so full in America.

2770
02:29:40,510 --> 02:29:43,630
Look, you can't have a fucking
cocktail or without almost dying.

2771
02:29:43,631 --> 02:29:45,820
You think they're eating ass in America.
We're so full.

2772
02:29:45,821 --> 02:29:50,230
We got so many choices that we choose
to eat ass we want to do for fun.

2773
02:29:50,890 --> 02:29:54,010
But Bro, I'm telling you they're
not. It's pretty, pretty amazing.

2774
02:29:54,011 --> 02:29:56,950
They're all leaning into it and I think
that people have had enough with the PC

2775
02:29:56,951 --> 02:30:00,040
shit. So they really like to see
the fact that this is out there.

2776
02:30:00,041 --> 02:30:03,700
And I mean we're posting, you know, I'll
tell you one thing, the Joe Rogan effect,

2777
02:30:04,810 --> 02:30:08,050
we used to do a million views a week
on my youtube channel. I came on here,

2778
02:30:08,770 --> 02:30:09,603
2 million now.

2779
02:30:09,780 --> 02:30:14,760
Wow. Wow. Doubled. That's crazy. We'll
see what happens now. I mean, we'll see.

2780
02:30:14,761 --> 02:30:18,360
I mean it was nuts. Charlemagne effect
in there. Well we do a pocket. I mean,

2781
02:30:18,390 --> 02:30:22,490
but the channel exists because of the
Charlotte made effect by Shayle exists

2782
02:30:22,491 --> 02:30:24,510
because we were putting the
brilliant idiots, fat videos,

2783
02:30:24,720 --> 02:30:27,630
idiots videos out every week on
the channel. Like without him,

2784
02:30:27,631 --> 02:30:30,000
that channel doesn't exist.
I mean like you two guys,

2785
02:30:30,050 --> 02:30:30,601
I swear to God,

2786
02:30:30,601 --> 02:30:33,500
I have the biggest influence on the
market and it's like he gave me this

2787
02:30:33,501 --> 02:30:36,830
opportunity to have all these people
view and I was able to put the stuff out

2788
02:30:36,831 --> 02:30:39,080
and luckily they liked it.
But the same thing happened here.

2789
02:30:39,081 --> 02:30:40,430
We just doubled up again.
I mean

2790
02:30:40,730 --> 02:30:44,450
it's crazy that it's all dependent
upon generosity and being a fan.

2791
02:30:44,630 --> 02:30:47,840
Cause that's what I do. I mean, when I'm
talking to a scientist or talking to you,

2792
02:30:47,900 --> 02:30:50,960
yeah, I'm a fan, I'm
interested. I'm curious.

2793
02:30:51,080 --> 02:30:53,170
And it's not like you're putting
on some fuck shit. Right. You know,

2794
02:30:53,180 --> 02:30:56,340
say like Andrew's funny, he's
been funny. Exactly. Years.

2795
02:30:57,710 --> 02:31:02,420
So now everybody else is actually
realizing what we all knew already. Yeah.

2796
02:31:02,421 --> 02:31:07,421
And the limitations of like
those platforms putting
you on like Netflix or HBO

2797
02:31:07,641 --> 02:31:10,550
or something like that, that
doesn't exist anymore. It's not you

2798
02:31:10,980 --> 02:31:13,200
in your whole game and
you know that you go,

2799
02:31:13,201 --> 02:31:16,430
you go get no systems and they teach
you I just to shoot three pointers. Yup.

2800
02:31:16,620 --> 02:31:17,281
You know what I'm saying?

2801
02:31:17,281 --> 02:31:19,980
Instead of like fucking
cultivating your your whole game.

2802
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:23,230
That's why, you know, really
needed, I love rainy days.

2803
02:31:23,870 --> 02:31:26,640
I try not to promote brewing needs.
I know this sounds crazy, right?

2804
02:31:27,060 --> 02:31:30,540
This is interesting. And the reason
I do it because I love our audience.

2805
02:31:30,570 --> 02:31:34,890
I love that group of people who
come to listen to us every week.

2806
02:31:35,160 --> 02:31:39,000
They know that we just out here saying
some wild shit, not even on purpose,

2807
02:31:39,001 --> 02:31:40,360
just because we're,
we're,

2808
02:31:40,390 --> 02:31:43,140
we're trying to get ideas out and
we're just talking through things.

2809
02:31:43,290 --> 02:31:45,150
It's when you bring those outsiders in,

2810
02:31:45,510 --> 02:31:48,000
who here you don't know
any context than nothing.

2811
02:31:48,420 --> 02:31:51,750
Take that little piece out of context.
Give it to the rest of the world.

2812
02:31:51,810 --> 02:31:53,340
Now the rest of the world is outraged.

2813
02:31:53,430 --> 02:31:56,410
We can ask God to come over here any
fucking way. Right. You know what?

2814
02:31:56,730 --> 02:31:58,330
We want to be wild.
We want to place

2815
02:31:59,260 --> 02:32:02,690
is where do you think that's going?
Like what is outrage?

2816
02:32:02,720 --> 02:32:04,550
Culture reached full outrage.

2817
02:32:04,610 --> 02:32:07,430
It's coming back. We turned it
around. I agree. [inaudible] around.

2818
02:32:07,450 --> 02:32:10,370
You know what's made me think about that?
Two situations in the past two weeks,

2819
02:32:10,400 --> 02:32:11,360
I can't remember the first one,

2820
02:32:11,361 --> 02:32:14,290
but the whoopie Goldberg one
from yesterday with Bella
Thorne. I didn't hear it.

2821
02:32:14,720 --> 02:32:18,880
Bella Thorne, uh, she took
some nude pictures. Somebody
was going to expose him.

2822
02:32:18,890 --> 02:32:22,100
So she just shared them herself first.
I think somebody hacked her out.

2823
02:32:22,410 --> 02:32:25,220
Acthar clouds cloud.
They're trying to say, hey,

2824
02:32:25,221 --> 02:32:27,650
we're going to put this out unless you
give us money or some shit. She's like,

2825
02:32:27,651 --> 02:32:30,350
fuck it. I'm gonna put my own shit
on Twitter. Yeah. So Whoopi Goldberg,

2826
02:32:30,351 --> 02:32:34,700
it's on the frame of juggernauts.
I didn't even see it. Lovely.

2827
02:32:34,730 --> 02:32:36,620
We'll be getting on the
view at whip. He goes, look,

2828
02:32:36,980 --> 02:32:40,910
it's 2019 when you take pictures,
they go up to the cloud.

2829
02:32:41,750 --> 02:32:45,800
Hackers can hack you, so don't
take pictures. She was like,

2830
02:32:45,801 --> 02:32:48,020
it's just common sense like it's not,
it's not worth it.

2831
02:32:48,021 --> 02:32:51,200
Just don't take the pictures. Hey.
I was like, oh, your victim shaming,

2832
02:32:51,380 --> 02:32:54,500
but I thought that I thought that
was what the outrage was going to be.

2833
02:32:54,620 --> 02:32:57,170
It wasn't. They was like, Oh shit, we'll
be, you're talking to super common sense.

2834
02:32:57,171 --> 02:32:59,270
Now. Bella came out and said
she was being victim shame,

2835
02:32:59,660 --> 02:33:01,790
but the general public
on social media was like,

2836
02:33:01,940 --> 02:33:05,640
so y'all are mad at whipped before talking
common sense and I was like, Oh shit.

2837
02:33:05,730 --> 02:33:10,110
You can't say it's victim shaming if she's
correct because we are moving into an

2838
02:33:10,111 --> 02:33:13,230
era where all information is going
to be available to everybody.

2839
02:33:14,190 --> 02:33:17,670
I think that's going to be a thing
that we're going to have to overcome.

2840
02:33:17,730 --> 02:33:21,180
The privacy is going out the window,
John. It's not going to exist anymore.

2841
02:33:21,300 --> 02:33:21,721
Like what?

2842
02:33:21,721 --> 02:33:25,020
Our expectations of privacy are so much
different than people that lived in our

2843
02:33:25,021 --> 02:33:27,330
parents' age. Well, our kids,

2844
02:33:27,331 --> 02:33:31,060
it's going to be even less and
then their kids nonexistent.

2845
02:33:31,350 --> 02:33:36,060
They didn't even know FDR was crippled.
That's right. FDL was crippled. Yeah.

2846
02:33:36,290 --> 02:33:37,123
See?
Yeah.

2847
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:39,950
They didn't know. He would literally
hold himself up at the podium.

2848
02:33:39,951 --> 02:33:44,100
I think he got polio or some shit.
Right. So he was a paraplegic. Right.

2849
02:33:44,450 --> 02:33:48,980
And but the press respected his role as
president and they respected his privacy.

2850
02:33:49,160 --> 02:33:50,120
I mean he had side bitches,

2851
02:33:50,121 --> 02:33:54,050
he had all this shit going on and he
would just stand up at the podium holding

2852
02:33:54,051 --> 02:33:56,150
himself up. Whenever you're talking
to everything else besides that,

2853
02:33:56,151 --> 02:33:58,850
they kind of roll them around with the
people didn't know because there wasn't

2854
02:33:58,851 --> 02:34:03,040
this access. Oh I want us to get
back in line to each other all day.

2855
02:34:03,050 --> 02:34:04,780
Talk to me cause I cause think about it,

2856
02:34:04,781 --> 02:34:07,520
it used to be a time where you didn't
know what somebody's religion was.

2857
02:34:07,700 --> 02:34:11,090
You didn't know what somebody's political
views were like you didn't like,

2858
02:34:11,120 --> 02:34:14,960
nobody knew. Like you just went, you
presented and you went the fuck home.

2859
02:34:15,230 --> 02:34:17,980
I think we need to get back to that.
Well I think it's too much

2860
02:34:18,010 --> 02:34:18,700
motherfucking.

2861
02:34:18,700 --> 02:34:22,150
So every call trooper get back in the
closet and not just with your gay should

2862
02:34:22,151 --> 02:34:26,920
just whatever the bullshit meter everybody
to just get back to bullshit and each

2863
02:34:26,921 --> 02:34:27,754
other. Cause. Guess what?

2864
02:34:27,850 --> 02:34:30,250
Remember I used to say you don't want
the truth because you can't handle the

2865
02:34:30,251 --> 02:34:33,370
truth that this era,
the world cannot handle the truth.

2866
02:34:33,371 --> 02:34:35,470
That's why you wanna tell us about Ufos.
What,

2867
02:34:36,430 --> 02:34:37,440
what do you think is happening with you?

2868
02:34:37,441 --> 02:34:40,900
Fos they won't tell us that you FO's
exists because if they told us that you

2869
02:34:40,901 --> 02:34:41,710
oppose exists,

2870
02:34:41,710 --> 02:34:44,890
motherfuckers would probably go crazy
when the reality is we really probably

2871
02:34:44,891 --> 02:34:47,950
need to know you. Fo's it just cause it
would humble the fuck out of everyone.

2872
02:34:48,040 --> 02:34:51,430
Well that's the only time we get a
roar, right? Like in every movie, right?

2873
02:34:51,431 --> 02:34:55,220
The only time Russia and China and America
get on a conference call is when they

2874
02:34:55,260 --> 02:34:57,460
had the movies.
Aliens are coming up the movies.

2875
02:34:57,461 --> 02:35:00,280
Ronald Reagan said that in his speech in
the eighties Ronald Reagan told him to

2876
02:35:00,290 --> 02:35:03,550
Kel Gorbachev, why the fuck are we
beefin cause one day we might be,

2877
02:35:03,700 --> 02:35:07,330
we might have an extra terrestrial threat
and then we got to come together and

2878
02:35:07,331 --> 02:35:10,510
everybody was like, what
the fuck is Ronald Reagan
talking about? Click quickly.

2879
02:35:10,511 --> 02:35:12,040
We would put aside our differences.

2880
02:35:12,041 --> 02:35:15,880
We were three phase faced within a threat
from an alien world and everybody was

2881
02:35:15,881 --> 02:35:18,640
like, what does he know?
Oh, I would respect

2882
02:35:19,250 --> 02:35:22,660
no tonight show.
We go find out 10 nights.

2883
02:35:24,170 --> 02:35:26,240
By the way,
I would respect you have prejudice.

2884
02:35:26,241 --> 02:35:30,510
If aliens came and you still had held
onto whatever the fuck you [inaudible] was

2885
02:35:30,530 --> 02:35:34,660
still racist, you will still
homophobic, transphobic,

2886
02:35:34,670 --> 02:35:36,510
got the aliens came. I'd be like, shit,

2887
02:35:39,500 --> 02:35:44,280
that's not a girl. That's a fucking dude
in a dress. Can't get pregnant. Hold on.

2888
02:35:44,580 --> 02:35:49,490
[inaudible] oh my God, I respect
the fuck out of there. I'd be like,

2889
02:35:49,491 --> 02:35:52,140
okay, I'll tell you no. It's
true though. You know it's real.

2890
02:35:53,370 --> 02:35:56,650
As long as it's real. I really
don't have no choice but to respect

2891
02:35:58,190 --> 02:36:01,470
Joe, I think you're right. I think we're
getting to the end of outrage culture.

2892
02:36:01,471 --> 02:36:04,680
I think she was almost over. We had,
we put on a clip this last week,

2893
02:36:04,860 --> 02:36:07,620
there was this kid in the front row
in a wheelchair heckling me, saw that.

2894
02:36:07,980 --> 02:36:11,910
That was hilarious and we went back and
forth and initially I put it out like,

2895
02:36:11,940 --> 02:36:14,100
oh fuck. What's going to happen? Am
I going to have these like, you know,

2896
02:36:14,101 --> 02:36:17,220
people rolling up to my shows and
like fucking pussies that really,

2897
02:36:17,221 --> 02:36:21,680
well he was also a special kid. He had
something, you know people have it,

2898
02:36:21,710 --> 02:36:24,690
you are river around people and
they just have a fucking, like,

2899
02:36:24,691 --> 02:36:28,230
they have a cold like you know
who has it? Ari, Ari, Ari Shaffir.

2900
02:36:28,231 --> 02:36:31,040
He has this fucking, I don't know,
there's something I just want him around.

2901
02:36:31,060 --> 02:36:34,290
I just like them. I just kind of want
him to tell me his opinions on shit.

2902
02:36:34,390 --> 02:36:37,710
I was ask him Janklow Talker,
but he's just, he's like,
do you feel about carpets?

2903
02:36:37,711 --> 02:36:40,770
And he'll just fucking tell you. They'll
be like, eh, whatever. So it was like,

2904
02:36:41,040 --> 02:36:44,250
he just had this thing needs such positive
energy and I'm making fun of the guy

2905
02:36:44,251 --> 02:36:48,360
from fucking being in a wheelchair and
he's making fun of me for having a shitty

2906
02:36:48,361 --> 02:36:52,530
up body. And like literally I go to
him, I was like, I said, you don't,

2907
02:36:52,531 --> 02:36:54,600
are you upper body is pretty good.
And he goes, what's your excuse?

2908
02:36:54,820 --> 02:36:55,653
Like cool.

2909
02:36:57,060 --> 02:37:01,440
And we have this moment and no
backlash. There's a thing. It was cool.

2910
02:37:01,470 --> 02:37:04,780
Backlash shouldn't matter except for
the guy in the wheelchair, right.

2911
02:37:04,880 --> 02:37:07,140
If everybody else is like, oh, why
the fuck are you picking on him?

2912
02:37:07,340 --> 02:37:10,140
If the guy in the wheelchair don't care
and the guy in the wheelchair is going

2913
02:37:10,141 --> 02:37:13,290
back and forth, why the fuck are you
jumping in ever? People that have it,

2914
02:37:13,320 --> 02:37:15,740
never always.
Parents of people have things

2915
02:37:16,190 --> 02:37:19,340
like when there was this person had
a seizure in, in one of my videos,

2916
02:37:19,970 --> 02:37:21,680
everybody who had
seizures was cool with it.

2917
02:37:21,800 --> 02:37:24,470
It was always a parent of a kid
who had a seizure, who was like,

2918
02:37:24,650 --> 02:37:27,800
my son suffers from, how dare
you? What a clip up like that.

2919
02:37:27,980 --> 02:37:31,640
So it's always a fence on behalf of cause
I really think that people who suffer

2920
02:37:31,641 --> 02:37:32,360
for things,

2921
02:37:32,360 --> 02:37:35,930
they've went through way harder things
in a joke and they actually like that

2922
02:37:35,931 --> 02:37:39,080
they're being spoken to as a
regular person in the audience,

2923
02:37:39,290 --> 02:37:42,650
not babies like every other part of their
life. When can I get the door for you?

2924
02:37:42,651 --> 02:37:45,740
Can I get, it's like they all
right for the first time I'm in it.

2925
02:37:45,900 --> 02:37:48,980
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
pose, I won't post or like make jokes.

2926
02:37:48,981 --> 02:37:52,470
I talk shit about something
that I wouldn't want to
happen to me or somebody I

2927
02:37:52,471 --> 02:37:56,100
loved though. Right. You know what
I'm saying? Like I can handle,

2928
02:37:56,550 --> 02:37:59,250
you know what I'm saying?
Like HIV aids.

2929
02:37:59,251 --> 02:38:04,251
I don't want it
[inaudible] I wouldn't trip

2930
02:38:07,750 --> 02:38:12,240
if I got it. I wouldn't trip to orders.
I mean not what we used to think it was.

2931
02:38:12,241 --> 02:38:16,480
So it's a different thing. Yeah. Do
you know what bug catchers are? Yeah.

2932
02:38:16,490 --> 02:38:18,620
What's a book around fucking
people who have those?

2933
02:38:18,660 --> 02:38:21,480
Did he try to get it? Yeah. There's
a bunch of guys in the gay community.

2934
02:38:21,481 --> 02:38:26,360
We're trying to get HR. Yeah.
That's fun catching crow. Hold on.

2935
02:38:26,370 --> 02:38:28,680
Self low.
The people that wanted to get HIV,

2936
02:38:28,681 --> 02:38:30,720
and this is back in the day
where it was a death sentence,

2937
02:38:30,810 --> 02:38:35,700
there was a lot of guys who were doing
that hold on. Their goal. Their goal.

2938
02:38:35,730 --> 02:38:36,541
Yeah.
They would try,

2939
02:38:36,541 --> 02:38:41,070
they would put out ads on craigslist
looking for HIV positive guys to give me

2940
02:38:41,071 --> 02:38:41,580
the bug.

2941
02:38:41,580 --> 02:38:44,570
This is why colts happened because people
need to be part of something there.

2942
02:38:44,580 --> 02:38:47,730
It's like in them,
some people are just broken.

2943
02:38:48,120 --> 02:38:51,300
Exactly. Cause I heard about that 20
years ago and I thought that was crazy.

2944
02:38:51,301 --> 02:38:54,540
But now that I'm thinking about it,
I'm like, what was their life like?

2945
02:38:55,200 --> 02:38:58,020
I need to know what their life is
like if they had something to lose,

2946
02:38:58,021 --> 02:39:01,170
if they was actually successful,
would they be doing that?

2947
02:39:01,380 --> 02:39:04,980
I need to know what kind of people were
out there trying to catch dis book.

2948
02:39:05,030 --> 02:39:05,863
This every,

2949
02:39:05,900 --> 02:39:10,760
every step in the spectrum
of crazy you think about it.

2950
02:39:10,761 --> 02:39:13,100
And there's a whole fucking category
of people that are doing that.

2951
02:39:13,670 --> 02:39:15,260
So bug catching was one of them.

2952
02:39:15,261 --> 02:39:19,610
Like it was a big thing where guys were
like actively going out and trying and

2953
02:39:19,790 --> 02:39:22,160
guys who had HIV,
we're trying to go give it to people.

2954
02:39:22,980 --> 02:39:25,470
Yeah. That's why, uh,
I did thing would calm,

2955
02:39:25,471 --> 02:39:28,530
I don't even necessarily believe in common
anymore because every day of our life

2956
02:39:28,980 --> 02:39:32,850
we're trying to avoid crazy.
Right? Yeah. But you can't,

2957
02:39:33,540 --> 02:39:34,041
you know what I'm saying?

2958
02:39:34,041 --> 02:39:37,230
When a guy comes in with a gun and he
shoots up a motherfucking school. Yeah.

2959
02:39:37,440 --> 02:39:41,040
Like what are we supposed to do?
We didn't do anything to cause that,

2960
02:39:41,041 --> 02:39:45,210
but he's got something going on with
his life that caused him to snap and it

2961
02:39:45,211 --> 02:39:46,140
affected us.

2962
02:39:46,350 --> 02:39:49,110
Like if you're walking down the street
and you know a guy's just angry about

2963
02:39:49,111 --> 02:39:51,390
something, he bumps into you and
you're like, oh, excuse me. He's like,

2964
02:39:51,391 --> 02:39:53,370
why the fuck you mean it's choose
me and he's ready to fight.

2965
02:39:53,540 --> 02:39:56,280
I don't got nothing to do with you.
I've got everything to do with him.

2966
02:39:56,430 --> 02:39:59,040
So you really can't avoid
this crazy that exists.

2967
02:39:59,110 --> 02:40:01,750
I had a conversation with someone they
were talking about like everything in

2968
02:40:01,751 --> 02:40:03,910
your life you have manifested
and created. I go, okay,

2969
02:40:04,150 --> 02:40:07,270
explain babies who get shot and
drive bys. Shut the fuck up. Yeah.

2970
02:40:07,490 --> 02:40:11,110
There's random things that happen.
Kids get leukemia. What would they do?

2971
02:40:11,111 --> 02:40:14,040
Something bad. Come on, I
use it, but bigger than you.

2972
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:15,700
That's the thing that people hate to.
Yeah.

2973
02:40:16,020 --> 02:40:19,440
We are a very small part of this
big fucking ego system, right?

2974
02:40:19,500 --> 02:40:22,380
We really think that everything
in our life is that important.

2975
02:40:22,381 --> 02:40:24,540
That it could affect the world.
Get the fuck out of here.

2976
02:40:24,660 --> 02:40:28,080
Sometimes random factors, cause you
know, you think about the secret,

2977
02:40:28,081 --> 02:40:30,720
like the law of attraction,
your thoughts become things.

2978
02:40:30,721 --> 02:40:33,630
I think that thing that we forget
about that is not only do our,

2979
02:40:33,840 --> 02:40:36,420
it's not just our thoughts, our
actions. You know what I'm saying?

2980
02:40:36,421 --> 02:40:38,640
It's not like you're just sitting around.
You didn't think,

2981
02:40:38,670 --> 02:40:40,510
you didn't sit around and
think about doing this. Yeah.

2982
02:40:40,590 --> 02:40:42,150
We actually put us on fucking work.

2983
02:40:42,270 --> 02:40:45,990
That's the difference between the secret
in reality is that people think that

2984
02:40:45,991 --> 02:40:50,370
you think things into existence, but know
when you're successful and people say,

2985
02:40:50,371 --> 02:40:54,390
what did you do while I thought this a
new existence, show me how you did that.

2986
02:40:54,420 --> 02:40:54,800
Well,

2987
02:40:54,800 --> 02:40:58,110
I got up every morning at 6:00 AM and
I fucking hustle to the gym and then I

2988
02:40:58,111 --> 02:41:01,420
wrote jokes all day. Like, here you go.
Listen Bitch, you put it in the work.

2989
02:41:01,720 --> 02:41:03,440
Yeah. Yeah. And put in
the work. It's like,

2990
02:41:03,441 --> 02:41:04,950
it's like literally if
somebody said to you, Hey,

2991
02:41:04,951 --> 02:41:08,510
one day you're going to win the
lottery so you can sit at home. Right.

2992
02:41:08,530 --> 02:41:10,700
Thank all day waiting to win the lottery.

2993
02:41:10,740 --> 02:41:13,400
You get up and go to the fucking
store and buy a powerball ticket.

2994
02:41:14,270 --> 02:41:15,740
I think Chappelle had that joke.
He's like,

2995
02:41:15,741 --> 02:41:19,130
you don't think they're starving kids
in Africa thinking about food, right?

2996
02:41:19,780 --> 02:41:24,300
They don't get drew out a nice roast
beef sandwich. Any common exactly that,

2997
02:41:24,310 --> 02:41:24,940
don't get me wrong.

2998
02:41:24,940 --> 02:41:27,290
There's plenty of things that I've
thought about that I've manifested,

2999
02:41:27,291 --> 02:41:31,160
but like you said, I took the steps to
go put in the work. Like there's focus,

3000
02:41:31,161 --> 02:41:32,630
there's a process discipline.

3001
02:41:32,660 --> 02:41:34,880
I've got this theory called
putting the weed in the bag,

3002
02:41:34,910 --> 02:41:35,571
you know what I'm saying?

3003
02:41:35,571 --> 02:41:39,200
And they came from the movie belly because
nod and Dmx was sitting at this table

3004
02:41:39,201 --> 02:41:41,500
with these two young kids and they were
bagging up the weed and all the kids was

3005
02:41:41,501 --> 02:41:43,010
like, y'all want to go
thank you money with y'all.

3006
02:41:43,180 --> 02:41:45,230
I want to go out there and get
money at Dmx is like, what are the,

3007
02:41:45,231 --> 02:41:47,630
we in the back first didn't
go out there and get money.

3008
02:41:47,720 --> 02:41:51,640
You have to go through the process
so we can start with a thought. Yeah,

3009
02:41:51,800 --> 02:41:54,450
but you still gotta execute.
Put some fucking work in.

3010
02:41:54,600 --> 02:41:56,110
All right.
I remember I was talking to this girl,

3011
02:41:56,111 --> 02:41:58,750
she was a friend of a friend of
mine and she was telling me how, um,

3012
02:41:58,780 --> 02:42:03,400
I found the secret and my life is
going to be amazing now and I'm gonna,

3013
02:42:03,580 --> 02:42:06,810
I'm going to get married and I'm going
to meet the right man. Never ever.

3014
02:42:06,811 --> 02:42:08,470
It was like, okay. And then I ran into,

3015
02:42:08,500 --> 02:42:11,530
like a year later she came to one of
my comedy shows and I'm a, I'm like,

3016
02:42:11,531 --> 02:42:14,030
how's everything going? She was like, I
don't get it. I've been using the seat.

3017
02:42:14,070 --> 02:42:17,900
Good. But I, life is a
mess. My father's in jail.

3018
02:42:21,440 --> 02:42:23,390
She was a sweetheart of a person,

3019
02:42:23,391 --> 02:42:26,780
but she really believed that
her life was going to transform.

3020
02:42:26,781 --> 02:42:29,420
I'll never forget the juxtaposition
of those two conversations.

3021
02:42:29,460 --> 02:42:33,180
That's why that's why the
position that we're in in media,

3022
02:42:33,390 --> 02:42:35,510
you have to be very responsible
with these positioning. Yeah.

3023
02:42:35,760 --> 02:42:38,790
Malcolm X and Malcolm x at the person
who controls the media controls the minds

3024
02:42:38,791 --> 02:42:41,220
of the masses. So you have
to be very, very responsible.

3025
02:42:41,360 --> 02:42:44,730
What do you remember when you used to
get a lot of flack for putting on just

3026
02:42:44,731 --> 02:42:47,400
different voices that people
didn't agree with? Yeah.

3027
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:50,970
Like why are you giving these people
a platform platform? I'm like, Yo,

3028
02:42:51,510 --> 02:42:54,390
everybody deserves to
be heard. Yeah, I guess

3029
02:42:54,590 --> 02:42:58,660
man, I'm not everybody but I just, I want
to know how people think too. I want to,

3030
02:42:58,661 --> 02:42:59,890
uh,
even if I don't agree with it,

3031
02:42:59,900 --> 02:43:02,750
especially if people you don't want to
go with that conversation isn't a co sign

3032
02:43:02,870 --> 02:43:05,480
and I think that's what we owe.
We often mistake

3033
02:43:06,030 --> 02:43:09,330
in this day and age two was especially
on the left that so many people are

3034
02:43:09,331 --> 02:43:12,400
talking about d platforming.
You want a d platform

3035
02:43:12,400 --> 02:43:15,850
people, I don't like to know. I don't
like that. Like you might get either.

3036
02:43:15,851 --> 02:43:18,700
I saw people getting mad at Lavar ball
this week, you know what I'm saying?

3037
02:43:18,701 --> 02:43:21,990
Because of the comments he made the
Molly on ESPN, which I didn't, I didn't.

3038
02:43:22,270 --> 02:43:23,560
He just was like, she was like, Hey,

3039
02:43:23,561 --> 02:43:25,390
let's shift gears and you said you
can shift gears with me anytime.

3040
02:43:26,050 --> 02:43:29,330
[inaudible] he said it just like that.
You can still be in the meeting.

3041
02:43:29,350 --> 02:43:31,790
He didn't say, he didn't whisper that
you could shift good placeholder.

3042
02:43:32,140 --> 02:43:36,230
If she had said, hey, let's switch it up.
He would say, hey, you switch it on me.

3043
02:43:38,030 --> 02:43:40,900
But every people was like, oh, they need
to stop putting them on ESPN. I'm like,

3044
02:43:40,901 --> 02:43:41,734
wait a minute,
Huh?

3045
02:43:42,190 --> 02:43:45,550
Literally just last year y'all was saying
he was the drunk uncle at the picnic

3046
02:43:45,551 --> 02:43:47,290
and you love him or hate him.

3047
02:43:47,291 --> 02:43:50,740
He's good entertainment but that now
because he said that you want to take them

3048
02:43:50,741 --> 02:43:53,380
off and I'm like, we got to stop
doing that because guess what?

3049
02:43:53,410 --> 02:43:56,650
Every single one of us is going to
say something that is going to offend

3050
02:43:56,651 --> 02:44:00,880
somebody at some point. Now that doesn't
mean that we shouldn't have a platform.

3051
02:44:00,881 --> 02:44:04,120
I'm not calling nobody to get killed,
but also makes things fun.

3052
02:44:04,390 --> 02:44:06,310
When people say stupid shit sometimes.

3053
02:44:06,550 --> 02:44:08,890
You know when Steven Smith
was going off about Andrew,

3054
02:44:08,891 --> 02:44:12,870
he's winning the title looks like Butter
Bean. This is a disgrace. There was mad.

3055
02:44:12,871 --> 02:44:16,750
I'm like, the guy is speaking the way
he would speak if you are around him.

3056
02:44:17,230 --> 02:44:20,170
You gotta appreciate that. Unless you
want everybody to be Ryan Seacrest,

3057
02:44:20,320 --> 02:44:22,720
you should fucking appreciate not
there's anything wrong Ryan Seacrest,

3058
02:44:22,870 --> 02:44:26,320
but you should appreciate someone who
just giving you what they really think.

3059
02:44:26,580 --> 02:44:30,160
Yes we do. That's why he's so
popular. We pretend to hate it,

3060
02:44:30,400 --> 02:44:33,160
but the reality is we're going to keep
listening. The second one gets a result.

3061
02:44:33,161 --> 02:44:35,590
So pay attention. A lot of
people like, ah, all right,

3062
02:44:35,880 --> 02:44:39,490
that's the America feeds off of that.
She, that's why Donald Trump is president.

3063
02:44:39,850 --> 02:44:41,920
That's why the Kardashians are
still viable. I caught that.

3064
02:44:41,940 --> 02:44:44,620
She's the first family drama.
Every year.

3065
02:44:44,680 --> 02:44:48,370
Every year they find a new piece of
trauma. Once shit gets calm and cool,

3066
02:44:48,430 --> 02:44:51,520
the show ends. So they need
a new piece of drama. Oh,

3067
02:44:51,521 --> 02:44:53,930
who you got cheated on this year? Who's
going to have a baby? You're gonna,

3068
02:44:53,950 --> 02:44:56,740
you gonna get a baby. But
whatever it is every year, hey,

3069
02:44:56,800 --> 02:45:00,220
you're going to chop your dick off.
But you respect her for with Kim,

3070
02:45:00,250 --> 02:45:04,840
she is getting people out of jail going
forward. I can go back before that.

3071
02:45:04,841 --> 02:45:06,730
I respect the Kardashians
because if we really,

3072
02:45:06,970 --> 02:45:09,790
really pay attention to the Kardashian's
over the past 10 years, first of all,

3073
02:45:09,791 --> 02:45:11,890
you got to put them up there with some
of the greatest dynasties of all time.

3074
02:45:12,160 --> 02:45:16,000
This is Lakers. This is patriots. This
is fucking, they've made billions. Yes.

3075
02:45:16,060 --> 02:45:18,220
Billions with a B.
So many,

3076
02:45:18,430 --> 02:45:22,240
so many social conversations have
started because of the car dashes.

3077
02:45:22,300 --> 02:45:25,440
You're talking about interracial
relationships. You're talking about, uh,

3078
02:45:25,570 --> 02:45:29,950
the transgender thing. You're talking
about drug use and mental health.

3079
02:45:29,951 --> 02:45:32,560
With Kanye plastic surgery,

3080
02:45:32,950 --> 02:45:35,770
they did change the shape of
American women. They changed,

3081
02:45:36,640 --> 02:45:41,350
they changed asses. They made that
whole fat relocation thing popular.

3082
02:45:41,650 --> 02:45:43,030
They suck it out of your waist,
turn your,

3083
02:45:43,100 --> 02:45:46,390
wasting this little thing and turn
your ass into this ridiculous platform.

3084
02:45:46,420 --> 02:45:50,050
But Real Kim. Kim learned that from black
women though because people forget Kim.

3085
02:45:50,350 --> 02:45:52,350
But that's a bile. The when, when the,

3086
02:45:52,360 --> 02:45:56,170
when you would look at someone who really
has it. It's different. Absolutely.

3087
02:45:56,410 --> 02:45:59,470
You will see a woman who
has a big ass naturally.

3088
02:45:59,471 --> 02:46:03,340
It looks like it belongs on hers.
It's a different thing. Yeah.

3089
02:46:03,570 --> 02:46:08,050
They thick legs. They're there.
They're fucking genetically superior.

3090
02:46:08,051 --> 02:46:11,610
Built like a Turkey. Built sexy.
Yeah. Kim. Kim is inspiration.

3091
02:46:11,870 --> 02:46:15,610
People don't rip from Jim and Kim
came up in the black circuit. Right.

3092
02:46:15,700 --> 02:46:19,370
She did king magazine and smooth.
That's right. That's right.

3093
02:46:19,371 --> 02:46:23,240
You know what I'm saying?
Wendy Williams radio show earlier.

3094
02:46:23,241 --> 02:46:25,320
That's what I'm better. I met her when
I was going to read it with Whitney.

3095
02:46:25,460 --> 02:46:27,470
He knew her before she
was ever on anything.

3096
02:46:27,471 --> 02:46:30,480
When she was [inaudible] who's assistant?
Some of the system was Paris Hilton.

3097
02:46:30,740 --> 02:46:33,300
She's the organizer to organize
closets for Paris Hill.

3098
02:46:33,330 --> 02:46:37,370
I got a old picture like me and
Kim from like 2006 different,

3099
02:46:38,500 --> 02:46:42,650
what I will say,
she always had that vision.

3100
02:46:42,890 --> 02:46:47,690
She used to always say, I'm going to do
what Paris is doing times a hundred wow.

3101
02:46:48,590 --> 02:46:51,080
She motherfucking did it.
The secrets she used.

3102
02:46:51,081 --> 02:46:53,780
The secret secret is black deck.

3103
02:46:53,960 --> 02:46:56,810
That's the secret smoke a black cock.

3104
02:46:57,810 --> 02:47:00,790
It's amazing that that kicked her off
because it used to be the kiss of death.

3105
02:47:00,791 --> 02:47:01,790
If a girl did porn,

3106
02:47:02,030 --> 02:47:05,150
that was the hand Lisa and she
was the one to break that down.

3107
02:47:05,210 --> 02:47:07,310
Well what's it to her,
Jenna Jamison.

3108
02:47:07,430 --> 02:47:11,150
I think Jenna Jameson was the first one
to become actually popular outside of

3109
02:47:11,151 --> 02:47:11,961
porn.
Oh,

3110
02:47:11,961 --> 02:47:14,560
I thought you meant like the first person
to break like the racial barrier and

3111
02:47:14,561 --> 02:47:17,270
pull pulling on purpose. She was
the first to break the racial part,

3112
02:47:17,300 --> 02:47:20,180
but I mean doing porn
periods where you can be,

3113
02:47:20,300 --> 02:47:24,000
where you could be a celeb outside
and you talk about radio. Uh,

3114
02:47:24,090 --> 02:47:27,800
it's not too many people that came up off
celebrity sex tapes as long as few and

3115
02:47:27,801 --> 02:47:30,950
far between that really popped off.
Who made it off the sex?

3116
02:47:30,951 --> 02:47:33,650
Do you remember when girls were showing
him [inaudible] they were showing their

3117
02:47:33,651 --> 02:47:34,790
pussy on purpose.

3118
02:47:35,070 --> 02:47:40,070
You remember [inaudible] camera
just happened to be down with that.

3119
02:47:40,331 --> 02:47:42,230
Pussy is, yeah. Fuck.

3120
02:47:42,231 --> 02:47:46,460
Did you not know that camera was
down near your pussy up? Yeah.

3121
02:47:47,870 --> 02:47:51,950
That's a lot of confidence to put climbing
out of the car is showing their pussy.

3122
02:47:52,130 --> 02:47:55,700
Not a lot of trainers chill. What is
happening you not a lot of witch fingers.

3123
02:47:56,900 --> 02:48:01,640
That's all the more reason you
got to say Kim k Bro. Sat grow.

3124
02:48:01,641 --> 02:48:04,580
That was happening on a cause and you
could see her vagina and was doing sex

3125
02:48:04,581 --> 02:48:08,450
tapes is out here getting prison as free
is doing that. I don't give a fuck. Yeah.

3126
02:48:08,510 --> 02:48:11,480
I don't give a fuck if she's best
friends with Donald Trump. I don't care.

3127
02:48:11,650 --> 02:48:12,321
That's my thing.
Right?

3128
02:48:12,321 --> 02:48:15,890
If you care about prison reform to care
about criminal justice reform, yes.

3129
02:48:15,950 --> 02:48:19,910
You should be happy that these people
are getting out. Yeah. Worried about, oh,

3130
02:48:19,911 --> 02:48:22,860
she's doing it in the White House with
Donald Trump. Who gives a shit. You,

3131
02:48:23,080 --> 02:48:27,060
you think the guy who just
did 15 years for nothing,

3132
02:48:27,140 --> 02:48:30,740
nothing cares what president let him out.
She doesn't have to do this.

3133
02:48:31,130 --> 02:48:33,740
She could just be buying cars
and getting her nails done.

3134
02:48:33,741 --> 02:48:38,741
She's choosing to spend her time to get
these people that are unjustly accused

3135
02:48:39,021 --> 02:48:43,720
and convicted and get them released
and that and Trump like him or not,

3136
02:48:43,721 --> 02:48:46,310
and he's listening to her and he's
helping her at that. But you know why?

3137
02:48:46,400 --> 02:48:48,450
Because he's a celebrity.
He understands the and go.

3138
02:48:48,810 --> 02:48:51,860
So you keep sending all these politicians
to talk to a celebrity. That shit,

3139
02:48:51,861 --> 02:48:53,240
that shit goes over his head.

3140
02:48:53,640 --> 02:48:57,470
You've got to send another celebrity to
get in his ear because he understands

3141
02:48:57,471 --> 02:48:59,600
that type of lane.
He just understands that their power,

3142
02:48:59,720 --> 02:49:01,490
he understands where they're reaches.

3143
02:49:01,491 --> 02:49:04,910
He knows the Kim k doing something is
way more valuable than some random,

3144
02:49:04,940 --> 02:49:07,500
you know, democratic congress
person. Are you seeing that much now?

3145
02:49:07,501 --> 02:49:08,370
You look at Capitol Hill

3146
02:49:08,370 --> 02:49:12,540
the past few weeks, you see you're not,
I was there meeting Bti in David Gross,

3147
02:49:12,541 --> 02:49:14,280
what they're talking about
opportunities on legislation.

3148
02:49:14,281 --> 02:49:17,460
I was there with Taraji talking about
bringing social emotional learning in

3149
02:49:17,461 --> 02:49:20,790
schools. In therapy. You
had a a tiny, he see Colton.

3150
02:49:20,791 --> 02:49:23,910
Danny Glover was dead this week talking
about HR 40 you had John Stewart.

3151
02:49:23,911 --> 02:49:28,260
They're talking about the victims of
nine 11 now be compensated by the way,

3152
02:49:28,261 --> 02:49:30,600
to nine 11 shit. I didn't even
know that was going on, Bro.

3153
02:49:30,720 --> 02:49:32,160
If Jon Stewart hadn't had done that,

3154
02:49:32,250 --> 02:49:35,850
that I would've never even known that
was going on and that is fucked up.

3155
02:49:35,851 --> 02:49:38,820
And it was a simple statement. The
people you said you would never forget,

3156
02:49:39,120 --> 02:49:43,230
you forgot, whoo, that's not going to
win. Nobody's, hey, anybody can get that.

3157
02:49:43,231 --> 02:49:45,930
You can be with no teeth sitting in
fucking South Carolina in a trailer park.

3158
02:49:45,931 --> 02:49:47,510
You understand it.
You understand that link.

3159
02:49:48,070 --> 02:49:52,190
It doesn't have to do that. Let's do that
because he needs to. It's in him. Yeah.

3160
02:49:52,220 --> 02:49:53,820
It gives you a different sense of purpose.
Yeah.

3161
02:49:54,200 --> 02:49:55,340
Like that's what really means something.

3162
02:49:55,341 --> 02:49:58,040
When you talk to me about talking
about anxiety and mental health,

3163
02:49:58,041 --> 02:50:01,370
like the past couple of years, I feel
like I've been walking in my purpose,

3164
02:50:01,760 --> 02:50:02,031
you know?

3165
02:50:02,031 --> 02:50:05,150
Because I truly feel like if we can get
more people to deal with their mental

3166
02:50:05,151 --> 02:50:05,984
health issues,

3167
02:50:06,260 --> 02:50:10,190
you'll reduce so much of the
other bullshit we complaining
about in in America,

3168
02:50:10,460 --> 02:50:12,860
the violence,
the gun shootings.

3169
02:50:12,980 --> 02:50:15,770
Because when you've got a bunch of people
who have never dealt with that trauma,

3170
02:50:15,771 --> 02:50:19,040
never dealt with their pain and
their hurt, hurt people, hurt people,

3171
02:50:19,160 --> 02:50:21,680
and all we do is go around
redistributing that pain. The others,

3172
02:50:21,681 --> 02:50:24,770
you think murderers and rapists do that.
She could just put the thrill of it. No,

3173
02:50:24,771 --> 02:50:29,000
they are broken, damaged people so they
go and break in damage other people.

3174
02:50:29,120 --> 02:50:32,030
So if you can get people to deal
with their mental health issues, man,

3175
02:50:32,031 --> 02:50:34,400
that's the foundation of it all.
To me that's the real secret.

3176
02:50:35,240 --> 02:50:37,460
Getting to the root of that shit.
Yeah.

3177
02:50:37,461 --> 02:50:41,730
There is a thing about about purpose
that like what happens I think when,

3178
02:50:41,731 --> 02:50:45,260
when some people reach
financial independence and
I mean like fuck you money

3179
02:50:45,320 --> 02:50:47,930
meaning like you don't have
to work anymore, your family
good. Everything is good.

3180
02:50:47,931 --> 02:50:50,150
Yeah.
You have some people go,

3181
02:50:50,151 --> 02:50:52,520
well I'm going to get even more money
and I'm going to become a billionaire and

3182
02:50:52,521 --> 02:50:54,590
a trillion or whatever
and then some people go,

3183
02:50:55,070 --> 02:50:57,650
I'm going to live life
instead of survive it.

3184
02:50:57,860 --> 02:51:00,320
Or if you're working every
week so you can get a paycheck.

3185
02:51:00,500 --> 02:51:02,690
There's absolutely nothing wrong with
that. That's a majority of people are.

3186
02:51:02,720 --> 02:51:05,240
But you are surviving. Yes. That, that,

3187
02:51:05,241 --> 02:51:07,760
that job is no different than being out
there in the forest trying to find some

3188
02:51:07,761 --> 02:51:11,240
foods you can eat. We have some
shelter, you get financial dependence,

3189
02:51:11,241 --> 02:51:14,600
you have the opportunity to truly do
whatever you want every single day with

3190
02:51:14,601 --> 02:51:18,680
your life. Yes. And some people
go, you know what I want to do.

3191
02:51:19,100 --> 02:51:24,100
I want to go to fucking DC and help out
with these causes or I want to put on a

3192
02:51:25,221 --> 02:51:27,170
whole comedy community.
You know what I mean?

3193
02:51:27,171 --> 02:51:30,110
And like you really put it on your back.
I want to help other people out.

3194
02:51:30,111 --> 02:51:32,600
I want to have these conversations
and just talk shit about, you know,

3195
02:51:32,601 --> 02:51:34,340
fucking magic having HIV,
whatever it is.

3196
02:51:34,730 --> 02:51:38,000
We're actually choosing to
do the things that we enjoy.

3197
02:51:38,140 --> 02:51:39,250
Cause you realize it was important.

3198
02:51:39,280 --> 02:51:40,520
Like even when you're talking
about something like that,

3199
02:51:40,521 --> 02:51:41,740
but it's only when
these known legislation,

3200
02:51:41,770 --> 02:51:44,410
I feel like that goes hand in hand with
mental health because the environment is

3201
02:51:44,411 --> 02:51:47,830
so important. So if you can, you know,
get into these, these, these, these,

3202
02:51:47,831 --> 02:51:48,431
these communities,

3203
02:51:48,431 --> 02:51:51,370
these points just in franchise areas and
you can start putting things in these

3204
02:51:51,371 --> 02:51:53,680
communities that people actually need.
Like in the hood,

3205
02:51:53,890 --> 02:51:57,340
you replaced the liquor stores and
the fucking chicken spots in the check

3206
02:51:57,341 --> 02:52:02,341
cashing places with juice bars and
mental health spas and wellness centers,

3207
02:52:03,371 --> 02:52:05,200
things that people actually need.

3208
02:52:05,470 --> 02:52:08,380
Now you're creating an environment where
people can thrive in instead of just

3209
02:52:08,381 --> 02:52:10,660
trying to fucking survive in.
Yeah. You know what I'm saying?

3210
02:52:10,661 --> 02:52:13,210
You can't properly deal with your mental
health if you're trying to survive

3211
02:52:13,211 --> 02:52:13,920
every fucking day.

3212
02:52:13,920 --> 02:52:16,710
Well I think what you're doing is very
important as you're bringing up that

3213
02:52:16,711 --> 02:52:17,550
conversation.

3214
02:52:17,580 --> 02:52:20,910
That conversation wasn't taking place
before the mental health conversation

3215
02:52:20,911 --> 02:52:24,920
about anxiety amongst cool, successful
people. It just wasn't happening. Yeah.

3216
02:52:25,020 --> 02:52:28,290
Everybody was pretending everybody
was there. They're hiding from it.

3217
02:52:28,380 --> 02:52:29,510
You can use secrets like you've got,

3218
02:52:29,550 --> 02:52:31,990
you've got the float tank in
your fucking compound. Yeah.

3219
02:52:32,460 --> 02:52:36,200
Are you telling people about
that? Oh yeah. Okay. I'm the,

3220
02:52:36,210 --> 02:52:40,950
one of the reasons why that thing became
popular again. I got one in 2002 wow.

3221
02:52:41,040 --> 02:52:43,800
Yeah. I didn't do it for the first
time like three weeks ago. Yeah, man.

3222
02:52:43,801 --> 02:52:46,530
If you go to some float places,
they'll ask you how he found out about it.

3223
02:52:46,531 --> 02:52:48,390
It's like,
did you find out from the Internet,

3224
02:52:48,420 --> 02:52:51,540
Yelp and then they'll say Joe Rogan.
That's why one of the,

3225
02:52:51,570 --> 02:52:55,110
cause I talk about it so much as videos
of me. I gave one away. I gave one. No,

3226
02:52:55,111 --> 02:52:57,550
I had bought a new one and I said
I'm going to give one away to,

3227
02:52:57,590 --> 02:53:01,230
and I just got random emails and I picked
one of them had it sent to this guy's

3228
02:53:01,231 --> 02:53:02,310
house,
had it set up.

3229
02:53:02,610 --> 02:53:04,940
I just cause I want people to
know about what these things are.

3230
02:53:05,070 --> 02:53:09,290
Never felt stillness like I felt inside
the float tank. Yeah, it's amazing.

3231
02:53:09,291 --> 02:53:11,540
It's like, you know, at first you're like,
okay, they want you to get butt naked.

3232
02:53:11,541 --> 02:53:13,320
You don't know if they and you,
you know what the fuck's going on.

3233
02:53:13,440 --> 02:53:14,990
You know what I'm saying?
And then they're like, no,

3234
02:53:14,991 --> 02:53:18,940
that's complete a lot of confidence
in your cock. I wasn't even swinging.

3235
02:53:18,941 --> 02:53:22,400
And I'm a, I'm a, I'm a grower, not a
short, my shit is like swinging that.

3236
02:53:23,680 --> 02:53:25,900
Actually I was trying to think it
was all church say bro, I can't,

3237
02:53:26,310 --> 02:53:28,850
I actually would try to make it a little
chubby just in case you can't trust

3238
02:53:28,851 --> 02:53:30,820
these people. I don't know.
Trust. How do I go, Oh fuck,

3239
02:53:30,830 --> 02:53:32,240
I might be recording me in this shit.

3240
02:53:32,490 --> 02:53:35,120
So the lights went off and it's
like when you first get in,

3241
02:53:36,050 --> 02:53:39,500
it's allowing yourself to relax because
at first year fighting it a little bit,

3242
02:53:39,501 --> 02:53:41,300
you got your head up, you're
like, I don't know if I'm a drown,

3243
02:53:41,560 --> 02:53:43,930
but when you finally just relax,
you don't,

3244
02:53:43,970 --> 02:53:45,510
you don't even know what
the fucking I went. Right.

3245
02:53:45,900 --> 02:53:49,040
And I've never experienced the level
of students like that. It was point,

3246
02:53:49,041 --> 02:53:52,010
it was period where I thought I was
actually, I'm like, am I alive right now?

3247
02:53:52,510 --> 02:53:56,580
Right. Because your eyes are open, but
it's totally dark. It's totally dark.

3248
02:53:56,581 --> 02:53:58,970
So you don't know if you're really sleep,
you don't fill the water,

3249
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,640
you don't feel the water. You don't know
if you're in and out of consciousness.

3250
02:54:02,170 --> 02:54:04,610
It's, it's, it's wild.
Everybody should do floods.

3251
02:54:04,860 --> 02:54:06,210
Yeah,
I agree.

3252
02:54:06,720 --> 02:54:10,230
What is the hardest part
about having influence?

3253
02:54:17,010 --> 02:54:20,520
That's a nice pregnant pause. I was
dope. Right? Yeah. And then the clap.

3254
02:54:20,600 --> 02:54:25,600
Who's going like [inaudible] the cameras.

3255
02:54:27,630 --> 02:54:29,660
Cameras switch.
Well timed.

3256
02:54:29,850 --> 02:54:32,430
Yeah. I Dunno. What's the hardest,
I don't think about it that way.

3257
02:54:32,650 --> 02:54:35,670
The thing you're very,
there's very,

3258
02:54:35,671 --> 02:54:38,490
there's very few people that you have
the opportunity to have the kind of

3259
02:54:38,491 --> 02:54:43,470
influence that you or I have or
you, it's a, it's, it's very,

3260
02:54:43,471 --> 02:54:48,420
very strange. I think you gotta
realize what harm you can do.

3261
02:54:48,750 --> 02:54:50,160
You gotta be careful when the,

3262
02:54:50,161 --> 02:54:53,190
the kinds of things you say are the
kind of things you promote, you know,

3263
02:54:53,191 --> 02:54:56,190
the kind of things that you
sign off on or agree to.

3264
02:54:56,610 --> 02:55:00,510
And I think there's also a responsibility
to tell people about cool shit.

3265
02:55:00,800 --> 02:55:03,770
I tell people about things
that have benefited you to
help help people about how

3266
02:55:03,771 --> 02:55:03,980
you've

3267
02:55:03,980 --> 02:55:07,310
overcome your own personal mistakes. I
think all those things are very important.

3268
02:55:07,790 --> 02:55:08,361
Yeah.
I never,

3269
02:55:08,361 --> 02:55:11,450
I never even thought about having
influence until like the past three,

3270
02:55:11,451 --> 02:55:15,260
four years because you know, I'm just
out here doing my thing. Just doing it.

3271
02:55:15,800 --> 02:55:16,370
When you read,

3272
02:55:16,370 --> 02:55:21,370
when you realize you are having influence
and a lot of that influence could be

3273
02:55:22,130 --> 02:55:26,840
negative. Yeah. That's when
you realize like, Oh shit,

3274
02:55:26,930 --> 02:55:30,320
let me make sure I'm doing the
right things with these platforms.

3275
02:55:30,321 --> 02:55:30,681
You know what I mean?

3276
02:55:30,681 --> 02:55:34,120
Let me make sure I'm bringing on the
right voices that people can learn from.

3277
02:55:34,130 --> 02:55:36,920
Let me make sure I'm telling people about
the things in my life that are making

3278
02:55:36,921 --> 02:55:38,510
me a better person.

3279
02:55:38,540 --> 02:55:41,420
So for me it's like the best compliment
I get nowadays when people say, man,

3280
02:55:41,421 --> 02:55:45,050
you really grown like you've, you've
really evolved. Like it's visible.

3281
02:55:45,051 --> 02:55:46,630
People can see it.
Yeah.

3282
02:55:46,880 --> 02:55:49,880
That right there lets me know I'm
putting out the right energy into the

3283
02:55:49,881 --> 02:55:50,570
ecosystem.

3284
02:55:50,570 --> 02:55:54,890
It also people become inspired
to seek that same kind of path.

3285
02:55:54,891 --> 02:55:56,480
When someone in the public eye,

3286
02:55:56,481 --> 02:56:01,370
like yourself and they see you grow and
expand and change your views on things.

3287
02:56:01,700 --> 02:56:05,570
It also inspires other people to open
up themselves and change their own

3288
02:56:05,571 --> 02:56:08,810
perspective and enhance their
own way of looking at the world.

3289
02:56:08,880 --> 02:56:12,850
I can admit when I'm wrong, y'all said,
I've said a lot of fucked up wild shit.

3290
02:56:14,700 --> 02:56:18,190
You're going to live on the air,
you're not reading a script right now.

3291
02:56:18,290 --> 02:56:20,000
You're free balling.
It's going to happen.

3292
02:56:20,120 --> 02:56:23,330
And I think the worst thing that can
happen too is like for me, you know,

3293
02:56:23,331 --> 02:56:25,280
breakfast club has only been
going on for nine years.

3294
02:56:25,281 --> 02:56:28,790
So I never had experienced this
level of attention. And you know,

3295
02:56:28,820 --> 02:56:31,310
you start reading things
about yourself in the media,

3296
02:56:31,311 --> 02:56:34,430
like you read real articles and be like,
oh the hip hop Howard Stern.

3297
02:56:34,430 --> 02:56:36,500
And I'm like, oh, so I gotta be like,

3298
02:56:36,501 --> 02:56:40,530
how would so I gotta give him more of
that shit. So what Howard though? Right?

3299
02:56:41,180 --> 02:56:44,670
Cause I'm giving them a little
bit of nineties I was like, what?

3300
02:56:44,720 --> 02:56:49,400
How would do yo fuck no. So it's just
like you can get caught up in that,

3301
02:56:49,880 --> 02:56:53,420
you know, you could get caught up in
what people's expectations of you are.

3302
02:56:53,530 --> 02:56:54,890
You change who you're,
you know,

3303
02:56:54,950 --> 02:56:57,770
a lot of people say that
happens to a certain comedians,

3304
02:56:57,771 --> 02:57:01,220
so they become their character.
Dice. I was going to bring up,

3305
02:57:01,221 --> 02:57:03,050
his name is Andrew Silverstein. Yeah. Dot.

3306
02:57:03,051 --> 02:57:07,610
The dice man character that he
would do in his bit. He would do,

3307
02:57:07,850 --> 02:57:11,180
he was doing a routine where
he would be John Travolta.

3308
02:57:11,181 --> 02:57:14,270
He would do a Sylvester strong and then
he would do this character called the

3309
02:57:14,271 --> 02:57:18,890
dice man. And that part was so funny
and so good. It took over his whole act.

3310
02:57:19,100 --> 02:57:21,450
I went toe to toe with dice
one time. Toe to toe. Yeah,

3311
02:57:21,460 --> 02:57:24,340
on Wendy Williams show back in the
day when I was Wendy's a sidekick.

3312
02:57:24,380 --> 02:57:25,630
And you the Wendy VH one.

3313
02:57:25,640 --> 02:57:28,310
Wendy had a show on VH one and Andrew
dice clay had a show on VH one so they

3314
02:57:28,311 --> 02:57:31,460
bought him on to promote it and
like we just ended up going,

3315
02:57:31,461 --> 02:57:34,370
but I don't know why the fuck me
ended up going to happen. Yes.

3316
02:57:34,620 --> 02:57:38,780
And and like VH one edited it to make it
look like he like kind of fucked me up.

3317
02:57:38,781 --> 02:57:42,410
But they kept a couple of mine mining.
He was really upset. Like I called him,

3318
02:57:42,411 --> 02:57:45,220
I said, you're like a fat Fonzie. Fuck

3319
02:57:47,680 --> 02:57:50,180
fucking loved it.
He was like,

3320
02:57:50,660 --> 02:57:55,460
fuck are you fucking one is basketball
fucking living? And I'm like, Oh shit,

3321
02:57:55,550 --> 02:58:00,080
it's on and got his shoes on. I'm
like, you fucking laugh at that.

3322
02:58:00,110 --> 02:58:02,000
I thought it was funny.
I want to be able to laugh

3323
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:04,710
at that. If I looked like a
fat Fonzie be like, Oh shit,

3324
02:58:06,940 --> 02:58:09,190
you'd have to go. I was on, as I told you,

3325
02:58:09,200 --> 02:58:12,300
he going to discontinue terminate a model.
You remember

3326
02:58:13,960 --> 02:58:14,940
did that.

3327
02:58:17,690 --> 02:58:20,120
But what you said is real cause I'd
never want to become a character,

3328
02:58:20,121 --> 02:58:21,160
chill my say.
Yeah.

3329
02:58:21,380 --> 02:58:24,410
And I feel like it was a certain point
in my life where I was becoming a

3330
02:58:24,411 --> 02:58:27,570
character of myself and it's like,
well that's not real.

3331
02:58:27,571 --> 02:58:31,640
Like you can't claim claim to be a real
person and be out here pretending to be

3332
02:58:31,641 --> 02:58:33,420
real. You either really you not. Yeah.

3333
02:58:33,500 --> 02:58:37,430
And what's real is yo being
honest about going to a therapist,

3334
02:58:37,431 --> 02:58:40,550
what's real as being honest about your
mental health issues was really talking

3335
02:58:40,551 --> 02:58:43,910
about being a father.
Like real shit.

3336
02:58:43,940 --> 02:58:47,840
Like you can't always be trying
to be cool. It's not cool.

3337
02:58:47,841 --> 02:58:52,530
That's fake only existed when there was
like some sort of, uh, you're, you're,

3338
02:58:52,580 --> 02:58:54,500
you're projecting something.

3339
02:58:54,501 --> 02:58:56,360
You're putting something out
there in these small bits.

3340
02:58:56,540 --> 02:58:57,470
When you're doing what you do,

3341
02:58:57,471 --> 02:59:00,530
when you're talking for hours and
hours on gotta be you gotta be you,

3342
02:59:00,550 --> 02:59:01,930
you at the end of the day,
it's going to come out.

3343
02:59:03,690 --> 02:59:05,570
And then people with the longest careers,

3344
02:59:05,720 --> 02:59:08,790
I feel like are the people
who evolve born time. Boom.

3345
02:59:09,440 --> 02:59:12,380
You could see the guys
who have real growth,

3346
02:59:12,381 --> 02:59:15,410
like how it started in the beginning
when we really think about Howard,

3347
02:59:15,790 --> 02:59:18,080
like chicks were queesland on speakers.

3348
02:59:18,770 --> 02:59:23,720
That was a normal thing in the
Howard stern radio show is come in.

3349
02:59:23,721 --> 02:59:26,480
Who has the loudest Queef on the speaker?
They're lucky.

3350
02:59:26,481 --> 02:59:28,090
The Tiffany Haddish
wasn't around back then.

3351
02:59:28,180 --> 02:59:31,740
That's cause he, cause it would
be over six that Microsoft Pussy,

3352
02:59:31,800 --> 02:59:35,520
she makes a canon sound.
It doesn't even make sense.

3353
02:59:36,510 --> 02:59:40,830
She's like large had midgets into
the fucking atmosphere. Yeah.

3354
02:59:40,831 --> 02:59:44,190
She used to do that all the time.
She would quantify what she's shameless.

3355
02:59:44,270 --> 02:59:45,103
That lady

3356
02:59:45,880 --> 02:59:49,990
give a fuck.
[inaudible] guys to fucker like on comedy.

3357
02:59:50,380 --> 02:59:54,610
Oh y'all. Well there's not allowed. I'm
kind of an elitist approach to comedy.

3358
02:59:54,611 --> 02:59:58,870
It's quite interesting. He likes and
he likes bars. He says he likes jokes.

3359
02:59:58,871 --> 03:00:01,810
He doesn't like school.
Fucking still fucking,

3360
03:00:01,840 --> 03:00:05,820
if it's the right bit can be funny,
but it has to be the right.

3361
03:00:05,930 --> 03:00:10,210
It has to be a real comic with a
real reason to fuck that stool.

3362
03:00:10,270 --> 03:00:13,300
There has to be something to it. I'm
trying to think of Eddie. Fuck this tool.

3363
03:00:13,320 --> 03:00:17,110
I'm asking. Nobody fucking knows stole
Bro. See, I like Eddie. I like Richard.

3364
03:00:17,111 --> 03:00:20,030
I like Chris Rock. Bless
you. I like Chapelle. You
know what I'm saying? I like,

3365
03:00:20,080 --> 03:00:21,640
I like those guys that actually don't say,

3366
03:00:21,641 --> 03:00:24,880
just say something like have
something in perhaps something to say.

3367
03:00:24,881 --> 03:00:27,760
Louis C K has something
to say like I want,

3368
03:00:27,761 --> 03:00:30,460
I like people that have something to
say. All that stool fucking is, hey,

3369
03:00:30,500 --> 03:00:33,680
I want to get him on stage. I think
he could do it. Oh, you never go down.

3370
03:00:33,700 --> 03:00:36,370
I would not. I would never
disrespect the craft like that.

3371
03:00:36,700 --> 03:00:38,320
Well you wouldn't have to disrespect it.

3372
03:00:38,350 --> 03:00:41,230
You would just have to want to do it and
then try it. Yeah. I don't want to do it.

3373
03:00:41,231 --> 03:00:42,820
I tried to do it for fun.
I don't want to do,

3374
03:00:42,821 --> 03:00:44,740
you don't want to do it if you
don't want to do it, don't do it,

3375
03:00:44,741 --> 03:00:47,620
but you could do it. I tried one weekend
and my first job was like, you know what?

3376
03:00:47,640 --> 03:00:50,670
I'm going to sit down cause I don't
want anybody to ever say Charlene's up.

3377
03:00:50,680 --> 03:00:51,513
You're trying to do.
Stand up.

3378
03:00:52,430 --> 03:00:56,200
If you don't try it. Okay. Maybe don't
try and listen. It's not for everybody.

3379
03:00:56,210 --> 03:00:59,870
[inaudible]

3380
03:01:00,940 --> 03:01:04,270
my bad. Maybe I don't have an eye
for talent. We just did three hours.

3381
03:01:05,720 --> 03:01:10,180
That's how we do it. Let's
bring it home. Uh, Hey Andrew,

3382
03:01:10,210 --> 03:01:15,210
thank you for setting this up
and bring it to a shop to me.

3383
03:01:15,710 --> 03:01:17,270
Shout out to Brendan Schaub.
Um,

3384
03:01:17,350 --> 03:01:19,810
I really do appreciate what
you do for comics though,

3385
03:01:20,220 --> 03:01:24,530
cause I got seen what you do for Andrew
and Jessie Mae Paluso and ms Pat Dyno

3386
03:01:24,530 --> 03:01:27,790
Riley. He's people I really fuck with,
so thank you for that man. My pleasure.

3387
03:01:27,791 --> 03:01:31,330
It's for me, it's a, I'm, I'm honored that
I have the platform to be able to help.

3388
03:01:32,180 --> 03:01:33,470
All right. Bye. Bye.

3389
03:01:34,830 --> 03:01:35,030
Okay.
