Speaker 1:          00:00          Are Listening to radio lab radio lab from W. N. Y. S. E. N. N. P. R. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich. Yep. This is radio lab and a today. Just to start things off for this podcast. All right. Let's just say that you love an author, but somehow the text isn't enough. Okay? It doesn't get you close enough to the author. So what do you do? You know what you do, but take off your shoes. You take off your stocks as you stand on the plan and the book and your whole body. Let me, yeah, let me give you a different flavor that, hello? How about you take the tex, give it to this guy he puts into a computer and you turn it into data?

Speaker 1:          00:51          What do you mean? Who is that I, this is a, My name is Ian Lancashire. I'm a professor of English at the University of Toronto. Now, Ian, as he said, is an English professor, but he's also a computer guy, right. Founded a computing center with the help of IBM Canada. And the reason he combines those two is because he's interested in the secrets behind the authors word and that desire. He says to take a text, spin it the data as a way to get into that author's head. Well, that goes back to long way. It goes back to the fathers of the Christian Church.

Speaker 1:          01:24          It's the Bible. In the early Middle Ages, some monks decided to make what's called a concordance of the Bible. And what that means is they were going to take every single word in the Bible and there are 960,243 of them, at least in the King James version, and they're going to list them all alphabetically, notate each time every single word was used and the context, oh, Yay. Yes. Imagine it. You begin with the first, first. In the beginning you create a heading for the first word n, and then for the second word, Duh. And then for the third beginning, every time you come across those words, you have to write a context. In genesis one verse one the current one in the beginning, genesis one per sixth Kearns two and God said, let there be for a minute in the myths, all handwritten and at the end you n well you end up with a a lot of pieces of paper.

Speaker 1:          02:18          So many that it, it took those first monks, you know, who decided to do this an entire lifetime to complete it. Nowadays, you know, with computers you can be done in under 15 seconds. So that all just basically sets the stage for the story that I'm about to tell you, it's the 1980s Ian is an English professor, Toronto. He's got a lab full of kids computers and he's using them to analyze his favorite authors, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, TSL, IA, James Choice, Cadman, Chaucer, Shakespeare, and he's starting up some interesting stuff sort of, for example, in his poetry, Melton didn't use the word because who knows why. Yeah. But at a certain, Ian decided to look at more modern authors and so I turned to Agatha Christie [inaudible] at the time he was doing this. We're now in the nineties Agatha Christie happened to be the most published author ever. She sold a billion books, a billion, like be billion. She was number one failing God after, after the Bible. I think.

Speaker 1:          03:26          So what I did is I collected two of her earliest novels written in the early twenties fed those 200 Peter and I did the third [inaudible]. Eventually you would add in 14 additional books that cover 50 years of Agatha Christie's writing. What does the computer doing exactly? Measuring the individual concordance, word frequency, vocabulary of the works and all the while it's spitting out these reports. And I saw the totals at the bottom. So all this is first of all, a woman written needling detective Knowles, which is just amazing in and of itself. Something the computer found that her use of language was relatively consistent and normal, uh, for the first 72 of those books. But something happened on book number 73 something drastic. What suddenly her use of words, like words like thing, anything, something, nothing. What Ian Calls indefinite words. These these words increased six times, but also when the computer added up the vocabulary size of that book, that is how many different words are there in the first 50,000 words. If a text it found in this book there were 20% fewer different words. That is astounding. That's one fifth of our vocabulary lost. It gradually dawned on him that what he might be seeing was the very beginning stages of an author

Speaker 2:          04:53          mm

Speaker 1:          04:53          losing herself. She had developed Alzheimer's

Speaker 2:          05:06          [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          05:06          I delayed publishing my results for two years. I had to to have the results analyzed by computational linguist and a statistician and in her lifetime was she ever actually diagnosed? Absolutely not. There was no diagnosis. He said that some of her biographers suspected that something was up in her later years. One point parently she cut off all of her hair. She was not doing very well in interviews as far as we know. She was never taken to a doctor, never got diagnosed. I think her family closed around her and protected her

Speaker 2:          05:40          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          05:41          I realized that I was seeing something about the human mind. I was seeing the author in the text in a way that people hadn't seen the author and the texts before.

Speaker 2:          05:57          Um,

Speaker 1:          05:57          raised the question for me. And I think this can apply to anyone. I mean, we all write a bazillion emails a day. I've got a decades worth on my computer. Does that stuff cold clues about what will be like early warning signs? I think it's possible. It does, yes. And it's well worth doing research about how a loss of vocabulary can be determined, let's say in man's email over five or six years. Indications are, he says that those clues are there. Not only that, they may actually be there practically from the beginning. Oh, Yup. Yup. Very famous example is the so-called none study. Okay. The nun study actually began in 1990 and what's this is Dr Kelvin Lim. He works at the University of Minnesota and is the current director of the so-called none study and this study more than any other that we know really makes the point about the predictive power of the words we choose.

Speaker 1:          06:53          Study began with a guy named David Snowden who wanted to look at aging over time. So he chose nuns because he wanted a group that was healthy. For example, they don't smoke, they don't drink, they all have similar lifestyles, obviously haven't had children. So he approached this one particular order in Connecticut, all the school sisters of Notre Dame and he signed up just short of 700 nuns and the only stipulation being you had to be at least 75 years of age. And so we're now 20 years in the study. So that means the youngest of the sisters is about 90

Speaker 1:          07:26          yeah, I think I am. I am the youngest. And you are 94 years old? Yes sir. Not 95 not 95 this is sister Alberta Sheridan. I like the way you said that. Do you happen to know who the oldest remaining sister in the study is? Wait a minute now. The one who was very today, John was 101 I think she was the oldest one in the study. Wow. In our province. Yes. The study began, uh, innocently enough. She says the researchers would show up to the convent every year, give the nuns a bunch of tests. But like mostly from memory, we just questioning back and forth. Right. And then over the years, as the nuns passed away, which many of them have at this point, they've all gone check of the original 678 sisters. At this point, we have approximately 40 sisters still alive and participating in the study.

Speaker 1:          08:14          And I'm the only one left here in the Wilton province. And as an unsurpassed away, the researchers had arranged it so that they would get a small piece of their brains, which they could examine for plaques and tangles. Oh, this morning we buried assister here. I told you at the funeral was delayed a bit because she had to be taken to the hospital to have a portion of her brain removed to further this study. Oh, [inaudible]. Okay. So here's why I bring this study up because of an accident that happened pretty early on, the changed everything in the study, David Snowden, the main dude, was in the, uh, convent archives and he was talking to the archivist. Yorkville says to him, Hey, you know, all of these nuns that you're studying, who right now are over the of 75 I actually have the essays

Speaker 4:          08:58          that they wrote right when they got here. And they did this roughly at about age 18, like 60 years before.

Speaker 1:          09:05          Oh, yes. Oh yeah. Right. I have a copy of it at home. Thank you so much. We actually asked to report or Naomi Sterban to visit sister Alberta at her home in Connecticut today and having her read her essay that is now 76 years old. Yeah, go ahead.

Speaker 4:          09:24          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          09:26          oh,

Speaker 1:          09:26          two days after the birth of the Christ child, I was brought as a belated Christmas gift to Mr and Mrs. Albert Joseph Sheridan of Providence, Rhode Island. A week later, the sparkling waters of baptism were poured over me. Nicklin read all the silly stuff that when I first entered. Why not? It sounds kind of Saccharin. I was only a teenager when I wrote, but here's the thing. When the researchers found the essays, like

Speaker 4:          09:55          when you just heard it was a gold mine, there was a major, major find. So the analyze the essays looking primarily at two specific features of the language that was contained in these narratives that Serge, AICPA, Houma, he does the analysis for the current and unsteady particular, they looked at the notion of grammatical complexity and a idea density. What is idea density? What does that mean? Density is, um, a, um, measure that looks at how many basic units of meaning are contained in any given utterance divided by the total number of words in that utterance. In other words,

Speaker 1:          10:30          the date of my birth is December 27th. Like if you'd listen to sister Alberta's autobiography, when I was 11 years of age, my dear mother was called to God. It's the number of little discrete ideas she's able to cram into one sentence. This was to be a turning point in my life as I had always had the odd desire to become a sister. Here's a classic example of the difference between low and high idea density. Here's low

Speaker 4:          10:55          from sister Helen. I was born in a Claire, Wisconsin on May 24th, 1913 and was baptized in same James Church. Okay, that's low. Now here's high from sister Emma. It was about a half hour before midnight between February 28th and 29th of the leap year in 1,912 when I began to live and to die as the third child of my mother whose maiden name is Hilda Hoffman and my father auto Schmidt. I got to say I'm liking the first one, Jed, probably you as a journalist seen the first one as straight to the point. Yeah, it's good writing. The second one seems kind of embellished a little bit. Yeah, but here's the punchline of all.

Speaker 5:          11:38          Well, this turns out that the people who when they were 18 wrote in that journalistically very precise, low idea density sort of way. Those people 60 years later, we're vastly, vastly more likely to develop dementia. In fact, based on those essays alone, the researchers could predict with about 85% accuracy what the nuns brains would look like when they died and were able to look at the brains. I mean, would the brains have plaques and tangles that you associate with Alzheimer's or would they not? What I mean that's just crazy

Speaker 1:          12:14          why it's backwards reasoning. But we'll see you, we'll see. I'm, I'm, I'm just suddenly, I'm suspicious. Here's a man who, from what you just said, has found the ones who got sick and working backwards found certain incidences of this, that or the other. And this, ah, this is a cause that produces this effect. No, no, no, no, no. There is no cause and effect here. These studies are demonstrating associations, right? They're not demonstrating causality. It's a very important distinction. This is just the correlation. Okay. But you know, that may be one of 190 correlations that produce people who get Alzheimer's in the end. Yeah. I mean, yeah, I mean, but let me argue your case actually from a different angle. Like, would this kind of linguistic analysis actually be relevant in the, in the age of Twitter where everything is short and clip people Twitter only Twitter, they might also write um, small, short tens essays for their yeah.

Speaker 1:          13:10          But no, you know, man, I guess you are right. It's like it's mostly about the thoughts in your head, not so much why you write well. So what about Agatha Christie? Was there a conclusion about Agatha? Yeah, there was, I get the Christian writing. Elephants can remember. This brings us back to Ian Lancaster and uh, that 73rd book of Agatha Christie's that he analyzed, found that her vocabulary dipped well before he did the analysis. He picked up that book and gave it a read. And like most people who read it didn't like it. Initially I thought it was very poorly written, badly plotted, full of errors of time of dating, terrible read. Then I realized when I looked at the title, elephants can remember, he realized that maybe Agatha Christie sensed

Speaker 3:          13:54          what was happening to her. She was responding to that truism that elephants never forget the a, the chief character is an, an aging female novelist named Ariadne who is a foil for I get the herself and she Ariadne is suffering from memory loss in the story. She tries to help a detective self this crime, but she has trouble cause she keeps forgetting. And uh, the last, uh, the last sentence in that novel in fact, is Agatha Sang, well, maybe it's okay now.

Speaker 6:          14:26          Do you remember

Speaker 3:          14:30          she was trying to defend herself, defend her sense that she was forgetting she was losing her vocabulary. She was losing her language. I began to see that Kristi was heroic, still writing despite this handicap and her willingness do that at an age of 81 82 struck me as is heroic in a way.

Speaker 7:          15:04          Well, I understand that the amuse wouldn't quit, but the tools all left the room. Yeah, I think we should leave the room. Okay.
