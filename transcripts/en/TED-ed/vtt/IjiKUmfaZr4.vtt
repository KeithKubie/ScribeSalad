00:00:09.191 --> 00:00:10.823
What's that sound?

00:00:10.823 --> 00:00:12.435
Depending on whom you ask,

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:16.528
the crackle of popping joints
is either the sound of sweet relief

00:00:16.528 --> 00:00:19.999
or the noxious tones 
of a stomach-turning habit.

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:22.178
Really, though. What's that sound?

00:00:22.178 --> 00:00:27.295
I mean, why does bending your joints
in a certain way make them pop like that?

00:00:27.295 --> 00:00:29.978
Scientists have offered 
several explanations,

00:00:29.978 --> 00:00:32.301
including rapidly stretching ligaments,

00:00:32.301 --> 00:00:36.956
and in severe cases, actual bones 
grinding against each other.

00:00:36.956 --> 00:00:38.686
But the most common explanation

00:00:38.686 --> 00:00:42.129
for why your stretched-out joints
sound like bubbles popping

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.358
is that, well, there are bubbles in there.

00:00:45.358 --> 00:00:48.937
The joints in your fingers 
are the easiest ones to crack,

00:00:48.937 --> 00:00:53.874
but many people also crack the joints
between vertebrae in their neck and back,

00:00:53.874 --> 00:00:58.367
and even their hips, wrists, 
shoulders and so on.

00:00:58.367 --> 00:01:01.006
All these joints are synovial joints,

00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:03.672
and they're the most flexible 
ones in your body.

00:01:03.672 --> 00:01:07.399
The space between the two bones
is filled with a viscous liquid,

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:11.858
synovial fluid, which contains long,
lubricating molecules,

00:01:11.858 --> 00:01:15.489
like hyaluronic acid and lubricin.

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:18.985
Synovial fluid is more or less
the texture of egg yolk

00:01:18.985 --> 00:01:21.938
and its primary purpose 
is to cushion the bones

00:01:21.938 --> 00:01:24.679
and help them glide past each other.

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:26.885
It also contains phagocytic cells

00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:32.379
that help clean up any bone or cartilage
debris that ends up in the joint.

00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:34.944
But the reason it's important 
for knuckle cracking

00:01:34.944 --> 00:01:37.129
is that, like other fluids in your body,

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:41.143
it contains lots of dissolved 
gas molecules.

00:01:41.143 --> 00:01:44.517
Knuckle-crackers know that 
to get that satisfying pop,

00:01:44.517 --> 00:01:48.107
you stretch the joint farther
than it normally goes

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:51.148
by bending your fingers 
backwards, for example.

00:01:51.148 --> 00:01:54.077
When you do that, 
the bones move away from each other.

00:01:54.077 --> 00:01:56.486
The space between bones gets bigger,

00:01:56.486 --> 00:01:59.981
but the amount of synovial fluid 
stays constant.

00:01:59.981 --> 00:02:02.069
That creates a low-pressure zone

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.506
that pulls dissolved gases 
out of the synovial fluid,

00:02:06.506 --> 00:02:09.287
just like the carbon dioxide 
that fizzes out of soda

00:02:09.287 --> 00:02:11.481
when you twist open the cap.

00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:17.258
Inside the joint, the escaping gases 
form a bubble with a pop.

00:02:17.258 --> 00:02:19.454
But the bubble doesn't last long.

00:02:19.454 --> 00:02:23.938
The surrounding fluid presses on it
until it finally collapses.

00:02:23.938 --> 00:02:27.636
The bubble's gases scatter 
throughout the synovial cavity

00:02:27.636 --> 00:02:32.853
and slowly dissolve back into the fluid
over the course of about twenty minutes,

00:02:32.853 --> 00:02:37.041
which is why it can take a while
before you can pop the same joint again.

00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:40.762
Some scientists think 
there may actually be two pops.

00:02:40.762 --> 00:02:45.003
One when the bubble forms, 
and another when it bursts.

00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:47.532
Popping a joint temporarily enlarges it,

00:02:47.532 --> 00:02:51.815
which may be why dedicated 
knuckle-, neck- and back-crackers

00:02:51.815 --> 00:02:56.191
say the habit makes their joints
feel looser and more flexible.

00:02:56.191 --> 00:03:00.783
But you may have heard from 
a concerned relative or annoyed officemate

00:03:00.783 --> 00:03:04.590
that cracking your joints 
will give you arthritis.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.229
A doctor named 
Donald Unger heard this, too.

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:11.529
So, determined to disprove 
his mother's warnings,

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:17.736
he cracked the knuckles 
of his left hand repeatedly for 50 years,

00:03:17.736 --> 00:03:20.690
while the right-hand 
knuckles went unpopped.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.402
36,500 cracks later, 
both hands were arthritis-free.

00:03:27.402 --> 00:03:30.369
For this selfless act 
of devotion to science,

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:33.505
Dr. Unger received an Ig Nobel Prize,

00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:37.305
a parody of the Nobel Prize
that recognizes wacky,

00:03:37.305 --> 00:03:41.729
but weirdly fascinating,
scientific accomplishments.

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:47.211
Unger wrote that his results should prompt
investigation into other parental beliefs,

00:03:47.211 --> 00:03:50.007
like the importance of eating spinach.

00:03:50.007 --> 00:03:51.901
The jury's still out on that one.

00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:53.478
As for knuckle-cracking,

00:03:53.478 --> 00:03:56.532
one study suggests 
that all that joint stretching

00:03:56.532 --> 00:03:59.561
and bubble bursting
can cause your hands to swell

00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:01.282
and weaken your grip.

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:06.190
But the biggest proven danger
seems to be annoying those around you.
