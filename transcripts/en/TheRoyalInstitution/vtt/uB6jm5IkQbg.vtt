00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.080
So that's one half of the story of electromagnetic
charges,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.100
electromagnetic attractions and repulsions.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.380
That was attraction of opposites.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.280
Now we've got the repulsions of light charges.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.960
And that creates a problem for us.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.840
Let's just think. We're all sitting here quite
happily.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.680
Nothing untoward happening to us.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.600
Not exploding or anything.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.720
But inside us are atoms and in the middle
of the atoms are nuclei.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.640
And here is an enlarged picture of a nucleus.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.680
With lots of neutral particles in it.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.120
But also lots of protons. Each one of which
is positively charged.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.720
Now like charges repel.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.600
So each of these protons is repelling all
the other protons.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.280
The nucleus then should be exploding apart.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.280
Yet somehow it stays together.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.680
Now that's a puzzle.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.000
We'll come to that in a moment and find the
answer to it

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.120
but first of all, let me give you an idea
of actually how strong that repulsive force is.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.119
Bryson's next demonstration is going to show
us the repulsive power

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.600
of electromagnetic forces.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.040
So what we're going to do now is first of
all cool down this ring

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.320
so that we make the effect rather more dramatic.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.680
And we've got a magnet here which we'll turn
on when Bryson throws the switch.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.240
When everything is ready.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.400
OK, don't spill it over me.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.560
This is about as cold as, well, the universe
out there now.

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.579
You all ready?

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.400
Oh, this is going to be really dramatic by
the time it gets going.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.160
Right, here it is.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.750
Ready to go, put it on the magnet.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.140
Now, turn the magnet on.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.870
[Audience gasps]

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.920
OK, you reckon we'll try it again?

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.920
[Audience laughs]

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.160
[Audience gasps in amazement]

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.280
Well done.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.840
[Applause]

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.960
So you saw there the power that magnets have
got when you can make things repel.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.470
In fact it sent the thing almost as high as
I came down from at the beginning.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.640
And then it came down rather faster than I
did.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.750
So that's the repulsive power.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.280
That you saw there with a large scale magnet.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.800
Just imagine now then the strength of the
repulsive power buried in the nucleus.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.310
These things are really small. Pretty well
touching.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.910
And each of them repelling with at least as
much power as you just saw.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.760
So how come we are still sitting here happily
without our nuclei exploding apart.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.960
There must be something very, very strong
here, another force,

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.760
a very strong force gripping the nucleus together
and overcoming that repulsive power.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.860
Let me show you what we believe today that's
caused by.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.170
So here is a picture of a nucleus opened up.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.160
And you see the three quarks buried inside
one of them.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.230
And the strong force that binds the quarks
together,

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.610
we've shown here by these little wiggly lines

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.760
to give the impression of the things really
being gripped.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.840
Now this force is so strong that it leaks
out very slightly.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.380
We show this on the outside here.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.640
And grips the individual neutrons and protons
together.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.200
So it's that very strong force, rooted in
the quarks, that holds the nucleus together

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.600
and resists that outward thrust that we saw
the demonstration of.
