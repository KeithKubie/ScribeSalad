00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Narrator] For this quiz we're asking for the value of the length of P

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
after running these 3 statements.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is a little trickier than the previous quiz.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Try to see if you can think about the answer and find it yourself.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Of course it's okay if you want to run the code in the Python interpreter as well,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but see if you can figure out the answer without doing that.
