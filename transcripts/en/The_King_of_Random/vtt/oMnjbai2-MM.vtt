[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]
In this video, we're going
to try a couple of methods

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.380
to see if we can turn lava rock
back into molten lava.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.000
[Opening Theme Music]

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.220
Guys, we got a fun experiment for you
today brought to you by YouTube user

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.280
Awesomeness Brahadhish.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.560
I don't know if I'm pronouncing
that right but Awesomeness,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.220
you wanted to know if we
could please melt rock,

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.090
and today we are going to try that out.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.160
We've got a couple of different
methods we're going to try

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.420
to see if we can take some lava rock,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.640
and turn it back into liquid lava.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.660
Here's the basic plan.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.370
We're gonna try taking some lava rock,

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.390
putting it in a crucible,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.500
and letting it sit in our foundry
for a while to see if it gets hot

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.520
enough to melt the rock.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.780
We'll also use the arc furnace to
try melting some rock into lava,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.829
and if we get enough melted rock,

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.140
we may try pouring it into sand
to see if we can cast with it.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.080
As the first step, let's gather up
a little bit of this lava rock

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.940
from where Grant has some in his yard,

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.000
and see what happens if
you throw it in the foundry.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.060
Lava rock.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:17.300
[Music]

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.160
Oh my gosh. It's actually melting.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.520
Now, I did not think that this furnace

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.810
was going to get hot enough
to melt lava rock,

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:24.939
but looking in the sides,

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.720
I think it looks like it's
starting to deform a little bit.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.560
That right there is some melted rock.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.200
It's not super liquid but it's gooey.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.120
It's not running like a thin liquid,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.740
but clearly this is melted.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.900
Have a small piece of it that
I scraped out right here...

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.780
It's very glass-like.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.700
[Music]

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.180
I don't really think it's going to get
more liquid than that inside our foundry,

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.900
so what I'm going to do
is take the crucible out,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.920
and see if we can pour
or at least scrape the goo

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.540
out from the inside of the crucible.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:16.220
[Music]

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.820
Our lava has cooled down pretty
quickly after we poured it out of the cup,

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.000
and as you can see,
it never really flowed very well.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.900
Let's let this cool down
and take a closer look

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.180
once we can touch with our hands.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.500
We've got our mini arc furnace set up,

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.660
and now I think it's time to see
if we can melt this rock down into lava.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.120
Although it occurs to me,

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.719
if we do melt it down into lava,
it'd be nice to pour it out into something.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.480
and I don't just want to pour it on the table.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.260
So maybe let's grab a little bit of sand,
make an impression in that,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.020
and then just in case
this works really well,

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.960
we can try pouring it out into the sand
and maybe cast some lava.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.020
It's not the most advanced mold ever
but it's a shallow recess into the sand,

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.180
and if we pour any lava into it,
I suspect it will hold.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:09.740
[Music]

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.360
Holy cow!

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.160
That right there is lava.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.560
It is liquid lava.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.880
Not all of it is liquefied at once,

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.160
but that right there is rock
just running around in there.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.160
All right that's starting to cool off.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.640
I'm going to turn this back on,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.860
try and heat up all of it enough
that I can pour it out into the sand.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.100
When I do that, I'm going to try and turn it
off and throw it in there really quickly

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.820
because it does start
to cool down quite fast.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:54.680
[Music]

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.560
Well it doesn't go very quickly.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.020
[Music]

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.520
And we're getting some
funny shapes out of it.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.620
So this kind of lava rock is
really not far off from being glass.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.680
Once it's melted down,

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.160
what I'm making is
probably more like obsidian

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.060
than it is anything else,
which is a very glass like rock.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.880
So all of it didn't melt down into
a nice flowing pourable liquid,

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.280
but we did get melted rock,

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.240
and while it was in there,
that right there, that's lava.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.080
That is melted rock straight up.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.280
It's gonna be really interesting to see
what this looks like once it cools down.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.420
Right now, of course, it's still very hot.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.880
There's a good chance that it's going
to crack somewhat as it cools as well.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.780
Glass-like substances do that
but we'll see how it turns out.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.740
Wow! Bottom of this brick, not even warm.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.260
That is amazingly insulated stuff.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.440
As the glass on the sand cooled down,

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.680
I think it did fracture
and the force of it

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.800
sent pieces flying a little bit.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.620
Just likes to crack as it cools off.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.200
If it cools off too quickly like it just did,

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.420
then it will break.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.100
Or it looks like something out of Venom.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.140
Like, that's one of his little
tentacles reaching off.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.450
Very little mini Venom.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.660
Try and break this.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:10.780
Hey it broke.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.200
Let's try this again.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.400
Let's melt a little bit more.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:29.220
[Music]

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.860
It also cools down pretty quickly.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.060
But it just goes from that
lava rock pumice texture

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.200
to just a strait glass texture
in no time at all.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:48.180
[Music]

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.100
Too hot.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:55.600
[Music]

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.320
Just sends glass shards everywhere.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.440
Unfortunately, while it
does get super hot,

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.940
it only gets super hot in
a pretty concentrated area.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.140
So it doesn't do a good job
of melting all of it at once.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.270
One thing I can try though

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.420
is I'm going to put the
lid on top of the furnace,

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:12.740
get those leads really going,

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.460
and hopefully, it will just make
a sort of oven inside there.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.460
That's the goal behind
the lid in the first place.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.160
[Music]

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.200
It's starting to get hot
so I'm going to take it off .

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:35.940
[Music]

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.620
As it was very melted in there,

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.380
I was able to stick
the screwdriver down in,

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.280
and play with it and stretch it out.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.160
And there's a chance
that while this cools down,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.980
that will still crack at
some point and just fall off.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.920
But I'm going to let it sit
there in case it doesn't.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.760
Well just now, I tap very lightly on this,

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.760
and it fell into a few different pieces.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.240
It's too bad.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.060
Not very surprising though.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.080
The rocks that we started
with are something called Scoria,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.760
which is a type of igneous rock.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.400
Igneous rocks are those
that are made from magma

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.180
as it comes up out of a volcano,

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.280
or at a split in the ground
in between tectonic plates.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.980
Now this stuff, the scoria,
is made when volcanic magma comes up

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:18.240
out of the ground and rapidly 
depressurised as it cools down.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.320
This type of rock actually
has quite a bit of air bubbles in it,

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.360
which form as the rock is cooling.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.820
Imagine the soda
in this bottle as magma.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.960
It's under pressure right now
because the lid is still on it,

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.300
and as you know there's
carbon dioxide dissolved into the liquid,

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.460
which stays dissolved
as long as it's under pressure.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.220
However, as soon as we open the bottle,

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.180
we lower the pressure on the liquid,

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.060
and you can see that the bubbles
form and come up out of the soda.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.940
All of those bubbles started
coming up out of the liquid

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.940
because under lower pressure,

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.520
the liquid doesn't dissolve
as much as the gas.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.640
Underground, magma is under pressure,

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.540
and it has some gases dissolved in it too,

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.880
like H2O and CO2.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.080
When the magma
comes up onto the surface,

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.640
a couple of things happen.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.020
First, it starts cooling off

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.240
because it's a lot colder up here
than it is down under the ground.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.560
But it also loses pressure
and that lowers the solubility

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.420
of the gases in the magma.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:18.400
So all of that H2O and CO2 starts
to undissolve from the magma,

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.160
and then it starts to expand
because it's under lower pressure.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.360
But it's also cooling down
and then it gets trapped

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.720
inside the cooling lava
to form our little rock.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.160
The reason we're not getting
the same effect when we melt it

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.480
is we're melting it under normal pressure.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.820
There's no additional
dissolved gases in there,

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.360
and in fact, some of the dissolved
gases escaped as we melt it down.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.820
That's part of the bubbling action
that we see as we melt it.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.380
Once it's all melted though,

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.314
no more gases are coming up Bout
of it as a solidifies,

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.060
and so it just forms
a hard smooth glass.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.220
It's actually quite impressive how
black, smooth, and shiny this forms.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.540
Let's go see if the stuff we poured out
of our furnace is cool enough to handle.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.860
So this stuff was not able to melt

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.710
quite as completely as the stuff
we hit with the arc furnace.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.560
The Arc furnace does definitely
get hotter than our foundry.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.400
What we have here is somewhat more
glassy than the original rock we started with,

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:14.060
but it doesn't have the smooth pure black
texture of what we melted in the arc furnace.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.250
You can still see some
air bubbles in there, I think,

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.120
and some of those may
have already been there

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.400
when we started melting the rock,

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.480
and some of them may have formed
as I tried to scrape it out of our crucible

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.400
[Music]

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.580
That's an interesting texture.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.260
It's actually very similar to
the rock that we started with.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.160
It's just maybe a little more fragile,

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.240
and of course, a different shape.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.640
Well Awesomeness Brahadhish,
thank you for your suggestion

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.940
