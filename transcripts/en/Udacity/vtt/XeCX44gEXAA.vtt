00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.860
So I would to consider with you one example of

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.760
what Rice's Theorem might mean in practice

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.640
and  might not mean in practice,

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.370
and the example I find very illustrative for this is

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.230
malware detection,

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.620
so determining if a program does something bad on your computer

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.670
or if it is a harmless program that you want to run.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.540
So first of all, we have to think of it about

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.300
what actually classifies a piece of software as malware?

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.490
So a good classification of malware be that

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.100
it's a piece of software that does something the user doesn't want it to do?

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.740
Would it be a good classification if it deletes files?

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.820
If it gathers information from your computer?

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.480
If it disrupts or interrupts other programs?

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.680
If it installs itself or something else without asking you as a user?

00:00:44.680 --> 99:59:59.000
Or some combination of the above.
