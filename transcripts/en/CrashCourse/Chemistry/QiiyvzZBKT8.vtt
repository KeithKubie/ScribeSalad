00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320
You got a pretty good idea of what chemistry
is, right?

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:08.330
It's atoms and molecules doing stuff and making
cars and food and life and everything.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.470
And of course it's the study of those things.
But like how did we get here?

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.600
There's certainly no everyday evidence for much of what we have discovered through the science of chemistry.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.220
Discoveries that were not derived or made
up,

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.779
but just laws of the Universe that exist simply because the Universe is the way the Universe is.

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.920
So in today's episode of Crash Course Chemistry
we're going to taking a bit of a historical

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.320
perspective on the creation of the science
of chemistry.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.070
A science that didn't really even exist until
a super-smart, super-wealthy French guy put

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.770
the puzzle pieces together into a coherent
theory for, quite literally, how everything works.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.230
And if you've ever found yourself sitting
at your desk reading the same line in your

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.020
chemistry book for the 22nd time,

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.980
and you think to yourself "Gah, the guy who
invented chemistry should be put to death!"

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.029
Well you should feel bad, because he was.

00:00:57.029 --> 00:01:06.849
[Theme Music]

00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:13.300
Antoine Lavoisier, was pretty fantastic. He was a geologist, a botanist, a biologist, and a physicist.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.360
He helped define the metric system, creating
an international language of chemistry,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.300
named hydrogen and oxygen, predicted the existence
of silicon, outlined what elements were,

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.720
figured out how animals extracted energy from
food,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.260
determined that an element can take different forms on discovering that both ash and diamond contained pure carbon,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.920
published the very first chemistry textbook
ever,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.540
and there's a reason why the Law of Conservation
of Mass used to be called Lavoisier's Law.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.880
Born into a wealthy family, Lavoisier inherited a massive amount of money when his mom died when he was five years old.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.080
And though he did get licensed to practice law as his father expected him to follow in his lawyer-ly footsteps,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.460
young Antoine chose science instead.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.499
When the opportunity arose to marry a wealthy
girl whose father's massive income came from

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:04.699
collecting taxes for the French government,
he did it, even though she 13.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.860
A questionable decision, though not uncommon
at the time,

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.880
it turned out that the family connections would be his undoing, though, not the age of the bride at her marriage.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.840
Marie-Anne, as she grew older, would become
a colleague as well as a wife,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.840
assisting Antoine in his experiments and his
analysis of the work of others.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.160
Indeed it was Marie-Anne who translated Essay
on Phlogiston for Antoine,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.520
which he ripped to pieces, changing everything
forever.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.099
Until Antoine Lavoisier started inspecting
everybody's work,

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.349
the prevailing theory of chemical change was
that some substances contained an elusive

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.620
element called "phlogiston."

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.080
By burning these phlogiston-containing elements, they would lose their phlogiston, and become new things.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.760
Lavoisier took those theories and their research,
combined it with research being done elsewhere,

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:52.140
and added in his own genius experiments and
then tore the chemical world to pieces,

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.140
with a little thing called "combustion."

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.950
He determined that hydrogen wasn't "inflammable
air," it was an element.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.220
Indeed he named it hydrogen because it was
generated from water, or hydro-generated.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.260
And he determined that oxygen was a vital
ingredient for combustion

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.920
and also what would later be known as oxidation, something that we'll discuss quite a lot in this course.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.340
By hooking people up to his bizarre contraptions,

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.849
he determined that burning wood consumed the
same amount of oxygen,

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.600
and produced the same amount of carbon dioxide,
as people consuming food and breathing.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.380
Thus determining that people, and all animals,
are powered by some form of internal combustion.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.680
Now experimenters of the day (I hesitate to
call them chemists),

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.380
noticed that when you burned something, its
massed decreased.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.660
Like here's a fuse, and I put it on a scale
and I burn it, and its mass decreases.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.800
But Lavoisier determined that if all the particles
in gas are collected,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.880
like if I burn the fuse inside a closed bottle,
the mass stays the same.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.860
Stuff remained stuff. You can't lose any,
you couldn't make more.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.120
This realization, though it seems obvious to us now and its acceptance by the general scientific community,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.109
as far as I'm concerned, was the precise moment
at which alchemy ended and chemistry began.

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.789
Lavoisier's chief contributions, and ultimately his discovery of the Law of Conservation of Mass,

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:06.969
relied on careful measurement and careful
thinking.

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:11.269
And as you'll see, both of those things are
key to success in chemistry to this day.

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.929
Lavoisier the man was a bit of a dichotomy,

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:18.649
having worked as a tax collector and helping
to create a literal wall around Paris to assist

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:20.290
in the collection of taxes,

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.240
but also a supporter of the French Revolution
as it began.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.949
But the enemies he had made with his wall,

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.030
and by denying certain powerful politicians
entry into the French Academy of Sciences,

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.760
eventually caught up with him as the revolution's lunacy increased, he was beheaded on May 8th, 1794.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.400
Lavoisier was pardoned a year and a half after
his execution. So, that's good.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.120
Marie-Anne was delivered all of his confiscated
belongings, and a note of apology, like

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.360
"Sorry we killed your husband, here's all
his stuff back."

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.080
The mathematician Joseph Lagrange said of
the event:

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.440
"It took them only an instant to cut off that head, but France may not produce another like it in a century."

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.800
It's worth noting, though this isn't really
science talk,

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.180
that Lavoisier couldn't have done any of his
magnificently careful measurements had it

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.300
not been for his enormous wealth.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.560
He commissioned the creation of hundreds of
pieces of equipment, large and small.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.210
Only the system of economic inequality that
the French were revolting against made it

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.669
possible for Lavoisier to do his work.

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.810
I'll leave you to think on the implications
of that, on your own.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.790
Lavoisier's work was, for a full century,
the basis of all chemistry.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.640
Proving that you don't have to be rich to get a law (at least temporarily) named after you,

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.740
French pharmacist Joseph Proust built on Lavoisier's
ideas of extremely careful measurement

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.570
showing that a chemical compound always contains
the same proportions of elements.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.310
For a while we called this Proust's Law,

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.840
but to make it easier to remember for the world we just call it the Law of Definite Proportions now.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.879
And then an English schoolteacher, John Dalton,
followed Proust

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:50.519
by examining what at first appeared to be
a problem with Proust's work.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.280
Carbon and oxygen, when reacted together, would form two different proportions, not just one.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.700
Of course what was happening is obvious to
us,

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:03.220
carbon and oxygen were reacting to form two different compounds: carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.080
As Dalton's work continued, he found something
truly mind-bendingly fascinating.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.340
If you limited the amount of carbon reacting
to exactly 1 g,

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.460
the mass of oxygen consumed to produce one
compound was 1.33 g,

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.760
while the mass consumed to produce the other
compound was 2.66 g,

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.460
exactly double what was required for the other
compound.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.460
This shook out for other reactions, too.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.380
When reacting nitrogen and oxygen, and limiting to exactly one gram of nitrogen, three compounds formed.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:38.160
One compound consumed 1.750 g of oxygen, another
consumed 0.8750 g of oxygen,

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:41.469
and another consumed 0.4374 g.

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:46.000
All of those numbers are relatable by small
whole number ratios.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.620
Oxygen wasn't reacting with some ephemeral
cloud of the idea of nitrogen,

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.500
it was reacting with individual, discrete
bits of nitrogen, that couldn't be divided.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.360
It could react in a number of ways,

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.100
but it was always the same oxygen and the
same nitrogen with the same properties.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:05.660
And so while in our first episode we showed you how Einstein actually proved that atoms exist with super fancy math,

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:12.659
Dalton had used multiplication to become the first person to actually have real data supporting the idea of atoms.

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:15.419
Dalton still, though, had it kind of wrong.

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:18.599
He thought that the products of his reactions
were elements as well.

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:22.039
Basically, he believed that atoms and molecules
were the same thing.

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:26.030
We often simplify this and don't note Dalton's
confusion on this particular point,

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.710
but that leaves a couple of other fantastic
chemists out of the story.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.720
For example, Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac, who in 1804 became the highest scientist ever in history,

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.139
by taking a hot-air balloon to the dangerous
height of 7,000 m to take air samples.

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:42.860
But in addition to maybe being a little bit
crazy, Gay-Lussac published a paper

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:49.180
showing that a volume of oxygen gas is two times smaller than the volume of water vapor it creates,

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.760
indicating that somehow, oxygen was splitting
into two pieces.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:59.580
Dalton, would not accept this, because it
meant that oxygen was not one, but two atoms,

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.219
and apparently that just messed with his whole
conception of the Universe,

00:08:03.219 --> 00:08:05.930
and he never did accept it, even unto his
death.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.900
It took an Italian house-elf -- I mean genius,

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:15.250
Lorenzo Romano Amadeo Carlo Avogadro di Quaregna
e di Cerreto. (I did it the first time.)

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.139
We'll just call him Amadeo Avogadro, but he
was a count,

00:08:18.139 --> 00:08:22.099
so he had to have a super-fancy name, and
I'm me, so I had to try and say it.

00:08:22.099 --> 00:08:26.179
Much like Lavoisier, Avogadro's political
alliances would get him into trouble.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:32.360
After Napoleon's downfall in 1815, Avogadro
was active in the Italian Anti-Monarchy Revolution,

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.460
possibly even sponsoring some revolutionaries
with his personal fortune.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:41.280
For this he lost his chair at the University
of Turin, but thankfully he did not lose his head.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:46.380
Avogadro proposed, correctly, that any gas
in a container of the same size,

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.900
with the same temperature and pressure, would have roughly the same number of molecules in it,

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.780
no matter what the gas was.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:57.590
So any difference in mass between two flasks
of the same size full of two different gases

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:01.950
would be because of a difference in the actual
physical mass of the molecules.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:08.470
And thus, Avogadro basically figured out how to weigh atoms and molecules, as long as they were gaseous.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.760
To support his hypothesis, which was certainly
good enough to support,

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:17.490
he suggested that, in forming water, oxygen
gas would actually split into two oxygen atoms,

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.650
what he called "elementary molecules" that
could not be broken down any further.

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:26.110
For some fifty years, Avogadro's idea of fundamental
molecules were ignored.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:29.630
Maybe because of incorrect ideas of how atoms
stuck together,

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.560
maybe because Italy was a bit of a backwater
of science

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.830
and Avogadro wasn't considered an important
thinker at the time.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:40.880
But the scientific community, as it usually does, came back around to Avogadro's ideas eventually.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.400
Not only naming his proposal that equal volumes
at the same temperature

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.650
and pressure contained the same number of
molecules Avogadro's Law,

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:53.250
but also giving him his own number, maybe
the most important number in chemistry,

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:57.170
certainly one of my very favorite numbers,
but we'll get to that later.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.640
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.600
If you were paying attention you now know
the story of how we went from alchemists,

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:08.090
who thought that the element of fire hid inside
of substances just clamoring to get out,

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:14.320
to chemists, who understood the Law of Conservation
of Mass, as proposed by a decapitated aristocrat.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:19.550
Greater understanding of how chemical compounds
work, thanks to a pharmacist and a schoolteacher.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:23.980
And eventually a complete understanding of
what atoms and molecules are,

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.520
thanks to a neglected Italian house-elf -- nobleman.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.640
