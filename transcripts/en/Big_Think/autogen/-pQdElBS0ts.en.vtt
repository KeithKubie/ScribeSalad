friend your question is when we have a

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500
friend your question is when we have a
 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.590
friend your question is when we have a
permanent base on the moon where will

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:14.600
permanent base on the moon where will
 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.420
permanent base on the moon where will
the astronauts get air to breathe I'm

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430
the astronauts get air to breathe I'm
 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.580
the astronauts get air to breathe I'm
sure it makes sense to you that air is

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590
sure it makes sense to you that air is
 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.500
sure it makes sense to you that air is
something that we consume and it would

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510
something that we consume and it would
 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.450
something that we consume and it would
be a lot of effort to actually bring air

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460
be a lot of effort to actually bring air
 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.130
be a lot of effort to actually bring air
tanks from Earth and actually launch

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140
tanks from Earth and actually launch
 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.720
tanks from Earth and actually launch
them up onto the moon one of the

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730
them up onto the moon one of the
 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.310
them up onto the moon one of the
questions I can ask you is where do you

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320
questions I can ask you is where do you
 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.689
questions I can ask you is where do you
think the astronauts are getting air

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699
think the astronauts are getting air
 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:30.099
think the astronauts are getting air
right now to breathe on the

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109
right now to breathe on the
 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:31.839
right now to breathe on the
International Space Station we don't

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849
International Space Station we don't
 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.210
International Space Station we don't
actually take up giant tanks of air to

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220
actually take up giant tanks of air to
 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.310
actually take up giant tanks of air to
the space station they get it from water

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320
the space station they get it from water
 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.680
the space station they get it from water
if you run a very strong electrical

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690
if you run a very strong electrical
 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.420
if you run a very strong electrical
current through water you can separate

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430
current through water you can separate
 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.090
current through water you can separate
it into hydrogen and oxygen oxygen of

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100
it into hydrogen and oxygen oxygen of
 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.770
it into hydrogen and oxygen oxygen of
course is the most important gas that we

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780
course is the most important gas that we
 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.870
course is the most important gas that we
need to breathe so the way the space

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880
need to breathe so the way the space
 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.150
need to breathe so the way the space
station gets air is it takes water and

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160
station gets air is it takes water and
 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.160
station gets air is it takes water and
breaks it up into those two gases and

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170
breaks it up into those two gases and
 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.110
breaks it up into those two gases and
actually uses the oxygen for people to

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120
actually uses the oxygen for people to
 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.420
actually uses the oxygen for people to
breathe now we can do the exact same

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430
breathe now we can do the exact same
 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.190
breathe now we can do the exact same
thing on the moon and so your next

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200
thing on the moon and so your next
 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.540
thing on the moon and so your next
question would be well well doesn't it

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550
question would be well well doesn't it
 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.220
question would be well well doesn't it
take a lot of energy to bring water up

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230
take a lot of energy to bring water up
 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.330
take a lot of energy to bring water up
there as well you have to bring all

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340
there as well you have to bring all
 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.070
there as well you have to bring all
these water tanks this is one of the

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080
these water tanks this is one of the
 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.660
these water tanks this is one of the
reasons we were most excited to find

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670
reasons we were most excited to find
 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.240
reasons we were most excited to find
evidence of a lot of ice underneath

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250
evidence of a lot of ice underneath
 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.149
evidence of a lot of ice underneath
parts of the Moon up by the poles of the

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159
parts of the Moon up by the poles of the
 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.010
parts of the Moon up by the poles of the
moon there are craters that are very

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020
moon there are craters that are very
 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.930
moon there are craters that are very
well shaded from sunlight and they get

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940
well shaded from sunlight and they get
 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.540
well shaded from sunlight and they get
very very cold and we found evidence of

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550
very very cold and we found evidence of
 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.880
very very cold and we found evidence of
more water in the lunar soil in those

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890
more water in the lunar soil in those
 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.680
more water in the lunar soil in those
craters near the poles than we ever

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690
craters near the poles than we ever
 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.050
craters near the poles than we ever
expected that means if you had

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060
expected that means if you had
 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.880
expected that means if you had
astronauts up there and you actually had

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890
astronauts up there and you actually had
 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.800
astronauts up there and you actually had
the bases near the poles of the moon

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810
the bases near the poles of the moon
 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.899
the bases near the poles of the moon
there would be stores of ice and

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909
there would be stores of ice and
 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.760
there would be stores of ice and
therefore water that you could actually

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770
therefore water that you could actually
 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.190
therefore water that you could actually
tap into you could actually turn that

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200
tap into you could actually turn that
 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.410
tap into you could actually turn that
water into air for the astronauts to

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420
water into air for the astronauts to
 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.300
water into air for the astronauts to
breathe without ever bringing anything

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310
breathe without ever bringing anything
 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.160
breathe without ever bringing anything
up from the earth you could actually be

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170
up from the earth you could actually be
 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.990
up from the earth you could actually be
independent on the moon itself and

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000
independent on the moon itself and
 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.360
independent on the moon itself and
there's another really important thing

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370
there's another really important thing
 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.890
there's another really important thing
that you can make out of water by

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900
that you can make out of water by
 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.780
that you can make out of water by
separating it into oxygen and hydrogen

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790
separating it into oxygen and hydrogen
 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.690
separating it into oxygen and hydrogen
and that's rocket fuel rocket fuel today

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700
and that's rocket fuel rocket fuel today
 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.480
and that's rocket fuel rocket fuel today
liquid rocket fuel is the combination of

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490
liquid rocket fuel is the combination of
 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.969
liquid rocket fuel is the combination of
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen so not

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen so not
 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.680
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen so not
only would you have air to breathe from

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690
only would you have air to breathe from
 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.120
only would you have air to breathe from
the water but you could make your own

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130
the water but you could make your own
 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.039
the water but you could make your own
fuel this is one of the things that

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049
fuel this is one of the things that
 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.600
fuel this is one of the things that
we're investigating now not only

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610
we're investigating now not only
 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.250
we're investigating now not only
colonizing the moon but also thinking

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260
colonizing the moon but also thinking
 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.390
colonizing the moon but also thinking
about sending people to Mars

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400
about sending people to Mars
 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.240
about sending people to Mars
you send people so far away they have to

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250
you send people so far away they have to
 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.979
you send people so far away they have to
be independent and they even have to

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989
be independent and they even have to
 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.869
be independent and they even have to
make their own fuel to get back and we

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879
make their own fuel to get back and we
 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.429
make their own fuel to get back and we
think we can do that if we can find

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:12.439
think we can do that if we can find
 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.440
think we can do that if we can find
water one of the great questions is why

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450
water one of the great questions is why
 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.059
water one of the great questions is why
would there be ice on the moon the moon

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069
would there be ice on the moon the moon
 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.400
would there be ice on the moon the moon
seems very dry there's no atmosphere how

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410
seems very dry there's no atmosphere how
 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.180
seems very dry there's no atmosphere how
could there be

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190
could there be
 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.700
could there be
or even frozen underneath the soil well

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710
or even frozen underneath the soil well
 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.810
or even frozen underneath the soil well
we think that what's happened over

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820
we think that what's happened over
 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.880
we think that what's happened over
billions of years is that many different

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890
billions of years is that many different
 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.950
billions of years is that many different
comets and asteroids have collided with

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960
comets and asteroids have collided with
 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.960
comets and asteroids have collided with
the moon you can see all the craters on

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970
the moon you can see all the craters on
 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.330
the moon you can see all the craters on
the surface and asteroids and comets

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340
the surface and asteroids and comets
 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.280
the surface and asteroids and comets
both contain a decent amount of water

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290
both contain a decent amount of water
 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.070
both contain a decent amount of water
now most of that water probably just got

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080
now most of that water probably just got
 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.960
now most of that water probably just got
vaporized and flew off the moon entirely

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970
vaporized and flew off the moon entirely
 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.510
vaporized and flew off the moon entirely
but some of it actually turned into ice

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520
but some of it actually turned into ice
 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.460
but some of it actually turned into ice
and the important thing about these deep

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470
and the important thing about these deep
 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.290
and the important thing about these deep
craters near the poles is that they're

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300
craters near the poles is that they're
 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.360
craters near the poles is that they're
shaded from sunlight sunlight would

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370
shaded from sunlight sunlight would
 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.980
shaded from sunlight sunlight would
actually just disperse that ice and

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990
actually just disperse that ice and
 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.110
actually just disperse that ice and
actually turned into vapour but in the

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120
actually turned into vapour but in the
 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.110
actually turned into vapour but in the
dark shadowy craters the ice accumulates

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120
dark shadowy craters the ice accumulates
 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.670
dark shadowy craters the ice accumulates
over time and so you actually have a

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680
over time and so you actually have a
 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.310
over time and so you actually have a
buildup of ice underneath the soil

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320
 
 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.530
