00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.660
Now, we should be able to find the most
appropriate URL that our app should use.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.780
Based on the UX wireframes
we saw earlier, we want

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.480
the weather forecast for a week's worth
of data given a certain postal cost.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.900
For the purposes of this quiz and our
example code that we'll be showing you.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.440
We'll be using the Mountain View
postal code, which is 94043.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.000
By all means you should use the postal
code for your own location.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.890
Or you can use city name or
latitude, longitude coordinates.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.580
If it doesn't find your
location based on postal code.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.720
Try using postal code followed by
a comma, followed by the country code.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.670
See the discussion forum for
more examples.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.930
Next, we want the response from
the server to be in JSON format.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.600
And we also want the temperatures
to be reported in metric units.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.410
We choose metric for
doing the query, but our UI will be

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.815
able to displace celsius or
fahrenheit based ion user preferences.

00:00:50.815 --> 00:00:53.330
Wnd we'll just do
the conversion ourselves.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.230
Enter the URL in the box that
fulfills these requirements.
