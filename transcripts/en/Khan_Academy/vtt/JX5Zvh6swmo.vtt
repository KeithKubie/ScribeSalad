00:00:00.098 --> 00:00:03.849
- [Narrator] We're going to
learn to recognize and factor

00:00:03.849 --> 00:00:06.927
perfect square polynomials in this video.

00:00:06.927 --> 00:00:08.552
So for example, say I have the polynomial

00:00:08.552 --> 00:00:11.385
x squared plus six x plus nine.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.970
And then someone asks you,
"Hey, can you factor this

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.558
"into two binomials?"

00:00:15.558 --> 00:00:17.364
Well, using techniques we
learned in other videos,

00:00:17.364 --> 00:00:18.885
say, "Okay, I need to find two numbers

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:22.907
"whose product is nine
and whose sum is six."

00:00:22.907 --> 00:00:25.051
And so I encourage you to
pause this video and say,

00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:27.385
"Well, what two numbers can add up to six,

00:00:27.385 --> 00:00:30.443
"and if I take their product I get nine?"

00:00:30.443 --> 00:00:32.489
Well, nine only has so many factors,

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.460
really one, three, and nine.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.163
And one plus nine does not equal six.

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:40.625
And so, and negative
one plus negative nine

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:42.055
does not equal six.

00:00:42.055 --> 00:00:45.269
But three times three equals nine,

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:47.876
and three plus three does equal six.

00:00:47.876 --> 00:00:51.310
Three times three, three plus three.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.126
And so we can factor this as

00:00:54.126 --> 00:00:57.043
x plus three times x plus three,

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.059
which is of course the same thing as

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.809
x plus three squared.

00:01:06.513 --> 00:01:08.942
And so what was it about this expression

00:01:08.942 --> 00:01:10.807
that made us recognize,

00:01:10.807 --> 00:01:12.991
or maybe now we will start to recognize it

00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:14.924
as being a perfect square?

00:01:14.924 --> 00:01:19.045
Well, I have of course some
variable that is being squared,

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:20.347
which we need.

00:01:20.347 --> 00:01:23.409
I have some perfect square as a constant,

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.545
and that whatever is being squared there,

00:01:25.545 --> 00:01:28.005
I have two times that as the coefficient

00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:30.691
on this first degree term here.

00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:33.038
Let's see if that is generally true.

00:01:33.038 --> 00:01:35.858
And I'll switch up the variables
just to show that we can.

00:01:35.858 --> 00:01:40.025
So let's say that I have a
squared plus 14 a plus 49.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.512
So a few interesting
things are happening here.

00:01:45.512 --> 00:01:47.677
All right, I have my variable squared.

00:01:47.677 --> 00:01:49.404
I have a perfect square constant term,

00:01:49.404 --> 00:01:52.095
that is seven squared right over here.

00:01:52.095 --> 00:01:55.351
And my coefficient on my
first degree term here

00:01:55.351 --> 00:01:57.723
that is two times the
thing that's being squared.

00:01:57.723 --> 00:01:59.432
That is two times seven, or you can say

00:01:59.432 --> 00:02:01.431
it's seven plus seven.

00:02:01.431 --> 00:02:02.508
So you can immediately say, "Okay,

00:02:02.508 --> 00:02:03.862
"if I want to factor this,

00:02:03.862 --> 00:02:07.759
"this is going to be
a plus seven squared."

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.571
And you can of course verify that

00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:11.087
by multiplying out,

00:02:11.087 --> 00:02:13.721
by figuring out what a
plus seven squared is.

00:02:13.721 --> 00:02:14.952
Sometimes when you're first learning this,

00:02:14.952 --> 00:02:16.312
you're like, "Hey, isn't
that just a squared

00:02:16.312 --> 00:02:17.230
"plus seven squared?"

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.063
No!

00:02:18.063 --> 00:02:20.398
Remember, this is the same thing as

00:02:20.398 --> 00:02:23.065
a plus seven times a plus seven.

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:27.595
And you can calculate this by using

00:02:27.595 --> 00:02:29.952
the foil, F-O-I-L technique.

00:02:29.952 --> 00:02:30.857
I don't like that so much

00:02:30.857 --> 00:02:32.126
because you're not thinking mathematically

00:02:32.126 --> 00:02:33.343
about what's happening.

00:02:33.343 --> 00:02:35.993
Really you just have to do
distributive property twice here.

00:02:35.993 --> 00:02:39.618
First you can multiply
a plus seven times a.

00:02:39.618 --> 00:02:41.618
So a plus seven times a.

00:02:42.816 --> 00:02:45.005
And then multiply a
plus seven times seven.

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:47.755
So plus a plus seven times seven,

00:02:48.781 --> 00:02:52.104
and so this is going to
be a squared plus seven a,

00:02:52.104 --> 00:02:55.025
plus, now we distribute the seven.

00:02:55.025 --> 00:02:56.775
Plus seven a plus 49.

00:02:58.885 --> 00:03:03.023
So now you see where that 14 a came from.

00:03:03.023 --> 00:03:05.933
It's from the seven a plus the seven a.

00:03:05.933 --> 00:03:07.782
You see where the a squared came from.

00:03:07.782 --> 00:03:11.241
And you see where the 49 came from.

00:03:11.241 --> 00:03:15.185
And you can speak of this
in more general terms.

00:03:15.185 --> 00:03:18.755
If I wanted to just take the expression

00:03:18.755 --> 00:03:20.672
a plus b and square it,

00:03:22.687 --> 00:03:25.687
that's just a plus b times a plus b,

00:03:27.522 --> 00:03:29.249
and we do exactly what we did just here,

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:31.257
but here I'm just doing
in very general terms

00:03:31.257 --> 00:03:32.992
with a or b and you can think of a

00:03:32.992 --> 00:03:34.340
as either a constant number

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.780
or even a variable.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.987
And so this is going to
be, if we distribute this,

00:03:39.987 --> 00:03:43.154
it's going to be a plus b times that a

00:03:44.308 --> 00:03:46.558
plus a plus b times that b.

00:03:48.864 --> 00:03:50.290
And so this is going to be a squared,

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.467
now I'm just doing the
distributive property again.

00:03:52.467 --> 00:03:55.884
A squared plus ab plus ab plus b squared.

00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:04.865
So it's a squared plus
two ab plus b squared.

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:11.275
So this is going to be the general form.

00:04:11.275 --> 00:04:15.442
So if a is the variable, which
was x, or a in this case,

00:04:18.412 --> 00:04:20.127
then it's just going
to be whatever squared

00:04:20.127 --> 00:04:22.802
and the constant term is
going to be two times that

00:04:22.802 --> 00:04:24.254
times the variable.

00:04:24.254 --> 00:04:26.311
And I want to show that
there's some variation

00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:28.250
that you can entertain here.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.417
So if you were to see 25
plus 10x plus x squared,

00:04:38.071 --> 00:04:38.904
and someone wanted you,

00:04:38.904 --> 00:04:40.727
said "Hey, why don't you factor that?"

00:04:40.727 --> 00:04:42.885
we could say, "Look, this
right here is a perfect square.

00:04:42.885 --> 00:04:44.169
"It's five squared.

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.092
"I have the variable
squared right over here,

00:04:46.092 --> 00:04:48.192
"and then this coefficient
on our first degree term

00:04:48.192 --> 00:04:50.087
"is two times five."

00:04:50.087 --> 00:04:52.168
And so you might immediately
recognize this as

00:04:52.168 --> 00:04:54.085
five plus x squared.

00:04:55.471 --> 00:04:57.878
Now of course you could
just rewrite this polynomial

00:04:57.878 --> 00:05:00.878
as x squared plus 10 x plus 25

00:05:01.714 --> 00:05:04.763
in which case you might say,
"Okay, variable squared,

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:06.667
"some number squared, five squared,

00:05:06.667 --> 00:05:08.903
"two times that number
is the coefficient here.

00:05:08.903 --> 00:05:12.027
"So that's going to be
x plus five squared."

00:05:12.027 --> 00:05:14.321
And that's good because these two things

00:05:14.321 --> 00:05:16.488
are absolutely equivalent.
