KYLE KEANE: All right, cool.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.850
So projects, presentations
are going to happen.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.510
And we're going to start
with the video games,

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.070
and then we're going to take
a cool break in the middle

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.760
to play with a collaborative
crowdsourced, cloud-based robot

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.180
that's going to try to follow
all of our collective input

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.390
in order to grab
a piece of paper

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.930
that Abhinav, the TA
for the Arduino class,

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.450
has been building
in his free time.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.210
It's a good embarrassed face.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.190
So that's a way to
model embarrassment.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.731
I appreciate that because we're
all going to feel embarrassed

00:00:53.731 --> 00:00:55.240
when we present, and that's OK.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.330
I feel embarrassed right now
trying to get your attention

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.980
and pull you away
from your projects

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.840
because I know that that's what
you want to be doing right now.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.550
So that's OK, we're all
going to feel embarrassed.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.420
But we're going to share and
not in order to impress everyone

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.790
with how amazing
our project was,

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.760
but to open up a dialogue
about what we learned

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.630
and what other people
can learn from us.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.830
So the point of coming up
and sharing your presentation

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.050
is not to get accolades
from your friends

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.270
about how amazingly
brilliant you are.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.940
It's to share something so
that if someone's interest gets

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.600
peaked, they can go, oh cool,
how did you do that thing.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.034
And then you have a chance to
teach them about that really

00:01:34.034 --> 00:01:35.200
specific thing that you did.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.230
If you were able to make a
really cute thing on the screen

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.880
move, or if you're able to make
a really cool video game work,

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.900
or if you're able to make fun
Arduino electronics projects,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.600
this is your chance to
teach by sharing what you do

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.520
and inviting other people
to ask questions about it.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.670
So this is not about
impressing each other.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.440
Most of you will never--

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.610
which way are you
trying to shift me?

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.400
Oh yeah, you guys.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.620
Most of you won't
talk after this class.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.630
So don't worry if you do
something embarrassing,

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.940
you won't see most
of these people.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.366
The ones that you do
exchange e-mails with them

00:02:09.366 --> 00:02:10.990
and talk to them
after, and they're not

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.450
going to care if you do
something silly up here.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.120
So I just want to
set the expectation

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.870
that this is not a competitive
presentation environment.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.510
We're not getting
venture capital.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.410
There's nothing other than
learning opportunity here.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.310
ANDREW RINGLER: As Kyle
said, we're not competing.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.900
Hopefully you had fun
and learned something.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.360
Over the last two weeks,
that's the teacher's goal--

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.660
to let you have fun
and learn something.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.180
So yeah, I think the
point of this two weeks

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.000
is to get your
feedback with Arduino,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.420
and see what it's like to plan
a project and try to build it

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.770
and then figure out how
to do it better next time.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.460
So that's what we do.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.770
But that said, all your
groups did amazing.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.360
You did so much work,
which is awesome.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.800
And we're all excited to see
what you have to present.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.710
Thank you.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.647
All right.

00:03:18.647 --> 00:03:19.480
KYLE KEANE: --there.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.990
Is-- You're done?

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.470
ANDREW RINGLER: Yes, I'm done.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.405
Come on in.

00:03:23.405 --> 00:03:26.340
KYLE KEANE: All right, so
the first group to present

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.910
is going to--

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.080
I'm going to let them
come up and introduce.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.670
So the video game
groups, when you

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.410
come up, take the microphone,
introduce your game,

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.540
demo your game--

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.760
introduce your game,
talk about anything

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.700
that you feel inspired
to talk about if there

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.990
is a fun interesting
learning experience

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.770
or if something got you really
excited, talk about that.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.330
Demo your game.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.610
And then we're going to
open it up to questions.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.950
As an audience
member, the best thing

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.770
that you can do to support
someone who's presenting

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.270
is to make occasional eye
contact and pay some attention.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.570
And then at the end, be able to
ask a question that reflects--

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.816
I know, I'm very
explicit, but you'd

00:04:06.816 --> 00:04:08.440
be amazed at how many
people don't make

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.870
eye contact with presenters.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.420
And then ask
questions at the end

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.029
which reflects something
like, that looks really cool,

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:17.050
how did you do that.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.240
And what you're doing is
you're setting them up

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.480
to look smart and share
something that they're

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.790
passionate about
and feel supported

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.850
and you too will have
your chance to be up here.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.350
And I guarantee
that you will want

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.760
to have an audience
that makes eye contact

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.880
and then asks you questions
about things that were

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.720
interesting in your project.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.660
So that you too
can feel supported

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.635
and interesting and
like people care

00:04:40.635 --> 00:04:42.760
about what you're doing
because a lot of this class

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.640
was two weeks of
passion projects.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.430
We don't have a lot
of structure because I

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.500
think that you're
here for two weeks

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.840
and you should opt into the
project that you want to do

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.089
and you should find people
that you want to work with.

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:57.006
So a lot of this
work that you've

00:04:57.006 --> 00:04:58.630
done over the last
two weeks represents

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.400
a personal investment.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.390
And so respect that in each
other, like everyone who's

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.390
up here presenting put a lot of
their own interest and passion

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.010
into this.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.540
So yeah, support
support support.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.120
All right, so first group,
are you ready to present?

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.580
All right, here you go.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.930
[APPLAUSE]
