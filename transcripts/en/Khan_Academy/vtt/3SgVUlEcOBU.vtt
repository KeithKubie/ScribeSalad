00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.520
In the last video, we figured
out what is the present value

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.380
of these three different
payment timing choices.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.650
If we had a 5% risk-free rate,
and if these payments were

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.080
risk-free, instead of coming
from -- you can almost view

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.440
them as some type of government
program, where

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.000
they're asking you to choose
which of these three payment

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.060
streams from the government
do you want?

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.860
And so we'll use the same rate
that the government would pay

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.190
you, if you lent them money.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.680
And that's given by
the treasury rate.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.760
And in the first case we assumed
a 5% treasury rate.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.430
And if you watched the first
present value video, I think

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.470
you understand why compounding
going forward is the same

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.100
thing as discounting that
rate by going backwards.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.350
If you want to know how much
$100 is a year from now, you

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:54.220
multiply that times one plus
the interest rate, right?

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.060
So if it's 5%, you multiply
that times 1.05.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.770
If you're taking $110 and
going a year back,

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.350
you divide by 1.05.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.520
So it's just the
same operation.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.920
You're just going
forward or back.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.240
Forward is multiplication,
backwards is division.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.420
But anyway, the result that we
got in the last video is that

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.730
the present value -- let me do
this in a different color.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.200
And I'll introduce
my notation.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.240
The present value, if we assume
a 5% rate, no matter

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.110
how long-- how far away the
money is given to you.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.610
And you'll see what I mean
because I'll change that

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.720
assumption in a second.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.230
But if we assume that the
risk-free rate is 5%, then the

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.490
present value of $100 today,
well that was just $100.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:48.360
$110 in two years, we got that
by doing 110 divided by 1.05

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.230
squared, right?

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.710
You divide by 1.05 there, and
then you divide by 1.05 again.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:01.340
And then you get $99.77.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.640
I don't want to run out
of too much space.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.840
I could have probably done
this whole thing

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.470
a little bit bigger.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.060
And then choice number three.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.860
How did we get that?

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.320
Well, we said -- let me do that
in a different color.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.850
That was the present value of
the $20 today, plus $50 in one

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.240
year, divided by that,
discounted to the present day.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:31.460
So divided by 1.05 plus $35
divided by 1.05 squared.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.380
And we had gotten $99.36.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.100
And that's what that should be
worth to you today, if you

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.910
assume that these payments are
risk-free, and you use a 5%

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.480
discount rate.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.380
Fair enough.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.050
And based on these calculations,
choice number

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.390
one was the best, choice number
two was second best,

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.230
choice number three was third
best. Fair enough.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.020
Now what happens -- after I pose
the question, you might

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.790
want to think about it before I
show you the answer -- what

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.720
happens if I don't assume
a 5% discount rate?

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.670
What happens if I assume
a 2% discount rate?

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.600
This is just my notation.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.490
What is the present value of
these if I assume a 2%

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.020
risk-free rate, or a
2% discount rate?

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.180
Well $100, I'm getting
that today, so

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.620
that's still worth $100.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.200
You could even do that as --
let me do that in a more

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.110
vibrant color -- as 100 divided
by 1.02 to the 0

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.170
power, because we're
getting it today.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.080
But that's just 1.02 divided
by 1, which is just $100.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.740
$100 today.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:34.490
What's the present value?

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.140
It's $100.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.100
Now what's the $110 two years
out going to be worth?

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.100
So this is interesting.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.260
When the interest rate goes
down, from 5% to 2%, I'm going

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.450
to be dividing by a
smaller number.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.630
1.02 squared is a smaller number
than 1.05 squared.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.020
So the present value of this
payment should go up.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.610
Interesting.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.680
This is something to keep in
mind for later, when we start

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.140
thinking about bonds.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.750
When you lower the interest
rate, the present value of

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.490
this future payment goes up.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:08.840
And it just falls
out of the math.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.190
You're discounting by
a smaller number.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.720
Let's figure out what that is.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:20.600
So if I take $110 and I divide
it by 1.02 squared, right?

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.580
Discounted twice.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:32.390
I get $105.72.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.380
Oh, and how did I get that?

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.780
That was equal to -- I'm doing
it in reverse here -- that was

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.390
equal to 110 divided
by 1.02 squared.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.470
And our intuition was correct.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.160
Just by the interest rate
going from 5% to 2%, the

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.350
present value of this payment
two years out -- it's in year

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.330
three, but it's two years out.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.460
Actually I should
re-label this.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.610
I should call this
now, the present.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.550
I should call this year one.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.250
I was calling this year
two, one year out.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.250
But I think that makes
it confusing.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.720
I called this year two,
so this is now.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.260
So you could call
this year zero.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.530
This is year one.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.820
And this is year two.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:13.410
Anyway.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.940
The present value of this is --
it increased by $6 just by

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.430
the discount rate going
down by 3%.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.050
Fascinating.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.370
Now let's see what happens
to choice number three.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.640
Choice number three, the $20
today, the $20 now, well

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.892
that's just worth $20.

00:05:29.892 --> 00:05:38.520
Its present value is 20 plus 50
divided by 1.02, plus the

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.840
35 divided by 1.02 squared.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.090
Let's see what this adds up.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:58.130
20 plus 50 divided
by 1.02 plus 35

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.800
divided by 1.02 squared.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:11.200
$102.66.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.010
Now there's a couple of really
interesting things.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.920
And this is a really good time
to kind of let it all sink in.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.760
All of a sudden we lowered
the interest rate.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.880
And now choice number two is the
best, followed by choice

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.580
number three, followed
by choice number one.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.110
So it almost -- choice number
one was the best when we had a

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.730
5% discount rate.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.850
Now at a 2% discount rate,
choice number two is all of a

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:33.840
sudden the best.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.730
And there's something else
interesting here.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.710
Choice number two improved by a
lot more when we lowered the

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.500
interest rate, than choice
number three did.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.130
Its present value went from
$99.77 to $105.70,

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.770
so it's almost $6.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.320
While here it only improved
by less than $3, right?

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.160
So why is that?

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.130
Well, when you lower the
interest rate, the terms that

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.150
are using that discount rate the
most, benefit the most. So

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.340
all of this payment was
two years out, right?

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.760
So it benefited the most by
decreasing the discount rate,

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.100
the 1.02 squared.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.130
It changed this value
the most.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.770
These payments are spread out.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.850
Only some of its payment
is two years out.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.040
Then some of its payment is one
year out, and that's going

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.820
to benefit less.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.460
And then some of its
payment is today.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.600
So it will benefit, because you
are discounting some of

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.610
the cash payments.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.520
But it's going to
benefit by less.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.690
Anyway, I'll leave you
there in this video.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.700
And in the next video, we're
going to see what happens when

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.450
we have different discount
rates for

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.560
different amounts of time.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.460
See you in the next video.
