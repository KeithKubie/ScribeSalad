thing I think that just Google sometimes

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840
thing I think that just Google sometimes
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.590
thing I think that just Google sometimes
becomes synonymous with the internet for

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600
becomes synonymous with the internet for
 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.539
becomes synonymous with the internet for
in good ways and in bad ways so anything

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549
in good ways and in bad ways so anything
 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.649
in good ways and in bad ways so anything
good that happens with the internet

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659
good that happens with the internet
 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.819
good that happens with the internet
that's Google and anything bad that

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829
that's Google and anything bad that
 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.590
that's Google and anything bad that
happens because of the Internet that's

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600
happens because of the Internet that's
 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.359
happens because of the Internet that's
Google as well so I think part of it is

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369
Google as well so I think part of it is
 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.060
Google as well so I think part of it is
just is just that I mean we are sort of

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070
just is just that I mean we are sort of
 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.999
just is just that I mean we are sort of
associated with with some of the

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009
associated with with some of the
 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.710
associated with with some of the
disruption so I think that's part of it

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720
disruption so I think that's part of it
 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.280
disruption so I think that's part of it
the other is this sense that that google

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290
the other is this sense that that google
 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.010
the other is this sense that that google
gets value from indexing the content and

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020
gets value from indexing the content and
 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.230
gets value from indexing the content and
in that case i think everybody google

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240
in that case i think everybody google
 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.399
in that case i think everybody google
would agree one hundred percent there's

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409
would agree one hundred percent there's
 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.800
would agree one hundred percent there's
no doubt that google receives value from

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810
no doubt that google receives value from
 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.690
no doubt that google receives value from
our ability to index high quality

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700
our ability to index high quality
 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.850
our ability to index high quality
information on on the web whether it's

value from that i don't think that's in

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640
value from that i don't think that's in
 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.180
value from that i don't think that's in
dispute but i think that the part where

there's sometimes as a disconnect which
is the value that we deliver back to
