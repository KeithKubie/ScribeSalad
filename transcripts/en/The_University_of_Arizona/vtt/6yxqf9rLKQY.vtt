KATY PRUDIC: Butterflies
are amazing creatures.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.369
Of course, we admire them for
their beauty and their grace.

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:09.410
They have many important
roles in an environment.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.030
They are eating plants.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.380
They're pollinating plants.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.040
They're also being eaten
by birds, lizards, mammals.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.530
Everybody wants to eat
a tasty caterpillar.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.250
So butterflies are
central to a lot

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.170
of the interactions that are
happening within a community.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.390
Is that a monarch?

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.475
HANK VERBAIS: Yeah, yeah yeah.

00:00:28.475 --> 00:00:29.720
KATY PRUDIC: And incoming.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.584
HANK VERBAIS: Yeah,
it's pretty fresh.

00:00:31.584 --> 00:00:33.250
KATY PRUDIC: Yeah,
aren't you beautiful?

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.310
HANK VERBAIS:
Yeah, look at that.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.885
That's beautiful.

00:00:34.885 --> 00:00:36.384
KATY PRUDIC: You're
a gorgeous girl.

00:00:36.384 --> 00:00:38.510
HANK VERBAIS: OK, so we're
going to take the tag.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.635
KATY PRUDIC: And you can
tell it's girl why, Hanky?

00:00:40.635 --> 00:00:42.990
HANK VERBAIS: There
is no scent gland,

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.890
if that's the
correct name, yeah.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.210
I wanted you to see it.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.700
OK, good, AZ 530.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.730
So cool.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.550
Good job.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.720
I'm here today to learn more
about Adventure Scientists

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.620
and how to collect
data on butterflies

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.160
and flowering plants for
Adventure Scientists projects

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.205
that are going on.

00:01:09.205 --> 00:01:10.830
MICHELLE TOSHACK:
Adventures Scientists

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.670
is a nonprofit based
out of Bozeman, Montana.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.110
We do the volunteer management.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.170
And then we partner
with researchers

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.490
who have specific
conservation concerns where

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.900
data is a limiting factor.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.160
And so we have this
network of volunteers,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.280
not only over the US
but through the world.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.497
Some of our projects
are global projects.

00:01:34.497 --> 00:01:36.330
KATY PRUDIC: So the
proboscis is out, right?

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.990
So he's probing with his
proboscis, which is his straw.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.850
Butterflies are great indicators
of how an ecosystem is doing.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.290
I think it signifies whether
this habitat is working,

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.910
whether it's able to
support a variety of life,

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.520
whether you'll have a lot of
birds there, a lot of mammals.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.180
A lot of interactions
are happening.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.530
So a diverse place is often
a very productive place.
