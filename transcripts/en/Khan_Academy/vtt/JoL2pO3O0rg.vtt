00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.610
 

00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.640
In the last video, we
saw that if we started

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.700
with a massive star
about nine to 20 times

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.190
the mass of the Sun,
and when it finally

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.740
matures the remnant of
the star is roughly,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.430
or that remnant core of the star
is roughly 1 and 1/2 to 3 times

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.810
the solar mass or
the mass of the Sun,

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.150
then this remnant right here--
and let me just be clear,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.420
this nine to 20 times is
the mass of that star when

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.080
it's in its main sequence.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.340
This 1 and 1/2 to
three times is the mass

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.175
once it's shed off
a lot of the, I

00:00:35.175 --> 00:00:37.340
guess, outer
material of the star.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.270
And this is really the
mass of the remnant

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.730
of the star, kind of
the core of the star.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.060
But that remnant,
once it stops fusing,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.180
once it stops having
outward pressure,

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.230
and once it has enough density,
this, we saw in the last video,

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.180
will cause a supernova.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.951
It will cause a shock
wave to move out

00:00:53.951 --> 00:00:55.950
through the rest of the
material and essentially

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.510
cause it to blow up.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.770
And this will condense
into a neutron star.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.927
 

00:01:04.927 --> 00:01:06.760
Now, in this video what
I want to talk about

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.476
is what if we're starting with
a star that has a mass more

00:01:10.476 --> 00:01:11.850
than-- and this
is give or take--

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.990
but we don't know the
actual firm boundaries here.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.850
But what if we have a star
that is more than 20 times

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.209
the mass of the Sun?

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:22.750
And this is kind of
the original mass

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.860
before the star
burns itself out.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.120
Or when that star is kind
of reached this old age,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.480
once it has an iron core,
it has more than-- so

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.820
I could say the remnant--
the dense remnant has

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.080
more than three to four
times the mass of the Sun.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.937
And remember, it's going
to have three to four times

00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:45.770
the mass of the Sun.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.915
But it's going to be far denser.

00:01:46.915 --> 00:01:48.123
It's just going to be a core.

00:01:48.123 --> 00:01:51.930
It's going to be in iron-nickel
core that's no longer fusing.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.280
So what happens to these stars?

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.240
So it turns out that these
are so massive that even

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.110
the neutron degeneracy
pressure will not

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.860
be enough to keep the
mass from imploding.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.440
And these stars, all of
the mass in these stars

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.060
will just keep imploding.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.180
So we imagine, in the first,
in kind of Sun-like stars,

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.980
things would collapse
into white dwarfs.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.040
So maybe I should
draw that in white.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.805
So they would collapse
into white dwarfs.

00:02:20.805 --> 00:02:23.270
Now, that's not white either.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.120
There you go.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.490
They would collapse into
a white dwarfs eventually.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.670
So this is a white dwarf.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.380
 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.280
And here, the pressure
that's keeping this

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.550
from collapsing further is
electron degeneracy pressure.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.040
The atoms are squeezed so
much that the electrons are

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.647
essentially keeping them
from squeezing anymore.

00:02:41.647 --> 00:02:43.230
But if the pressure
gets large enough,

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.160
then you have the neutron star.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.120
So you have even more
mass and even a smaller--

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.960
and I'm not drawing this to
scale-- neutron stars are tiny.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.010
White dwarf stars
are on the scale

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.380
of an Earth-like like planet.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.300
Neutron stars, we learned
in the last video,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.780
are on the scale of a city.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.310
So these are
superdense, super tiny.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.566
And this has more mass
than this over here.

00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:04.440
In fact, maybe I should
just draw it as a dot

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.320
just so you have a sense
of how dense it is.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.180
It's really just like
one big atomic nucleus

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.000
or, well, it's still small.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
But it's size of a city.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.240
It's like a nucleus
the size of the city.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.706
But this right here
is a neutron star.

00:03:18.706 --> 00:03:20.580
And what's unintuitive
about what I'm drawing

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.210
is each of these smaller
things have more mass.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.020
This overcame the electron
degeneracy pressure

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.370
to collapse even further.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.520
But if the mass is
large enough, and this

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.770
is what we're talking
about in this video,

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.590
even the neutron
degeneracy pressure

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.360
will not be able to keep
that mass from collapsing.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.550
And there's even
theoretical quark stars

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.290
where the quark
degeneracy pressure--

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.885
but if you get even
beyond that, then

00:03:43.885 --> 00:03:47.410
it all collapses
into a single point--

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.560
and I'm simplifying
here-- but it

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.200
collapses into a single
point of infinite density,

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.920
infinite mass density.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.030
And this is really the
mass of a black hole.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.530
And I'm calling it the mass of
a black hole, because there's

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.820
different ways how you could
view where a black hole starts

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.570
and ends or what exactly
is the black hole.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:20.860
So this is all the
mass of the black hole

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.310
or we could say of
the original star.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.260
So when we're talking about
that remnant being times three

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.770
to four solar masses,
all of that mass

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.987
is now being contained.

00:04:29.987 --> 00:04:30.820
Well, not all of it.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.409
Some of it is released as
energy during the supernova.

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:35.200
And that was also true
of the neutron star.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.620
But most of that
mass is now being

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.630
contained in this
infinitely small point.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.094
And you'll hear physicists
and mathematicians

00:04:44.094 --> 00:04:45.135
talk about singularities.

00:04:45.135 --> 00:04:48.040
 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.850
And singularities
are really points,

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.530
even in mathematics, where
everything breaks down,

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.510
where nothing starts
to make sense anymore,

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.130
where the mathematical
equations don't give you

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.400
a defined answer.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.500
And this is a
singularity because you

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.840
have a ton of mass in an
infinitely small space.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.050
You essentially have an
infinite density right here.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.440
And this is hard to visualize.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.190
But you have kind of an infinite
curvature in space/time right

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.690
here.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:14.860
And I can't visualize that.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.920
So maybe we'll think
about that in more videos.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.310
But the reason why I said
that there's different ways

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.080
to think about where
a black hole is,

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.850
or where it starts and ends, is
that this is where the mass is.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.975
And if there was any other
mass that was over here,

00:05:26.975 --> 00:05:29.160
it would obviously be
attracted to this mass

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.650
and then become part
of that singularity.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.430
It would add to that mass,
that already huge mass, that's

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.449
in an infinitely
small point in space.

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.490
But the reason why the
boundary is hard to define

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.330
is because there's
some point in space

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.820
around that singularity
at which no matter

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.020
what that thing is, no matter
how much energy that thing has,

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.400
it will not be able to escape
the gravitational influence

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.510
of the black hole, of
that ultradense mass.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.700
So even if it was
electromagnetic radiation,

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.050
even if it was light,
and even if it's

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.000
a light that's shone
away from the mass,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.130
it will eventually
have to go back.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.960
It will not be able to escape
the gravitational influence.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.100
And so the boundary where if
you're within that boundary--

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:27.900
that's really a sphere-- so that
boundary around the singularity

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.420
where if you're
within the boundary,

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.170
no matter what you do,
no matter if you're

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.040
electromagnetic
radiation, you're

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.360
never going to be able
to escape the black hole.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.310
If you are beyond
that boundary, you

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.130
might be able to
escape the black hole.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.570
So this guy could escape.

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.430
This guy over here, no
matter what he does,

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.030
is going to have to go
back into the black hole.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.530
This boundary right here is
called the event horizon.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.010
This right here is
the event horizon,

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.404
another word used in a lot
of science fiction movies.

00:06:55.404 --> 00:06:57.320
And for good reason,
because it's fascinating.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.130
And we'll actually learn in
future videos-- hopefully,

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.740
about Hawking radiation-- we'll
see that that is not radiation

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.360
from the black hole itself.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.850
It's the byproduct
of quantum effects

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.520
that are occurring
at the event horizon.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.590
But the event horizon, it's
this kind of point in space,

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.130
or this sphere in space,
or this boundary in space.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.460
Anything closer or
within the event horizon

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.540
has to eventually end up in
the singularity, contributing

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.110
to that mass.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.260
Anything on the outside
has a chance of escaping.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.820
So what would a
black hole look like?

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.730
Well, not even light
can escape from it.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.670
So it will be black.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.540
It will be black in
the purest sense.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.700
It will not emit any
type of radiation

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.170
from the black hole
itself, from that mass.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:45.554
And so here are some depictions
I got from NASA of black holes.

00:07:45.554 --> 00:07:47.470
And so just to be clear
what's happening here.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.550
What you're seeing
here is black.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.230
You can view that
as the black hole.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:52.380
When people talk
about the black hole,

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.280
that's often what
they're talking about.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.700
But there's a point
of infinite density

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.210
at the center of this
black sphere right here.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:01.970
And what you see as
that black sphere,

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.060
that really is the boundary
of the event horizon.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.640
So this right here is the
boundary of the event horizon.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.890
And what we're seeing right
here is the accretion disk

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.240
around the black hole.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.525
As all of this matter gets
closer and closer to it,

00:08:16.525 --> 00:08:18.401
it's being squeezed
more and more.

00:08:18.401 --> 00:08:20.900
It's moving faster and faster
and getting hotter and hotter.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.290
And that's why the way
this artist depicted it,

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:23.980
it looks like the
stuff over here

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.300
is redder and hotter than
the stuff further out.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.870
It's just accelerating as it
approaches that event horizon.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.399
Once it's in the event horizon,
we cannot even see the light it

00:08:33.399 --> 00:08:35.690
is emitting, even though it
would be starting to become

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.780
unbelievably energetic.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.929
Here's some other pictures.

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:41.490
This is a picture
of a star being

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:42.434
ripped apart-- not a picture.

00:08:42.434 --> 00:08:43.830
This is actually an
artist's depictions.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.288
All of these are
artist depictions.

00:08:45.288 --> 00:08:47.800
We never were able to
get such a good pictures

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.974
of actual action occurring
near black holes.

00:08:49.974 --> 00:08:51.140
These are artist depictions.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.320
But this is a star being
ripped apart by a black hole.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.410
So this star is getting pretty
close to this black hole.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:01.370
Already out here,
where the star is,

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.930
it's very strong
gravitational attraction.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.680
So any mass that's being emitted
from the star in that direction

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.730
is slowly being pulled
into the black hole.

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:13.220
So the star is kind of being
ripped apart by the black hole.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.330
This is maybe a better
depiction of it.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.510
This is the star at first.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:20.980
And once it becomes under the
influence of the black hole's

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.350
gravitation, it starts
to kind of elongate

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:24.950
and gets ripped apart.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:28.019
And its matter starts
spiraling in closer and closer

00:09:28.019 --> 00:09:28.810
to that black hole.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:30.652
And then once it's
in the event horizon,

00:09:30.652 --> 00:09:31.860
we won't even see it anymore.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.500
Because even the light
from that matter,

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.520
that intensely hot matter that's
entering into the black hole,

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.250
cannot even escape
the black hole itself.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.420
Anyway, hopefully you
found that interesting.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.030
And I want to be
clear, we still don't

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:48.230
understand a lot
about black holes.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.270
In fact, this whole
notion of a singularity,

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.320
the fact that all the
math and all the theory

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.680
breaks down at the singularity,
is a pretty good sign

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.040
that our theory isn't complete.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.456
Because if our
theory is complete,

00:09:59.456 --> 00:10:02.030
we would maybe get something a
little bit more sensical than

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.340
just all of our equations
not making sense

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.340
at that infinitely dense point.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.850
Anyway, hopefully you
found that interesting.
