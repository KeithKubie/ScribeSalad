00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.669
- Holy crap man, I
thought you were kidding.

00:00:03.702 --> 00:00:05.338
(laughs)

00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:07.840
- Where better to play
Dungeons and Dragons than

00:00:07.873 --> 00:00:08.941
in your own dungeon?

00:00:08.974 --> 00:00:11.344
- (laughs) It's crazy.

00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:12.445
- What? What's so funny?

00:00:12.478 --> 00:00:14.480
- Oh, you're just this huge
hunk.

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:16.382
- Please, come on. You
know I'm a total nerd.

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:19.085
I mean I've got one of those,

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:21.687
that thing right over there,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.589
bunch of these.

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:24.891
- Hey, I've got an idea.

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:26.859
Last season of Game of Thrones,
let's watch it together.

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:27.794
Guy's night.

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:28.861
- Are you kidding?

00:00:28.894 --> 00:00:29.695
Yes!

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:30.562
- Right?

00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:33.566
- Who's gonna sit on the Iron
Stone?

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.269
(electronic squelch)

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:38.805
Cone. The cone. The Iron Cone.

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:41.974
- It's "Iron Throne."

00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:43.309
You know that, Joe, right?

00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:45.878
- (laughs) Just kiddin', man.

00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:46.779
It's a joke.

00:00:46.812 --> 00:00:47.647
- Okay.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.648
- Excuse me.

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:50.116
- Sure.

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.652
- [Joe] Hey man, what
the fuck! It's Throne!

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:54.420
You're making me look
like an idiot in there!

00:00:54.453 --> 00:00:56.022
- [Man In Hall] I'm so
sorry sir, it must be

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:57.356
the equipment, I don't know.

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:59.759
- [Joe] Just shut up
and do your fuckin' job!

00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:01.794
So uh, Sophia's gonna whip up
some

00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:03.996
chocolate chip cookies,
should be done any second.

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:06.265
- That didn't sound like Sophia,
Joe.

00:01:06.298 --> 00:01:08.701
- Oh, we haven't geeked
out on Infinity War.

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:11.104
- We haven't! We haven't,
actually.

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:12.205
It was crazy.

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:14.273
Which death hit you the hardest?

00:01:14.306 --> 00:01:15.108
(electronic feedback)

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:16.309
- Oh, god damn it!

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:18.411
- What's wrong? You okay?

00:01:19.278 --> 00:01:21.547
- Um, yeah. What were we talking
about?

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.382
- Infinity War. Which
death hit you the hardest?

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:25.952
- Oh, right. Which death in
Infinity War

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:27.253
hit me the hardest?

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:30.123
- [Man In Hall] I can't
hear you, it's not working!

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:32.658
- Which death in Infinity
War hit me the hardest?

00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:35.028
- [Man In Hall] Which death?

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:36.696
Spider-Man!

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.798
- Spider-Man. Duh.

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:39.632
Excuse me.

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:40.499
- Sure.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.268
- [Joe] Dude all this equipment
is shit!

00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:43.269
Why are you even here?

00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:45.204
- I'm sorry, we're
subterranean, so it's hard

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:48.741
for the waves to travel through
the walls.

00:01:50.342 --> 00:01:52.411
- What is this, Joe?

00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:54.580
- This is my friend Taron.

00:01:54.613 --> 00:01:55.581
- Hello.

00:01:55.614 --> 00:01:58.151
- He lives in this hallway.

00:01:58.184 --> 00:02:00.987
- [Taron] I do, and I don't
feed Joe nerd knowledge

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.256
through an IFB that isn't
working today.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.090
- Taron!

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:06.759
- I said I don't do that.

00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:08.327
- Why?

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.798
Why Joe, why do this? Why do any
of this?

00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:15.668
- Because it's not enough
to be a stud anymore.

00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:17.603
Nerds have taken over.

00:02:17.636 --> 00:02:18.571
Back in the 80's,

00:02:18.604 --> 00:02:20.039
I just beat the crap
out of dorks like you.

00:02:20.072 --> 00:02:21.741
But I can't anymore.

00:02:23.275 --> 00:02:25.511
Now guys like Taron are in
charge.

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:28.681
But I mean, look at him. He
deserves it.

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:30.650
He's got kind eyes and sexual
dynamism

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:32.318
I can never live up to.

00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:33.319
That's why he's the great--

00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:37.290
What the? Now you get
the ear piece to work!

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:39.692
- I'm just gonna head out now, I
think.

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:41.360
- Master, he knows too much.

00:02:41.393 --> 00:02:42.461
- What, no.

00:02:42.494 --> 00:02:46.832
- You're not gonna tell
anybody about this, are you?

00:02:46.865 --> 00:02:48.367
- You should stay, Josh.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.236
We're just about to play Pogs.

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.738
- Right. You like Pogs, don't
you?

00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:55.275
- Joe has the biggest slammer.

00:02:59.478 --> 00:03:01.013
- You guys are coming back soon,
right?

00:03:01.046 --> 00:03:03.683
- [Sophia] Joe, Taron, cookies!

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:04.951
- Be there in a second, honey!

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:06.953
- Mm, I hope she's making
her snickerdoodles.

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:09.055
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:11.290
It's really dark in here.

00:03:11.323 --> 00:03:15.828
- [Sophia] Is your little
friend staying for cookies?
