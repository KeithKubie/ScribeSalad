00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.310
There are some default behaviors on
the street view panorama object that you

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.200
can override, if you like.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.140
By default, street names
are written on the panorama.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.000
Zoom gestures to zoom in and
out are available and

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.360
user navigation is enabled.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.740
You can check and
set each of these using the following.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.720
For street names,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.880
you can call isStreetNamesEnabled, and
this will return a true or a false.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.400
To set the street name,
you can call setStreetNamesEnabled.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.630
And you pass that ability in true or
false to turn street names on or off.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.300
For zoom gestures,
you call isZoomGestureEnabled

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.740
to check if it's on or off and
that will give you a true or a false.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.160
And similarly,
you call setZoomGesturesEnabled and

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.460
pass that ability to turn them on or
off.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.010
For user navigation,
you check isUserNavigationEnabled,

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.390
and this will return a true or a false.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.250
And you call SetUserNavigationEnabled
to turn it on or

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.010
off, passing an ability true or false.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.270
It's as simple as that.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.330
Let's take a look at what this will
look like in an application, and

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.540
we'll see what it looks like with
street names on and streets names off.
