&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.410
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Good
afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.700
and welcome to the African
Middle East division.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.490
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb, chief of
the division, and I'm very happy

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:38.750
to see you all here for the program
today, which is a discussion on how

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.710
to make a film under very
difficult circumstances.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.720
But more about it in a moment.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.290
As most of you already
know, our division is made

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.140
up of three sections: the
African, the Middle East,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.910
and the Hebraic sections.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.940
We are responsible for materials
from 78 different countries

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.200
in the Middle East,
Central Asia, the caucuses,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.380 position:56%
as well as from the entire continent
of Africa, North and South Saharan.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.400
Our Hebraic and Judaic collections
come from all over the world.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.440
We also serve these
materials to patrons here

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.850 position:56%
and in our reading room, in our
reading room, and organize programs,

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.370
exhibits, and other activities
that highlight these collections

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.920
and that inform our
patrons about the countries

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.010
and the cultures these
publications come from.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.880
The African section is
very active in acquiring

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.770 position:56%
and developing collections, briefing
visitors coming from the countries

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.110
of the regions and the regions
for which they're responsible.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.300
They've organized symposia,
workshops

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.810
and have an ongoing program
in partnership with a poetry

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.810 position:56%
and literature center at the African
Society for the National Summit

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.110
on Africa, which is
the conversations

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.280
with African poets and writers.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.470
And we've had some exceptional
people come and talk to us,

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.530
including Chinua Achebe
and Ali Mazrui.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.580
We in the African and Middle East
Division are reaching out to those

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.140
who have researched and done work
on our countries of responsibility.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.190
We ask them to share with us
their insights, their findings,

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.360
and their ongoing work so
that all of us attending

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:28.600
and participating can learn
more about those regions.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.680
Today our special guest is
J.R. Biersmith who will talk

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.410
about making a documentary
in Somalia, Men in the Arena,

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.890 position:56%
and about the challenges two members

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.870 position:56%
of the national Somali soccer team
faced together as friends on the way

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.240
to achieving their dreams.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.240
And to introduce Mr. Biersmith
is our own Abdulahi Ahmed,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.210
who has been, himself, a member of
the national soccer team of Somali,

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:06.490
i.e. that is before he joined the
library and who continues to train

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.770
and supervise young American
Somali soccer players here

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.940
in the United States.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.070
So, Abdulahi, will you
please introduce the speaker?

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.370
Thank you.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.670
&gt;&gt; Abdulahi Ahmed: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.090
I was a former soccer player,
but I still play on Saturdays.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.750 position:56%
Okay, so, it's a short introduction.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.240 position:56%
Men in the Arena is J.R. Biersmith's
first feature-length movie.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.430
The three-year journey to make
the film in Somalia, Kenya,

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.210
and the United States has been
chronicled in a number of national

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.980
and international publications
including the BBC,

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.080
Sports Illustrated,
and the NPR Radio.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:03.670
Prior to his work on the
film, Mr. Biersmith produced

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.480
and published content
for more than ten years

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.280
across the country,
the United States.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.970 position:56%
He started his broadcast
journalism work at the Miami Herald.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.930
He graduated with a BA
in International Business

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:26.430
from Bradley University, and he
has a MA in broadcast journalism

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.420
from the University of Miami.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.510
And we should welcome
Mr. J.R. Biersmith.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:41.190
[ Applause ]

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.490
&gt;&gt; J.R. Biersmith:
Thank you so much.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.980
It's great to be here.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.990
Move this little microphone.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.580
Can everybody hear me okay?

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.600
Okay. I came by the library
yesterday and I met Abdulahi,

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.010
and I didn't know that
you played soccer.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.030
I learned the history of all the
research that he's been working

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.920
on in Somalia, and never
did he mention himself.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.920
A typical Somali way.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.730
So, I really appreciate the
invitation to come and speak today.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.830
It's really an exceptional place.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.660
On the way in, there's a, if you're
watching via webcast at some point,

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.550
there's a little map maybe
75 yards from me, not little,

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.830
a giant map that was made in
the 1500s that has maybe one

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:29.920 position:56%
of the first, the first image of the
United States, or of North America,

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.810
which is kind of remarkable.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.380
We're surrounded by all of
these books and it's just,

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.710
it's really a beautiful place.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.610
And I want talk about
another beautiful place

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.040
that doesn't always get referred

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.890
to as a beautiful place,
and that's Somalia.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.430
And journalists often say
for years, they've debated

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.410
about when it started,
but journalism is supposed

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.780
to be a first rough
draft of history.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.640
And I looked at the world,
the world stage and thought

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.830
about where Somalia
fit on the world stage.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.980
And it's been a failed
state for a long time,

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.810 position:56%
it's been a troubled place that was,
in 2012, about to seem like it was

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.730
on the cusp of some
kind of comeback.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.010
So that's where kind of my
journey and look at Somalia was,

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.780
can we look at it through
a new prism?

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.240
Can we see it through a new light?

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:28.100
And I thought, as a storyteller, a
documentary might be a good place

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.350
to try to write a first draft
of history about a place

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.570
that doesn't often get
looked at in that way.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.220
So, that's why I named it
what I did, and why I wanted

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.610
to talk to you all today.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.300
So, we'll scoot through here.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.230
I took this image here of
Morgan, which is an elephant

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.580
that has been researched
for a very long time.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.820
And it was in Kenya, and
recently, Morgan made some news

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:01.730
because he traversed across -- I
don't know if it's a he or she,

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.830
so don't, if you're a wildlife
expert, don't quote me on this,

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.940
but crossed into Somalia.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.030
And it struck me because I -- you
very rarely think about Somalia

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:16.640
and wildlife, and there's
images like this that exist

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.940
and are happening every day there

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.490
that rarely find itself
inside the news.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.970
And to talk about, you
know, a living heartbeat,

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.750
I think that's what I was
chasing as a filmmaker is,

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:30.030
can we get into Somalia and
find something that feels alive?

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.410
That feels like it's not death
and destruction and war and piracy

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.320
and famine and the single story.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:41.580
So, in 2012, I was in
the process of moving

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.220
from New York City to Los Angeles.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.600
And being a -- I started out my
career in finance in New York City,

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.540
and then I took a vow of poverty
to be a journalist and went

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.750
to the University of Miami.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:58.230
And on the way, after a
quick stint in New York,

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:02.960
I went back to St. Louis and picked
up my sister's old 2006 Saturn

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.750
and made my way to Los Angeles.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.570
And while I was in St.
Louis, I just happened

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.460
to catch a story on the radio.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.420
And it was NPR's Fresh
Air with Terry Gross.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.790
Maybe some of you have listened
to that show, of course.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.980
And Michelle was talking about a
book of hers called Decade of Fear.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.860
And while she was talking
about Decade of Fear,

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.500
Terry Gross prompted
her and said, "You know,

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.740
there was a story inside your book
about a young man from Mogadishu.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:33.560
And he and three of his friends
had an encounter with Al-Shabaab

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.140
that was quite difficult
and I'd, you know,

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.170
appreciate it if you
would talk about that."

00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:41.250
And so, Michelle jumped into
this story, and it's one of those

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:44.860
where you're driving down the road,
and you don't remember driving.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.170
You just kind of remember
being captivated by something

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:49.610
but you got there safely.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.350 position:56%
And I remember getting to my
sister's house and taking some notes

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.820
and thinking, something
just happened.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.000
I just heard a story about a place

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.880
that I hadn't thought
of in a long time.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.000
And the story that she was telling
was about this young man, Ismael,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.530
he was 16, and he was recruited
by Al-Shabaab and he said,

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:09.830
"I want to get an education,

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:13.230
I don't want to join this
proxy terrorist group."

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:16.970 position:56%
And they took matters into their own
hands, along with three other boys,

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.560
and they took them
inside the soccer stadium

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:25.320
and they publicly amputated his
right hand and his left foot.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.300
And then they came back two
weeks later and got more.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:34.110
And Michelle Shephard told this
story to Terry Gross and continued

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.810
to say, "Hey, inside my book
I describe what happens."

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.110
Well, she wrote a paper,

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.030
or she wrote an article
for the Toronto Star.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.530
She's a national security
correspondent.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:47.910
And that work emboldened the Somali
diaspora that was living in Canada.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.020
And they started a project
called Project Ismael.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.130
And project Ismael was
a giant response to,

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:58.080
how do we get this young man
out of Mogadishu onto safe soil?

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.160
Like, there's no way he can
get, you know, doctor's care.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.090
And she wrote the story.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.720
Canada didn't take him
in, but Norway did.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.010
And so, then she flew
back to Mogadishu --

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:12.290
well, actually Nairobi because
they got him out, met in Nairobi

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.540 position:56%
and he ended up in the Arctic Circle
and she accompanied him there.

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.820
And as you can see
from this image here,

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:24.650 position:56%
the top right is Ismael inside
Mogadishu, and then you can see he's

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:28.770
in the Arctic Circle
up in Northern Norway.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.560
And that story really struck me.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.690
Because it was the first time
I realized that I'd thought

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.490
about Somalia through the
eyes of a young person.

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:40.380
And I remember somewhere in one
of the articles that she wrote,

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.020
he mentioned wanting
to kick a soccer ball.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:48.290
And I spent the next nine
months after listening

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.160
to that story in a deep dive.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.700
It's one of those where, if you've
ever been on, you hear music

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.570
on the radio maybe, and then
you have to Wikipedia it and see

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.670
who sang that song, and then
three hours later you're

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.560
down some rabbit hole of research?

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.320
That was what happened with me for
Somalia and it took me nine months.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.390
And there was a show on,

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:08.400
I don't know if you've ever seen
the Showtime show Home Front

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.460
or Homeland, rather.

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:14.420
And you know, she's --
Carrie, the figure in the film

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.580
or in the TV show, she's always
pegging things up to a board

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.690
and sticking them up and
getting images and trying

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:20.990
to get her plan together.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:22.290
Well, I did the same thing.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:25.840 position:56%
I got a board together and I started
taking all these images of Somalia,

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.420
trying to figure out, what was
the story that I wanted to tell?

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:34.420 position:56%
And it just so happens that FIFA had
put some AstroTurf inside the main

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.290
soccer stadium in Mogadishu.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:38.970
And that story was making its
way through, you know, Twitter

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.500 position:56%
and the internet and various places.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.670
And I thought, uh-oh,
this is something.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:50.880
This is the first time that
there is a turf in a lot of years

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.290
that young men can go and
women can go play soccer.

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:57.330
And the national soccer team
seems like it's reassembling

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:01.100
and it's going to try to play
in this annual tournament.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:06.740
So, I put this Black
Hawk Down image here

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.550
because in this nine-month
journey of trying to make sense

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:12.990
of Somalia, I read a lot of books.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:14.890
And one of them, of
course, was Black Hawk Down.

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:17.720 position:56%
And the significance of it, as I
thought of a lot of the young people

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.960
of Mogadishu, and they were born
the same year that Black Hawk

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.170
Down happened in that
October of 1993.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.620
And so, when you think about
the seminal battle and kind

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:33.270
of US foreign policy, the idea that
young people were being born just

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.580
down the street, and now we're

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.930
on the national soccer team
potentially really fascinated me.

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:41.270
Like, there was this big gap in
history, like a lost generation,

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:44.340
and I thought maybe this was an
opportunity to tell that story.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.270
So, I want to play
something for you real quick,

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:50.240
because this will take you
inside of, I think inside

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.200
of my head a little bit, and
why listening to the foreword

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.400
of Black Hawk Down ended up being
a big therapeutic moment for me.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.700
So, this is about a minute-thirty.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.000
I'm going to let this
run for a second.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.860
It's Mark Bowden introducing
the foreword

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.440
of his book, Black Hawk Down.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.740
Oop, that didn't work.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.140
We'll try this again.

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:12.040
Uh-oh. I preloaded all
this stuff, there it is.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:16.500
&gt;&gt; The Battle of the Black
Sea, or as the Somalis call it,

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.720
Maalintii Rangers, the
Day of the Rangers,

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.270
is one that America has
preferred to forget.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:26.360
The images it produced of dead
soldiers dragged by jeering mobs

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:32.850
through the streets of Mogadishu
are among the most horrible

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:41.270 position:56%
and disturbing in our history, made
all the worse by the good intentions

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.990
that prompted our intervention.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:49.740
There were no American reporters
in Mogadishu on October third

00:13:49.740 --> 00:14:05.570
and fourth of 1993, but after a
week or so of frenzied attention,

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:10.850
the world events quickly
summoned journalists elsewhere.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:17.190
President Clinton's decision,
just days after the fight,

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.680
to end Task Force Ranger's
mission to Somalia,

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.710
accomplished what he intended,
to slam the door on the episode.

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:27.590 position:56%
In Washington, a whiff of failure is
enough to induce widespread amnesia.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:28.890
There was a [inaudible]
investigation and two days

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:30.190
of congressional hearings

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:31.490
that produced the partisan report
blaming the president and Secretary

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:32.790
of Defense Les Aspin, who
resigned two months later.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:34.090
But that was it.

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:35.390
I began working on this story
about two and a half years

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:36.690
after the battle was fought.

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:37.990
I've been intrigued by the
early accounts of the fight,

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:39.290
both as a citizen and as a writer.

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:40.590
But the undertaking intimidated me.

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:41.890
I had no military background
or sources.

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:43.190
Nevertheless, I remained
curious enough

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:44.490
to read whatever stories
I saw about the incident.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:45.790
I was especially intrigued

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.090
by President Clinton's subsequent
struggles to deal with it.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:48.390
&gt;&gt; J.R. Biersmith: So that's it.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:49.720
And, I wanted to play that and
share that with you because,

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.180
first he's talking about why
he was introduced to the book.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.340
And then he says, "I've been
a journalist for a long time,"

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.030
this is Mark Bowden speaking,
you know, inside this piece,

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.900
"and I had no foreign
correspondent experience."

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.100
Well, I was laying up, many a
nights, thinking, I don't either.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.390
And when I heard him say that,

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:12.290
I suddenly felt this,
okay, I can do this.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.410
Like, I think that, if
he did it, I can do it.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:18.570
And for me, it was,
in a similar way,

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:22.140
akin to what Michelle Shephard's
storytelling did for me.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:26.890
It kind of lit this spark of, and
why I think story is so important.

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:33.250 position:56%
And their rough draft of history was
a link for me to say, I think I want

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:37.010
to try to understand a piece of the
storytelling that's going on there.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:38.310
And so, when Mark Bowden said that,

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:42.550
and I told him personally
a few weeks ago, it really,

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:45.520
it emboldened me and I
felt like I can go do this.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.670
And not too soon after,
I had touched base

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.470
with the Somali Football
Federation in Mogadishu.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.760
Football, soccer here in the US.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:58.190 position:56%
And I got an email shortly after I
said, "I want to make a documentary,

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.850
and I want to do it about the
Somali national soccer team."

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:03.440
And I don't think he really
understood what I wanted to do.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:07.500
So, I was put in the process of
putting together a big draft trying

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.720
to explain to him in basic language
why I wanted access to the team

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.270
and why I wanted to
come to Mogadishu.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:15.810
Because keep in mind, very
rarely does a Western journalist,

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.920
especially in a war-torn
space like this,

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.800
want to come tell a
story about soccer.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.780
So, I think he was a little bit
like, "Why are you doing this?

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.080
Who's paying you?

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.380
Are you the CIA?

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.680
Like, are you some kind of
counter-intelligence guy?

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:27.980
What's happening here?"

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:31.550
So, I got an email, which I have
lit on the screen here and it says,

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:34.650
it's from the secretary
general's assistant saying,

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:38.550
"My secretary general is in Tahiti
for the beach soccer world cup

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:41.560
as he is a member of FIFA's
beach soccer committee.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.740
It's the first time in nearly
ten years that a member

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:47.600
from Somalia is doing a
FIFA work at a world event

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.500
since Farr Ado [phonetic]
was banned by FIFA."

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.260 position:56%
That was a gentleman that was a part
of the Somali Football Federation.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.940
"You can now meet him if
you interest face to face.

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.240
You can have a meeting."

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.030
So, it's a little bit of a broken
English, but that's the email I got

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:05.210 position:56%
on a Sunday, and three days later, I
used some airline points and I flew

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:09.690
down to Tahiti, and I met the
soccer federation president,

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:14.490 position:56%
and it took six days to convince him
to let me have access to the team.

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:18.240
And I think it was just
a bridge-building thing.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.660
I think he just wanted to fully
understand why I wanted to do it

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.790
and what my intent was, so I just
wanted to share that picture.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.640
And there, you see there,
Abdiqani is the Somali Football

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.940
Federation president.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.240
So that's where it
started, and he told me

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.560
that there was a soccer
tournament starting a month later

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.580
that the Somali was
going to participate in.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:38.150
Well, the Somali community
in Nairobi,

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.550
Kenya was having a
little bit of trouble.

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:42.960
Because there had just
been a terrorist attack

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.860 position:56%
at the Nairobi mall called Westgate.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.720
And inside the Westgate
Mall in September 2013,

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:53.050
a number of people were wounded
and maybe 60 or 70 were injured.

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.490
And a month later, the Somali
national team was coming to town

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:57.120
to Nairobi to play soccer.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.090
So it felt kind of like,
on the world stage,

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.320
that something was happening, and
all these young boys were going

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.230
to come coalesce and
try to play some soccer.

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.020
That's where our film begins.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:09.270
So, when I get there, I had
no idea who I was meeting.

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:10.860
I had done all of this research.

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.170
I showed you the pegboard
that I created.

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:17.320
I put all these faces on it,
and there was one kid that I saw

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.110
on the internet whose
information I could find

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:20.980
and it was this young
man named Saadiq.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.200
And Saadiq, you could see
here, it's a picture of he

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.190
and his little brother
in Mogadishu as kids,

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:28.560
and then he's got the soccer ball
on his head, and another photo

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.000
that you see is my
co-producer sitting

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.310
around a table with
Saadiq and Sa'ad.

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:35.610
And Sa'ad is his best friend

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:39.460
from this small village called
Afgoye that's just outside

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:40.880
of Mogadishu.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.140
And we had handed out
a questionnaire,

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.220
because we didn't know
anything about the boys,

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.980
handed out this questionnaire,
there was an English and Somali,

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.660
and Saadiq came up to me while we
had handed out the questionnaire

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:55.910
and said, "J.R., you know, my
friend has a really hard story

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:59.810
that he doesn't really feel
comfortable talking about.

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.090
I was wondering if you, if he had

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:03.500
to write it all on
this piece of paper."

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.170
And I said, "No, he
can tell us later.

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.950
Like, we're going to be
here all week, you know,

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:09.830
like for a couple weeks frankly."

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:14.650
And, it turns out that Sa'ad was
captured by Al-Shabaab in 2010,

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:17.220
and they went and they grabbed
everyone in his village.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.450
After seven days of being captured,

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.210
he was told he was
going to be killed.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:25.130
The village elders worked to get
him released, but they had gone

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:28.040
around all his village, told all
the people to come out and watch,

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.520
that he was going to
be publicly whipped.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:36.190
And as he was trying to share
the story through Saadiq,

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:39.580
inside this moment, I
realized there's 20, you know,

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.540
maybe 18 kids on this team.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.620
But something's happening here.

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:47.140
Like there's a kid that knows a
little bit of English that's living

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:50.290
in Nairobi because a lot of Somalis
get pushed out and are, you know,

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.800
there's a big Somali
community in Kenya.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.100
But I felt like there was this

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.210
like brotherhood thing
that was happening.

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.070
This humanity thing that
I was chasing in Somalia,

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.130
seeing one young man
have a friendship

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.490
with another and look after him.

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:07.130
And there was, I remember vividly
that Sa'ad had beads of sweat

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:10.060
that were falling down his head
as he tried to recount the story

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:13.070
to Saadiq and then Saadiq told
my co-producer, and I was kind

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:15.660
of listening from afar, and
I was just taking his photo.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:17.630
And so, I thought that
was maybe the first thing

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:21.370
that would get me a window
into this team and the humanity

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:22.910
and maybe something
that might be here.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:24.270 position:56%
And it just so turned out that Sa'ad

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.820
and Saadiq were the two best
players on the national team.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:30.700
So, as the story and the weeks
would progress with this team,

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.310
that's the storyline
we ended up following.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.510
A few more slides,
and I'll tell you,

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:37.330
and we'll open it up
for questioning.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:41.620
Here's the thing about
Somalia, which,

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.860 position:56%
when you're doing all your research,
you know, for a Mark Bowden,

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.230
he flew in the back of a cot plane.

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:51.430
And cot is the, you know, a leafy
substance that gets chewed on

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:54.980
and gives you a small little
high if you chew enough of it.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.430
And that's how he got
into Mogadishu.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:00.360
Well, I got into Mogadishu because
Michelle Shephard, the same woman

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.470
who I heard on the
radio back in 2012 --

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:06.080
I was nervous to contact her, but
I waited a full year, I said, "Hey,

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.380
I'm making a documentary.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.680
I've been to Kenya.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.980
I've spent all this
time with this team.

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.750
I need to get back to Mogadishu.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:13.050
And I need to know how."

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:16.300
And she said, "Well,
it's complicated.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.760
Asymmetric warfare," meaning an
attack can come from anywhere

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.600
at anytime, "has made reporting
in Mogadishu quite difficult.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.310
Even though Al-Shabaab,
this terrorist group,

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:26.230
has kind of been pushed out
of the city and is on the run,

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:28.040
they still do targeted attacks.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.440
So, it is, it is difficult,
but I can help you.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.090
I can help you get back in.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.420
And so, when you go back to
Mogadishu, you're on the ground,

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.420
and as a white Western
journalist, you have a --

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:41.600
or storyteller, you go in an SUV,
a blacked-out SUV, you have a truck

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.000
in front of you, and you know, four
guys sitting on the back of it,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.280
and that's how you
navigate through the city.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.680
And I'll show you a clip
of that in a second.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:54.570
But it got to this realization of,
in the planning to go to Mogadishu,

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:59.300
that access to my subjects
was the biggest challenge.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:03.090
And further got me pushed towards
like, I have to tell this story

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:05.650
because these kids can't
tell their own story.

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:08.150
Because if they speak out, you
know, as public soccer players,

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:10.810
everybody knows who they are,
if they try to speak their truth

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:13.680
and just talk, it's
going to get suppressed.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.220
Or they'll become targets.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:17.760
They will get attacked.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.160
So, there was a real reluctance

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.930
when we first met them
to even say the word.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:24.020
Like they wouldn't
even utter the word.

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:26.800
And so that was the most
difficult challenge about trying

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.280
to make a film about Somalia
was, how do you even get access

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.130
to your subjects when you have
to travel around in this car,

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.190
or you can only talk via Skype?

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:38.540 position:56%
So, I'm going to show you how I kind

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:41.240
of navigated getting
access to my subjects.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:45.470
This is the young man Saadiq that I
showed you, and he and I, over the,

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:47.840
before I went to Mogadishu,
like six to eight months later,

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.460
he and I would talk on Skype
once a week, and I was just going

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:55.430
to show you a quick clip of
one of our conversations.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:03.670 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Saadiq: I'm not feeling good for
football because, well, I just train

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:11.560
and I hope to see some
change in the future.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.950
&gt;&gt; J.R. Biersmith: Okay.

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:18.600
Well, keep your head up.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.900
You'll be okay.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.200
&gt;&gt; Saadiq: Yeah.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.500
&gt;&gt; J.R. Biersmith:
You're a good player, man.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.800
You're young, don't forget that.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.100
You'll get your opportunity.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.140
&gt;&gt; Saadiq: I know, but, you know,
what I'm thinking is, you know,

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:32.690
football, I'm playing football
because I want to, you know,

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:35.990
to play to beat, to get better.

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:37.290
&gt;&gt; J.R. Biersmith: Mm-hmm.

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:40.020
&gt;&gt; Saadiq: That's why I'm
playing football, but you know,

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:44.830
people laughing at me a lot, so if
I don't get the option of football,

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:52.550 position:56%
you know, life would be hard for me.

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:54.100
&gt;&gt; J.R. Biersmith: Yeah.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:24:05.050
&gt;&gt; Saadiq: That's why I want to
change, I want to change my life.

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:07.260
&gt;&gt; J.R. Biersmith: So,
if you could tell there,

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.360
I wanted to put subtitles
on there for you,

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.780
because you probably struggled

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.120
to understand what some
of what he was saying.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.890
There's a rule in journalism:
you don't record your subjects

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:19.080
without their permission.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.920
Well, every time I
would have a Skype call

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.460
with Saadiq I would
record the conversation.

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:27.160
And I recorded the conversation
because I would often struggle,

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.830
I got very good at
understanding him speak, you know,

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:31.210
when he was speaking
and getting through.

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:33.200
And he knew English, It
was one of four languages

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.340
that he had taught himself
and he taught himself English

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.140
by listening soccer
games and watching clips

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.580
on YouTube while he was in Kenya.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:43.200
And by the way, Saadiq was
supposed to be born in Mogadishu,

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.460
but his mother fled at the start of
the war and he was born in Kenya.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:52.240
And he lived in 13 different
cities until he got noticed,

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.180 position:56%
he went back to the Somalian
national soccer team when he was 16.

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.290
Had played one summer
back in Mogadishu

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:58.940
in 2012, right before I had come.

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.870
And he got a bunch of death
threats because he spoke

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.820
out on the radio about, "Hey, I'm,
you know, I would like for there

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.840
to be peace here so
that I can play soccer."

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.940
And he went back to Kenya, and they
picked up this really good team.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:15.560
So, inside of this
conversation that I had recorded,

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:21.970
I realized that maybe
this was how some

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:23.640
of the story was going to get told.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.540
That these conversations
that I'd had been having

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:29.220
with him might be my
access to subject.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:32.480
And as I start building
the film I would go back

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.890
and reference these
clips all the time.

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:37.640
And at one point, when I did
the first cut of the film,

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.580
that was the opening scene.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.250
And it was the opening scene,
and I, of course, built around

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:44.970
and put subtitles, and did all
kinds of other things to it.

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:46.450
But it was the opening scene

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:50.390
because I thought it was
Saadiq at his most vulnerable.

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:53.850
It was him being fully human
saying that "I want the opportunity

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:57.200
to change my life," which was
the thread that I had been,

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.590
the narrative thread that
I had been looking for,

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:03.270
which is that universality of every
kid, if given the opportunity,

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:05.220
would like to make
their dreams come true.

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:08.380
That's all something that
we all can relate to.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:12.670
And so, that clip for me really
epitomizes the journey that we were

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:15.690
on and where we were trying to go.

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:19.430
And so now, before I
went back to Mogadishu,

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:26.140
I made a quick little video about
going in; it's about 30 seconds.

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:29.310
Actually, this is the one
that we had when we got there.

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:32.320
Let's see if it plays.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:38.140
Come on. Oh, codec unavailable.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:39.440
So we'll show it later.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.890 position:56%
So, what happened inside that video,
it's a drive through Mogadishu,

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:47.470
and it gives you a window into,
you know, what it's like to try

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:52.450
to have a camera in your hand, and
have blacked-out tinted windows,

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:54.030
and you can only shoot
through the front.

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:56.800
And you have pre-determined
routes where you can get out

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.210
and access your subject
and turn a camera on.

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:01.180
Which if you think about that,
having access to character,

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:04.100
how do you just roll
camera and get the moments

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.420
that feel just authentically
there for you

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.030
to try to tell a story around?

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:12.800
So, when we got there,
and a big piece

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:16.720
of the film is this place
called Mogadishu stadium.

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:21.410
And funny enough, inside Mark
Bowden's Black Hawk Down,

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:25.880
the film adaptation of it, our
American troops go running back

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.890 position:56%
to what is called Mogadishu stadium.

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:32.260
And Abdulahi, maybe you played in
that stadium, I can't remember.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:36.540
Yeah, so, Mogadishu used
to have this soccer stadium

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.760
that was the crown
jewel of the region,

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.060
of Central and Eastern Africa.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:43.120
I mean, everyone wanted
to play at this place.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.870
And it turned into the war place.

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:48.270
It turned into the most
strategic spot in the city to be,

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:50.380
and if you wanted to
control Mogadishu,

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.290
you controlled the soccer stadium.

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:56.800
And it was protected,
it was elevated,

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.920
and this ends up being
the war place.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:02.280
It's like this symbol of, if soccer
could actually come back here --

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.800
well, while we were in Mogadishu,
an invitation was extended to some

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.130
of the soccer players to
come visit the stadium.

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:11.900
So, these are some images from --

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.640
Bonadir Stadium is where
the turf is, but then that,

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.470
it looks like a gun, but it's
actually an old clock tower,

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:19.720
and that's looking onto the
field that is now quite barren

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.400
and where our troops
went running back to.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.700
And these are the boys.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.880
Sa'ad, was still in Mogadishu,
that's the other young man

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.180
that I built the film around,

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:28.820
and then that's his friend
Ahmed in the truck with him.

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.020
And Ahmed, we had called the
day before, and said, "Hey,

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:32.440
Saadiq couldn't come
back to Mogadishu.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.480
Would you like to come visit
Mogadishu Stadium with us?"

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.760
It was a, you know, a
very nice invitation from,

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.080
and we feel like a
really, a big first step

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.470
in the right direction,
getting invited back.

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:46.090
Because AMISOM is the military wing

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:49.270
that controls the peacekeeping
forces.

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:51.550
And they keep trying to push
back Al-Shabaab, so there's kind

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:54.000
of this back and forth
between peacekeeping

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.990
and they make this argument
they have to keep the stadium.

00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:01.090
So what's striking and I
don't include in the film is

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:06.400
that Ahmed was terrified, because
if he's caught riding in this car

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:10.400
to the stadium, it has
major repercussions.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.730
So, I edited the entire
film to keep that out,

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:16.290
and then you just see this
scene inside of the stadium.

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:18.370
And so, I think that that's
interesting only because you have

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:21.340
to make these editorial
choices that you don't want to,

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.040
because at every turn
we had to think

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.300
about the safety of our subjects.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:29.440
So, if I can skip forward,
and hopefully this one plays,

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.910
after I was in Mogadishu and
did some filming and we caught

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:36.560
up with Sa'ad, we went to Mogadishu
stadium, I went back to Kenya,

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.310
and Saadiq had gotten
a tryout offer to come

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:41.970
to the United States
from a university.

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:47.070
And he had got a, he had applied
for his visa, and he equivocated it

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:51.410
to standing in the line at the
embassy and just waiting, you know,

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:53.840
to see if your number
would be called.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.660
He said it was like soccer
because you would get a red card

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:00.290
or you would get a green card,
you know, like a yellow card

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:02.050
or a red card, and if you
got, you know, the green one,

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:03.350
that meant you got to go.

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:07.570 position:56%
And he saw all these people standing
in line before him, you know,

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.730
trying to get in or trying to
get their case heard or whatever.

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:12.770
And you only get like a minute
or two to present your case;

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:14.380
they ask you a bunch of questions.

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.990
And he said the first
three people in front

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:18.580
of him all went and
they got red cards.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:21.180
So, he was praying that he didn't
get those two ladies or the guy

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:23.640
or whoever it was that gave them,
and he got in the other line.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.470
And he got a guy that knew
who his soccer team was.

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:27.990 position:56%
And he said, "Oh, you played soccer?

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:29.290
You get the chance
to go to America?"

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:33.140
And a minute and a half
later, he was approved.

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:35.280
And he was going to
be coming to the US.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.790
And when I went, he was supposed
to go back with us to Somalia,

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:41.690
and he didn't get to go because
his passport was hung up.

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:44.750
Well, we got back to DHL, and
it'd been shipped and this is kind

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:48.800
of a minute and a half of
him finding out that he,

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.100
he was indeed going to get to come.

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.980
Sorry, we're trying to --
I had all this pre-done

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.670
and it's actually not
working, sorry.

00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:02.800
I had preloaded all these and
they weren't converting over,

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.530
but basically what happens is that
he drops his head and realizes

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:09.860 position:56%
that his passport has been stamped
for a year, and that he gets to come

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.500
to the United States
for a full year.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.640
So, then we get to America.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.270
There he is, he's in Miami
Beach, we're recording him there,

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:20.940 position:56%
and then the young man that you see
here is actually sitting in the back

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:22.860 position:56%
of the room right now, that's Liban,

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.440
that's one of Saadiq's
closest friends here in the US.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:28.870 position:56%
And he had called me when I first
got back from Nairobi and said, "Oh,

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:31.060
you have clips of Saadiq
playing soccer?

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:33.310
He wants clips put together!"

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:37.620
Clips meaning, images because
they very rarely get seen on TV.

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:41.990
So, they put some clips together
and Liban put them all together,

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:45.530
sent them to Saadiq and that
video, that they put together,

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:47.810
was how he got to America.

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:51.100
Because coaches got to see like,
"Oh, there's this dynamic talent.

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.280
Maybe if we offer an invitation,
maybe he [inaudible] one

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.820
in a million chance get to come."

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:56.120
And that's what happened.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:59.190
And so we had came up to Washington
D.C., we interviewed Liban,

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:03.770
and he's a central part of how
this journey really happened.

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:07.460 position:56%
So Saadiq, after a week of being in
the US, kind of blows everyone away,

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:10.110
but he's not eligible
to play college soccer.

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:12.680
He missed too much school in Kenya.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:16.570
So the coaching staff made a
quick phone call over to FC Dallas

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:18.200
which is a professional MLS team,

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.410
and they had an academy
down in Dallas.

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:22.520
And he went down there, and
of course blew everyone away,

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.950
and ran with the pro
team the very first day.

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:26.590
But he had to enroll in high school

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:29.850
because he still needed college
credit, and he really wanted to go

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:32.970
to school, and keep in mind
he's on a one-year visitor visa.

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:36.590
So, this is an image of him down
at FC Dallas inside the stadium.

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:41.300 position:56%
And we took a selfie one day because
we went to the rodeo for fun.

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:44.300
I thought a rodeo might be
kind of fun for two Somali guys

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:46.590
that never really had
exposure to that before,

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:48.780
so we went to the rodeo,
threw some cowboy hats on,

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:51.010
and that's the selfie
that you see there.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:54.570
And then, you know, the entire year
that Saadiq was down in Dallas,

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:58.040
we kept flying in my family; my
sister, her husband, and my mom,

00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.340
grandparents all live in St. Louis,

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:02.350
Missouri so we'd fly him back
during, you know, Thanksgiving

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:05.870
and Christmas break and just to
get a sense of some kind of family,

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:11.190
you know, structure and, you know,
love for lack of a better word.

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:14.250
So that's a picture of Saadiq
with my brother-in-law.

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:20.920
So, when I was in Mogadishu, I knew
when we jumped inside of the --

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.640
AMISOM escorted us out
to the soccer stadium.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:27.570
And when we got there, this is the
image of Sa'ad standing next to me,

00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:29.360
Saadiq's, you know, friend.

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:32.750
And we're standing
inside Mogadishu stadium.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:37.720
I had this acute realization
that my need to get Sa'ad

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.580
out of Mogadishu was
stronger than ever.

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:43.750
I knew that there was, I really
worried about his safety.

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:46.410
And just so I can quickly
explain that,

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:47.920
we got about three more
slides, by the way,

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.700
and then we'll open
it up for questions.

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:53.610
But Sa'ad came from
this town of Afgoye,

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:58.980
he had previously been captured
by Al-Shabaab and just repeating

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:02.720
that story in the film, if we
really wanted to use that story,

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.360
and if we really wanted
to use all the footage

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:07.580
and follow his storyline, I knew
that he couldn't really stay

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:12.170 position:56%
in Mogadishu, because if he stays
in Mogadishu and the film comes out,

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:16.020
he doesn't have the
money to protect himself.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.670
A lot of people that
can stay in Mogadishu --

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:18.970
and I don't want to misrepresent.

00:34:18.970 --> 00:34:21.800
A lot of people are coming in the
Diaspora, coming back to Mogadishu,

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.990 position:56%
making their homes there, it's a
beautiful place, but it's not secure

00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:28.340
because of these targeted
attacks that happen all the time.

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:33.820
So, for the next year, we started
coming up with ideas to try

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.290
to figure out how we could
get Sa'ad out of Mogadishu.

00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:40.090 position:56%
And from a journalistic perspective
or a storytelling perspective, yeah,

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:43.300
it was crossing the line, you know,
I cared too much about my subjects,

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:47.980
but I realized that this was
our first draft, that I felt,

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:53.350 position:56%
of human history inside of Mogadishu
with a bend towards sports.

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:56.760
All the archives had
been destroyed in 2010.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:01.060
And so, I owed it to the
boys, I owed it to everybody,

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:04.790
the next generation that could
be empowered by their journey

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:07.080
and see people that looked
like them, talked like them,

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:10.900
and walked like them from their
neighborhoods, they could see them

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.780
on a big screen, or see
them on their mobile phones.

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.760
And so, we spent the next year
trying to come up with a way

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.860
to get Sa'ad out of Mogadishu.

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:24.410
And given the immigration crisis,
there's a line 20 years long to try

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:26.240
to get a meeting with
UNHCR; in fact,

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.680
they're not even taking
meetings in Kenya.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:33.540
Well, Saadiq came up with
this idea that Sa'ad needed

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:36.960
to come visit his old
doctor back in Kenya.

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.480
And I don't even know
if there is a really --

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.660
doctor exists but Sa'ad told his
team, they bought him a ticket,

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:45.240 position:56%
his passport had been stamped by
the Kenyan government to come visit,

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:48.250
because they were supposed to have
an Olympic Cup qualifying game.

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:51.160
You know, all the -- regionally
you play a qualifying match,

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:53.460
and then you try to, you
know, come out of Africa

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:55.530
and be represented in the Olympics.

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:59.280 position:56%
And they had their first-round game
in Kenya, and they didn't get to go,

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.000
they went to Djibouti instead.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.650
Well, he had 15 days
left on his passport.

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:08.910 position:56%
So we devised this idea to get him
out of Mogadishu into Kenya legally,

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:13.080 position:56%
then he got his passport renewed,
and we started the process of trying

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:14.410
to get him a meeting with UNHCR.

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:20.240
And he lived in Kenya, on a friend
of Saadiq's floor for eight months.

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:27.040
And waited very impatiently, but he
was arrested eight different times.

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:29.480
Eight different times just
because he was Somali,

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:33.530
just because he was a kid
that didn't speak the language

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:38.800 position:56%
that was trying to figure out how to
exist and be human and play soccer

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:43.150
and try to adapt to a new
city while we he waited.

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:47.330
And this gentleman who's a
parliament member named Usef

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:52.320
[phonetic] had also been attacked
by Al-Shabaab and was living

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:59.030
in Nairobi, and he became a
huge ally and Sa'ad's, you know,

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:01.710
biggest asset, I would
say to figuring out,

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:03.760
every time he would get
arrested, how to get out.

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.060
There were just chasing
-- it was just police,

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:07.250
corrupted police chasing
bribe money.

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:14.940
So, this went on for a year,
and then Sa'ad came to the US

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:17.400
in March of this past year.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:21.100
And he was reunited with
Saadiq in St. Louis, Missouri.

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:24.170
And he's doing quite well.

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:27.830
He's working at a pizza place,
he's making $11 an hour.

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:29.580
He wants to play pro soccer.

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:30.880
I don't know if it's
going to happen.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.130
We've been, you know,
struggling to figure out,

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:34.430
you know, how you get him English.

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:38.430
It's the first time in his life
since he went to a little bit

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:40.510
of Koran school as a kid in Afgoye.

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:44.120 position:56%
It's the first time he's been inside
a classroom and put a pen to paper.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:50.390 position:56%
And that in itself feels like a
pretty amazing accomplishment to me.

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:53.420
So, Sa'ad and Saadiq are
together in St. Louis, Missouri.

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:57.470
And they're now living with
my sister and her husband.

00:37:57.470 --> 00:38:03.270
And I think it's pretty
remarkable because, one,

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:05.980
the St. Louis community has
really embraced both of them.

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:09.930
A lot of people have heard about
the story, and given, you know,

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:12.420
the conversation around
immigration and what it means

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:17.890
to have a kid that's 19, 20, and
then his friend be from Somalia,

00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:21.990
I mean, hey, let's be honest: that
fits the terrorist profile right?

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:26.530
You're from Mogadishu, Somalia;
you're 19, 20, 21 years old.

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:28.560
You fit the profile.

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:31.320
You might come here
to do something bad.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.790
They're athletes.

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:35.780
All of a sudden, they get looked
at through a different prism.

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.240
Here domestically.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:40.110
They were on the front page of
the St. Louis Post Dispatch.

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:42.490
They're going out to the
St. Louis soccer park,

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:44.740
and kids can't get enough of them.

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:47.840
They show them how to do little
African dances before they do

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.140
their warm-ups.

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:51.480
And all of a sudden, you have a
little bit of infusion of culture

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:55.740
that you never dreamed of finding
its way into St. Louis, Missouri

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.780
and into kids' lives
that I never expected

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:00.650
that they would touch in that way.

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:03.380
And so, our journey to
make Men in the Arena,

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:07.150
which is a Teddy Roosevelt speech
that was given at the Sorbonne

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:10.610
in 1910 that talked about
being engaged in democracy,

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:13.520
and it's the critic -- it's not the
critic who counts, but it's the man

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:16.980
in the arena, It's the people that
are in there, giving their blood,

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:20.200
sweat, and tears, simply
participating.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:24.490
And that's what the Somali national
soccer team represented for me,

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:28.880
was a bunch of young people with
impossible stories committing

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:32.520
to their national soccer team
and bringing all kinds of pride

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:36.110
to a country that just
eats up soccer.

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:40.540
Coming out to games any way
they can to see them play.

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:44.050
And then Sa'ad and Saadiq kind
of taking this huge sacrifice

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:47.250
to share their story, and
now they're in America.

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:50.170
And it'll be a good six or seven
years before they could ever dream

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:51.470
of going back home.

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:54.160
But only because of technology
were we able to make this film,

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:57.990
and only because of technology
are they able to communicate

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:01.180
with their families and not feel
as lonely as they would've if,

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:05.020 position:56%
maybe when you came over and you
probably have to get that phone card

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:08.120
and make that super difficult
phone call once every two weeks.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.470
So now they can Whatsapp
and talk to their families

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:12.670
on a pretty consistent basis.

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:14.370
That doesn't mean it's not hard.

00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:19.440
They have lots of days where the
trauma brings itself back up,

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.080
where they miss home.

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:26.040
But I think their journey
is really beautiful,

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:31.700
and I think that's why I talk about
this being a first rough draft

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:35.860
of Somali history, because I think
they're emblematic of what it means

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:38.030
to be a young person
chasing your dreams inside

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:40.280
of a super complicated world.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:47.830

the trailer if it actually plays.

you'd probably have more questions
about individual storylines,

or Saadiq's image is what
pops into your head first

versus all the other images that
we see, because there's no doubt

to figure out how to chase

months before Black Hawk Down.

off of the famine in 1992,

during that time.

know, to get anything

even produce breastmilk.

born and surviving is, to me,

00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:41.630

that complexity.

00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:58.960
and on their own two feet
is pretty remarkable to me.

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.890
Of course, I've worried
about both of their safety,

00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:04.750
both of the mothers, like anybody
that appears in the film I worry

00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:06.620
about on some small level.

00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:08.860
But I think, Sa'ad and
Saadiq were the, you know,

00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:10.630
they're the central
figures of the film.

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:14.710
And they've both said that, and
this one is what breaks my heart,

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:18.530
is that, you know, "Both of our
moms, like their journey was

00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:22.940
to raise us, and I
hope that they're okay,

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:26.930
but they did what they
were supposed to do.

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:28.230
Like, they raised us."

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:30.480
Like, that's what they're
most proud of.

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.340
And I don't know how to take that.

00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:34.530
I don't know what that means.

00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:38.570
Other than, we hope
that they're okay.

00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:41.150
And certainly, I do too.

00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:43.770
So, yes?

00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:46.400
&gt;&gt; Well, I just wanted to
say thank you very much.

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:47.700
&gt;&gt; J.R. Biersmith: Thank you.

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:54.590
&gt;&gt; And about two years ago, in
2014, you showed Scoring for Peace,

00:48:54.590 --> 00:49:00.180
which was a film about
the people in East Africa,

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:01.730
Burundi, [inaudible] and Uganda.

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:05.280
And so the filmmaker donated
the film to the library,

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:09.960
and we hope that we'll
get Men in the Arena, too.

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:14.880
But I also have a question,
and that is,

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.180
as a journalist myself,
I know that doesn't pay.

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:17.480
How did you fund this?

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:18.780
All the travel --

00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:20.100
&gt;&gt; J.R. Biersmith: Oh,
that's a good question.

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:23.430
I left all of that out.

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:27.490
That whole part, all that struggle.

00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:33.870
I did, I worked on a project
when I first moved to LA,

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:39.580
and then I got to, I did a lot
of, when that project was over

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:43.580
and I went to Tahiti, I spent
that next six months kind of just

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:47.290
on surviving on the
money that I had saved.

00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:50.450 position:56%
And then I did a bunch of freelance,

00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:52.240
like some random freelance
projects just

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:55.000
to get some supplemental
income, and --

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.760
but this has really been
my life for three years.

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:02.570
And it's been my life because
it's so incredibly complicated.

00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:04.790
I mean, in the middle of
night, you're calling Ethiopia,

00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:08.240
asking for footage of one game.

00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:10.960
Like I wasn't even sure if I
was going to use it in the film,

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:13.160
and I had to track down a
journalist, figure out how

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:16.030
to get a hold of the guy that might
have the footage that, you know,

00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:19.930
holds it, you know, for the
dictatorship that's in charge

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:25.230
of media that like chooses to
license things, so the journey

00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:30.350 position:56%
of trying to make this was just that
every single turn felt impossible.

00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:33.740
And that's why I extended way
longer than I ever expected.

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:37.470
So after I went to Somalia,
we did a Kickstarter campaign,

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:40.860
and we got $39,000 on
the Kickstarter campaign.

00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:42.160
That was tough.

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:45.130
Like I thought I'd just send some
social media emails around, like,

00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:47.350
"Hey, if you like what
we're doing, give us $10."

00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:49.330
You know? Nobody was giving $10.

00:50:49.330 --> 00:50:51.410
Like, they were sharing
it like crazy, like,

00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:52.710
"Oh, this is super moving!"

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:54.030
But nobody was giving money.

00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:55.940
Like I thought it would
just roll, but it didn't.

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:57.470
Like it didn't just roll.

00:50:57.470 --> 00:51:00.200
I made a lot of phone calls,
and thankfully to my sister,

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:03.100
my brother-in-law, they started
calling friends and saying,

00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:04.400
"Are you in for this amount?"

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:05.700
"Are you in for this amount?"

00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:08.020
and all of a sudden,
you know, weeks went by,

00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:09.340
and we got that money
that we needed.

00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:12.400
And that helped a little bit,
but just going to Somalia

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.340
for the five days that I was there,

00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:17.480
not to mention the countless other
filming trips that we did there,

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:20.370
was like $10,000 just
for that five days.

00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:22.770
Because it's extremely expensive
to go out into the field

00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:25.490
because you have to have all these
security teams and everything else.

00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:30.750
So that's how, and I borrowed a
lot of money; I owe a lot of money.

00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:33.840
That's the short answer
to the question.

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:37.540
I just never, I just never dreamed
that it'd take as long as it did.

00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:39.800
And I think some people would say,
"Well, why did it take so long?"

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:42.840
Well, it took so long because
we spent a year trying to figure

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:45.140
out like, literally every single
night trying to figure out,

00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:48.980
what do I do now to get
this kid out of Mogadishu?

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:51.590
And that's not a, like
a heroic thing.

00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:53.420
That's like being human.

00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:56.080
Seriously, like when you meet these
kids, and you talk to these kids,

00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.910
and you hear, like, the
sacrifice that they're making,

00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:00.870
you don't have another choice.

00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:04.160
Like, it feels like your kid.

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:06.820
You know? Like I got to
make sure that he's safe.

00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:09.730
And so you just don't stop
until you get that done.

00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:14.850
And so, that's the long answer
to, how do you figure out how

00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:17.270
to survive making a film like this?

00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:20.190 position:56%
But now we hope to distribute it,
and, you know, it should be released

00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:24.010
in April, and you know, hopefully
it gets picked up by some networks

00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:26.900
and it'll be on Amazon,
iTunes, etc. But you know,

00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:29.920
and as far as donating it to the
library, I said it's a first draft

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:33.610
of history, that's how I look at
it, and this place is the epitome

00:52:33.610 --> 00:52:38.440 position:56%
of taking care of rough drafts and
original drafts and original prints.

00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:40.990
So hopefully it finds its way here.

00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:43.100
&gt;&gt; And then it's a copyright issue.

00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:44.400
In other words, when you --

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.220
&gt;&gt; J.R. Biersmith: Right,
do we license the coverage?

00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:48.840
We sent that in a few weeks
ago, so if somebody would

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:53.480
like to approve that,
that would be great.

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:55.210
[Inaudible] Yeah, it's
like $20, right?

00:52:55.210 --> 00:52:56.510
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:57.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; J.R. Biersmith: Yeah, we applied.

00:52:57.810 --> 00:52:59.110
We're just waiting on the response.

00:52:59.110 --> 00:53:00.410
&gt;&gt; For the copyright?

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:01.710
&gt;&gt; For the copyright.

00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:03.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:04.830
&gt;&gt; J.R. Biersmith:
I've already applied.

00:53:04.830 --> 00:53:07.060
[Inaudible] Yeah, so
we went down that road.

00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:08.360
Yeah. Yeah.

00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:11.360
[Inaudible] I would like to.

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:14.580
It's funny because this one
just, there's a part of me that,

00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:18.060
because I'm so buried and
mired in the weeds on this one,

00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:22.440
that the journey that you don't
see on film is interesting for me

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:25.970
from a chronicling perspective is
I'd really like to write a book,

00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:28.840
and that's going to require
picking up some of Sa'ad

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:30.220
and Saadiq's story and even Liban.

00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:32.740 position:56%
I mean, if I can just say -- Liban's
sitting at the back of the room,

00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:35.010
so I hope you stick around for a
second, and I know you're not going

00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:37.620
to want to do this, I'm
speaking directly to him.

00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:43.250 position:56%
But you know, Liban was, I'm not
going to give your whole life story,

00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:48.310
but what he does for his
family is unbelievable.

00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:52.810
And he would call me nearly
every other day on his break,

00:53:52.810 --> 00:53:56.130
if not every day, because I
would say, "Hey, I need to talk

00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:58.600
to this person; I need
help with translation."

00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:01.110
And he would take his
15-minute breaks at Home Depot,

00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:05.110
or his lunch hour, and we would
call people in Somalia, Ethiopia,

00:54:05.110 --> 00:54:09.460
wherever, and he was like,
my guy, he did everything

00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:12.950
for me for a year and a half.

00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:14.460
And I think that's
really remarkable.

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:17.130
Like that's like, talk
about selflessness.

00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:19.190
I mean, all he did was call
me one day and say, "J.R.,

00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:20.550
can I get Saadiq's clips?"

00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:24.270
And then, three years later, he's
been, you know, he's almost been

00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:26.390
like a father figure to Sa'ad
and Saadiq too along the way.

00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:28.810
I mean, not only just
a friend, but you know,

00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:31.950
a real source of, how
do I handle this?

00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:35.950
And I think, his journey, and
now he's driving Uber cars

00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:39.200
and doing whatever he can, but he
really wants to do cyber security

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:43.180
and he's just waiting for
his passport to come in.

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:46.200
And I just think that, like,
I didn't do this alone.

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:49.710
You know? I didn't write this, I
didn't do this, and my co-producer,

00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:55.780
myself, Liban, like, we did this
because terrorism can find its way

00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:57.760
in your backyard at
any point in time.

00:54:57.760 --> 00:54:59.960
And unless you start
to try to understand

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:02.030
or go at it a different way --

00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:03.640
like everyone's trying
to approach Somalia

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:06.310
and these failed states
in a war way.

00:55:06.310 --> 00:55:07.980
What if we approach it
with a storytelling way?

00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:09.840
I'm not naive enough to think
it's going to change everything,

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:12.470
but what if people have
heroes to look up to

00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:16.710
and that's why I think that,
I'd like to write a book.

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:19.380
But making another
film, it's kind of,

00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:21.200 position:56%
maybe I should do something lighter?

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:25.150
Like maybe something a
little, I'm fascinated by Cuba;

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:27.720
it's just which story
do I want to tell?

00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:32.420
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Well, first
of all, thank you very much.

00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:35.390
It was a very moving and
very inspiring story.

00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:36.690
&gt;&gt; J.R. Biersmith: Thank you.

00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:38.620
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: I
wanted to ask you something.

00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:44.900
You know, sometimes tragedy is
overwhelming, and you had to focus

00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:49.390
on something that you as
an individual can help.

00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:54.620
What is it, what was it about those
two young men, what was the quality

00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:59.780
that you saw in those two
young men that made you say,

00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:03.280
"I'm going to help them"?

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:04.580
They'll be able [inaudible]

00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:07.840
accomplish their dreams
with some help [inaudible]?

00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:09.140
&gt;&gt; J.R. Biersmith: Yeah.

00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:11.190
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Why those
two, and not, you know --

00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:12.490
&gt;&gt; J.R. Biersmith: The other kids.

00:56:12.490 --> 00:56:13.790
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb; Other kids?

00:56:13.790 --> 00:56:16.950
What is it that you saw [inaudible]
that you were able to identify,

00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:19.530
because they actually lived
up to what you were expecting?

00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:21.130
&gt;&gt; J.R. Biersmith: Yeah,
I mean, I think that's why

00:56:21.130 --> 00:56:23.260
that clip is interesting
that I showed you.

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:26.130
Well, it's interesting for me
because I feel like I'm a bit

00:56:26.130 --> 00:56:30.750
of a motivator on a personal level,
and I've been that for Saadiq.

00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:33.950
You know, so in moments where
he gets really sad, you know,

00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:37.220
and feels like the world's against
him and he can't, doesn't know what

00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:41.370
to do -- not to mention, like, his
best friend tried to leave Nairobi

00:56:41.370 --> 00:56:45.720
on a boat and died at sea
right before he came to the US.

00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:50.970
So, the tragedy that he
continuously has to face --

00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:54.290
the first day that I met him, he
called himself the grandfather,

00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:58.870
a grandfather because at 17,
he had already seen enough

00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:02.250
that he gave himself
that, you know, "J.R.,

00:57:02.250 --> 00:57:03.680
my grandfather hadn't
seen that much stuff."

00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:06.910
So, There's something about him.

00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:09.110
There's something about,
like, his energy when he,

00:57:09.110 --> 00:57:10.480
I mean, Liban can speak to it.

00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:16.030
There's something about it's
tucked away; he's really shy.

00:57:16.030 --> 00:57:19.010 position:56%
He doesn't really like, I mean, he's
going to come out here tomorrow,

00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:21.900
and he was hesitant about it.

00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:25.700
He gets, you know, he's just
like, "I've told my story now.

00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:27.000
Do I have to talk more?"

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:33.360
You know? But every time I,
he'll participate in a Q and A,

00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:36.170
he'll say something
that just blows me away.

00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:39.350
I'll give you an example, and I'll
try to make this really quick.

00:57:39.350 --> 00:57:42.730
We were at a screening and
somebody raised their hand,

00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:46.620
and they were from Britain or
something, somewhere in Europe.

00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:50.690
And they said, "Hey, how about
that team that just won in Europe?

00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:51.990
They weren't expected.

00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:53.870
And they had that great guy, and
they weren't, they were supposed

00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:55.420
to be like at the bottom
of the premier league,

00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:56.860
and they won the whole thing!

00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:58.160
What'd you think of that?"

00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:00.540
And I'm like, and I was thinking,
"How's he going to answer this?"

00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:02.080
You know, because he
loved that team,

00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:03.470
he was so surprised that they won.

00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:06.230
And he said, "You know,
that's a great question,

00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:09.530
because that team reminds
me of Somalia.

00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:12.660
Like, they were from the
bottom, and they were just there.

00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:14.730
And then they were trying to, it's
like what we were trying to do

00:58:14.730 --> 00:58:16.030
when we went to the tournament.

00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:17.950
Like we just wanted to show up
and give everything we had."

00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:20.560
And I'm like, "How
did you just do that?

00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:22.190
Like, that was a PR spin.

00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:24.730
Like you just brought the
question back to you."

00:58:24.730 --> 00:58:27.730
And so that's what he does,
like he has that subtlety,

00:58:27.730 --> 00:58:29.980
but that doesn't mean that
he's still not a 19-year-old

00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:32.220
that doesn't struggle
to make his way,

00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:34.400
he's a college kid making
his way through the world.

00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:37.360
But I think that's what it was, and
it was really that first night too,

00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:38.690
of when I saw the bead of sweat.

00:58:38.690 --> 00:58:42.900
And that's what I'm chasing,
like I'm chasing moments

00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:44.700
that aren't just moments.

00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:46.970
Like moments that reveal
real character

00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:49.950
that show you exactly
who that person is.

00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:51.930
And through that first two
weeks that we were with both

00:58:51.930 --> 00:58:54.990
of those boys, we got these
moments that, if somebody shows you

00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:57.370
who they are, believe
them, and I believed them.

00:58:57.370 --> 00:59:01.060
And it was a leap of faith,
because along the way,

00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:03.730
there's just societal
things that are different.

00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:07.290
And I think that, there's
been like a teaching process,

00:59:07.290 --> 00:59:10.400
and that's why I'm so proud of
the St. Louis community even,

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.820
of trying to wrap their
heads around the story,

00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:15.120
because now it's a
village type thing.

00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:17.370
You know, people are coming and
offering them rides, you know,

00:59:17.370 --> 00:59:19.650
different people, my co-producer
and his girlfriend were just

00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:21.660
in St. Louis two weeks
ago, and they're like, "Oh,

00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:24.370
Sa'ad has a stick-shift car
that he doesn't know how

00:59:24.370 --> 00:59:25.770
to drive; it's a used car."

00:59:25.770 --> 00:59:27.490
And so, they took him out driving.

00:59:27.490 --> 00:59:29.910
You know, so, there's all these
people that are stepping in now

00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:33.570
to help get them acclimated

00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:36.840
because what they represent
is bigger than themselves.

00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:39.970
And so that's, I hope that's
what your question was,

00:59:39.970 --> 00:59:41.270
but that's kind of what I saw.

00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:44.560
And I did, it was a leap of faith.

00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:48.470
But you can spend two weeks with
somebody, and you wake them up out

00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:52.820
of their beds every morning,
you get it, you get it.

00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:55.550
Any other questions?

00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:58.510
&gt;&gt; Abdulahi Ahmed: Well,
thank you, J.R., for coming.

00:59:58.510 --> 01:00:02.300
[ Applause ]

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:03.600
&gt;&gt; J.R. Biersmith: Thanks again.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.610
I appreciate it.

01:00:05.610 --> 01:00:09.250
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
