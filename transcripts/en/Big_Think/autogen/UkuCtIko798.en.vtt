as far as gross evolutionary pressure is
concerned there is none anymore on the

when we lived in the forests there were

when we lived in the forests there were
 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.360
when we lived in the forests there were
enormous selection pressures placed on

well first of all there are no more

Australia's Australia is a continent
 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.349
Australia's Australia is a continent
that broke off from the other continents

that broke off from the other continents

and it evolved very rapidly because it

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929
and it evolved very rapidly because it
 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:03.779
and it evolved very rapidly because it
diverged from the rest of the

Australia's anymore in this sense we

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560
Australia's anymore in this sense we
 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.100
Australia's anymore in this sense we
have jet airplanes you can jet airplane

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110
have jet airplanes you can jet airplane
 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.929

you can go it pretty much anywhere on

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939
you can go it pretty much anywhere on
 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.969

throughout the planet Earth we no longer

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409
throughout the planet Earth we no longer
 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.340
throughout the planet Earth we no longer
have any isolated pockets like Australia

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350
have any isolated pockets like Australia
 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.980

which would accelerate human evolution

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990
which would accelerate human evolution
 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.800
which would accelerate human evolution
now evolution is still taking place it

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810
now evolution is still taking place it
 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.230
now evolution is still taking place it
takes place every time two people mate

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240
takes place every time two people mate
 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.929
takes place every time two people mate
it takes place inside our bodies in our

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939
it takes place inside our bodies in our
 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.990
it takes place inside our bodies in our
immune systems in our body chemistry

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000
immune systems in our body chemistry
 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.609

evolution is still taking place but

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619
evolution is still taking place but
 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.670
evolution is still taking place but
gross evolution that is evolution that

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680
gross evolution that is evolution that
 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.980
gross evolution that is evolution that
will give us big brains big eyes bald

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990
will give us big brains big eyes bald
 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.289
will give us big brains big eyes bald
heads and little bodies that kind of

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299
heads and little bodies that kind of
 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.260
heads and little bodies that kind of
gross evolution is pretty much gone now

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270
gross evolution is pretty much gone now
 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.080
gross evolution is pretty much gone now
that doesn't mean that we can't have

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090
that doesn't mean that we can't have
 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.300
that doesn't mean that we can't have
genetic engineering that's many decades

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310
genetic engineering that's many decades
 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.760
genetic engineering that's many decades
away at the present time

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770
away at the present time
 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.489
away at the present time
we can only manipulate perhaps one gene

00:01:59.489 --> 00:01:59.499
we can only manipulate perhaps one gene
 

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:02.130
we can only manipulate perhaps one gene
at a time it is a very painful process

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140
at a time it is a very painful process
 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.889
at a time it is a very painful process
we cannot for example create a pig with

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899
we cannot for example create a pig with
 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.709
we cannot for example create a pig with
wings that would require thousands of

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719
wings that would require thousands of
 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:10.380
wings that would require thousands of
genes being manipulated and we simply

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390
genes being manipulated and we simply
 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.509
genes being manipulated and we simply
don't have that technology we only

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519
don't have that technology we only
 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.630
don't have that technology we only
manipulate one gene at a time so we are

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640
manipulate one gene at a time so we are
 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.350
manipulate one gene at a time so we are
I think

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360
I think
 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.900
I think
many many many decades away from being

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910
many many many decades away from being
 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.000
many many many decades away from being
able to actually influence human

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010
able to actually influence human
 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.000
able to actually influence human
evolution so in other words chances are

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010
evolution so in other words chances are
 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.030
evolution so in other words chances are
decades from now will look pretty much

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040
decades from now will look pretty much
 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.820
decades from now will look pretty much
the same
