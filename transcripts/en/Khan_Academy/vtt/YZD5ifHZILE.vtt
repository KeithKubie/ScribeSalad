00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.590
Let's see if we can
add 3/10 to 7/100.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.080
And I encourage you to
try adding these two

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.050
fractions on your own first
before I work through it,

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.660
and I'll give you one hint.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.490
Right now, it's very hard
to add these fractions.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.120
You're adding 3/10 to 7/100.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.130
You're adding two
different fractions

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.130
with two different denominators.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.760
So what I would
encourage you to do

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.465
is try to rewrite
3/10 in a way that it

00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:30.020
has 100 as a
denominator, or so it's

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.940
expressed in terms
of hundredths,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.280
and then see if
you can add them.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.530
Well, I'm assuming
you've given a go at it.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.780
Let's see how we
can rewrite 3/10,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.730
and I'll try to visualize it.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.570
So what I've done here, so this
you could consider a whole,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.310
and this is a whole as well.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.891
And this whole is divided into
tenths-- 1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:53.840
9, 10.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.970
So what would 3/10 look like?

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:03.600
Well, it would be one, two,
and three of the tenths.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.170
Now, what would happen if
you took each of those tenths

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.230
and you divided them
into 10 more sections?

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.630
So you're essentially
taking each of those tenths

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.610
and you're dividing
them into 10 sections.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.090
Well, you have 10 sections
and then each of them

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.400
will have 10 subsections in it.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.030
So you're going to
have hundredths.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.720
Then the sections are going
to describe hundredths.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.880
So 10-- let me
write it this way.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.210
10 times 10.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.134
You are then going
to have hundredths.

00:01:44.134 --> 00:01:48.690
And 3/10 would be equivalent to
how many of these hundredths?

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.280
Well, each of these
tenths will now become 10.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:00.791
So you're going to
have 10, 20, and-- let

00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:01.790
me color them in better.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.710
So that's 10, 20, and
then 30 hundredths.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.250
So this part right over here.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.450
This-- let me get my tool
right-- this part right

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:21.550
over here, this is going
to be 3 times 10, which

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.960
is going to be equal to 30.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.122
10 times 10 is equal to 100.

00:02:27.122 --> 00:02:29.330
So this is how we're going
to change the denominator.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.820
Instead of thinking
in terms of tenths,

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.653
we're going to think
in terms of hundredths.

00:02:32.653 --> 00:02:38.120
And now our numerator, 3/10,
is equivalent to 30 hundredths

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.470
so we can rewrite this fraction.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.640
We essentially multiplied
the numerator by 10,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.470
and we multiplied
the denominator

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.300
by 10, which didn't change
the value of the fraction.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.160
It still represents
the same-- it still

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.350
represents 3/10 of the whole.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.270
So when you do
that, you end up--

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.136
we can rewrite this
thing as 30 over 100.

00:03:05.136 --> 00:03:08.640
Three tenths is
equivalent to 30 over 100.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.389
We add that to 7 over 100.

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.430
Or another way of thinking
about it, three tenths

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.360
is the same thing
as 30 hundredths.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.820
And we add that to 7 hundredths.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.300
Well, now we're going to
have 30 plus 7 hundredths.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:30.564
So now, we're going to
have 30 plus 7 hundredths.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.680
Or we could say that this is
now going to be 37 hundredths.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.960
So this extra 7 that we're
adding here-- maybe I'll

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.780
do this in-- that's
the same color.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.500
This extra sevenths-- let
me do this in a new color.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.190
This 7 hundredths that we're
adding, that's going to be one,

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.410
two-- let me paint that
in a little bit clearer.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.530
So that's 1, 2, so it
gets us all the way to 7.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:09.980
Let's see, 1, 2, 3, so 7
hundredths is right over there.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.920
So let me get back to my pen.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.740
So that, whoops, this right
over here is 7 out of the 100

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:23.060
so 30/100 plus 7/100 is
going to get us to 37/100.
