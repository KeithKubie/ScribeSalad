What's up guys welcome back to the king of random I'm Nate, thanks for joining us today

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.459
Recently we had a video where we showed you how to make your very own foam balloon generator. Well today

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.729
We've got some experiments that are going to take that to the next level first

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.369
I want to point out that I've changed my formula a little bit before I was using bubble soap with a ratio of about one

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.519
Part bubble soap to seven parts water and while that still works great

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.850
I think I've had slightly better results by using a foaming hand soap

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.639
I use one part foaming hand soap to two parts water

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.730
So it's not quite as

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.570
Concentrated of a base to start with but I think it makes a slightly better phone since that's what this type of soap was designed

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.389
For the experiment that so many of you wanted us to try was using food coloring to see if we could make our foam come

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.430
Up as colored bubbles instead of white blue is usually the most concentrated food coloring color

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.229
So I'm going to add plenty of that to our liquid and then blow some bubbles in and see what happens to our foam

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.239
Because I want to give these bubbles the best chance of picking up the blue color, I'm using a lot of dye

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.288
Probably only would have taken about one drop to turn all of this water blue

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.689
Nice dark blue

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:09.570
diluted soap all right now

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.500
I'm just gonna use my mouth and blow some air in to see if we get any sort of color in these bubbles

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.889
There you go, you can see that there really isn't almost any blue tint

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.320
There's maybe it looks like a little bit down at the bottom

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.860
But I think you're just seeing through the bubbles to the blue liquid below the actual foam as it comes off really

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:42.549
Has no color whatsoever. It's still the same shade of white that it was before so let's talk about what's happening

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.469
And why we aren't getting any color in the bubbles themselves when the bubbles are forming

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.209
They're an extremely thin film surrounding. Whatever gas. It was that filled them up

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.470
It's so thin that it really isn't able to hold any color of its own

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.029
So the soap that's forming these bubbles actually contains the blue dye in it

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.780
But it's spread out so much that it can't really add any color to it the reason these look white is they're actually clear

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.589
Reflecting the light around and since all the light we have shining in the studio and outside is white light the bubbles appear

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.140
white

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.390
The only way to really change the color would be to either use a colored smoke to fill them

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.119
Or if you've shown a different color like on to the bubbles so unfortunately because bubbles are so thin

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.500
It looks like using food coloring to dye. The bubbles doesn't work out too. Well however. I do have a few other things

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.690
I don't want to try the first of which is using hydrogen to fill these bubbles instead of helium. Let's take this outside

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.289
So here we have our giant tank of hydrogen our pressure regulator

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.829
Which is apparently absolutely essential to getting hydrogen safely out of a tank so we have that it's got two different valves to control

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.590
Actually, it's got three valves one here

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.200
And then two on the regulator just to control very carefully the speed and pressure at which our hydrogen is leaving the tank

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.090
I've got our bubble soap already

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.579
I'm still using the blue stuff because why waste bubble soap, but as we've learned unfortunately that will not give us blue bubbles

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.869
Let's see if the hydrogen has any more lift to it than the helium did

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.870
open this valve and

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.600
Then as I slowly turn this one it will let a little bit of hydrogen through at a time and that

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.150
Will immediately start bubbling up down in our pan?

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:26.699
A little bit windy out here today, so our bubbles are already straining to get free get it free see what happens

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.300
Boom flying up into the air

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.500
Obliterate chop into thousand pieces by the tree branches

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.190
Whoo balloon attacked our cameraman I

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.440
Think we've shown that hydrogen works pretty well probably lifts even better than helium now

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.839
I want to try cutting a stencil shape out of foam core to see if we can control the shape of the foam balloons coming

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.840
out of our generator

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.760
Well I think to start out we'll just try a triangle

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.089
It's not the most perfect triangle I've ever seen but I think it'll work

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.559
Now I do want this to sit flush

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.040
So I'm gonna add a little bit of a notch

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.760
Where the hose comes out just so I'm not squishing that I'll seal it all up with tape so it's on there pretty well

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.169
It looks like it should work all right

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.929
All right looks like our board is pretty well attached

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.389
So let's see if we can get some triangle-shaped bubbles come out of our foam generator

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:08.879
Hmm

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:16.339
Well it's not working wonderfully our stencil isn't really doing much to control the shape of the bubbles so I have an idea that I

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.500
want to try to see if we can get the bubbles to travel in a more uniform direction part of the problem is that they're

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.410
Coming from all sides, and they're really getting squished through sort of a bottleneck

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.660
There's also the fact that our bubbles are a little larger than I'd like them to be which makes it so it's hard to get

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.029
Any sort of resolution or definition in our stencil as the bubbles are coming out through it?

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.549
So I've put our whole bubble generator down at the bottom of a bucket

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.090
And I want to see if that makes a difference in how it rises up out

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.179
I think we might be able to have a more smooth uniform

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:55.649
Transition with the bubbles rising out this way well test it alright

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.530
Let's see how this works out

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:00.550
So far so good

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.469
Making bubbles they float large part of what we're going for right there

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.989
Yeah, we're getting nice thin layers of bubbles now, that's a step in a good direction

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.870
Now these bubbles are still a little larger as in each individual

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.689
Bubble is a larger size than I would ideally like

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.149
But there's also the fact that as the bubbles fill up the whole bucket the excess bubble fluid

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:30.389
That's around them has more of a chance to drain off so we have what's actually a little bit dryer of bubbles

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:32.938
And I'm hoping that that will also work better with our stencils

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:40.379
Let's give this another shot letting it grow a little too high at first just to let it even out

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.349
Hey look that looks like a triangle

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:57.249
It's not a great triangle, but its triangle

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:07.449
Ha shapes, I'm just let this one go for a little bit. We're getting a nice prism shape

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:14.229
All right that worked out pretty well now

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:17.979
I'm gonna try a slightly more complicated shape and see if we can get that to work

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:22.269
We've got a king for a king of random. We're gonna see if we can make some bubble

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:24.650
hydrogen foam caves

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.650
float through the air

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.050
Here we go here we go

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.989
That we're facing the camera better, you'd be able to see how a case shaped it was here's another one

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:53.599
That worked okay, it wasn't perfect, but it was a whole lot better than nothing we got some good shapes out of it

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.950
Let's move on in the next experiment, which is to see how big we can make this work?

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:01.339
I've taken this three-foot plastic bright pink kitty pool

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:07.760
Run clear hose and Aspire all the way through it poke holes in the hose all the way around we're gonna pour a whole bunch

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:13.460
Of our fluid into here run hydrogen down through the hose and see if we can make some giant foam balloons for

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:17.390
Bubble fluid we already have in

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.749
We're gonna need a whole lot more than that

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:26.210
All right, I think at this point all of our hose is completely submerged

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:33.080
That's what we want for some good. Even bubbles. Let's add some gas and see how this works. Well. You can definitely see it

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.020
forming a

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.830
Lot of bubbles

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:46.129
It's all sort of pushing to one side of the tub as the wind blows on it, Oh

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.800
Big one there it goes

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.959
And there goes an even bigger one from the wind oh

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:05.030
Boy that's just spinning around it got caught in some little sideways tornado or something

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:09.170
That's funny. It looks like a car wash exploded

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:15.859
There are no wind I think this would work. I think we'd have like a column of this that I could like jump roars

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.860
I've been

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.879
Yep there you go that is working pretty well, I think it would work better

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.600
If it weren't quite so windy out here

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:35.140
but I do think we're getting bubbles about as large as we could possibly get there gets to a point where there's just like the

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:40.659
Maximum amount of lift that bubbles can hold on to they don't have a whole lot of cohesion to themselves however

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:46.360
There is of course one more thing I do want to try we are using hydrogen gas to fill these balloons

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:52.719
And hydrogen is flammable, so I've got myself a little makeshift torch here that I've been using just as a stick

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:56.170
But now I'm gonna add some fuel light this up and when a bubble goes off

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.050
I'm gonna try and poke it and ignite it here goes

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:15.869
Haha break free break free you can do it

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:27.559
This is the greatest game ever oh don't worry

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.410
Should be a big one

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.539
Still good whoo five seconds awesome

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:49.730
Haha

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:54.339
Yeah, just wait. It's just hovered right above it, and I don't want to like the pool on fire

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.759
So I had to wait for it to move somewhere. Oh a big one here we go

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.280
Got it

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.980
Like fending off an attack cover yet really got back bubbles back

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.070
Hot bubble soap wave them

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:34.489
This is the greatest game ever played it was like Harry Potter King around stuff, Alakazam incendio

00:11:48.459 --> 00:11:50.459
Laughs I didn't even float

00:12:00.329 --> 00:12:03.209
Oh, it's coming right at my face

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.600
Oh

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:21.459
That was safe that wasn't nearly as dramatic as I thought it me neither probably for the best yeah

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.250
Huh that does look really cool actually

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.040
I'm sure this is not at all safe

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:35.940
It just kind of circles and snakes around chasing itself

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:44.549
There you have it lining a three foot kiddie pool with our tube with holes poked in it filling that with bubble soap and

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:50.970
Setting that off with hydrogen makes some great foam balloons and best of all it's flammable so you can have a really fun time pretending

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:54.360
You're a wizard like poking at balloons, and they just explode. It's great fun

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:58.589
This is seriously very entertaining even if you aren't lighting them off if you just do it with helium

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:02.789
It's way fun making these balloons and just chasing them and hitting it and swatting them stuff like that

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:08.459
It's easy to do at home the little version. It's cheap. It's quick. You can definitely make your own foam balloons

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.630
I highly recommend it

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:13.949
Thank you guys for your suggestions of things you wanted to see us try if you've got any other ideas

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:15.420
Please let us know down in the comments

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.719
Thanks for joining us for this project today, and we look forward to the next one talk to you then

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:27.269
Huh, oh no oh it's too high now, I can't get that I want lightning to strike it haven't just blow up

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:29.550
You know that Santa Claus trick?

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.790
Haha that was a good one

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.740
You
