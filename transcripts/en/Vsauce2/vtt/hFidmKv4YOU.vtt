00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:01.599
Vsauce!

00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:02.599
Kevin here.

00:00:02.599 --> 00:00:07.759
Spit out your gum, put down that toad and
follow a rainbow to the wishing well.

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.620
Swallowed chewing gum doesn’t stay in your
stomach for seven years.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.460
Since your teeth don’t break down gum like
food, fears arose that stomachs had similar

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.010
trouble processing it.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.790
But it really just passes through your system
like the outside fiber shell of corn.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.360
Swallowing several pieces of gum a day, however,
could develop a bezoar - a hard mass that

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.949
clogs the digestive tract.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.460
In severe cases, surgery is needed to remove
the blockage, and the disimpaction procedure

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.199
is described in a medical journal as like
a taffy-pull.

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.530
Touching a toad will not give you warts.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.100
Toads are covered in wart-like bumps that
help them blend into their environments, but

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.589
warts on humans are a virus.

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:59.049
The problem was that no one before 1892 knew
what a virus was, so the transmission of warts

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:02.850
through toad-handling was a common explanation.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.750
Methods for getting rid of warts often involved
rubbing something on them like a bean pod,

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.970
piece of beef or your mother’s dish rag
and then burying it - and as the item rotted

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.780
away - so apparently went the wart.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:23.020
In reality, warts can suddenly disappear on
their own due to the nature of the human papillomavirus,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.670
so many bizarre wart remedies like dripping
eel blood or blowing on it nine times under

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.810
the full moon were believed to really work.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.560
Tossing coins in water fountains and ponds
for good luck comes from the tradition of

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.969
wishing wells.

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:44.570
Ancient Germanic and Celtic people thought
that by offering gifts like pins or coins

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.179
to the water deities that lived in wells,
they would be granted their wish -- which

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.909
often was about finding a sweetheart.

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.509
And while the wishes may not have always been
granted, pure silver and pure copper coins

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.240
tossed into wells may have been making the
water safer to drink.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.030
Silver kills bacteria in water - it’s been
used as a water disinfecting agent on the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.569
International Space Station.

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:13.940
And a 2012 study shows storing drinking water
in copper pots can also kill certain harmful

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:14.940
bacteria.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.520
Therefore, Helga’s wish for a boyfriend
may have prevented her village from getting

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.100
diarrhea.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.440
But silver and copper coins are no gold.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.690
According to Irish folklore, just visit the
end of a rainbow to find a pot of gold guarded

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.400
by a Leprechaun.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.160
Unfortunately, you can never reach the end
of a rainbow because seeing a rainbow requires

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.540
you to be a distance away from it so that
sunlight can refract off water droplets and

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.770
hit your eyes.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.870
After Vikings invaded Ireland around the 10th
century they left behind hordes of treasure

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.680
which are supposedly guarded by Leprechauns
to prevent greedy humans from fighting over

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.680
it.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.970
A metal detector recently uncovered over a
hundred silver and gold Viking artifacts near

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.830
the coast of the Irish Sea.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:09.500
So a bit of science and technology were all
that was needed to get those lucky charms.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:18.200
And as always - 
thanks for watching!
