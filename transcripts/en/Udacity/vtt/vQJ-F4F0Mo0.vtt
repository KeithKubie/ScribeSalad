00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.980
So, what should you use if you need

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.900
a complex data storage system? Well, there's one more

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.350
system, the Indexed Database API, also called IndexedDB for

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.920
short. Indexed Database was designed in response to Web

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.290
SQL, and its SQLite variant. Indexed Database is

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.200
not a SQL API, it's a simpler index storage

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.890
system, on which you can build an optimized query

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.270
implementation, like a, a SQL variant. This means it

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.720
isn't optimized to a particular query system. Instead, when

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.020
you create your database, you define what indexes you want

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.835
to use. If you've never done database storage before,

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:38.670
IndexDB may take a little bit of getting used to,

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.970
but it's actually pretty straight forward. The spec itself

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.170
has some really good examples in it. This code is

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.040
based on the spec. FIrst, you need to open

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.280
your database and you need to be prepared to initialize

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.110
the database if it hasn't been opened before. When you

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.120
initialize the database, you can define the indexes in the

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.950
database, that is, what attributes are easily searchable. You can

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.590
change this later too, you just have to upgrade the database.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.930
And of course you can inspect the databases in the

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.030
developer tools to see what's going in to the IndexDB store.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.830
And check to make sure it's organized the way you

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.050
want it. Just go into the Resources tab, select IndexDB, and

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.030
there you go. You can see your objects right there.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.300
If you expand them, you can even see the values.
