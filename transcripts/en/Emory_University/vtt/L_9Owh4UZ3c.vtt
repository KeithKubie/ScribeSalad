00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.780
LISA WALLS: "We have some of the most complex,

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.520
complicated patients, and it has helped up in that

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.980
we have this second set of eyes

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.080
on our patient.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.920
Intensive care specialists stationed

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.240
on the other side of the world

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.820
are using their expertise

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.120
to aid critical care patients

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.340
in Emory hospitals locally,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.000
thanks to a partnership between Emory Healthcare,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.260
Royal Perth Hospital in Australia,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.600
and the health technology company Philips.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.720
LISA WALLS: "If we push the button,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.100
they come on immediately."

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.660
TIM BUCHMAN: "And I'm speaking  to you

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.000
from the other side of the world, from Perth, Australia."

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.075
KATIE CASIE: "So the physician can camera in and see

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.580
with very high definition the patient, and the monitor,

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.160
and what's going on, and the patient can see the physician back.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.140
And there are nurses also behind the scenes

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.240
who watch the monitors. If the patient has a rhythm abnormality,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.580
or a low pressure or a sudden change in vital signs

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.760
that alarms, then the nurse can pick it up immediately,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.540
then call us at the nurses' station,

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.340
just in case we didn't see it here.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.600
That extra set of eyes will catch it

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.540
right on the spot."

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.835
TIMOTHY BUCHMAN: "We're kind of life air traffic control

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.500
for the ICU.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.420
Keeping an eye on the health

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.500
and well-being , identifying

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.440
problems as they crop up,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.255
so those problems don't become huge challenges,

00:01:20.255 --> 00:01:22.795
and those huge challenges

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.700
don't become emergencies

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.600
and those emergencies don't become catastrophes.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.740
LISA WALLS: "We can call that at any time

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.440
to say 'Hey, this is what's going on with the patient.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.900
'Can you take a look? Just give us a second opinion.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.480
Are we on the right track or do you see something else we could be doing?'

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.180
KATIE CASEY: "I work night shift, so there's

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.080
just a few people on handle emergencies

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.040
as they come up. And having a physician

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.080
or somebody else available who is able to offer that expertise immediately,

00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:51.735
for me, it helps relieve some of the stress of the job.

00:01:51.735 --> 00:01:54.375
It increases satisfaction. The patient gets immediate care.

00:01:54.375 --> 00:01:55.725
And I feel like it truly saves lives."

00:01:55.725 --> 00:01:58.485
TIMOTHY BUCHMAN: "Our eICU is there to support them,

00:01:58.805 --> 00:02:00.435
and make the deployment of our scarce

00:02:00.435 --> 00:02:03.585
experienced professionals

00:02:03.585 --> 00:02:05.585
more effective and more efficient."

00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:08.805
LISA WALLS: "The technology that we have

00:02:08.865 --> 00:02:11.095
is cutting edge."

00:02:11.095 --> 00:02:13.335
TIMOTHY BUCHMAN: "We can look around the room,

00:02:13.335 --> 00:02:15.975
survey all of the treatments and medications

00:02:15.975 --> 00:02:18.365
that are being delivered.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.620
We can see the bedside physiologic monitor.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.560
And then using the rest of our screens,

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.180
we can look at the entire medical record,

00:02:27.185 --> 00:02:30.165
all of the X-rays, CT scans.

00:02:30.165 --> 00:02:33.195
We can see everything that the

00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:36.275
providers at the bedside can see -- and more."

00:02:36.275 --> 00:02:39.285
LISA WALLS: "It's that second set of eyes,

00:02:39.285 --> 00:02:42.285
that second set of the critical thinking,

00:02:42.285 --> 00:02:45.595
that helps us give really exemplary care here.
