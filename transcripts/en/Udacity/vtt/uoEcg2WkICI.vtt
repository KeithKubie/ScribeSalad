00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.880
So finally, let's take a look at what kinds of consistency are there. We

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.160
know that there is sequential consistency, and

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.360
then, there is a family of relaxed consistency

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.212
models which are allowed to violate one or more of those ordering rules. And the

00:00:17.212 --> 00:00:20.061
models that have actually been proposed and

00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:24.912
sometimes used, are called weak consistency, processor consistency,

00:00:24.912 --> 00:00:28.685
release consistency, lazy release consistency, scope

00:00:28.685 --> 00:00:32.491
consistency, etcetera. There are actually many,

00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:38.089
many relax consistency models, too many to actually explain here. But the key

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:42.949
to all of them, is that although they allow arbitrary reordering's or

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.448
maybe some reordering's among data operations.

00:00:46.448 --> 00:00:50.183
All of them support synchronization operations that

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:55.744
allow you to ensure that the ordering that you really want in your program, gets

00:00:55.744 --> 00:01:00.523
to happen. Some of them do it by doing something like the N-sync corporation,

00:01:00.523 --> 00:01:01.762
some of them do it by using

00:01:01.762 --> 00:01:05.330
more refined memory synchronization operations. Some of them

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.820
do it by actually calling library functions

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.560
that are ensuring such ordering, and so on.
