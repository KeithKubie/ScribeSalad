00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.640
Well, we had shown a couple years ago on
efforts we did with these was that we

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.139
could develop synthetic biology-based
sensors to detect viral pathogens such

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.940
as Ebola. In this case we took that
platform and now developed several dozen

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.920
sensors they could be used to detect Zika in a very rapid and inexpensive

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.130
manner. We took on the Zika challenge

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.480
largely because of the growing global
health crisis. Increasingly, we're seeing

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.760
reports in the media and the call for
new technologies. We have a synthetic

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.940
biology platform for rapid, cheap
diagnostics that was remarkably well-

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.680
suited to take on this crisis. So, Zika virus is an RNA virus which basically means

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.320
that its genome that it's carrying
around inside has RNA in it.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.809
The idea is that we create a RNA-based sensor
and then you hydrate it with a simple and

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.800
then depending on if the Zika virus is
present or not then there's a color change

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.969
and you can easily see it with the naked
eye.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:05.070
The standard way to diagnose these kinds of
viruses is an antibody-based method,

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.100
but one problem is that the antibodies that
you get once you get Zika virus are very

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.010
similar to the ones that you get for
Dengue. The nice thing about our method is

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.340
that it's a sequence-based method. We
initially looked at sequences of the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.330
Zika virus from the field and we could actually identify

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.040
regions of the RNA genome that lent
themselves to the RNA-based sensors that

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.390
we've developed in the context of our
synthetic biology platform. We then went to

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.650
the next step and developed a whole
workflow, figuring out how you could process

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.520
patient samples. First of all, you start with
a patient sample, and then you

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.240
amplify it. That creates many many copies
of a small part of the Zika genome.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.170
The concentration of the virus in the blood
is very very low. By doing an

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.690
amplification step where you're gonna try to just
increase the number of RNA molecules, that

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.060
now makes it easier to actually detect
the presence of such RNA and get a

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.770
measurable read-out where you could, for
example in our paper based scheme, see a change in

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:10.890
color. We use this amplified RNA, put
it on paper and test whether the virus

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.980
is present or not. Typically within 30
minutes to an hour you can start seeing

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.160
a color change on the paper, but if a
more precise measurement needs to be

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.070
made you can also transfer this paper
under an electronic reader that can take very

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.830
precise measurements and more
efficiently diagnose the Zika. As part of this

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.380
project in addition to direct detection
we also developed a platform that allows

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.739
us to discriminate between different
strains of the virus. Differences between the

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.720
RNA sequences of the different strains
tend to be very very small. What the

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.269
CRISPR system allows us to do is to
distinguish between those very small

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.010
differences. So you can discriminate to
identify: is it an African strain or is it

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.980
an American strain or an Asian strain. The
broader implications of what we have

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.380
here, whether it's for Zika or Ebola, or other viral infections is that

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.280
we have now a platform

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.620
that allows you to rapidly develop new
sensors for new outbreaks. We anticipate

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.569
that this platform will enable one to
actually develop, test, validate, and

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.470
deploy a new diagnostic in under a week.
