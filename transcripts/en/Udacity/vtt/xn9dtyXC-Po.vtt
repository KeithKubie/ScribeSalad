00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.410
And luckily we have an equation that
helps us solve problems just like this.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.750
It involves using the point slope
form of the equation of a line.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.790
And the point slope equation
is y- y1 = m(x- x1).

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.730
And what does all this mean?

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.380
Well, m is still the slope and
x1 and y1,

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.330
they're just the coordinates
of our point.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.250
So in this case X1 would be 9 and
Y1 would be 8.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.860
So to practice entering
something in point slope form.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.550
Maybe you can complete the point slope
equation of the line described here.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.400
So can you just fill in the blanks here,
here and here?
