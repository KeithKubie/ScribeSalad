00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.057
- [Instructor] So let's
see if we can figure out

00:00:02.057 --> 00:00:05.402
what 1/3 divided by five is.

00:00:05.402 --> 00:00:06.877
And I'll give you a hint.

00:00:06.877 --> 00:00:09.470
Try to draw out 1/3 of a whole

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.978
and then divide it into
five equal sections.

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:14.634
Pause this video and try to do that.

00:00:14.634 --> 00:00:16.341
I always try to work through it together

00:00:16.341 --> 00:00:20.021
and to help us as I promised
or I suggested I guess.

00:00:20.021 --> 00:00:22.757
We said let's draw 1/3.

00:00:22.757 --> 00:00:27.267
I will represent a whole by
that square right over there.

00:00:27.267 --> 00:00:31.389
And now let me split up
into three equal sections.

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:35.607
So this is all hand drawn
with the aid of a computer.

00:00:35.607 --> 00:00:37.176
So it's not going to be perfect.

00:00:37.176 --> 00:00:39.986
But let's say that that
is three equal sections.

00:00:39.986 --> 00:00:41.404
It's roughly three equal sections.

00:00:41.404 --> 00:00:42.364
I didn't do it perfectly

00:00:42.364 --> 00:00:44.013
but you hopefully get the idea.

00:00:44.013 --> 00:00:48.757
And so 1/3 would be one of
those three equal sections.

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:50.632
So that's a third right over there

00:00:50.632 --> 00:00:52.538
that I have just shaded in

00:00:52.538 --> 00:00:54.977
and I want to divide it into five.

00:00:54.977 --> 00:00:57.812
I want to divide it by five, I should say.

00:00:57.812 --> 00:00:59.288
So let's do that.

00:00:59.288 --> 00:01:02.460
So to divide it by five, I'm
gonna divide it into five

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.677
equal sections.

00:01:03.677 --> 00:01:06.570
And if I'm dividing that one
into five equal sections,

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.919
let me just divide all of the thirds

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:09.322
into five equal sections.

00:01:09.322 --> 00:01:12.001
I'm essentially just going
to make five rows here.

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:13.588
One, and I'm gonna eyeball it,

00:01:13.588 --> 00:01:14.879
so it's going to be approximate.

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:19.046
Two, three, and then four
and five equal sections.

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:27.726
I now split this whole into
one, two, three, four, five rows

00:01:29.703 --> 00:01:31.258
of equal height.

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:34.642
Now if I go to my original
third and I divide it by five,

00:01:34.642 --> 00:01:38.189
I would be left with this right over here.

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.858
But what fraction is this of the whole?

00:01:41.858 --> 00:01:44.576
Well what I've done now
is I've split my whole

00:01:44.576 --> 00:01:46.729
into 15 equal sections.

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:47.562
How do I know that?

00:01:47.562 --> 00:01:48.443
Well I could count them.

00:01:48.443 --> 00:01:50.855
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,

00:01:50.855 --> 00:01:53.867
nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

00:01:53.867 --> 00:01:58.256
Or you could just say look
I had one, two, three thirds

00:01:58.256 --> 00:02:00.610
and now each of those have been split into

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.258
one, two, three, four,
five equal sections.

00:02:04.258 --> 00:02:06.891
So three times five is 15.

00:02:06.891 --> 00:02:08.683
So each of these is a 15th

00:02:08.683 --> 00:02:13.009
and so the 1/3 divided by five is just one

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:14.873
of those 15ths.

00:02:14.873 --> 00:02:17.423
So that right over there
is one of those 15ths.

00:02:17.423 --> 00:02:21.045
So this is going to be equal to 1/15

00:02:21.045 --> 00:02:22.378
and we are done.
