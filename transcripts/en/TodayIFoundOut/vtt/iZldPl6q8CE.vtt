00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.300
People have been telling dogs to “sic ’em,”
with the intent to have the dog attack individual(s),

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.720
since at least the nineteenth century.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.710
While this may seem odd given common modern
definitions for “sick” or the variant

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.320
“sic,” at the time this command popped
up, it made perfect sense.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.580
“Sick,” in this context, had nothing to
do with the word meaning “ill,” but rather

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.690
was simply a dialectal variant of “seek,”
which used to sometimes carry the connotation

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.000
of seeking with the intent to attack.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.420
(This sense of the word “seek” was used
as far back as around AD 1000 in the work,

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.420
Beowulf.)

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.489
The first known instance of someone instructing
a dog to attack someone using this “sick”

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.269
command occurred in Johnson J. Hooper’s
1845 Adventures of Capt. Simon Suggs:

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.199
You may well say that: what I tells them to
do they do—and if I was to sick them on

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.080
your old hoss yonder, they’d eat him up
afore you could say Jack Roberson.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.610
And it’s jist what I shall do, if you try
to pry into my consarns…

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.840
And later in that same work,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.840
“Here, Bull!” shouted the widow, “sick
him, Pomp!” but we cantered off, unwounded,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.100
fortunately, by the fangs of Bull and Pomp,
who kept up the chase as long as they could

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.759
hear the cheering voice of their mistress—“Si-c-k,
Pomp—sick, sick, si-c-k him, Bull—suboy!

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:26.939
suboy! suboy!”

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.750
As to how that became such a popular way to
tell a dog to attack, rather than to simply

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.390
say “attack,” or something similar, this
isn’t known but makes sense given the types

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.000
of sounds dogs are able to pick out most easily
from normal human speech.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.119
(Think when you hear someone speaking a foreign
language, it can at times just sound like

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.860
a jumble of random sounds.)

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.979
Thus, when training a new dog (and a young
child), most experts recommend “short, sharp

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:50.979
commands.”

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.970
“Sic” certainly fulfills these requirements,
being only one syllable and bookended by distinct

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:56.970
sounds.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.749
And while the “s” part of the word may
seem to be a soft sound to human hearing,

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:05.670
perhaps easily drowned out in some circumstances,
dogs hear not only much better in range of

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.149
frequencies than humans, but thanks to quite
a bit of their brains being devoted to sounds,

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.160
they are also better at discriminating between
noises.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.260
So something like a “ssssss” sound ends
up being relatively easy to pick out from

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.630
other human language to start a command, at
least more so than something like an “ah,”

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.200
and the hard “k” sound at the end is easily
distinguishable to finish it.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.060
Sic is also used to denote when someone has
made a mistake.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.120
This is often seen in print where a person
being quoted has made a grammatical or typographical

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.049
error, and the quote-r puts the quote in as
written (but includes {sic} so that it is

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.040
clear that the quote-e made the mistake).

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.040
This use of sic has Latin origins, where it
literally meant, “so, thus, in this way;”

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.840
it traces its regular use in English to the
late 19th century.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.730
Sick with the modern meaning of “excellent,”
“awesome,” or “very impressive,” according

00:02:51.730 --> 00:03:24.540
to the OED, dates surprisingly far back, to
1983 in boarding (skate and snow) culture.
