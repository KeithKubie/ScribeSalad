00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.900
okay all right so now we're going to

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910
okay all right so now we're going to
 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.250
okay all right so now we're going to
talk about probability this what I'll do

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260
talk about probability this what I'll do
 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.980
talk about probability this what I'll do
in probability today is actually not in

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990
in probability today is actually not in
 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.140
in probability today is actually not in
your primer but it is very important and

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150
your primer but it is very important and
 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.189
your primer but it is very important and
I use it as a basis for the statistics

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199
I use it as a basis for the statistics
 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.650
I use it as a basis for the statistics
so I thought we have enough time to do

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660
so I thought we have enough time to do
 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.640
so I thought we have enough time to do
that and we'll do that well and then we

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650
that and we'll do that well and then we
 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.950
that and we'll do that well and then we
will do the statistics later in another

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960
will do the statistics later in another
 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.920
will do the statistics later in another
session but everything will do in

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930
session but everything will do in
 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.860
session but everything will do in
statistics is covered in your primer ok

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870
statistics is covered in your primer ok
 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:51.310
statistics is covered in your primer ok
so both probability and statistics are

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320
so both probability and statistics are
 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.049
so both probability and statistics are
rigorous ways of thinking about

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059
rigorous ways of thinking about
 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:04.000
rigorous ways of thinking about
uncertainty and of course a lot of the

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010
 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.429
sustainability science or management

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439
sustainability science or management
 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.719
sustainability science or management
that you have to deal with involves

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729
that you have to deal with involves
 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.010
that you have to deal with involves
uncertainty in fact almost all of it

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020
uncertainty in fact almost all of it
 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.429
uncertainty in fact almost all of it
does and so probability and statistics

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439
does and so probability and statistics
 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.460
does and so probability and statistics
provide a useful tool to handle that

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470
provide a useful tool to handle that
 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.219
provide a useful tool to handle that
uncertainty and so that's why you need

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229
uncertainty and so that's why you need
 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.770
uncertainty and so that's why you need
to get used to it and it should be

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
to get used to it and it should be
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.069
to get used to it and it should be
actually central to the way you think

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079
actually central to the way you think
 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:36.020
actually central to the way you think
even though when we teach many things

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030
even though when we teach many things
 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.450
even though when we teach many things
both in the sustainability science and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460
both in the sustainability science and
 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.190
both in the sustainability science and
in in management and economics the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200
in in management and economics the
 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.530
in in management and economics the
uncertainty part comes later usually we

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540
uncertainty part comes later usually we
 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.319
uncertainty part comes later usually we
start off with simple examples that

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329
start off with simple examples that
 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.880
start off with simple examples that
don't have uncertainty that are

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890
don't have uncertainty that are
 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.969
don't have uncertainty that are
deterministic and then we add the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979
deterministic and then we add the
 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.859
deterministic and then we add the
uncertainty but the real world

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869
uncertainty but the real world
 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.990
uncertainty but the real world
uncertainty is central it comes before

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000
uncertainty is central it comes before
 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.709
uncertainty is central it comes before
anything else okay so once you've

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719
anything else okay so once you've
 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.590
anything else okay so once you've
learned to walk with the uncertainty you

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600
learned to walk with the uncertainty you
 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.900
learned to walk with the uncertainty you
got you have to get used to

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910
 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.400
incorporating that uncertainty all the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410
incorporating that uncertainty all the
 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.800
incorporating that uncertainty all the
time you know I've learnt with this

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810
time you know I've learnt with this
 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.370
time you know I've learnt with this
ankle

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380
ankle
 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.520
ankle
problem that walking is really just a

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530
problem that walking is really just a
 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.400
problem that walking is really just a
series of controlled Falls and and and

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410
series of controlled Falls and and and
 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.740
series of controlled Falls and and and
you don't realize that after you learn

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750
you don't realize that after you learn
 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.020
you don't realize that after you learn
to walk right you you forget that you're

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030
to walk right you you forget that you're
 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.250
to walk right you you forget that you're
just falling all the time and so and

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260
just falling all the time and so and
 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.200
just falling all the time and so and
that's what I'm certainty should be like

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210
that's what I'm certainty should be like
 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.050
that's what I'm certainty should be like
you should incorporate it and you should

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060
you should incorporate it and you should
 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.320
you should incorporate it and you should
realize in your analysis that you're

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330
realize in your analysis that you're
 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.660
realize in your analysis that you're
just making mistakes all the time

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670
just making mistakes all the time
 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.940
just making mistakes all the time
everything you say is really probably

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950
everything you say is really probably
 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.140
everything you say is really probably
wrong but nevertheless you have to

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150
wrong but nevertheless you have to
 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.560
wrong but nevertheless you have to
incorporate that it you have to you have

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570
incorporate that it you have to you have
 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.910
incorporate that it you have to you have
to control your mistakes just like you

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920
to control your mistakes just like you
 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.860
to control your mistakes just like you
control your Falls and that's really

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870
control your Falls and that's really
 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.440
control your Falls and that's really
what management is about controlling

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450
what management is about controlling
 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.880
what management is about controlling
that uncertainty okay so this is these

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890
that uncertainty okay so this is these
 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.160
that uncertainty okay so this is these
are methods of control we think of a

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170
are methods of control we think of a
 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.360
are methods of control we think of a
sample space as a list of possible

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370
sample space as a list of possible
 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.270
sample space as a list of possible
outcome so we imagine that uncertainty

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280
outcome so we imagine that uncertainty
 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.860
outcome so we imagine that uncertainty
and we control it we bound it we

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870
and we control it we bound it we
 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.630
and we control it we bound it we
parameterize it a parameter is something

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640
parameterize it a parameter is something
 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.800
parameterize it a parameter is something
that bounds something like a perimeter

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810
that bounds something like a perimeter
 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.530
that bounds something like a perimeter
fence those two are etymologically

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540
fence those two are etymologically
 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.880
fence those two are etymologically
linked the sample space is a parameter

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890
linked the sample space is a parameter
 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.540
linked the sample space is a parameter
which bounds our uncertainty in so far

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550
which bounds our uncertainty in so far
 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.420
which bounds our uncertainty in so far
as it lists all possible outcomes that

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430
as it lists all possible outcomes that
 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.530
as it lists all possible outcomes that
we imagined for the uncertain set of

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540
we imagined for the uncertain set of
 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.360
we imagined for the uncertain set of
outcomes an event is a set of possible

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370
outcomes an event is a set of possible
 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.820
outcomes an event is a set of possible
outcome so for example if you think of

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830
outcome so for example if you think of
 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.550
outcome so for example if you think of
the uncertainty as throwing a dice

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560
the uncertainty as throwing a dice
 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.400
the uncertainty as throwing a dice
throwing a die a single die then you

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410
throwing a die a single die then you
 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.440
throwing a die a single die then you
could the list of all possible outcomes

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450
could the list of all possible outcomes
 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.990
could the list of all possible outcomes
would be one two three four five and six

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000
would be one two three four five and six
 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.220
would be one two three four five and six
an event would be a list of possible

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230
an event would be a list of possible
 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.290
an event would be a list of possible
outcomes within that list of all

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300
outcomes within that list of all
 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.370
outcomes within that list of all
possible outcomes so it might be getting

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380
possible outcomes so it might be getting
 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.409
possible outcomes so it might be getting
a number less than three okay so the so

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419
a number less than three okay so the so
 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.810
a number less than three okay so the so
that event would consist of the outcome

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820
that event would consist of the outcome
 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.960
that event would consist of the outcome
one and the outcome to

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970
one and the outcome to
 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.450
one and the outcome to
two outcomes two possible outcomes

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460
two outcomes two possible outcomes
 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.900
two outcomes two possible outcomes
adding up to the event getting an

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910
adding up to the event getting an
 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.920
adding up to the event getting an
outcome less than three okay relative

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930
outcome less than three okay relative
 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.670
outcome less than three okay relative
frequency is the relative frequency of

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680
frequency is the relative frequency of
 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.420
frequency is the relative frequency of
an event a is the proportion of times

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430
an event a is the proportion of times
 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.560
an event a is the proportion of times
that event occurs in some fixed number

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570
that event occurs in some fixed number
 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:57.500
that event occurs in some fixed number
of trials okay so if I were to throw the

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510
of trials okay so if I were to throw the
 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.420
of trials okay so if I were to throw the
die a hundred times and i were to

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430
die a hundred times and i were to
 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.550
die a hundred times and i were to
compute the relative frequency the

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560
compute the relative frequency the
 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.670
compute the relative frequency the
proportion of times in those hundred

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680
proportion of times in those hundred
 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:15.800
proportion of times in those hundred
trials I got the event a that would be

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810
trials I got the event a that would be
 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.840
trials I got the event a that would be
the relative frequency let's say that

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850
the relative frequency let's say that
 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:23.780
the relative frequency let's say that
that I got it 30 times out of 100 then

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790
that I got it 30 times out of 100 then
 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.970
that I got it 30 times out of 100 then
the relative frequency is 30 over a

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980
the relative frequency is 30 over a
 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.630
the relative frequency is 30 over a
hundred the probability of event a

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640
hundred the probability of event a
 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.990
hundred the probability of event a
occurring is the relative frequency of

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000
occurring is the relative frequency of
 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.800
occurring is the relative frequency of
event a as n goes to infinity so as I

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810
event a as n goes to infinity so as I
 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.740
event a as n goes to infinity so as I
run that trial repeatedly with no change

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750
run that trial repeatedly with no change
 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:51.580

ok ok if this rectangle represents

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:43.169
 

00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:47.629
that's the sample space that's the list

00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:47.639
that's the sample space that's the list
 

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:51.550
that's the sample space that's the list
of all possible outcomes and I have

of all possible outcomes and I have
 

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.309
of all possible outcomes and I have
outcomes hey this is event hey that's a

00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:55.319

of outcomes these two events are
 

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:09.860

outcomes which comprise both event a and
 

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:19.519
outcomes which comprise both event a and
event be right so in that case the

00:08:19.519 --> 00:08:19.529
event be right so in that case the
 

00:08:19.529 --> 00:08:30.350

the probabilities were uniformly
 

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.120
the probabilities were uniformly
distributed over this space then you

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:53.130
distributed over this space then you
 

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.769
distributed over this space then you
could think of it as area but otherwise

00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:54.779
could think of it as area but otherwise
 

00:08:54.779 --> 00:08:58.240
could think of it as area but otherwise
it would be some function of that area

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:58.250
it would be some function of that area
 

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:06.170
it would be some function of that area
okay but of course events that are not

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:06.180
okay but of course events that are not
 

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:15.610
okay but of course events that are not
mutually exclusive might look like this

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:15.620
mutually exclusive might look like this
 

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:21.019
mutually exclusive might look like this
in that case the probability of A or B

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:21.029
in that case the probability of A or B
 

00:09:21.029 --> 00:09:23.870
in that case the probability of A or B
would not simply be the sum of these two

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880
would not simply be the sum of these two
 

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.559
would not simply be the sum of these two
circles because you'd be double counting

00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:27.569
circles because you'd be double counting
 

00:09:27.569 --> 00:09:32.829
circles because you'd be double counting
the intersection right so by definition

00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:32.839
the intersection right so by definition
 

00:09:32.839 --> 00:09:35.870
the intersection right so by definition
events and B are mutually exclusive if

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:35.880
events and B are mutually exclusive if
 

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.300

all those events is equal to one okay so

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:16.230
all those events is equal to one okay so
 

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:25.970
all those events is equal to one okay so
the example here would be suppose this

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:25.980
the example here would be suppose this
 

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:30.410

couple of probability axioms I'm sure

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:41.910
couple of probability axioms I'm sure
 

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.260

you've met that is if you have a

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:45.270
you've met that is if you have a
 

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:50.150
you've met that is if you have a
discrete valued variable X so now I've

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160
discrete valued variable X so now I've
 

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.430
discrete valued variable X so now I've
gone away from this sort of Venn diagram

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440
gone away from this sort of Venn diagram
 

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.490
gone away from this sort of Venn diagram
and I'm thinking of my uncertainty in

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:55.500
and I'm thinking of my uncertainty in
 

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:59.030
and I'm thinking of my uncertainty in
the following structure it is uncertain

00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040
the following structure it is uncertain
 

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:04.070
the following structure it is uncertain
in that I have some variable capital X

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:04.080
in that I have some variable capital X
 

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.990
in that I have some variable capital X
and it can take on a particular value

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000
and it can take on a particular value
 

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.820
and it can take on a particular value
little X and I don't know what

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:10.830
little X and I don't know what
 

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.120
little X and I don't know what
value it's going to take on ok so my

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:14.130
value it's going to take on ok so my
 

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.250
value it's going to take on ok so my
uncertainty is that is going to take on

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:16.260
uncertainty is that is going to take on
 

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.620
uncertainty is that is going to take on
a particular value little X and I don't

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:18.630
a particular value little X and I don't
 

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.230
a particular value little X and I don't
know what that is and there's some

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240
know what that is and there's some
 

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:27.890
know what that is and there's some
probability associated with that value

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:27.900
probability associated with that value
 

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.350
probability associated with that value
that random variable capital X taking on

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:30.360
that random variable capital X taking on
 

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.100
that random variable capital X taking on
the particular value little X if we're

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:34.110
the particular value little X if we're
 

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:37.390
the particular value little X if we're
talking about a discrete valued variable

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:37.400
talking about a discrete valued variable
 

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.570
talking about a discrete valued variable
then it can take on some value one and

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:41.580
then it can take on some value one and
 

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.970
then it can take on some value one and
two and three and four and five and so

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:43.980
two and three and four and five and so
 

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:50.600
two and three and four and five and so
on then I could simply express the

on then I could simply express the
 

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.390
on then I could simply express the
following axiom that is the probability

following axiom that is the probability
 

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.910

which we talked about here we were

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160
which we talked about here we were
 

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.490
which we talked about here we were
talking about mutually exclusive events

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:30.500
talking about mutually exclusive events
 

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:34.130
talking about mutually exclusive events
now we have two events that are not

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:34.140
now we have two events that are not
 

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:38.240
now we have two events that are not
mutually exclusive this is the Union a

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:38.250
mutually exclusive this is the Union a
 

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.880

the red lettering is the intersection ok
 

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:52.760
the red lettering is the intersection ok
and now we're not talking about events

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:52.770
and now we're not talking about events
 

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:56.960
and now we're not talking about events
which are mutually exclusive so the

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:56.970
which are mutually exclusive so the
 

00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:04.160
which are mutually exclusive so the
probability of a union B or a or b the

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:04.170
probability of a union B or a or b the
 

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:06.200
probability of a union B or a or b the
probability of a plus the probability of

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:06.210
probability of a plus the probability of
 

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:09.170
probability of a plus the probability of
B minus the intersection probability

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:09.180
B minus the intersection probability
 

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:12.590
B minus the intersection probability
right of course if a and B are mutually

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:12.600
right of course if a and B are mutually
 

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:18.740
right of course if a and B are mutually
exclusive than that 0 ok this is

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:18.750

something how many people have had to

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320
something how many people have had to
 

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.030
something how many people have had to
deal with sequel queries

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.040
deal with sequel queries
 

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.700
deal with sequel queries
you have right so this is a very useful

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:28.710
you have right so this is a very useful
 

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.830
you have right so this is a very useful
thing to keep in mind there is the

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:30.840
thing to keep in mind there is the
 

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:35.180
thing to keep in mind there is the
concept of the exclusive or the prop in

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:35.190
concept of the exclusive or the prop in
 

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.870
concept of the exclusive or the prop in
natural language the word or Never

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880
natural language the word or Never
 

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.390
natural language the word or Never
implies the exclusive or but it

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:43.400
implies the exclusive or but it
 

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.040
implies the exclusive or but it
occasionally people confuse it as such

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:46.050
occasionally people confuse it as such
 

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:49.790
occasionally people confuse it as such
and so this concept is very useful so

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800
and so this concept is very useful so
 

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.660
and so this concept is very useful so
this means the exclusive or means either

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:53.670
this means the exclusive or means either
 

00:14:53.670 --> 00:15:02.930
this means the exclusive or means either
A or B but not both ok and so when you

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:02.940
A or B but not both ok and so when you
 

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.260
A or B but not both ok and so when you
do sequel code often this is a useful

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:06.270
do sequel code often this is a useful
 

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:11.210
do sequel code often this is a useful
query to run and that is the sign for

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:11.220
query to run and that is the sign for
 

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.630
query to run and that is the sign for
the exclusive or ok so a couple of

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:14.640
the exclusive or ok so a couple of
 

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.060
the exclusive or ok so a couple of
notation things here this is the sign

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:17.070
notation things here this is the sign
 

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:21.680
notation things here this is the sign
for the exclusive or this is a or b

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:21.690
for the exclusive or this is a or b
 

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:25.810
for the exclusive or this is a or b
which would be this whole area

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:25.820
 

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:30.470
intersected with the compliments of a

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480
intersected with the compliments of a
 

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:34.550
intersected with the compliments of a
intersection B so this ' denotes

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560
intersection B so this ' denotes
 

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.540
intersection B so this ' denotes
complement and complement is everything

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:38.550
complement and complement is everything
 

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:45.650
complement and complement is everything
in the sample set that's not in this ok

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:45.660
in the sample set that's not in this ok
 

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:49.190
in the sample set that's not in this ok
so if I were to take a intersection B

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:49.200
so if I were to take a intersection B
 

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.340
so if I were to take a intersection B
which is this find the complement of

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:52.350
which is this find the complement of
 

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:54.680
which is this find the complement of
that that's everything that's not in

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:54.690
that that's everything that's not in
 

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:59.690
that that's everything that's not in
this so it's all of that and I were to

00:15:59.690 --> 00:15:59.700
this so it's all of that and I were to
 

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.050
this so it's all of that and I were to
take the intersection of that with a

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:02.060
take the intersection of that with a
 

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.580
take the intersection of that with a
union B then I'd be left with this

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:04.590
union B then I'd be left with this
 

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:09.470
union B then I'd be left with this
exclusive or ok all right let's talk

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:09.480
exclusive or ok all right let's talk
 

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:16.100
exclusive or ok all right let's talk
about conditional probability usually we

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:16.110
about conditional probability usually we
 

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.050
about conditional probability usually we
care about conditional probabilities we

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:18.060
care about conditional probabilities we
 

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:22.990
care about conditional probabilities we
want to know if something has happened

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:23.000
want to know if something has happened
 

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.810
want to know if something has happened
then what is the probability that

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:26.820
then what is the probability that
 

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.300
then what is the probability that
something else will happen for example

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:29.310
something else will happen for example
 

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:33.980
something else will happen for example
there is some probability that it will

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:33.990
there is some probability that it will
 

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:37.040
there is some probability that it will
rain on a random day

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:37.050
rain on a random day
 

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:41.630
rain on a random day
if tomorrow is a random day but if i

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:41.640
if tomorrow is a random day but if i
 

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:45.820
if tomorrow is a random day but if i
told you that tomorrow is a day in april

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:45.830
told you that tomorrow is a day in april
 

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:48.350
told you that tomorrow is a day in april
chances are the probability that it will

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360
chances are the probability that it will
 

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.300
chances are the probability that it will
be rain will be different we'll probably

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:50.310
be rain will be different we'll probably
 

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:53.329
be rain will be different we'll probably
be higher than if tomorrow was a random

00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:53.339
be higher than if tomorrow was a random
 

00:16:53.339 --> 00:16:56.840
be higher than if tomorrow was a random
day throughout the year right april

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:56.850
day throughout the year right april
 

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:02.259

showers bring May flowers so so there

00:17:02.259 --> 00:17:02.269
showers bring May flowers so so there
 

00:17:02.269 --> 00:17:07.549
showers bring May flowers so so there
the condition is that it's April the

00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:07.559
the condition is that it's April the
 

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:09.290
the condition is that it's April the

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:09.300
conditional probability is that it is
 

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.360
conditional probability is that it is
what's up is there probability that

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:11.370
what's up is there probability that
 

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:14.449
what's up is there probability that
it'll rain given that it's April okay

00:17:14.449 --> 00:17:14.459
it'll rain given that it's April okay
 

00:17:14.459 --> 00:17:16.699
it'll rain given that it's April okay
obviously that's different oh here I had

00:17:16.699 --> 00:17:16.709
obviously that's different oh here I had
 

00:17:16.709 --> 00:17:22.130
obviously that's different oh here I had
a more pertinent example perhaps

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:22.140
a more pertinent example perhaps
 

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:26.720
a more pertinent example perhaps
certainly not more amusing okay so

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:26.730
certainly not more amusing okay so
 

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:29.390
certainly not more amusing okay so
probability of a tanker spill an oil

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.400

tanker spill given that the captain of
 

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:40.690
tanker spill given that the captain of
the tanker is drunk ok ok so the

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:40.700
the tanker is drunk ok ok so the
 

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:48.860
the tanker is drunk ok ok so the
conditional probability is given by it

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:48.870
conditional probability is given by it
 

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.110
conditional probability is given by it
is denoted as follows the probability of

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120
is denoted as follows the probability of
 

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.040
is denoted as follows the probability of
B given a so this line again denotes

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:55.050
B given a so this line again denotes
 

00:17:55.050 --> 00:18:00.650
B given a so this line again denotes
given is the intersection probability

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:00.660
given is the intersection probability
 

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.020
given is the intersection probability
divided by the probability of the given

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:03.030
divided by the probability of the given
 

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:29.800
divided by the probability of the given
event ok and you can see that of course

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:29.810
 

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:36.520
okay so probability of a is the

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:36.530
okay so probability of a is the
 

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:41.770
okay so probability of a is the
horizontal shaded area and the

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:41.780
horizontal shaded area and the
 

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:51.780
horizontal shaded area and the
probability of a intersection B is the

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:51.790
probability of a intersection B is the
 

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:55.510
probability of a intersection B is the
the cross that what should I call is

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520
the cross that what should I call is
 

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.600
the cross that what should I call is
there the chequered the checkered area

00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:58.610
there the chequered the checkered area
 

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:05.560
there the chequered the checkered area
right so the probability of B given a is

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:05.570
right so the probability of B given a is
 

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:19.530
right so the probability of B given a is
this check it area divided by the

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:19.540
 

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:22.900
horizontally shaded area okay so it's

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:22.910
horizontally shaded area okay so it's
 

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:26.370
horizontally shaded area okay so it's
this divided by this whole circle right

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:26.380
this divided by this whole circle right
 

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:30.490

this divided by the whole thing right so

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:43.850
this divided by the whole thing right so
 

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:46.060
this divided by the whole thing right so
it's going to be higher the conditional

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:46.070
it's going to be higher the conditional
 

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:47.830
it's going to be higher the conditional
probability is going to be higher in

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840
probability is going to be higher in
 

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:57.760
probability is going to be higher in
this case okay suppose a dice rolled ok

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:57.770
this case okay suppose a dice rolled ok
 

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:01.180
this case okay suppose a dice rolled ok
an event a is the role takes a value

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:01.190
an event a is the role takes a value
 

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:05.290
an event a is the role takes a value
less than for an event B is that the

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:05.300
less than for an event B is that the
 

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:09.460
less than for an event B is that the
roll is an odd number ok what's the

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:09.470
roll is an odd number ok what's the
 

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:11.290
roll is an odd number ok what's the
probability of the role being an odd

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:11.300
probability of the role being an odd
 

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:15.130
probability of the role being an odd
number that is what's the probability of

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:15.140
number that is what's the probability of
 

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:19.000
number that is what's the probability of

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:19.010
event be given that event a has occurred
 

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:21.360
event be given that event a has occurred
right so I'm looking exactly for this

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:21.370
right so I'm looking exactly for this
 

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:25.150
right so I'm looking exactly for this
quantity probability of B given a well

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:25.160

define the events event a is roll takes

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:31.610
define the events event a is roll takes
 

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:33.940
define the events event a is roll takes
a value less than four so that's one two

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:33.950
a value less than four so that's one two
 

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:39.220
a value less than four so that's one two
or three an event be the roll is an odd

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:39.230
or three an event be the roll is an odd
 

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:44.040
or three an event be the roll is an odd
number so that's one three or five

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:44.050
 

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:47.590
okay so three values that make up event

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600
okay so three values that make up event
 

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:53.620
okay so three values that make up event
a one and three these two values are

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:53.630
a one and three these two values are
 

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:57.970
a one and three these two values are
associated with event be okay so outcome

00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:57.980
associated with event be okay so outcome
 

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:04.680
associated with event be okay so outcome
1 and outcome 3 is in this intersection

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:04.690
 

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:07.750
okay so the probability of event be

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760
okay so the probability of event be
 

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:14.800
okay so the probability of event be
occurring given event a is these two out

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:14.810
occurring given event a is these two out
 

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:19.960
occurring given event a is these two out
of the three possibilities okay this and

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:19.970
of the three possibilities okay this and
 

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:22.870
of the three possibilities okay this and
this out of the possibilities one two

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880
this out of the possibilities one two
 

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:26.110
this out of the possibilities one two
and three so you know that the

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:26.120
and three so you know that the
 

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.050
and three so you know that the
conditional probability is two thirds

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:28.060
conditional probability is two thirds
 

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:32.620
conditional probability is two thirds
but let's just use the formula okay we

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:32.630
but let's just use the formula okay we
 

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:38.070
but let's just use the formula okay we
want the probability of the intersection

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080
want the probability of the intersection
 

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:43.830
want the probability of the intersection
okay so that means events a and B occur

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840
okay so that means events a and B occur
 

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:49.420
okay so that means events a and B occur
that's the one or the three so you get 1

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:49.430
that's the one or the three so you get 1
 

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:51.820
that's the one or the three so you get 1
with probability 1 6 you get 3 with

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:51.830
with probability 1 6 you get 3 with
 

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:54.310
with probability 1 6 you get 3 with
probability 1 sixth the two are

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320
probability 1 sixth the two are
 

00:21:54.320 --> 00:22:02.770
probability 1 sixth the two are
independent so the sum of these is going

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:02.780
independent so the sum of these is going
 

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.130
independent so the sum of these is going
to give you one third so that's

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:06.140
to give you one third so that's
 

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:10.420
to give you one third so that's
one-third probability of an a is one two

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:10.430
one-third probability of an a is one two
 

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:12.120
one-third probability of an a is one two
or three well that's just going to be

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:12.130
or three well that's just going to be
 

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:17.010
or three well that's just going to be
three outcomes out of six so that's half

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:17.020
three outcomes out of six so that's half
 

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:20.980
three outcomes out of six so that's half
so probability of B given a is one third

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:20.990
so probability of B given a is one third
 

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:24.340
so probability of B given a is one third
divided by one half using I must have

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:24.350
divided by one half using I must have
 

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:26.230
divided by one half using I must have
given you this formula right as the

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240
given you this formula right as the
 

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:32.350
given you this formula right as the
formula one third divided by one-half

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:32.360
