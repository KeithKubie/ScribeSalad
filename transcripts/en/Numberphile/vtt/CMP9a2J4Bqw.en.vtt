00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.300
DR. .JAMES GRIME: So today we're
going to talk about one

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.210
of the great unsolved problems
in mathematics that went back

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.710
to the Ancient Greeks, thousands
of years ago, which

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.110
was eventually solved in 1882.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.050
And the problem is called
squaring the circle.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.740
And you may have even heard of
the problem as a metaphor for

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.050
something that's impossible
to do.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.950
The question is, can you make a
square with the same area as

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.480
the circle?

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.670
Now you have to understand
the rules.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.259
In Ancient Greece they
didn't have algebra.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.420
So they could only
construct numbers

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.980
using lines and circles.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.930
So you could only make things
using a straight edge--

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.130
like a ruler, but not a
measured ruler, just a

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.250
straight edge--

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.500
and a compass.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.290
So lines and circles,
those are the rules.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.300
Those are the rules the Ancient
Greeks had to work by.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.840
Using those rules, can you
construct a square with the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.000
same area as the circle?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.600
Let's have a look at
what you can do

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.270
with rules and compasses.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.860
You can add numbers.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.480
Here's a line, and
it has length a.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.620
And I add another line
of length b.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.430
And the whole thing
is a plus b.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.910
So you can add numbers together

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.900
quite easily with lines.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.770
You can subtract numbers,
as well.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.870
If I start with b, and then I
mark off a length, which I'm

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.330
going to call a, then this
bit here, that's going

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.420
to be b minus a.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.660
We can multiply.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.610
If I draw a little triangle
here, this has length 1.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.500
And this has length a.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.920
I'm going to scale
up the triangle.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.320
I scale it up, so now this has
length b, the big triangle has

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.940
length b, then this has been
scaled up as well, so that

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.290
this has a length a times b.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.970
You divide.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.080
Same idea, but it's the
reverse of that.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.530
If I took a bigger triangle, if
that has a length of b, and

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.420
the long edge here has a length
of a, if I scale it

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.200
down so now this has a length
of 1, then this has been

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.770
scaled down as well.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.524
And you scale it down so
it has a length of

00:02:08.524 --> 00:02:11.460
a divided by b.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.600
So you can divide by scaling
triangles as well.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.195
And there's one more
thing you can do.

00:02:16.195 --> 00:02:19.490
If I draw a line here,
this is a.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.650
I'm going to add 1 to it.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.050
That's 1.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.840
I'm then going to draw
a semicircle.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:33.270
And this length, here, is
the square root of a.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.750
And that's all you can do.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.920
That is it.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.350
With a ruler and a compass, you
can add, multiply, divide,

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.250
subtract, workout square
roots, and that is it.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.370
That is all you can do.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.940
The numbers you make using
those rules are called

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.570
constructible all numbers.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.330
So all those numbers are
just repeated use

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.740
of those few rules.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.820
If we had a circle--

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.780
let's this make this easy.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.900
Let's say this circle
has a radius of 1.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.430
The area of the circle is pi
times the radius squared.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.730
And the radius squared,
that's 1.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.470
So the area of the circle
is just pi.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.300
So I want a square with
the same area.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.720
I want a square now that
has an area of pi.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.400
And you may be ahead of me here,
because a square has an

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.580
area of pi, the lengths of the
sides are the square root of

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.830
pi

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.230
Now it's at the square
root of pi.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.530
We can do square roots.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.810
That's allowed.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.450
So there's nothing yet to say
that we can't do this.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.830
So what's the problem?

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.610
Well we know that pi
is irrational.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.860
Actually, that wasn't
easy to work out.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.570
We only worked that out
quite recently.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.150
By quite recently I mean 1761.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.800
But being irrational
is not enough.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.110
There are constructible numbers
that are irrational.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.660
You can make the square root
of 2 quite easily.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.890
And you can make the square
root of the square root

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.870
of 2, and so on.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.880
So being irrational is not
enough to say that

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.800
this can't be done.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.965
If I'm allowed to make this
a bit more general, if I'm

00:04:10.965 --> 00:04:15.090
allowed to use other roots,
like cube roots, or fifth

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.220
roots, or nth roots, if I'm
allowed to add those in as

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.200
well, the numbers that you can
make using those rules are

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.000
called algebraic numbers.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.005
That's just a bit more
general, same idea.

00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:28.840
And it turns out that they were
able to prove that pi was

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.610
not an algebraic number.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.310
And if it's not an algebraic
number, then it's definitely

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.250
not a constructible number.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.730
Now this is what I like.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.910
The word for a number that is
not algebraic is called a

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.210
transcendental number, which
is a fantastic word.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.420
Now to prove something is
transcendental is really hard.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.980
In fact, mathematicians had
shown that transcendental

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.060
numbers existed seven years
before they even found an

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.860
example of a transcendental
number.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.240
So you have to imagine in those
seven years, people were

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.630
saying to the mathematicians,
show me a transcendental

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.450
number, come on, show me a
transcendental number.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.590
But it was a really
hard thing to do.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.140
Eventually they found a
few examples of this.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.320
But we still have to wait until
we were able to prove

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.030
that pi itself was
transcendental.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.220
And then that was
done in 1882.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.660
Once we've shown that, we've
shown that pi is not

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.090
constructible.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.970
And that is a proof that you
cannot square the circle.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.670
BRADY: Can you only not square
this circle given the

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.870
parameters of these rules
in this game?

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.540
Could a computer square
a circle?

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.180
DR. .JAMES GRIME: You can make
a square with sides that have

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.340
length root pi.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.780
Absolutely.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.080
So to the modern day people,
with our tools of algebra--

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.390
algebra is fantastic.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.550
People complain about algebra,
and having to

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.340
learn algebra at school.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.470
But if we didn't have algebra,
we would be doing maths like

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.710
the Ancient Greeks did maths.

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.950
I promise you, that would
be much, much worse.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.090
Your textbooks would
be ridiculous.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.440
They'd be very wordy.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.640
Algebra is an amazing, powerful
tool in mathematics.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.080
It's not there to cause
you problems.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.290
It's there for a reason.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:24.750
It's brilliant.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:30.980
So this is easy to make a square
with the area of pi.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:36.050
But using the Greek rules,
straight lines and circles,

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.900
it's impossible to do.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.280
BRADY: You say it's easy
to make a square

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.190
with the area of pi.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:47.100
But because pi has this nature
where the digits continue, and

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.455
we can't even get to the exact
figure, surely you can't make

00:06:50.455 --> 00:06:51.870
a square that's exactly pi.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.500
Because you don't even
know what pi is.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.050
Or you can do it, can you?

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.250
DR. .JAMES GRIME: You can do
it and you're treading on

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.450
something called Zeno's Paradox
there, which we're

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.465
about to do next.

00:07:05.465 --> 00:07:07.360
BRADY: OK.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.530
So for a second video in a row
we're going to tell people

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.591
they have to wait to
find out more?

00:07:12.591 --> 00:07:14.510
DR. .JAMES GRIME: If that's the
way you want to play it,

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.530
Brady, that's your choice.

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.430
This is Brady's decision.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.410
He's stringing you along here.

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.770
The representatives
actually passed it

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.760
unanimously, 67 to 0.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.580
They passed it.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.070
Now this is the weird bit.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.450
On the same day that they
were passing the bill--
