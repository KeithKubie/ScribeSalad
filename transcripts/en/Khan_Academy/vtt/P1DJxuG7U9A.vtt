00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.510
Let f be the function
given by f of x

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.500
is equal to the square root of
x plus 4 minus 3 over x minus 5.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.640
If x does not equal 5, and
it's equal to c if x equals 5.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.630
Then say, if f is
continuous at x equals 5,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.630
what is the value of c?

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.060
So if we know that f is
continuous at x equals 5,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.670
that means that the limit
as x approaches 5 of f of x

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.390
is equal to f of 5.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.870
This is the definition
of continuity.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.590
And they tell us
that f of 5, when

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.970
x equals 5, the value of
the function is equal to c.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.917
So this must be equal to c.

00:00:38.917 --> 00:00:40.500
So what we really
need to do is figure

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.600
out what the limit of f of x
as x approaches 5 actually is.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.810
Now, if we just
try to substitute 5

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.150
into the expression right
up here, in the numerator

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.120
you have 5 plus 4 is 9.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.020
The square root of
that is positive 3,

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.220
the principal root
is positive 3.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.550
3 minus 3 is 0.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.170
So you get a 0 in the numerator.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.520
And then you get 5 minus
5 in the denominator,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.940
so you get 0 in the denominator.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.507
So you get this
indeterminate form of 0/0.

00:01:07.507 --> 00:01:09.090
And in the future,
we will see that we

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.540
do have a tool that allows
us, or gives us an option

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.050
to attempt to find
the limits when

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.400
we get this indeterminate form.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.080
It's called L'Hopital's rule.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.370
But we can actually tackle
this with a little bit

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.920
of fancy algebra.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.840
And to do that, I'm
going to try to get

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.990
this radical out
of the numerator.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.050
So let's rewrite it.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:36.090
So we have the square root of x
plus 4 minus 3 over x minus 5.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.622
And any time you see a radical
plus or minus something else,

00:01:39.622 --> 00:01:41.080
to get rid of the
radical, what you

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.220
can do is multiply
by the radical--

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.260
or, if you have a
radical minus 3,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.810
you multiply by
the radical plus 3.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.740
So in this situation,
you just multiply

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.940
the numerator by
square root of x plus 4

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.830
plus 3 over the square
root of x plus 4 plus 3.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.900
We obviously have to
multiply the numerator

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.640
and the denominator
by the same thing

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.729
so that we actually don't change
the value of the expression.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.560
If this right over
here had a plus 3,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.020
then we would do a minus 3 here.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.540
This is a technique that we
learn in algebra, or sometimes

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.420
in pre-calculus class,
to rationalize usually

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.300
denominators, but to rationalize
numerators or denominators.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.750
It's also a very
similar technique

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.690
that we use often times to
get rid of complex numbers,

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.319
usually in denominators.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.860
But if you multiply this out--
and I encourage you to do it--

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.526
you notice this has
the pattern that you

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:32.850
learned in algebra class.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.190
It's a difference of squares.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.500
Something minus something
times something plus something.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.460
So the first term is going to
be the first something squared.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.160
So square root of x plus
4 squared is x plus 4.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.530
And the second term is going
to be the second something,

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.020
or you're going to subtract
the second something squared.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.940
So you're going to have
minus 3 squared, so minus 9.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.700
And in the denominator,
you're of course

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.520
going to have x minus 5
times the square root of x

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.930
plus 4 plus 3.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.270
And so this has-- I guess
you could say simplified to,

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.010
although it's not
arguably any simpler.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.024
But at least we have
gotten our radical.

00:03:15.024 --> 00:03:16.690
We're really just
playing around with it

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.020
algebraically to see if we
can then substitute x equals 5

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.970
or if we can somehow
simplify it to figure out

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.090
what the limit is.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.700
And when you simplify
the numerator up here,

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.650
you get x plus 4 minus 9.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:35.570
Well, that's x minus 5 over x
minus 5 times the square root

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.750
of x plus 4 plus 3.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.260
And now it pops out at
you, both the numerator

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.910
and the denominator are
now divisible by x minus 5.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.235
So you can have a completely
identical expression

00:03:49.235 --> 00:03:50.860
if you say that this
is the same thing.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.670
You can divide the numerator
and the denominator by x minus 5

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.920
if you assume x
does not equal 5.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.990
So this is going to
be the same thing as 1

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:10.190
over square root of x plus 4
plus 3 for x does not equal 5.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.380
Which is fine, because in the
first part of this function

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.480
definition, this is the
case for x does not equal 5.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.060
So we could actually
replace this--

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.149
and this is a simpler
expression-- with 1

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:26.500
over square root
of x plus 4 plus 3.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.667
And so now when we take the
limit as x approaches 5,

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:30.541
we're going to get closer
and closer to five.

00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:32.800
We're going to get x values
closer and closer to 5,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.250
but not quite at 5.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.490
We can use this expression
right over here.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.310
So the limit of f of
x as x approaches 5

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.923
is going to be the same
thing as the limit of 1

00:04:42.923 --> 00:04:49.690
over the square root of x plus
4 plus 3 as x approaches 5.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.220
And now we can
substitute a 5 in here.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.310
It's going to be
1 over 5 plus 4 is

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.840
9, principal root of that is 3.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.030
3 plus 3 is 6.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:08.930
So if c is equal to 1/6, then
the limit of our function

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.800
as x approaches 5 is going
to be equal to f of 5.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.340
And we are continuous
at x equals 5.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.331
So it's 1/6.
