&gt;&gt; Male Interviewer: Thanks everybody for
joining us.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.330
I am very honored
to have today for a conversation about his

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.019
latest book,
uh, William Patry, known to us here at Google

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.660
as Bill,
who serves as a senior copyright counsel at

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.670
Google,
and before that, has a very esteemed career

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.820
as a copyright scholar, a copyright lawyer,
and in fact, is one of the authors

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.220
of one of the leading treatises on copyright
law,

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.240
'Patry on Copyrights', so thanks very much
for joining us today, Bill.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.640
&gt;&gt;Bill Patry: Thanks for having me, Fred.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.400
I was,
had a long and checkered career.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.450
My mother wondered if I'd
ever be able to keep a job.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.450
[laughter]

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.280
&gt;&gt;Fred: Lo and behold, it worked out in the
end.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.280
&gt;&gt;Bill: It did.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.280
&gt;&gt;Fred: Great!

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.760
So, um, thanks to you
for coming by Google to talk about your new

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.090
book,
How to Fix Copyright.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.040
It came out just a few
months ago, right?

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.500
&gt;&gt;Bill: Yes, in November.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.010
&gt;&gt;Fred: Fantastic, and so, we'll have a conversation
here.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.080
I have some questions to warm Bill up with
and then we'll

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.960
take some questions from the audience.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.510
I just ask you,
before you ask a question, to wait for the

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.640
handheld mic
so that we have that, uh, on the tape.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.690
Uh, so, as I was reading your book, Bill,
I kept, I couldn't help but feel I was reading,

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.720
it was almost like a sports account.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.550
I almost felt like
here was somebody who loves his hometown team

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.200
of copyright,
and yet is deeply unhappy with the direction

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.210
the managers have been taking it.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.430
Um, so, what do you think about that?

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.460
How how far astray do you think
things have gotten and have you given up hope

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.200
on the, uh,
copyright law that you've spent your life

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.200
working on?

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.520
&gt;&gt;Bill: Nice, that's a pretty good metaphor.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.810
I mean,
another one would be, it's like a favorite

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.740
aunt or
uncle, you know, who's always been a bit goofy,

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.100
um, maybe a bit creative, but never as creative
as they think they are.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.200
And so you have a good time, then after a
while things kind of take a

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.180
hard turn, and you're a bit surprised by that,
and you, you know, try to

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.230
work things out so that they can get back
to being the nice goofy person they were before.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.230
Um.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.230
&gt;&gt;Fred: so you're...

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.230
&gt;&gt;Bill: It may or may not work.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.909
&gt;&gt;Fred: So you're saying this book is like
an intervention

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:10.319
for uh, "Uncle Copyright?"

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.770
&gt;&gt;Bill: Right, right, right.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.150
It's, I view
myself as being within the family.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.030
I mean, I've done it for thirty years,
so if I didn't enjoy it, it would be really

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.030
a waste of time.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.120
But if you do care about something, then you
want it to work out well,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.270
and when it's not, you can either shut up,
in which case you shouldn't complain

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.990
about it,um, but if you don't like the way
it's going, then you probably should say

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.760
something and try to point out ways so that
your favorite aunt or uncle

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.480
could be goofy again and not such a, you know,
difficult, destructive person.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.520
&gt;&gt;Fred: Well, with that then, let's start
with the, uh, the,

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.630
what you view as the afflictions of copyright
or at least the ways

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.060
that copyright has gone a bit off the rails
in recent years.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.660
What would, what would you say were, are sort
of your top three, uh, ills

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.680
that you think need fixing?

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.680
&gt;&gt;Bill: Uh huh.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.690
Right right, at least it's not the ten plagues,
with Passover

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:06.690
coming soon.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.790
Let's see, three plagues, only three plagues,
three afflictions

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.440
&gt;&gt;Fred: Frogs, boils, locusts, what are they?

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.440
&gt;&gt;Bill: Right, right, right.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.480
Death of the firstborn, that's the real thing.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.209
So, one would be probably, uh, all of the
rhetoric that's used about

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.569
what copyright can do, should do, is doing,
um, and sort of,

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.870
the inability to get past that, the inability
to really have a rational discussion

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.800
about, uh, what we want copyright to be.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.730
Maybe the second affliction
would be that, huh, all too many policy believers

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.730
actually believe it.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.460
They actually believe all the things that
are said, and if you read some of the things

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.450
that are said, copyrights supposedly can do
everything but cure the sick,

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.890
and take care of global warming.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.520
So when something can do something like that,
um, then everyone wants to sign on.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.040
But if it can't do those things,
then people get disappointed.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.270
So it's sort of surprising that people
believe it can do all of those things.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.400
The third one might be,uh,
[takes deep breath] trade.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.640
That copyright is a trade issue, so, it's
always been

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.239
a trade issue in some ways.

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.680
The United States didn't protect English works
for the first hundred years, because it was

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.419
our national trade policy
not to, to be able to not pay English authors.

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.199
Um, but what's happened
since at least the mid-'80s, was that copyright

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:40.360
became part of our trade agreements,
conditioning, uh, benefits for uh, providing

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.830
effective and adequate protection
to U.S. works and it's become rigid.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.490
First of all, it's anti-democratic,
as the demonstrations and protests about ACTA

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.629
have, uh, have pointed out.

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:56.330
It's an anti-democratic way to make policy,
to have trade officials doing it,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.300
but once you do it, then it becomes rigid
and you can't go back,

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.300
unless you abrogate the trade agreement.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.479
So let's say, like, in an ideal world,
that policy makers were data driven, like

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:09.520
we are at Google, right?

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.240
You figure out
what it is you want to do, you've got the

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.479
data to support it, and then you go and do
it,

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:20.560
and if it doesn't work, you constantly iterate
and reiterate until you get it right.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.050
That's like a logical, rational way to do
things.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.999
But once things become, uh,
put into trade agreements, you know, you don't

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:30.669
have that flexibility any more.

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.539
You either have the choice of abrogating the
trade agreement, or not.

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:39.430
And the not part is living with things that
don't work.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.520
So, I'll give you an example.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.379
This is one that Hal Varian certainly has
provided a lot of good data on,

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:51.419
which is, what's the appropriate length of
copyright, and back in 1998,

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:57.189
when we extended it twenty more years, did
those twenty years lead

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:00.180
to any more works being created?

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.529
I mean, that was the argument.

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:04.759
The argument was, well, if we extend the term
of copyright

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:08.159
twenty more years, it's going to make people
create things

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:09.740
that they wouldn't create.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:16.240
Right, that's a factual statement
and it's one that you should be able to empirically

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.509
figure out.

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:20.649
And Hal
did really great work, you know, in figuring

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:22.580
that out.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.999
And the answer is "no",
it's not going to lead to the creation of

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:28.259
any more works at all.

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:29.259
And it hasn't.

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:33.559
&gt;&gt;Fred: Right, and it always struck me, the
notion that you tell an author today

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:40.689
that seventy years after you die, it's hard
to see that as highly motivating, uh,

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:43.499
in the moment, even without empirical data.

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:45.120
&gt;&gt;Bill: Right, so, so here's the fact situation.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.439
You're in 1998,
you're a policy maker, the existing term of

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:53.580
a copyright is
your life plus 50 more years, right?

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.389
And so the argument is
no, no, no, we need to incentivize people

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:00.530
more, if you give
20 more years to copyright, then you're going

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.210
to create
more works, and everyone will be happy.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.240
Well, that twenty more years,
of course, is tacked on to the end.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.479
So we're talking about somebody
say in 2012 sitting around saying, "Well,

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:11.839
what do I do today, you know?

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:15.750
Do I write another book, or do I take the
trash out, or find some

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.169
other way to make money."

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:21.639
Um, so in figuring out that, I think, how
long is

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:22.689
the copyright going to last?

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:27.050
Well, it lasts for my life, and I don't know
how long I am going to live but let's say

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.559
I'm thirty and I can expect to live
to be eighty, at least.

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:34.279
So that's fifty more years, and then you add
on fifty years

00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:35.279
after your death.

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:36.279
That's a hundred years.

00:07:36.279 --> 00:07:38.960
And you sit around and say,
"That's actually not long enough.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.050
I'm going to do something else, you know.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.160
[laughter] Fifty more years for while I'm
alive and fifty more after I'm dead,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.139
that's just not a sufficient incentive.

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:50.860
It's got to be seventy years
after I'm dead.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.050
It's got to be one hundred twenty years after
I'm dead."

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.699
&gt;&gt;Fred: This actually, suddenly I realize
that what you said a minute ago

00:07:56.699 --> 00:08:01.209
about copyright, can cure everything except
global warming.

00:08:01.209 --> 00:08:03.379
On that time
scale maybe we need to talk about whether

00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:06.649
copyright can cure global warming,
because maybe in a hundred and fifty years-

00:08:06.649 --> 00:08:07.649
&gt;&gt;Bill: It'd be long enough,it'd be long enough.

00:08:07.649 --> 00:08:08.649
&gt;&gt;Fred: Exactly, so-

00:08:08.649 --> 00:08:09.869
&gt;&gt;Bill: But if you look at it another way,
look at it from the standpoint

00:08:09.869 --> 00:08:10.949
of a publisher, right?

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:14.039
So the argument is, no, no, no, that's, you're
making

00:08:14.039 --> 00:08:19.949
this silly case, the real case is this, that
in 2012, a publisher is going to

00:08:19.949 --> 00:08:25.870
give you more money, right, for that work,
based upon it lasting seventy years

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:29.889
after you're dead rather than fifty, because
you don't know when you're

00:08:29.889 --> 00:08:34.919
going to die, but your publisher will, allegedly,
live forever, so right now

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:38.490
the present value is going to be more because
we're going to give you more.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:42.180
But, but that's not true either, if you talk
to publishers, no publisher

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:47.620
is going to give you more money today based
upon, allegedly, twenty more years,

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.620
you know a hundred years.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.330
Because we're talking about the difference
between

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.810
a hundred year copyright and a hundred and
twenty year copyright.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:58.530
And most works don't have any market, and
if they have a market,

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.340
it's not more than a year, two years, three
years, in my case,

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.090
you know, a few weeks.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.090
[laughter]
but..

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.090
&gt;&gt;Fred:Buy it now.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.090
Buy it now

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:08.090
&gt;&gt;Bill: The publishers don't give me more--.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.090
Buy it now, right.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.560
&gt;&gt; Fred: This brings me back to the first
two ailments you mentioned,

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:18.890
uh, of copyright, mainly what you view as
somewhat unrealistic rhetoric,

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.800
and the fact that policymakers seem to accept
it.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.410
And I'm curious, one of the main themes in
your book that you really decry

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:26.780
is this notion.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.220
Which really is, you know, often, you hear
it often at the heart

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.150
of the debates about copyright, is this notion
that copyright law

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.270
is necessary to create an incentive for creativity.

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:41.430
I mean that
really is a central story that copyright supporters

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:45.560
tell,
and you really take, take that notion to task.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.490
What's your sense
of why that's actually overselling what copyright

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:50.490
can actually deliver?

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:54.630
&gt;&gt;Bill: Right, so if I could go back to your
sports metaphor about, you know,

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.480
liking a sports team, whether it's the 49ers,
and I grew up in Marin,

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.690
so while I live in Connecticut, I'm still
a 49ers fan.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.730
You know when
you interview the losing coach, usually they

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:08.430
say something like,
"You know, we’re going to get back to basics.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:12.280
Learning the ball, throwing the ball, good
defense."

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.680
And I always think, well, aren't you supposed
to be doing that anyway?

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.040
[laughter] I mean, why is that going to be
something new,

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.270
that you're going to get back to the basics?

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.550
So if you're going to apply that
to copyright, what are the basics?

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.760
What do we actually want it to do?

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.310
And I don't think that law is an end to itself.

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:30.990
The goal is not to have laws.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:33.170
&gt;&gt;Fred: Don't tell politicians.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:34.170
&gt;&gt;Bill: Yeah, yeah.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:40.630
Well, when I went to work for Congress,
my father, who, uh, lives in Sonoma, but who's

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:44.040
really
a politically really conservative guy, was

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.570
deeply disappointed in me,
because he thought I was going to work for

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:55.990
an, you know, organization
that didn't do upstanding good things, and

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.960
passed too many laws,
and that they were there just to pass laws

00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.960
you know.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.960
That was their product.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.110
Their product was passing laws.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:07.230
So he said, "Look, if you're going to do any
of this copyright stuff, then any new law

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.000
you gotta
make sure that you repeal three others.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.940
[laughter] Otherwise,
you know, don't do it.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.990
Don't, don't give us more laws."

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:18.680
So, if you take that approach, that law is
actually

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:24.710
a tool and not an end to itself, it's a tool
to do things, hopefully, that only law can

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:25.710
do.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.690
Um, I don't think we want laws to do things
that laws

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:29.780
aren't supposed to do.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:34.720
Things that are business problems, right,the
solutions to business problems are business

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.720
problems.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.750
[chuckles] .
I mean, if you have a business problem, the

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:41.680
way to handle that
is to have a better business model, and not

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:46.970
to have a law
that supports a bad business model.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:51.580
So if you look at one of the basics
of copyright, you know the learning, throwing,

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.870
a good defense, right,
what's that supposed to be for copyright?

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:59.530
And so people say lots of things.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:03.430
One of the embarrassing things
is that no one can actually agree what copyright

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:04.430
is supposed to do.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:08.750
Um, and that makes rational policy making
pretty difficult when no one can

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.470
agree what it's supposed to do.

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:14.960
So if you want to have data driven,
rational driven copyright law, it would be

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.030
nice for everyone to agree
on what it's supposed to do, right?

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.610
Because you can't empirically test that,
you can't figure out whether it works if you

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:24.440
can't agree about what it's supposed to do.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:29.030
So, some of the things people say it's supposed
to do, is to prevent

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.920
free riding.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.880
That actually makes sense, I actually think
it can do that.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.540
If you have a motion picture that cost two
hundred million dollars to produce,

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:41.830
and someone else comes along and captures
all the investment on that,

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.220
that's something copyright could actually
do.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.520
That's a negative thing, though.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.190
That's actually stopping something.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:51.270
Now, the positive things
it's supposed to do are a little more difficult,

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.270
I think, to establish.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:55.580
One of which is to encourage creativity, right?

00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:01.090
So you say, the purpose of copyright
is to encourage creativity and we need creativity

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:06.080
because creativity
is necessary for culture, and therefore copyright

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.480
is necessary for culture.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.690
This is like a syllogism, uh, for that, and
so we all want culture,

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:15.060
therefore we all want creativity, and we need
copyright for that,

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:19.220
because without copyright, we won't have creativity
or culture.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:23.550
But, I'm, if you break down the syllogism,
I'm not really sure it's true.

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:30.890
I'm not actually sure that copyright causes
more creative works

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:32.960
to be created than otherwise would, right?

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.810
This is a "but for" argument, right?

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:39.430
But for copyright,
people wouldn't create creative things.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:43.020
This is leaving aside
the free riding argument, which is a different

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.020
one.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.941
And so,
I don't know, I don't know that the end, this

00:13:46.941 --> 00:13:49.770
is a question,
I don't have an answer, it's just a question.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:54.020
I don't know that when people are creating
things that they say

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:57.240
"well, my goal is to own a copyright."

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.420
I doubt that.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:03.100
I don't, I certainly think it's not true
that as consumers, we really care.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:09.030
Now, I'm an avaricious consumer, of cultural
works.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:13.420
I buy thousands of
dollars of sheet music and books, hard copy

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:14.420
books.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.950
I have ten year old twins who, you know, read
a lot, too.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:21.800
But I've never bought anything, or not bought
anything,

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.910
because it was under copyright and in the
public domain.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:25.920
I really don't care.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.340
It doesn't mean I don't care
about people getting paid, I do, but that's

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.480
a different question.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:34.460
I buy things because it has value for me,
and part of the value

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.220
is not whether it's under copyright.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:40.330
And I think that people
create things, not because they want to own

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.661
a copyright,
but because they want to create it, they want

00:14:43.661 --> 00:14:46.810
to make money,
they want to distribute their ideas, they

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:50.110
want to engage
in intellectual discussion with people.

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:53.730
Um, so I'm not sure that giving people longer
term copyright,

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:57.830
or stronger rights, is going to actually incentivize
people

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.130
to do things that they wouldn't.

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:03.940
Um, it's certainly not true that copyright
historically

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.960
has led to more diverse works.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.360
I mean, historically,
work that's sort of based on artificial scarcity,

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:15.050
and gatekeepers and the rule of copyright,
at least in the analog world,

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:20.600
was to make sure that those gatekeepers could
control the distribution

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.670
of physical copies and limit the number of
works and the prices that were,

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.340
that were out there.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:30.270
So I'm not sure it's demonstratively true
that it leads to creativity,

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:31.950
but it's an important question to ask.

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:36.170
It's an important thing
to figure out why people do stuff, um, so--

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.540
&gt;&gt;Fred: As I was reading the book, on that
point, I was really struck

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:44.100
by the notion that there's really two intended
beneficiaries here,

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.040
that may not actually be related.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.990
So, on the one hand,you have
the free riding question you mentioned.

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:52.230
I often talk
to movie executives who say, "well, it may

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:56.460
be really cheap
to go and record your own music nowadays,

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.780
or it might be
really cheap for you to write your own blog,

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:04.490
but it's not cheap
to create the kind of special effects extravaganzas

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:08.220
that draw people
into the theaters for the new Transformers

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.000
installment or what have you."

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
&gt;&gt;Bill: Hangover, part three.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000
&gt;&gt;Fred: Right.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.470
So the question is, I really wondered,
are we asking too much of copyright to serve

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:22.160
these two very different needs and communities?

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.279
I mean,
we need one thing for people to recoup these

00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:30.670
three hundred million dollar investments,
that require thousands of people to work together

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:34.940
in a coordinated way
to launch a movie, but then we also want copyright

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:40.780
to encourage, create incentives
for individual creators to write that next

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:44.940
song, or write that next book,
or write that next blog post.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.120
Is it your sense that we ought to somehow
have

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.780
two different systems, or do you think it's
compatible to have copyright

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:52.780
handle both sides?

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:53.780
&gt;&gt;Bill: Right.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.090
So I think that there's two different problems
here,

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:58.080
one of which is using the word creativity.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.750
So, when we talk about
creativity here, I think we're talking about

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.570
it in the colloquial sense.

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:09.880
We're talking about works that are interesting,
works that have some sort

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.589
of appeal, aesthetic appeal, emotional appeal,
something like that.

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:16.589
But that's not the sense that copyright uses
the word creativity.

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:22.169
So, one of the big things, one of the big
problems, the ailments as you said,

00:17:22.169 --> 00:17:27.530
is that when policymakers talk about encouraging
creativity through copyright law,

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:31.990
copyright law uses creativity in a totally
different way.

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:36.070
Creativity in copyright means
only that you didn't copy it from somebody

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:41.600
else and there's like a tiny bit
of something that somebody else , you know,

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.690
didn't do, or didn't do in the same way.

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:48.740
And the reason for that is, we don't want
judges to be arbiters of what's art.

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:54.350
We don't want judges to decide subjectively,
"this is a creative work, and this isn’t."

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:59.690
And so, from within the system of copyright,
that actually makes a lot of sense,

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:03.581
but when you use the same word in a colloquial
sense and say you want

00:18:03.581 --> 00:18:08.889
to encourage creativity, through copyright
law, you're using a totally different word

00:18:08.889 --> 00:18:09.889
to mean different things.

00:18:09.889 --> 00:18:15.190
So under copyright, we protect emails, perhaps
Twitter postings,

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:19.830
protect business documents, lawyers' cease
and desist letters, we protect virtually anything

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:24.110
that anyone creates, and we do it without
any formalities.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:28.850
So to say copyright law
encourages creativity sort of misses the point

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:34.149
that most works that are protected
under copyright are not works that are creative

00:18:34.149 --> 00:18:37.669
in the colloquial sense that we're debating.

00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:40.230
It's like using, well, I'll give you a great
example.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:42.270
&gt;&gt;Fred: You, you haven't been reading my emails,
Bill.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:43.270
[laughter]

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:44.270
Very, very creative.

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:45.270
&gt;&gt;Bill: All right.

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:47.929
[chuckles] So in 1990, I was still working
for Congress,

00:18:47.929 --> 00:18:52.330
and we wanted to protect architectural works,
the three dimensional buildings,

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:55.440
not plans or drawings because they were already
protected and we wanted to do it

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.600
because we had a treaty obligation to do it.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.090
You still had to make the case though,
to members of Congress why you should do that.

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:06.750
So I organized hearings, and I had
Michael Graves, who was a very famous architect

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:09.080
at the time,
we had the Frank Lloyd Wright estate, we had

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:14.509
a number of famous architects
come and explain why their works are creative,

00:19:14.509 --> 00:19:15.509
right.

00:19:15.509 --> 00:19:17.119
And you could get that.

00:19:17.119 --> 00:19:20.700
That was easy to see why they
re artists just like everybody else.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:25.629
The truth of the matter was, that most architectural
copyright infringement actions

00:19:25.629 --> 00:19:32.509
are over semi-custom or far, far lower works.

00:19:32.509 --> 00:19:37.950
So, you know, it was
a, you know, I don't know how to describe

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:38.950
it.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:44.450
[laughs] It was use of creativity
through famous architects to make a case why

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:48.690
we should do a general law
that applied to other works.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:54.039
And that's one of the problems with using
creativity in copyright as sort of a rallying

00:19:54.039 --> 00:19:58.529
cry, or as it can do something
is that you are using one case, that may be

00:19:58.529 --> 00:20:02.210
easy to prove, for ninety-nine percent of
the cases

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:05.489
that have very different policy issues.

00:20:05.489 --> 00:20:12.600
The second problem is that the scope of copyright,
the incentives that you would need for a 300

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.840
thousand dollar movie
are, uh, are they do fine in the market place.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:22.279
The stuff that we say that we want
are works that don't do well in the market

00:20:22.279 --> 00:20:23.279
place.

00:20:23.279 --> 00:20:26.999
And so, the problem saying
that copyright is going to solve everything

00:20:26.999 --> 00:20:31.809
is that it may solve free riding problems
for the expensive works, and should, but it

00:20:31.809 --> 00:20:36.520
doesn't do anything for the ninety-nine percent,
right?

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:42.169
Personally, um, we would be better taking
the hundreds of millions of dollars we use

00:20:42.169 --> 00:20:46.590
for enforcement,
and going to East Palo Alto and having something

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:49.629
like they have in Venezuela, El Sistema.

00:20:49.629 --> 00:20:54.389
If we really want to encourage creativity
among masses of people, other people, let's

00:20:54.389 --> 00:20:57.710
spend money to do it, because that's the only
way it's going to happen.

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:03.010
And if we don't do that, if we claim "don't
worry , we're going to give you a copyright",

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:04.010
that's baloney.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:05.010
&gt;&gt;Fred:mmm

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:08.671
&gt;&gt;Bill: I mean, I play bass clarinet, and
I'm trying to encourage more people

00:21:08.671 --> 00:21:11.580
to write more works for bass clarinet.

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.090
So if I go to them and say,
"Hey, guess what?

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:18.410
If you spend six months or a year writing
a new piece for bass clarinet,

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:21.259
at the end of that time, you're going to have
a copyright."

00:21:21.259 --> 00:21:23.149
No, I, … they'll laugh at me.

00:21:23.149 --> 00:21:26.860
There are other reasons for them to do it,
and copyright isn't one of them.

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:32.039
So if we want diverse cultural works, we have
to figure out ways outside of copyright to

00:21:32.039 --> 00:21:33.039
do it.

00:21:33.039 --> 00:21:35.390
It's not that it's a knock on copyright, it
isn't.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:38.970
It's that it can do some things,
but there's other things it can't do.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:43.249
And so if we fool ourselves into thinking
it can do everything,

00:21:43.249 --> 00:21:44.770
then it's just not.

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:45.770
It can't.

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:50.039
&gt;&gt;Fred: Alright, so your discussion about
extending copyrights to three dimensional

00:21:50.039 --> 00:21:53.019
works of architecture
reminds me that of, a lot of the discussion

00:21:53.019 --> 00:21:57.299
in your book reflects a disappointment, if
you will,

00:21:57.299 --> 00:22:03.789
in policy makers who have not demanded empirical,
factual support for expansions of copyright,

00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:08.570
who have not been more, I guess, discerning
customers when it comes to proposals.

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:13.419
Um, in fact, you used
a term in the book which I quite liked, you

00:22:13.419 --> 00:22:14.769
called it "lobbynomics."

00:22:14.769 --> 00:22:20.049
That rather than economics,
policy makers, too often, are swayed by "lobbynomics",

00:22:20.049 --> 00:22:22.419
by whatever the lobbyists come in and deliver.

00:22:22.419 --> 00:22:27.470
Um, so I guess as I was reading that, the
question came to me, do you feel like fixing

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:30.169
many
of many of the problems in copyright require

00:22:30.169 --> 00:22:34.869
us to first fix a larger flaw
in the political process?

00:22:34.869 --> 00:22:38.039
And, if so, that's a pretty tall order.

00:22:38.039 --> 00:22:40.779
Or do you think
that there's actually hope to make progress

00:22:40.779 --> 00:22:46.559
on copyright without fixing what
is viewed by a lot of people as a larger difficulty

00:22:46.559 --> 00:22:51.919
with communicating
empirical, fact driven analysis to Congress?

00:22:51.919 --> 00:22:57.970
&gt;&gt;Bill: Yeah, so I worked on Capitol Hill
for seven years, and I have, you know, some

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:04.650
experience,
with how members of Congress listen to issues,

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:07.759
and who they listen to and you know, things
have changed

00:23:07.759 --> 00:23:09.190
over time.

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:16.220
But once, when I was working for the copyright
office, this was in 1989, I was on this panel

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:19.700
in San Francisco with John Perry Barlow, one
of your friends.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:26.549
And it was, you know, it was 1989,
and there were a bunch of programmers who

00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:29.700
were very upset about software copyright.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.100
They thought
it was inappropriate, and I actually agree

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:38.190
with them, but it was an inappropriate thing
and they wanted me,

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:42.049
as a member of the government, to go fix it
for them.

00:23:42.049 --> 00:23:48.799
And I said," You know, unless
you get off your butt", I think I used a different

00:23:48.799 --> 00:23:52.220
word,
"and do something about it yourself, no, it's

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:54.289
not going to change."

00:23:54.289 --> 00:24:02.370
I grew up in Marin, and I was a child in the
'60s in Marin, and in

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:05.950
those days, there were actual protests about
stuff.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:12.340
I remember I went to the People's,
the second People's Park March, this was in

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.489
May of 1969.

00:24:13.489 --> 00:24:19.710
There was the first one in which Ed Meese,
this was when Reagan was governor,

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:24.590
we had him for eight years, eight or sixteen
years.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:26.980
[chuckles]
He was governor for eight years, then President

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:27.980
for eight
years.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:32.090
Ed Meese took over the police in, in Berkeley
and

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:35.789
and there was disputes about People's Park,
and he took over the police

00:24:35.789 --> 00:24:40.210
and during the protest, the police shot at
people, and one guy was killed,

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:45.159
another guy was blinded, and then two weeks
later there was a protest.

00:24:45.159 --> 00:24:50.809
A lot of people came, I came, you go over
to the East Shore Freeway,

00:24:50.809 --> 00:24:53.850
it's called the Bayshore Freeway, the whole
thing, I used to call it the East Shore,

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:57.419
but you go along that and you get on University
Avenue,

00:24:57.419 --> 00:25:01.539
and there's like that little cloverleaf there
and like right on top of the cloverleaf

00:25:01.539 --> 00:25:04.929
there was a big tank, because Reagan had called
out,

00:25:04.929 --> 00:25:07.460
like 2700 or so National Guardsmen.

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:11.289
And all along the way
there were these guns, and bayonets, like

00:25:11.289 --> 00:25:12.529
inches away from you and stuff.

00:25:12.529 --> 00:25:17.009
And you just prayed no one did anything really
stupid, and they didn't,

00:25:17.009 --> 00:25:22.619
but people did, did complain.

00:25:22.619 --> 00:25:24.869
Whether people listened or not, I know Johnson
didn't

00:25:24.869 --> 00:25:25.869
run again.

00:25:25.869 --> 00:25:30.039
But in 1989, people then said to me, "Well,
you know, you work in Washington,

00:25:30.039 --> 00:25:33.110
you're a government official, go fix it."

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:37.299
I said, "That's not the way this system works,
if you really don't like something, you've

00:25:37.299 --> 00:25:38.640
got to do it yourself.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:42.620
You have to make
your voice heard and only then will things

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:43.620
change."

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:44.620
&gt;&gt;Fred: So do you think-

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:45.620
&gt;&gt;Bill: It took twenty-three years,[laughs]

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:48.730
&gt;&gt;Fred: Do you think the most recent events
are a part of something like that?

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:52.739
&gt;&gt;Bill: That was too easy a transition for
you.[laughter] Yeah, yeah, it

00:25:52.739 --> 00:25:56.220
took twenty-three years, and things did change.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:01.521
So, I guess the point of my story is
that if you want things to change, then you

00:26:01.521 --> 00:26:02.521
have to do it yourself.

00:26:02.521 --> 00:26:06.110
&gt;&gt; Fred: You know as they used to say on the
radio, if you don't like the news, make some

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:07.110
of your own.

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:08.110
&gt;&gt; Bill: Yeah.

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:11.840
&gt;&gt; Fred: So before we open to questions, I
want shift from the the negative side of this,

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.940
there's
a lot in this book that you view as copyright's

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:19.789
failings, uh to some
of the sort of positive, uh, prescriptions,

00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:22.690
if you will,
for how you think things could be made better.

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:27.369
One of the things I noticed in particular
your emphasis on shifting

00:26:27.369 --> 00:26:31.269
from an analysis of exclusive rights, this
idea that copyright owners

00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:34.549
should be the only one who should be allowed
to make copies,

00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:39.019
or distribute the work, or publicly perform
it, to a system that focuses

00:26:39.019 --> 00:26:41.269
more on remuneration.

00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:44.330
Making sure that rights holders, and I guess
by extension,

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:49.590
creators themselves, are paid for what they
do even if they don't have exclusive control.

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:50.590
&gt;&gt; Bill: Mmm hmm.

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:53.759
&gt;&gt;Fred: I wonder, I mean, that’s, in some
ways, that's a real departure

00:26:53.759 --> 00:26:55.230
from traditional copyrights.

00:26:55.230 --> 00:27:00.470
Certainly, for the past hundred odd years,
formally, it has been about exclusive rights.

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:04.970
Umm, what do you say to creators
who say, "I would rather have the right to

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:10.549
say no, than the right to get paid
a few nickels and not have the right to say

00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:11.549
no?"

00:27:11.549 --> 00:27:15.049
&gt;&gt;Bill: Right, the short answer is, you can't
eat ideology.

00:27:15.049 --> 00:27:19.789
The longer answer is that
I don't, I don't regard the book as saying

00:27:19.789 --> 00:27:20.789
copyrights failed.

00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:22.179
That's sort of an anthropomorphic thing.

00:27:22.179 --> 00:27:26.179
I mean a law isn't a thing, you know, it doesn't
have feelings,

00:27:26.179 --> 00:27:28.210
can't hurt its feelings.

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:31.690
I don't think you can respect it in the sense
that you

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:32.690
can respect people.

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:34.850
It either works well, or it doesn't.

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:39.480
And it will work well
if it does the things it's supposed to do,

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.799
if it's fit for its purpose.

00:27:41.799 --> 00:27:46.320
And if it doesn't, then it's not working well,
and you need to change it.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:50.889
It's that simple, so it's not a sense of disappointment,
you know, you let me down,

00:27:50.889 --> 00:27:54.580
it's more like the coach thing, you know,
"we're going to get back to basics: throwing,

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.580
running,
good defense, you know."

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:59.419
We got to get back to, my point is, getting
people paid, right?

00:27:59.419 --> 00:28:04.649
If you want to encourage creativity, if you
want to have more works, I think a good way

00:28:04.649 --> 00:28:07.529
to do that is to make sure people get paid.

00:28:07.529 --> 00:28:13.629
So, in the past, the sort of model,
the conceptual model has been that control

00:28:13.629 --> 00:28:15.179
equals payment.

00:28:15.179 --> 00:28:18.919
That if I create something,
the only way I am going to get paid is if

00:28:18.919 --> 00:28:22.190
I can control most things about it.

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:27.869
I mean, the ideal in the golden age of cinema,
of movies, was of course complete control.

00:28:27.869 --> 00:28:32.830
You own the writers, you own the stars, you
own copyright and the movie, you own

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:35.859
the theaters, you own everything vertically.

00:28:35.859 --> 00:28:39.749
Now, that was a great system, and
Jack Valenti once gave this speech in which

00:28:39.749 --> 00:28:44.429
he bemoaned the Department of Justice
killing that system of control.

00:28:44.429 --> 00:28:49.230
But that was the model, the model was
control equals payment, and copyright is what

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:50.870
gave you control.

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:54.090
so, copyright equals control equals money.

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:56.320
In the end,
it was still about money, right?

00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:00.250
But the thought was that the only way
to get the money was to control it and the

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:03.409
only way to control it was through copyright.

00:29:03.409 --> 00:29:05.640
That was the system.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:11.179
It worked well, not well, good sometimes,
not other times, depending upon on well

00:29:11.179 --> 00:29:14.249
it matched business models and consumer demand.

00:29:14.249 --> 00:29:18.830
I mean, the one thing that copyright
can never do is to make people buy the stuff

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:19.830
they don't want.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:24.600
You know, if you take it as a coercive thing,
sure, maybe it can stop people from doing

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:28.600
things, but I think if you want to make money,
your approach has to be different.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.419
You have to give people things that they want.

00:29:31.419 --> 00:29:35.389
You want to make them do things,
you want to make them buy stuff, and copyright

00:29:35.389 --> 00:29:36.389
can't do that.

00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:39.970
Whatever else it can do,
I am a hundred percent convinced that it cannot

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:42.749
make people buy things they don't want to
buy.

00:29:42.749 --> 00:29:47.409
And that really should be the focus, if the
goal, to go back to the coach thing, if the

00:29:47.409 --> 00:29:49.249
goal is
to get people paid.

00:29:49.249 --> 00:29:56.820
Now in the past, having an analog world, having
artificial scarcity, and having copyright

00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:00.450
could get you a lot of that, but that's just
not true anymore.

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:04.049
You know it's not true, you can't,
you have a digital environment, you have digital

00:30:04.049 --> 00:30:06.779
abundance and you can't control it.

00:30:06.779 --> 00:30:14.399
So the idea that you're going to graft some
eighteenth, seventeenth century form of control

00:30:14.399 --> 00:30:19.710
onto a system that you don't have control
just really doesn't make sense to me.

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:24.559
So what you need to do is figure out a way
for people to get paid, 'cause that's the

00:30:24.559 --> 00:30:25.559
object.

00:30:25.559 --> 00:30:27.440
And it's good,
it's proper that people should get paid for

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.909
things that they create.

00:30:28.909 --> 00:30:31.779
The goal we should share, the question
is how you do it.

00:30:31.779 --> 00:30:35.090
And so what I think you have to do is give
up that idea

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:37.090
that copyright equals control.

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:39.640
Umm, because it's not there.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:44.929
Why invest so many resources
in something you can't do anyway?

00:30:44.929 --> 00:30:46.600
And do something else, and that something
else

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:51.960
is either abandon exclusive rights, for most
things, not for everything.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:56.609
If I write a novel, and a motion picture company
wants to make a motion picture out of it,

00:30:56.609 --> 00:30:57.609
then yeah.

00:30:57.609 --> 00:30:59.109
Those sort of one to one things you can still
do.

00:30:59.109 --> 00:31:02.950
But I think what people are most upset about
is not those one to one things, because those

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:04.429
one to one things still work.

00:31:04.429 --> 00:31:05.820
It's the other stuff.

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:09.789
So the other stuff has to be handled differently,
either through compulsory licenses,

00:31:09.789 --> 00:31:16.580
through tariffs, through collective administration
of rights, through Creative Commons licenses,

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:17.580
whatever else.

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:23.090
So I think we actually do have to shift from
a rule, from a model of control

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:25.950
to a model of payment instead.

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:29.429
So if you really want to say, "I really care
about my ideology,

00:31:29.429 --> 00:31:35.259
it's mine and you can't use it," that was
nice, but I don't think it actually works

00:31:35.259 --> 00:31:37.909
anymore,
and so you can't take that to the bank.

00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:40.760
And I'd rather you can take something to the
bank instead.

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:46.729
&gt;&gt;Fred: So, anyone want to ask for questions,
while we get the mic to somebody, I will just

00:31:46.729 --> 00:31:51.169
ask you quickly to say, tell us what is on
your sweatshirt, because I was very curious

00:31:51.169 --> 00:31:52.169
to learn it.

00:31:52.169 --> 00:31:53.169
&gt;&gt;Bill: Right , right, right.

00:31:53.169 --> 00:31:55.440
So MPCS means mouthpieces, clarinet mouthpieces.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.899
A friend of mine,
Jim Kanter, who's from Woodland Hills was

00:31:58.899 --> 00:32:01.919
going to be here today, but his wife got sick,
so I had this t-shirt

00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:08.380
made up for him, he makes these truly mystical
mouthpieces so that you feel like you're

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.679
not actually playing on a physical thing.

00:32:11.679 --> 00:32:15.999
He made his living, talk about getting paid,
he had a career

00:32:15.999 --> 00:32:19.210
in Hollywood, he was a film studio musician.

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:24.100
He was in over a thousand movies and television
ads,

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:25.840
and stuff like that.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:26.881
&gt;&gt;Fred: There you go.

00:32:26.881 --> 00:32:27.881
&gt;&gt;Bill: He's a really cool guy.

00:32:27.881 --> 00:32:28.881
&gt;&gt; Fred: Question?

00:32:28.881 --> 00:32:31.989
&gt;&gt;male #1: Hi. [coughs] I am intrigued by
your prescription for how we can

00:32:31.989 --> 00:32:35.340
change the model for copyrights, and I look
forward to reading that,

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:39.779
but looking at a different dimension of the
copyright issue,

00:32:39.779 --> 00:32:43.989
there's the battle between the content, the
big content companies like Disney that will

00:32:43.989 --> 00:32:48.809
stop at nothing to make sure that Mickey Mouse
and all subsequent works are in perpetual

00:32:48.809 --> 00:32:52.710
copyright,
and Google where we want to, Google for example,

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:58.309
where we want to scan orphaned works
into Google books and can't find the rights

00:32:58.309 --> 00:33:00.009
holders to get permission for that.

00:33:00.009 --> 00:33:01.989
Do you
think it would be possible to strike a compromise

00:33:01.989 --> 00:33:07.929
between big media and the copyright freedom
movement

00:33:07.929 --> 00:33:13.880
that copyrights would be renewed periodically
by rights holders and allow other works would

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.320
be allowed
to lapse into public domain over time?

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.320
&gt;&gt;Bill: Right.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:21.099
So Disney, one thing about the debate, I don't
actually view it

00:33:21.099 --> 00:33:25.129
as big media companies versus others,
or authors versus users.

00:33:25.129 --> 00:33:29.289
I mean, Disney has benefited
a lot from the public domain.

00:33:29.289 --> 00:33:33.429
Most of its earlier famous works were based
on public domain stuff.

00:33:33.429 --> 00:33:36.580
Bambi, based on Felix Salten's work.

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:41.750
Um, the, uh Fantasia,
they were able to use Stravinsky's 'Rite of

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:44.159
Spring'
because it was in the public domain here.

00:33:44.159 --> 00:33:49.789
So I think everyone would benefit from having
access to works earlier.

00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:56.220
How to do that, I agree with your
approach, and that's this: we had, in the

00:33:56.220 --> 00:34:01.350
United States, until either 1978 for most
works,

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:08.810
or 1992 for others, a system that actually
was amazingly great

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:12.260
at giving market signals for the worth of
things.

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:17.090
So if you want to approach this question empirically,
in a data driven way,

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:23.650
you would try to figure out
how long does the market itself say the commercial

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:27.020
value of a work is, right?

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.840
And there's lots
of different ways you can do this.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.612
You can look at certain books
in print, you can look and see

00:34:30.612 --> 00:34:33.240
how long certain books are in print.

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:37.470
Or you can do what the gentleman was suggesting,
is look at formalities.

00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:43.060
So, in the United States,
we had a system where you had variously, say,

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:49.620
an original twenty-eight year term of copyright,
if you wanted a longer term of copyright,

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:54.490
you had to file a renewal request with the
U.S. copyright office,

00:34:54.490 --> 00:34:57.120
and if you did that, you'd get another twenty-eight
years.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:01.960
So if you ask people now, you know, well,
you get a twenty-eight year monopoly and for

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.820
three bucks
and filling out a simple government form,

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:09.090
you're going to get another twenty-eight years,
most people, you would think, would

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:10.090
say "yeah, sure.

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:12.000
I'll take the other twenty-eight years.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.520
It doesn't harm me,
it's not a lot of work to do, the transactional

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.020
costs aren't high to get the twenty-eight
years."

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:22.360
But the actual data shows that most people
didn't do it.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:27.740
For almost a hundred years, the data was uniform
that the renewal rate was

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.850
fifteen percent.

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:34.470
Now this is actually a much smaller subset
of copyright works

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:36.930
because most works were never registered in
the first place.

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:41.370
And if you break it down
by type of work, motion pictures had the largest

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:43.900
renewal rate seventy-four percent.

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.930
Books had seven percent renewal rate, right?

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:50.850
So ninety-three percent of the books,
the twenty-eight year term of copyright was

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:51.850
quite enough.

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:54.981
And it wasn't that
book publishers were lazy, it's that they

00:35:54.981 --> 00:36:00.510
made a rational economic decision
that the economic value of their work was

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:02.390
over, after twenty-eight years.

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:07.100
So in a rational system, you would take those
market signals, you wouldn't have one size

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:09.970
fits all,
which doesn't make sense anyway, I mean if

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:14.530
the market evidence shows you
that there's seven percent for books and seventy-four

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:18.390
percent for motion pictures,
motion pictures might get a longer term than

00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:19.490
books would.

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:24.970
But by having this requirement,
that you need to renew your interest in works,

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:29.860
we cut out a lot of works where there
was no interest, and for those works where

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:32.700
there was interest, you could go to those
people

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:33.700
and license it.

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:37.300
So I actually think, in response to your question,
it's a really great idea,

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.080
and we should do it again.

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:42.710
To go back to the trade policy issue, we can't,
[laughs] unless

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:44.620
we abrogate a bunch of treaties.

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:48.550
And that's the danger, I think, of treaties.

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:53.910
They take away what we at Google take for
granted, which is that we can change

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:55.580
things that don't work.

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.220
And it's not a great system where you can't
change things

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:00.760
that don't work.

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.790
&gt;&gt;Fred: Question up front here.

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:03.790
.

00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:04.790
&gt;&gt; male #2: Sorry

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:05.790
&gt;&gt;Fred: It's on

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:06.790
&gt;&gt;Bill: And I can hear you anyway...

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:07.790
&gt;&gt;male #2: Okay.

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:10.710
I disagree with you that copyright does not
promote creativity,

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:15.770
because we are in very lucky industry, because
we can make things work like Google work,

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:18.770
or
Windows work, or IOS work without having to

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:20.790
open source our code.

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:24.240
But if you can [inaudible] books,
there is no way they can keep their source

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:28.790
closed while giving people their, uh, work.

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:36.250
So, we don't have to resort to copyright law
to keep our source closed, sorry, keep our

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:38.180
code closed,
but they have to.

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:43.050
So we should understand that they need protection,
by law that we can protect

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:47.840
by our business means.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:52.171
So if we had to open source our code to make
our things work, do you think

00:37:52.171 --> 00:37:55.470
we would be working here in Google today?

00:37:55.470 --> 00:38:02.310
&gt;&gt;Bill: Well see, I've been here five and
half years, I would say, and the books project

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:04.510
was going
on before that.

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:09.230
I would think that for any partner, we have
to understand what their needs are.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:17.230
And one of the things about copyright is,
as I mentioned, it's a one size fits all problem.

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:24.430
And books, I've been publishing books on copyright
since 1985, and I have a number of different

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:26.480
publishers,
and I have great relations with them and I

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:30.540
think they are making really great efforts
to try to figure things out.

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:34.520
And it's really quite generational, so I have
a ten year old daughter.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:43.400
And she reads a lot and she reads hard copy
and she reads Kindle, too, but she will take

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:50.580
her Kindle to bed to read at night, but she
won't take hard copy book to read at night.

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:57.240
So if we're trying to figure out
what the best business approach is, um, you

00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:08.030
know, I would say the copyright issues,
though while important, I think ultimately

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:14.110
figuring out what's the best market solution
for things is going to get us a lot farther.

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:15.820
Fred, do you have anything to say to that?

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:20.150
&gt;&gt;Fred: I actually also think it's really
interesting, because to some extent, books

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:22.010
actually are closed source.

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:28.290
In the sense that they are expensive to duplicate
and distribute in paper,

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:34.450
and yet you see the ease, the places where
your written word, focusing on books

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:36.800
is kind of missing the point.

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.880
If you look at the places where the written
word is most easily copied,

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:42.640
that has to be stuff that starts digital already.

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:48.270
So if you look at the enormous outpouring
of original writing going on on blogs, for

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:53.150
example, I think it's fair to say
that today more written words are written,

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:58.450
more people write, in the medium that is less
protected, um,

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:00.570
from easy copying.

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:05.970
And so, to some extent, empirically, I wonder
if your observation actually bears out,

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:11.950
because what you find is the folks who insist
on, publishers for example, of paper books,

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:15.670
who have been very reluctant to put their
books in digital form,

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:19.520
and have sort of come slowly to the e-book
solution revolution and things like that.

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:24.320
It turns out actually in a region of less
control, the Internet, people actually write

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.320
more.

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:30.160
So if creativity is what you're worried about,
you could have arguments about, well,

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:33.480
those people maybe aren't being paid as much,
or those people, I mean, there's lots of other

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:39.320
arguments you could have, but on a pure question
of where are the people creating,

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:43.760
they are creating more, in less protected
areas, than they are in more protected areas.

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:44.760
That's just me.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:45.760
That's been my experience.

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:49.340
&gt;&gt;Bill: Or and Cory Doctorow does his books,
too.

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:51.420
&gt;&gt;Fred: Yeah, there's plenty of folks-

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:52.420
&gt;&gt;Bill: And you can download his books for
free.

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:54.440
&gt;&gt;Fred: And there are plenty of authors now,
shouldn't say plenty.

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:58.650
There are some authors
now who publish on paper and digitally for

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:02.330
free using Creative Commons license at the
same time.

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:08.100
And that seems, O'Reilly, Tim O'Reilly has
some great stories about, he gives away some

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:12.130
of his books
for free online, and finds that those books

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:15.490
actually make more money for his publishing
company,

00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:17.410
than the ones he doesn't.

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:20.800
Because of the effect of people hand them,
you know, hand to hand,

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:25.940
more people see them, more people are exposed,
and granted, his publishing is mostly

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:28.340
technical manual type material.

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:30.901
So someone sees it, they like it, they decide
they want

00:41:30.901 --> 00:41:34.810
to have it on their shelf as a reference,
they buy it, um, and maybe that's not true

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:36.680
for a novel
or something like that.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.010
But it just goes to show there are a lot of
places where the intuition,

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:45.920
and copyright too often, I think, suffers
from, and Bill's book makes this point, from

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:51.320
a kind of untested intuitive reasoning
rather than from actual empirics.

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:56.130
And the untested intuitive reasoning is well,
you know as, uh, I guess it's, who is who

00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:58.360
said "Only a blockhead would write for-"

00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.360
&gt;&gt;Bill: Johnson, Sam

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.160
&gt;&gt;Fred: Samuel Johnson said "Only a blockhead
would write for free."

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:06.200
Um, in fact, you find, lots of people
write for free for all kinds of reasons and

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:07.200
&gt;&gt;Bill: Including him by the way

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.340
&gt;&gt;Fred: Including him, exactly.

00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:13.000
You really want to test empirically, do you,
do publishers

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.450
really need copyright?

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:17.550
How do publishers do who don't use copyright?

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:22.030
What actually happens in these markets
and a lot of the answers might be surprising,

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:24.320
and if they're not surprising, I'd be happy
to learn that, too.

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:28.420
&gt;&gt;Bill: It really is asking the questions,
not prejudging to say, "Oh, I really know

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.050
copyright's not necessary."

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:31.580
It is necessary for stuff.

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:35.270
We've got to figure out what it's necessary
for, and what it's not.

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:38.620
You know,
the intuitive stuff is where we get into trouble.

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:41.790
I'd have these arguments with my mother, and
at the end,

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:43.640
she'd say,"Don't confuse me with the facts."

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:47.090
[laughter] And I'd go, I'd like to be confused
by them.

00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:48.530
&gt;&gt;Fred: Brad?

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:53.760
&gt;&gt;Brad: Umm, I've,yes, as Fred knows, I've
written a bunch about this and there's sort

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:58.100
of a, just to get to one question,
I do believe that the investors that are putting

00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:02.700
the hundreds of millions together
do actually want a copyright as their goal,

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:05.770
as you said the writer isn't saying "today
I want to get a copyright,"

00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:08.720
but I think those investors actually are,
so there is a fair point to that.

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:11.310
But I want to get
to one of the central issues that I haven't

00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:16.720
found a good solution for, and that is,
having a powerful fourth estate in a world

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.090
without copyright.

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:23.120
Um, you know, the Martha Grahams of the world,
who become billionaires on publishing, or

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:26.310
the New York Times,
and then she is able to take on a president

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:27.770
with her power.

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:30.570
The huge money she made, she's able to take
on

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:35.600
and take down a president using that power,
and the world of the blogosphere, where people

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:37.790
will indeed
write news for free.

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:42.080
They'll report the news, they'll cover things
that the major news media don't find,

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:46.480
perform a very very valuable role, but having
powerful rich media who've been able

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:50.590
to build a business empire based on selling
that information in the past,

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:55.180
based, not so much on copyright when it was
not online, but today more based on it.

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:59.100
How do we preserve
those, have those people that can be so rich

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:02.890
by having that control, and then can take
on presidents and serve society?

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:07.770
&gt;&gt;Bill: I think that the Washington Post makes
most of its money off of Kaplan.

00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:12.490
&gt;&gt;Brad: So, I am certain that's true, but
unless you want to claim that the news media

00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:16.350
make no use
of copyright, and do not, and are not in the

00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:22.120
in fact seeing their decline because
of their inability to use the same business

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:24.130
models that they had in the paper world.

00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:29.920
&gt;&gt;Fred: It's intriguing, because I'm thinking,
there's a chapter in here about that very

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:30.920
question.

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:31.920
…

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:32.920
&gt;&gt;Bill: Yeah, long chapter..
[laughter]

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:33.920
&gt;&gt;Brad: I am sorry for not reading the book
first.

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:34.920
&gt;&gt;Bill: about newspapers.

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:36.430
So, if I can go back to the motion picture
one,

00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:44.480
um, motion picture companies certainly make
money off of licensing, and copyright

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:47.420
is a significant part of that licensing.

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:52.450
So there's secured interests and there's presells,
and there's regional agreements, so

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:54.580
&gt;&gt;Brad: The story of George Lucas is quite
famous in that regard.

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:55.580
&gt;&gt;Bill: Sure.

00:44:55.580 --> 00:45:00.220
So it does play a role in those things, I
will say, however, that the part about--

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:02.950
that it still doesn't create value.

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:05.840
That's another one of those intuitive things
that I don't think is true.

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:10.000
No one's going to go to a lousy movie because
it's copyrighted.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.810
People are going to go to a great movie
because they think it's inherently great.

00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:17.030
&gt;&gt;Brad: But the idea of copyright is, if there
is value

00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:18.030
&gt;&gt;Bill: Right.

00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:19.030
&gt;&gt;Brad: Copyright lets you protect it.

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:20.540
&gt;&gt;Bill: That's the free riding part, that's
the free riding part,right.

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:23.320
So the mistake, however, I think, is that
copyright

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:29.240
by itself creates value, whereas, at least
to me, it's the market and consumer demand

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:33.250
that create value and copyright, as you
were pointing out, plays a role in creating

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:35.840
it, once there.

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:40.420
I think the mistake is that if I own a bunch
of copyrights, it's really valuable, and the

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:44.440
mistake becomes important when it's a policy
issue, right?

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:51.540
Now copyright can lead to greater competition,
and the knowledge economy is based upon competition,

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:55.050
and knowledge economy needs copyright.

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:59.290
Those sort of syllogism that aren't, that
aren't quite there.

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:00.290
That's my only point.

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:02.349
I certainly agree it's significant for licensing.

00:46:02.349 --> 00:46:04.510
&gt;&gt; Brad: To the, to the question of the news?

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:12.250
&gt;&gt;Bill: Yeah, you know, I would say, the way
the question is phrased is not one I am comfortable

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:13.250
answering.

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:14.250
&gt;&gt;Brad: Okay.

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:19.810
&gt;&gt; male #3: I want to follow up on what you
said about making sure that content creators

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:22.600
get paid, rather than make sure they have
exclusive rights.

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.930
Now, it's fair to say I should read the book,
okay,

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:29.910
so I'll accept that answer, but otherwise,
are you suggesting something like ASCAP or

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:34.271
BMI where your stuff
is owned by some central agency that will

00:46:34.271 --> 00:46:37.370
license it for you and sends you a check periodically
or, or what?

00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:42.060
&gt;&gt;Bill: So there's a lot of discussion right
now about copyright registries,

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:45.230
and about collective administration of rights.

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:49.910
In Europe, they're already very far that way
in ways

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:54.860
that maybe some people don't like so, if I'm
a composer in Europe, I have to license my

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:58.240
work collectively,
I don't have the option, as I do here in the

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:04.290
United States, of not going to ASCAP or BMI,
and doing it directly.

00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:11.840
There certainly have been issues of transparency
in some collecting societies in Europe,

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:15.320
and even occasionally corruption, as well.

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:20.090
With some Mediterranean societies being raided
by the police, [chuckles]

00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:22.750
and stuff like that.

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:27.790
But the basic model for ASCAP and BMI I still
think makes sense.

00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:31.400
Which is that you,
as a creator, can't go around to every bar

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:35.190
and restaurant or broadcaster throughout the
country

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:36.190
&gt;&gt;Fred: Or website

00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:38.540
&gt;&gt;Bill: Or website and spend your time licensing.

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:43.280
It's really an issue for, say, photographers,
as well.

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:48.900
My point is that, yeah, we do need to go to
something like that, simply because it's the

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:53.760
only probable way
that people can get paid.

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:58.950
And one of the things that many people are
working on the registry area is,

00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:02.550
of course, something that we do very well,
which is building a data base.

00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:04.090
&gt;&gt;Fred: Just a, just

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:09.180
&gt;&gt;Bill: mm, who, who owns what rights?That's
got to be the first thing, who owns the rights?

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:14.840
What are the terms of it, is it time limited,
is it regionally limited,

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:17.660
is it limited to the sound recording, not
the musical thing.

00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:21.310
So I know there are
a lot of people doing a lot of work on that

00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:24.870
and I think it's an idea that has come to
be accepted

00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:27.110
by a lot of content owners as well.

00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:31.120
That the only way we're going to get people
paid is to first build a data base

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:36.990
of who owns what, and then it can be cleared
and then the second step is the sort of automatically

00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:38.560
licensing thing that
you're talking about.

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:42.510
I mean CCC paved the way for a lot of that
step.

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:45.810
&gt;&gt;Fred: That's Copyright Clearance Center
here in the United States.

00:48:45.810 --> 00:48:50.620
&gt;&gt;Bill: Yep, and also Creative Commons has
done a lot of work concerning those.

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:52.030
So I think it's a two step thing.

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:56.760
The first step is building a database of who
owns what, and the second step is using that

00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:00.220
database
to allow people to license things, or setting

00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:04.000
up micropayments, or other ways of doing it.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.830
There are a lot of people
who are doing work on that, even at Google

00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:07.830
too.

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:10.660
&gt;&gt;Fred: And there's a, I just want to point
out, there's a lot of situations where that

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:13.360
kind of solution
happens already.

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:18.720
And, uh, YouTube comes to mind for example,
where the major record labels,

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:23.550
and a number of independents as well, have
granted YouTube licenses essentially to their

00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:26.320
entire catalogs,
there's some exceptions and this and that,

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:30.740
but the general way it works is that, you
know, a user,

00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:37.190
a YouTube user can upload a video with a song
as the soundtrack without the user having

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:40.660
to figure out
who owns it, without clearances, without any

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:42.890
of those transactional headaches.

00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:47.530
The rights holder is compensated
based on advertising that appears around the

00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:52.970
video, and that is, in a way, a sort of collective
approach,

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:59.420
almost like a blanket license that works well
enough in practice to actually be a win for

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:00.420
everybody.

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:03.850
A win for users who get to post what they
like, a win for rights holders who get paid,

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:07.120
and it's a win for Google
because we get a piece of that revenue as

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:08.120
well.

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:12.150
So, some of that can happen without waiting
for, I agree,

00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:16.980
it is ridiculous that it is so difficult to
figure out who owns what, and we do need to

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.110
solve that problem.

00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:23.940
But we don't need to wait for the perfect
utopian registry in order to get started.

00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:24.940
&gt;&gt;Bill: Right.

00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:26.920
&gt;&gt;Fred: We need to get there, but at the same
time.

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:27.920
Other-

00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:33.960
&gt;&gt;Bill: We are participating in European Union
GRD, the Global Rights Database, and there's

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:38.840
been a lot of work done
internally on that, with rights holders to

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:40.700
make it happen.

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:41.930
&gt;&gt;Fred: Another question?

00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:42.930
Yes?

00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:48.490
&gt;&gt;female #1: How do you feel about the Twin
Books Ruling for the Ninth Circuit Court?

00:50:48.490 --> 00:50:49.490
Is that even--

00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:50.490
&gt;&gt;Bill: Insane.

00:50:50.490 --> 00:50:51.490
&gt;&gt;female#1: Insane?

00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:52.490
Okay, I am glad I am not alone in that!

00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:55.250
&gt;&gt;Fred: For the benefit of the audience, you
might want to say a little bit about what

00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:56.640
Twin Books is and why

00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:00.000
&gt;&gt;Bill: Well, Fred is an old Ninth Circuit
Clerk of course

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.950
&gt;&gt;Fred: Not my fault.

00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:03.690
It wasn't decided when I was there.

00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:04.690
[laughter]

00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:05.690
&gt;&gt;Bill: Yeah, right, right.

00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:11.420
So here's the, this is highly technical issue
but it's how Fred and I make a living,

00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:14.750
so, you can't begrudge us that, I hope.

00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:16.910
So here's the issue.

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:24.950
There was under a prior law,
the 1909 Act, a requirement that for a foreign

00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:29.470
work to be subject to copyright, you had to
put a copyright notice

00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:30.470
on it.

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:33.250
Now we were the only county in the world that
had that requirement

00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:36.760
&gt;&gt;Fred: That's the, That's the "C" in a circle
with your name and date.

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:39.100
&gt;&gt;Bill: the "C" in a circle and copyright
date, or like the motion pictures did, they

00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:42.510
used the Roman letters
so you can't figure out what year it is.

00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:45.540
I still can't figure out what year it is,
but they're doing it so that

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:50.960
they comply with it, but nobody knows this
was last year's movie, right, right.

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:52.230
That's the purpose for that.

00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:58.210
Um so, yeah,even though I studied Latin in
school, I still can't figure it out.

00:51:58.210 --> 00:52:02.120
So there's this requirement,
that if you were a German author, you need,

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:05.970
you needed to have put that notice on it.

00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:08.720
If you put it on, then things
were great.

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:13.650
You had a copyright in the United States,
leaving aside other things like the manufacturing

00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:16.270
clause,
but you had your copyright in the United States.

00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:18.370
That was true for U.S. authors, too, by the
way.

00:52:18.370 --> 00:52:23.470
We had to put a copyright notice on, and if
we didn't, it went into the public domain,

00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:25.410
meaning there was no copyright.

00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:31.530
So, what happened if a foreign work didn't
put that copyright notice on,

00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:32.600
the EASY answer--

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:33.610
&gt;&gt;Fred: And it was published overseas?

00:52:33.610 --> 00:52:36.480
&gt;&gt;Bill: It was published overseas.

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:41.530
The easy answer, the textual answer would
be, it's in the public domain too

00:52:41.530 --> 00:52:47.780
right, after all, if you get copyright by
doing it, and you don't do it, then the logical

00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:51.930
thing is you suffer
the consequences because you got the good

00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:54.380
and that's what the statute says.

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:58.300
That, of course, is not
what the Ninth Circuit did.

00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:04.630
They created this sort of weird hybrid which
is that, well,

00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:11.690
it wasn't protected, but it wasn't unprotected
quite either.

00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:15.450
And so that has caused lots of problems.

00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:19.290
One of them is, causes problems for anyone
trying to figure out whether a foreign work

00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:21.660
is in the public domain or not.

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:25.480
It also caused problems, because when I worked
for Congress in 1994,

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:33.190
we passed this law, the GATT, General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trades, which took out,

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:39.380
from the public domain, these foreign works
that hadn't complied that obligation.

00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:44.730
And, that was upheld by the Supreme Court
quite recently.

00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:49.260
I know a lot of people don't like it,
but I personally was relieved that a statute

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:51.410
that I wrote wasn't found unconstitutional.

00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:54.540
Small matter of pride.

00:53:54.540 --> 00:54:01.700
[laughter] Not a popular one within the company,
but you know, it was my own.

00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:03.710
So that law actually took care
of the situation.

00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:08.320
It said, "look if you are this foreign person
and you didn't really realize it, it's okay,

00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:11.650
we're giving it back to you and you have the
same term of protection you would have otherwise

00:54:11.650 --> 00:54:13.910
had."

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:16.210
But no,
that's not what the Ninth Circuit did, and

00:54:16.210 --> 00:54:18.070
that's a problem that we live with a lot.

00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:19.660
&gt;&gt;Fred: Yeah, the Google Books team

00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:21.450
&gt;&gt;Bill: How do you engineer that?

00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:24.110
How do you engineer something say, we can
actually engineer

00:54:24.110 --> 00:54:28.290
pretty easily for U.S. works whether it's
in the public domain or not.

00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:35.060
But how do you actually have the next level,
oh, if it's a foreign work and you have an

00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:37.170
insane Ninth Circuit decision, what do you
do?

00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:39.730
That's not an easy engineering problem.

00:54:39.730 --> 00:54:43.830
&gt;&gt;Fred: Are there, another question?

00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:48.970
&gt;&gt;male #4: So it seems like there's a lot
of pressure to have these laws

00:54:48.970 --> 00:54:51.160
around copyrights, sort of.

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:54.510
Like the one that comes to mind is DMCA, where
even the copyright

00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:57.120
technically allows you do to something, but
then you have another law based around the

00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:00.430
enforcement
that takes the right back away, like you're

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:02.610
allowed to use fair use, but I can't format
shift

00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:05.120
because I'm not allowed to break the encryption
on the work or something

00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:06.480
&gt;&gt;Bill: Anti-circumvention stuff

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:11.650
&gt;&gt;male #4: And it seems like SOAP and PIPA
were sort of another play in that direction

00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:13.300
a little bit.

00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:16.190
Do you think the conversations getting a little
bit away from copyright and they're sort of

00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:19.170
doing an end run around it or, that's an unhealthy
thing or

00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:23.850
&gt;&gt;Bill: I think what you are referring to
is this chapter twelve, and title seventeen

00:55:23.850 --> 00:55:28.050
is really technically
not a copyright thing, but it's used that

00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:31.160
way, and I agree with your point.

00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:35.930
The point would say,
I can engage in satire and parody because

00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:41.610
it's fair use, but if there's this code, that's
deemed a

00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:47.550
technological protection measure and I need
to break that code to engage in parody or

00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:50.230
fair use,
it's an independent violation.

00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:55.180
&gt;&gt;Fred: This is the classic reason why you
can rip your own CDs onto your IPod, but you

00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:56.770
can't rip
your DVDs onto your IPod.

00:55:56.770 --> 00:55:57.770
&gt;&gt;Bill: Right.

00:55:57.770 --> 00:56:02.521
&gt;&gt;Fred: Because the latter, DVDs, have a technological
protection measure, and you would have to

00:56:02.521 --> 00:56:06.220
break it
in order to copy it onto your IPod so, different

00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:07.220
answer.

00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:10.150
&gt;&gt;Bill: I mean, the greatest use of it, as
Fred and I were talking about earlier today,

00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:15.410
is not for that sort of stuff,
but in controlling consumer product features.

00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:18.310
That's how it was originally written, and
to me, it's sort of, it's very

00:56:18.310 --> 00:56:24.210
medieval, it's like medieval moats and stuff,
and it's like giving someone, like giving

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:28.210
some guy the right to put a chastity
belt on somebody else's wife, you know.

00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:29.750
It doesn't really make sense.

00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:33.670
[laughter] I mean , copyright
has always had to do with technology, this

00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:37.910
is true, but it's always dealt with a use
of technology

00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:42.810
positively or negatively, with the ultimate
consumer or the author.

00:56:42.810 --> 00:56:48.710
And what these anti-circumvention things do
sort of cross the Rubicon, to use another

00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:54.050
ancient metaphor, of giving control over what
third parties do.

00:56:54.050 --> 00:56:57.160
And, personally, I would love to have those
repealed.

00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:03.070
I think they don't make sense, but again,
they are in so many trade agreements now,

00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:04.070
that it would be really hard.

00:57:04.070 --> 00:57:07.170
Let's say that we just
decided we were wrong and it's really a stupid

00:57:07.170 --> 00:57:13.110
thing to do, it's anti-consumer,
it harms markets, it harms like everything

00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:15.140
it touches, it's radioactive.

00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:17.250
There's nothing we can do
about it.

00:57:17.250 --> 00:57:22.160
Because we'd have to abrogate all these treaty
agreements, and that's a huge problem.

00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:26.530
They're not only anti-democratic, but they
stop us from fixing our mistakes.

00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:30.890
&gt;&gt;Fred: So I think we're about, do we have
time for one more?

00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:31.890
&gt;&gt;male #5: Yeah.

00:57:31.890 --> 00:57:32.890
&gt;&gt;Fred: Great.

00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:36.320
&gt;&gt;male #6: Okay, I have a question that segues
off this but also gets back

00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:39.060
to an earlier discussion around creativity.

00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:44.480
Just, I have a number of friends who are deejays,
and video editors, and a big trend, especially

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:50.200
on YouTube, is to kind of take existing songs
out there and mash them up and remix them,

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:52.791
in a way where you actually create a new work,
and as well

00:57:52.791 --> 00:57:54.910
with video as well.

00:57:54.910 --> 00:58:00.500
And I was wondering what your thoughts are
on perhaps on how we could help move

00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:06.150
copyright law into an area where it would
kind work in this new digital environment

00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:12.290
where
well, just for an example, when a friend uploads

00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:18.210
his video to YouTube, sometimes it will say
we've found that you're using five different

00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:22.800
samples from these songs, and it will recognize
who owns the rights.

00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:27.890
But then sometimes it will prohibit him from
uploading the video at all, and sometimes

00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:31.650
there will be some kind of cost sharing program
going on.

00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:35.900
But I was curious as to what do you sort of
recommend

00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:38.280
for these remix and mash up works?

00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:41.900
&gt;&gt;Bill: The Canadian Reform Bill actually
has a provision on this

00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:43.220
&gt;&gt;Fred: I was going to say move to Canada

00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:45.320
&gt;&gt;Bill: Move to Canada, yeah.

00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:48.530
And you'll also have notice and notice, not
notice and take down.

00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:50.360
That's the second part of
that.

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:57.280
They actually have proposed a specific provision
for user generated content that's non-commercial,

00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:59.130
and really
addresses this issue.

00:58:59.130 --> 00:59:03.410
&gt;&gt;Fred: But, under U.S. law, wouldn't you
say that fair use often could address the

00:59:03.410 --> 00:59:04.410
issue already?

00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:05.410
&gt;&gt;Bill: Yes, yes.

00:59:05.410 --> 00:59:11.520
But then there's the nice intersection between
video content and ID.

00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:12.630
&gt;&gt;Fred: Well, that's right.

00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:21.790
On YouTube, when content ID detects a match,
the content owner can ask for that to be blocked.

00:59:21.790 --> 00:59:25.240
Which is why your friend is seeing things
not get uploaded.

00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:30.000
Those matches can be overridden by the user
disputing it,

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.790
and at that point the rights holder can then
send a take down notice formally if they believe

00:59:33.790 --> 00:59:36.710
it's infringing,
and the user has a right to submit a counter

00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:38.790
notice under our DMCA.

00:59:38.790 --> 00:59:42.210
So it's a very complicated system, but it
certainly

00:59:42.210 --> 00:59:45.610
offers more than a system that would simply
prohibit it.

00:59:45.610 --> 00:59:48.250
Which frankly, a lot of copyright laws around
the world

00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:51.900
leave no room that kind of creativity at all.

00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:56.200
Which is part of the reason why, I think in
many ways the United States,

00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:58.670
now perhaps Canada, there are a number of
countries

00:59:58.670 --> 01:00:02.790
&gt;&gt;Bill: Israel
&gt;&gt;Fred: Israel, um, a lot of this creativity

01:00:02.790 --> 01:00:05.450
at least has room in those systems.

01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:11.610
Interestingly, the U.K. just completed
a big study led by a professor named Ian Hargreaves

01:00:11.610 --> 01:00:14.240
that describes how they think their copyright
law might

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:19.370
need to change in order accommodate that sort
of creativity so there is, in some ways, it

01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:21.700
may not be perfect,
but the United States is a little bit in the

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:23.780
vanguard when it comes to that sort of thing.

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:27.730
&gt;&gt;Bill: The other concept we should deal with
is that in addition to fair use, which we

01:00:27.730 --> 01:00:29.360
have, is derivative works.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:33.270
The scope of derivative works because that's
part of what you're talking about.

01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:41.000
And I think, a different look
at derivative works, limiting them to market

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.650
displacement.

01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:46.160
You would give a right to procure
derivative works so for example if I write

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:49.130
a, go back and I write a novel, someone wants
to make a movie out of it

01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:53.530
that's a derivative work and I should have
the right to control that, or someone wants

01:00:53.530 --> 01:00:59.060
to use my song in a film or
a political advertisement, you know, those

01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:00.060
sort of things.

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:03.820
But derivative works that are themselves,
what we would say, transformative,

01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:10.510
creative and that don't harm the market for
the original, is a concept that probably should

01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:13.090
be revisited, I think.

01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:20.730
And there are, of course, even with content
and ideas, there are a lot of companies that

01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:21.870
do permit it.

01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:22.900
&gt;&gt;Fred: Absolutely right.

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:27.180
&gt;&gt;Bill: So it's not a monolithic, you know,
that all big companies are trying to suppress

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:28.600
this stuff.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:30.870
There
are a number of them that allow parody and

01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:33.560
a number of them allow mash ups, too.

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:36.960
&gt;&gt;Fred: So I think that brings us to an end
here.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.600
I want to thank Bill for coming by.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.190
&gt;&gt;Bill: Thank you everyone for coming too.

01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.359
