     »: Good morning.  I am 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:58.192
Carla at Library of Congress and
I want to welcome you to this 

00:00:58.193 --> 00:01:02.285
very special story time at the 
library.  I love  reading, don't

00:01:02.286 --> 00:01:06.646
you??  It is so much fun to let 
our imaginations run wild.

00:01:08.478 --> 00:01:12.367
We are excited and have teamed 
up with Ms.  Ms. Dolly Parton's 

00:01:12.368 --> 00:01:14.368
Imagination Library to introduce
you to some wonderful authors 

00:01:17.654 --> 00:01:19.913
who will share their stories 
with us.  This partnership works

00:01:19.914 --> 00:01:22.620
through her imagination Library 
and it is awe-inspiring.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.518
She and her team have given away
over 100 million books to help 

00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:29.519
encourage 

00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:33.005
young readers to read across the
world.

00:01:33.071 --> 00:01:35.532
Here at the Library of Congress 
we share that passion for 

00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:38.183
developing young readers and we 
know that the best way to 

00:01:41.448 --> 00:01:44.353
encourage people like you to 
read is to make reading fun so 

00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:46.354
that is what we will do.

00:01:47.884 --> 00:01:50.297
I hope you enjoy today's story 
time.  Even more, I hope you 

00:01:50.298 --> 00:01:52.340
keep reading at home and having 
fun.

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:57.815
Today we will warm up by singing
some 

00:01:59.361 --> 00:02:02.065
songs, touching your toes, and 
then get comfortable and get 

00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:05.374
ready to here stories.  Now 
let's get started!

00:02:08.244 --> 00:02:10.244
     »: Good morning!

00:02:15.138 --> 00:02:16.794
Good morning and welcome to the 
library of congress' fifth 

00:02:16.795 --> 00:02:18.795
imagination 

00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:23.887
the story time coming to you 
from the beautiful pavilion and 

00:02:23.888 --> 00:02:27.397
today we have a special guest.  
My name is Caroline and I come 

00:02:27.398 --> 00:02:30.086
from the young reader's center 
and today we 

00:02:34.765 --> 00:02:36.817
are welcoming Melissa from the 
music division who is going to 

00:02:36.818 --> 00:02:40.678
read and play her flute.  
Melissa Wertheimer, I should say

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:43.787
her last name.
     So we are going to start 

00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:45.788
with our 

00:02:47.912 --> 00:02:49.912
good morning song, our hello, 
friends.

00:02:51.806 --> 00:02:53.888
We are going to sing and sign to
the tune of good night ladies.

00:02:57.641 --> 00:03:00.491
So the sign for hello is the 
salute, just a little salute and

00:03:00.492 --> 00:03:05.782
the sign for friends is you take
your two index fingers and you 

00:03:05.783 --> 00:03:08.433
hug them one way and then the 
other way, and the some for 

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:14.232
time is do you tap your 
imaginary watch and the sign for

00:03:14.233 --> 00:03:17.836
to say is you touch your mouth. 
Okay?  So hello, friends.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.490
Hello, friends three times.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.550
It is time to say hello.

00:03:30.224 --> 00:03:32.224
Hello, friend, hello, friend, 

00:03:35.368 --> 00:03:35.779
hello, friend, it's time to say 
hello.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.780
Good job.
     (Applause)

00:03:41.816 --> 00:03:43.438
All right so since we are going 
to be reading about trains I 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:45.439
thought we should 

00:03:48.402 --> 00:03:51.287
start off with a little song 
that everybody knows -- down by 

00:03:51.288 --> 00:03:55.821
the station, down by the station
early in the morning, see the 

00:03:55.822 --> 00:03:58.284
little puffer bellies all in a 
row.

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:02.539
See the little engine driver 
pull 

00:04:11.073 --> 00:04:13.330
the little lever, puff, puff, 
toot, toot, here we go.

00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:18.521
What is a puffer belly?  The 
designers called it puffing 

00:04:18.522 --> 00:04:20.522
Billy 

00:04:21.842 --> 00:04:23.842
because all of the steam it 
created.

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:26.602
So here we go -- down by the 
station, early in the morning

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:32.375
See the little puffer bellies 
all in a row

00:04:35.264 --> 00:04:37.264
See the engine driver pull the 
little lever

00:04:42.904 --> 00:04:44.904
Puff, puff, toot, toot, off we 
go

00:04:46.609 --> 00:04:48.863
Down by the station, early in 
the morning, see the little 

00:04:48.864 --> 00:04:53.573
puffer bellies all in a row
     See the engine driver 

00:04:53.574 --> 00:04:56.468
pulled a little lever,

00:04:59.942 --> 00:05:02.208
Puff, puff, toot, toot, off we 
go!

00:04:59.942 --> 00:05:01.942
(Applause)

00:05:05.098 --> 00:05:07.098
So now we are going to do a 
little 

00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:11.029
action rhyme and we are going to
make our arms into the wheels 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.892
that go chugging down the 
tracks.  Can you get your arms 

00:05:13.893 --> 00:05:16.549
bent?  And then we are going to 
move them in a circle.

00:05:17.577 --> 00:05:19.577
Okay.

00:05:21.688 --> 00:05:24.164
This is choo-choo train.
     Here is a little choo-choo 

00:05:24.165 --> 00:05:26.165
train 

00:05:28.948 --> 00:05:31.603
puffing down the tracks, now now
it is, leaned forward, and now 

00:05:31.604 --> 00:05:33.604
it is going back.  Leaned back.

00:05:40.285 --> 00:05:42.333
Now the bell is ringing, ding, 
ding, now the whistle blows, 

00:05:42.334 --> 00:05:44.334
toot, toot.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.458
What a lot of noise it makes 
(Cover your  ears) Everywhere it

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:50.459
goes.
     One more time.

00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:53.941
Here is a little choo-choo train
coming down the tracks.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.057
Now it is going forward, and now
it is going back.

00:06:01.549 --> 00:06:03.549
Now the bell is ringing, ding, 
ding

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.470
Now the whistle blows, toot, 
toot

00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:10.831
What a lot of noise it makes 
everywhere it goes!

00:06:10.832 --> 00:06:13.129
(Applause)
     Good job!

00:06:20.096 --> 00:06:22.096
So miss Melissa is going to read
the 

00:06:25.414 --> 00:06:27.414
classic 19 book by Waddy Piper 
and 

00:06:30.273 --> 00:06:34.377
illustrated by Gerald and Anne 
Houseman called what do you 

00:06:34.378 --> 00:06:36.378
think -- the little engine that 
could.

00:06:36.404 --> 00:06:39.684
Our theme today is called 
persistence or perseverance.  

00:06:39.685 --> 00:06:41.685
What does that mean?

00:06:42.951 --> 00:06:44.951
It means sticking with something
no 

00:06:47.463 --> 00:06:52.356
matter how hard it gets and not 
giving us -- okay?  The little 

00:06:52.357 --> 00:06:54.407
engine that could.
     »: Good morning, everybody.

00:06:57.259 --> 00:06:59.259
I have a special job for 
everybody out here.

00:07:05.551 --> 00:07:07.581
Your job is when ever hear the 
sound, toot, toot, do you hear 

00:07:07.582 --> 00:07:09.582
that  sound?  Your job is to 
make the train go.

00:07:11.495 --> 00:07:14.142
We have to do our action from 
our action rhyme.  And we try 

00:07:14.143 --> 00:07:18.906
that one more time?  This is the
sound and you have to make the 

00:07:18.907 --> 00:07:23.005
train go.   Toot, toot.
     So this is the little 

00:07:23.006 --> 00:07:25.006
engine that could.

00:07:29.436 --> 00:07:31.436
Toot, toot

00:07:36.626 --> 00:07:39.074
The little train rumbled over 
the tracks.  She was a happy 

00:07:39.075 --> 00:07:41.075
little train because 

00:07:42.356 --> 00:07:44.356
she had such a jolly load to 
carry

00:07:45.629 --> 00:07:47.914
Her cars were filled full of 
good things for boys and girls

00:07:51.225 --> 00:07:53.898
There were toy animals, giraffes
with long necks.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.350
There were teddy bears with 
almost 

00:08:02.054 --> 00:08:03.307
no necks at all and even a baby 
elephant.

00:08:03.308 --> 00:08:05.308
Everybody be an elephant.

00:08:08.052 --> 00:08:10.052
We have a baby elephant on the 
train.

00:08:11.164 --> 00:08:13.164
And then there were dolls, dolls

00:08:14.653 --> 00:08:16.653
with blue eyes and yellow curls.

00:08:22.097 --> 00:08:24.162
Dolls with brown eyes and brown 
bobbed heads and the funniest 

00:08:24.163 --> 00:08:26.163
toy clown you ever saw

00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:30.441
And there were cars full of toy 

00:08:32.954 --> 00:08:34.954
engines and airplanes, tops, 
Jack 

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:38.039
Nieves, picture puzzles, books, 
and 

00:08:39.368 --> 00:08:41.368
every kind of thing a boy or 
girl could want.

00:08:45.514 --> 00:08:48.188
But that was not all -- some of 
the cars were filled with all 

00:08:48.189 --> 00:08:50.189
sorts of good 

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:53.279
things for boys and girls to eat

00:08:55.978 --> 00:08:57.978
Big gold oranges and red-cheek 

00:08:59.233 --> 00:09:02.103
apples, bottles of creamy milk 
for their breakfast, fresh 

00:09:02.104 --> 00:09:04.104
spinach for their 

00:09:05.808 --> 00:09:07.808
dinners, and lollipops for after
dinner treats

00:09:10.292 --> 00:09:12.937
The little train was carrying 
all of these wonderful things to

00:09:12.938 --> 00:09:16.648
the good little boys and girls 
on the other side of the 

00:09:16.649 --> 00:09:18.649
mountain.

00:09:23.848 --> 00:09:28.559
She puffed along merrily -- 
toot, toot

00:09:30.198 --> 00:09:32.198
And then all of a sudden she 
stopped with a jerk.

00:09:36.566 --> 00:09:38.566
She simply could not go another 
inch.

00:09:44.217 --> 00:09:46.217
She tried and she tried toot, 
toot, 

00:09:49.131 --> 00:09:51.131
but her wheels would not turn

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:53.788
What were all of those good 
little boys and girls on the 

00:09:53.789 --> 00:09:56.052
other side of the mountain going
to do with the wonderful 

00:09:59.817 --> 00:10:01.817
toys to play with and the good 
food to eat?

00:10:04.737 --> 00:10:06.737
Here comes a shiny new engine --

00:10:09.587 --> 00:10:11.587
toot, toot toot --

00:10:13.064 --> 00:10:15.112
said the funny little clown that
jumped out of the train.  Let us

00:10:15.113 --> 00:10:17.755
ask him to help us.
     So all of the dolls and 

00:10:17.756 --> 00:10:19.756
toys cried 

00:10:22.488 --> 00:10:24.774
out together, "Please, shiny new
engine, won't you please pull 

00:10:24.775 --> 00:10:27.409
our train over the mountain?  
Our engine has broken down and 

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:33.156
the boys and girls on the other 
side won't have any toys to play

00:10:33.157 --> 00:10:35.157
with or good food 

00:10:36.852 --> 00:10:39.487
to eat unless you help us!

00:10:43.848 --> 00:10:45.848
But the shiny new engine 
snorted.

00:10:47.154 --> 00:10:50.003
"I pull you?  I am a passenger 
engine.

00:10:53.501 --> 00:10:56.147
I have just carried a fine, big 
train over the mountain with 

00:10:56.148 --> 00:10:58.401
more cars then you ever dreamed 
of!

00:11:02.549 --> 00:11:04.549
My train has sleeping cars with 

00:11:08.304 --> 00:11:10.189
comfortable births, a dining car
where waiters brings whatever 

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:12.190
hungry people 

00:11:15.943 --> 00:11:18.226
want to eat and parlor cars in 
which people sit and big soft 

00:11:18.227 --> 00:11:20.227
tears and looked 

00:11:21.536 --> 00:11:23.536
out of place  windows.

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:26.630
I pulled the likes of you?  
Indeed not!

00:11:30.947 --> 00:11:32.947
"  And off he seemed to the 
Roundhouse 

00:11:33.987 --> 00:11:35.987
where engines live when they are
not 

00:11:36.997 --> 00:11:39.770
busy
     Toot, toot

00:11:50.628 --> 00:11:52.628
House sad the little train and 
toys all felt.

00:11:54.119 --> 00:11:56.642
Then the little clown called 
out, "The passenger engine is 

00:11:56.643 --> 00:11:58.643
not the only one in the world.

00:12:00.746 --> 00:12:04.609
Here is another engine coming, a
great big, strong one.  Let us 

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:06.610
ask him to help us!

00:12:07.831 --> 00:12:10.194
" 
     Toot, toot

00:12:16.553 --> 00:12:18.553
The little toy clown waved his 
flag and 

00:12:21.056 --> 00:12:23.056
the big strong engine came to a 
stop.

00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:26.949
"Please, oh, please big engine, 

00:12:28.023 --> 00:12:30.325
cried all the dolls and toys 
together, won't you please pull 

00:12:30.326 --> 00:12:32.326
our train over the mountain?

00:12:33.871 --> 00:12:36.751
Are engine has broken down and 
the good little boys and girls 

00:12:36.752 --> 00:12:38.752
on the other 

00:12:39.752 --> 00:12:43.362
side won't have any toys to play
with or good food to eat unless 

00:12:43.363 --> 00:12:45.363
you help us.

00:12:47.071 --> 00:12:49.088
"  But the big strong engine 
bellowed, "I am a freight train.

00:12:52.386 --> 00:12:55.274
I had just pulled a big train 
loaded with big machines over 

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:57.733
the mountains.  These machines 
print books and 

00:13:01.785 --> 00:13:03.785
newspapers for grown-ups to 
read.

00:13:07.166 --> 00:13:09.166
I am a very important engine 
indeed.

00:13:10.468 --> 00:13:14.750
I won't pull the likes of you." 
     And the freight train 

00:13:14.751 --> 00:13:16.751
puffed off 

00:13:18.782 --> 00:13:20.782
indignantly to the Roundhouse

00:13:22.737 --> 00:13:24.737
Toot, toot

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.260
.
     Toot, toot.

00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:33.069
Toot, toot

00:13:34.409 --> 00:13:36.409
The little trains and all of the

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:40.318
dolls was very, very sad.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.093
And now that we are all sad and 
we feel defeated, let's take a 

00:13:44.094 --> 00:13:46.094
little break 

00:13:48.621 --> 00:13:51.078
for a happy song it is called 
the railroad waltz and it is a 

00:13:51.079 --> 00:13:53.539
dance.  And railroads are 
special because we count to 

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:57.062
three.  In everybody count to 
three?  123

00:14:00.174 --> 00:14:02.174
123 all right.

00:14:03.235 --> 00:14:06.761
If you would like to dance, here
is a railroad waltz.  We will 

00:14:06.762 --> 00:14:08.762
get happy a little bit because 

00:14:10.072 --> 00:14:12.072
that way we will not be so sad

00:14:15.736 --> 00:14:17.736
(Flute playing) 

00:15:11.164 --> 00:15:13.164
     (Applause)

00:15:18.518 --> 00:15:21.058
»: Beautiful.  Does everybody 
feel a little happier?  I hope 

00:15:21.059 --> 00:15:23.059
so.

00:15:24.961 --> 00:15:27.194
So now we get back to our story 
where the little train and all 

00:15:27.195 --> 00:15:29.195
of the dolls 

00:15:30.287 --> 00:15:35.447
were very sad.   "Cheer up, 
cried the little toy clown, this

00:15:35.448 --> 00:15:38.171
right engine is not the only one
in the world.  Here comes 

00:15:38.172 --> 00:15:40.410
another."  

00:15:43.833 --> 00:15:45.833
Toot, toot.

00:15:47.708 --> 00:15:49.708
Toot, toot

00:15:52.722 --> 00:15:54.722
He looked very old and tired, 
but our train is so little.

00:15:57.871 --> 00:15:59.871
So perhaps he can help us.

00:16:02.607 --> 00:16:04.607
So the little toy clown waved 
his flag 

00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:11.269
and the rusty old engine stopped

00:16:18.222 --> 00:16:20.222
.   "Please, kind engine, cried 
all of 

00:16:21.711 --> 00:16:23.785
the dolls and toys together, 
won't you please pull our train 

00:16:23.786 --> 00:16:25.786
over the mountain?

00:16:27.268 --> 00:16:29.149
Our engine has broken down and 
the boys and girls on the other 

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.150
side won't 

00:16:32.216 --> 00:16:34.076
have any toys to play with or 
good food to eat unless you help

00:16:34.077 --> 00:16:36.077
us.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.880
"  But the rusty old engine 
side, "I am 

00:16:47.439 --> 00:16:50.128
so tired, I must rest my weary 
wheels.  I cannot pull even so 

00:16:50.129 --> 00:16:52.129
little A-Train 

00:16:53.438 --> 00:16:56.287
as yours over the mountain.  I 
cannot.  I cannot.  I cannot.

00:16:59.491 --> 00:17:01.491
"  

00:17:04.847 --> 00:17:06.847
And off he rumbled to the 
Roundhouse, 

00:17:07.848 --> 00:17:12.255
chugging.
     Toot, toot.

00:17:14.517 --> 00:17:16.517
Toot, toot.
     Toot, toot

00:17:16.998 --> 00:17:20.699
I cannot.  I cannot.  I cannot.

00:17:25.004 --> 00:17:27.004
Then indeed the little train was
very 

00:17:29.494 --> 00:17:31.494
sad and the dolls and toys were 
ready to cry.

00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:35.237
But the little clown called out,
"Here's another engine coming, a

00:17:35.238 --> 00:17:37.238
little 

00:17:38.505 --> 00:17:40.505
blue engine, a very little one 
but maybe she will help us.

00:17:42.727 --> 00:17:45.035
"  

00:17:48.265 --> 00:17:50.402
Toot, toot.
     Toot, toot.

00:17:53.619 --> 00:17:55.619
Toot, toot

00:17:58.432 --> 00:18:00.902
The very little engine came 
chug, chug, chugging merrily 

00:18:00.903 --> 00:18:02.903
along when she 

00:18:04.812 --> 00:18:06.812
saw the toy clown's flag, she 
stopped quickly.

00:18:08.707 --> 00:18:10.966
"What is the matter, my friends,
she asked kindly.

00:18:14.025 --> 00:18:16.502
"   "A little blue engine, cried
the dolls and toys, will you 

00:18:16.503 --> 00:18:19.394
pull us over the mountain?  Our 
engine has broken down and the 

00:18:20.823 --> 00:18:23.693
good boys and girls on the other
side won't have any toys to play

00:18:23.694 --> 00:18:25.694
with or good 

00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:28.773
food to eat unless you help us.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:32.250
Please, please help us, little 
blue engine.

00:18:35.801 --> 00:18:37.801
"   "I am not very big, said the
little blue engine.

00:18:39.866 --> 00:18:43.723
They use me only for certain 
trains in the yard.  I have 

00:18:43.724 --> 00:18:45.724
never been over the mountain.

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.045
"   "But we must get over the 
mountain before the children 

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:53.527
awake, said all of the dolls and
toys."  And the very little 

00:18:53.528 --> 00:18:55.528
engine looked up 

00:18:58.669 --> 00:19:00.711
and she saw the tears in the 
dolls' eyes and she thought of 

00:19:00.712 --> 00:19:02.712
the good little boys and girls 
on the other side of the 

00:19:05.263 --> 00:19:08.141
mountain who would not have any 
toys or good food unless she 

00:19:08.142 --> 00:19:10.142
helped.

00:19:14.426 --> 00:19:17.576
Then she said, ""I Think I Can….
I Think I Can….I Think I Can and

00:19:17.577 --> 00:19:19.577
she hitched herself to the 
little train.

00:19:22.271 --> 00:19:24.271
She chugged and she pulled and 
pulled 

00:19:26.351 --> 00:19:29.059
and tugged, and slowly, slowly 
they started off.

00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:39.553
(Chugging, chugging) 
     The toy clown jumped aboard

00:19:39.554 --> 00:19:41.807
and all of the dolls and toy 
animals begin to 

00:19:48.588 --> 00:19:50.588
smile and cheer (Chugging, 
chugging) 

00:19:51.801 --> 00:19:57.271
Toot, toot
     Ding, ding when the little 

00:19:57.272 --> 00:20:02.586
blue engine, ""I Think I Can….I 
Think I Can….I Think I Can I 

00:20:02.587 --> 00:20:05.035
Think I Can….I Think I Can….I 
Think I Can I Think I Can….I 

00:20:05.036 --> 00:20:07.036
Think I Can….I Think I Can.

00:20:10.778 --> 00:20:13.219
"  Up, up, up, faster, and 
faster and faster the little 

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.220
engine climbed until 

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.320
at last, they reached the top of
the mountain.

00:20:21.829 --> 00:20:23.829
Down in the valley lay the city.
"  Hooray!

00:20:26.325 --> 00:20:30.039
" Hooray!, cried the funny 
little clown and all the dolls 

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.040
and toys.  The good little boys 
and girls in the 

00:20:36.484 --> 00:20:38.484
city will be happy because you 
helped 

00:20:39.753 --> 00:20:41.753
us, kind little blue engine.

00:20:43.256 --> 00:20:45.292
And the little blue engine 
smiled and seemed to say as she 

00:20:45.293 --> 00:20:47.293
puffed steadily 

00:20:49.801 --> 00:20:51.801
down the mountain -- (Chugging, 

00:20:52.811 --> 00:20:55.808
chugging) chugging).
     Toot, toot.

00:20:57.031 --> 00:20:59.057
Toot, toot.
     Toot, toot.

00:21:01.341 --> 00:21:03.341
Toot, toot

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.072
(Chugging, chugging).
     Toot, toot.

00:21:07.468 --> 00:21:10.117
Toot, toot
     I thought I could, I 

00:21:10.118 --> 00:21:12.118
thought I 

00:21:14.228 --> 00:21:15.644
could, I thought I could, I 
thought I could.  The end.

00:21:15.645 --> 00:21:18.640
(Applause)

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:29.552
How fabulous!
     »: Thank you Ms. Melissa.  

00:21:29.553 --> 00:21:31.553
Okay.

00:21:34.277 --> 00:21:35.700
So let's do an old classic, "I 
have been working on the 

00:21:35.701 --> 00:21:37.701
railroad.

00:21:38.761 --> 00:21:40.761
"  We have been working on the 
railroad, right?

00:21:43.516 --> 00:21:45.992
So she is going to give us our 
key (Flute playing)

00:21:49.267 --> 00:21:51.267
I had been working on the 
railroad, all the live day

00:21:54.837 --> 00:21:56.837
I have been working on the 

00:21:58.748 --> 00:22:00.748
railroad, just to pass the time 
away

00:22:04.519 --> 00:22:06.519
Can you hear the whistle 
blowing, 

00:22:09.272 --> 00:22:11.272
rise up so early in the morn.

00:22:13.892 --> 00:22:15.892
Can't you hear the captain 

00:22:17.627 --> 00:22:19.627
shouting, Dinah blow your horn.

00:22:23.147 --> 00:22:25.147
Dinah, won't you blow, Dinah, 
won't 

00:22:26.219 --> 00:22:28.876
you blow, oh, Dinah, won't you 
blow your horn?

00:22:35.232 --> 00:22:36.059
 Dinah, won't you blow, Dinah, 
won't you blow, oh, Dinah, won't

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.060
you blow your horn

00:22:39.224 --> 00:22:41.224
Someone is in the kitchen with 
Dinah

00:22:43.736 --> 00:22:45.736
Someone is in the kitchen I know

00:22:47.014 --> 00:22:49.014
Is someone is in the kitchen 
with 

00:22:54.865 --> 00:22:56.865

Strumming on the old banjo.

00:23:15.308 --> 00:23:18.837
     »: Wonderful!  Great 
singing!

00:23:22.529 --> 00:23:24.529
All right, so we have come to 
the and of our livestream.

00:23:26.885 --> 00:23:28.963
Let's sing our goodbye song, 
which is the opposite of the 

00:23:28.964 --> 00:23:30.964
hello, song.

00:23:32.864 --> 00:23:34.511

Goodbye friends, it is time to
