00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.487
[Director] Tell me a
little bit about The Hajj.

00:00:01.487 --> 00:00:02.780
Can I get a sip of my water first?

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.560
[Director] Of course, yeah.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.268
Because this is such a tall tale.

00:00:06.268 --> 00:00:07.601
(Director laughs)

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.660
Hajj is, it's a pilgrimage
to Mecca, Saudi Arabia,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.460
and it's a requirement to
do once in your lifetime.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.890
My mother invited me, and I was

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.900
at a kind of low point in my life.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.730
I was getting cast in Hollywood
and playing the terrorist,

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.870
so I was perpetuating and
feeding the stereotype.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.090
And then, the day before
I was leaving for Hajj,

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.880
I got a bunch of calls for auditions.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.080
And I called my mom and I
was like, "Oh I can't leave,"

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.360
"Hollywood's knocking on my door."

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.790
And she said, "You know why
you're going to Hajj, right?"

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.957
And I said, "Yeah, you invited me."

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.957
And she's like, "No, God invited you."

00:00:44.957 --> 00:00:47.490
"You can only come by
invitation from God."

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.098
So now I'm like, "What do I say to God?"

00:00:51.098 --> 00:00:52.360
(laughs) When I get there, you know.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.693
"Sorry I haven't been in touch."

00:00:54.693 --> 00:00:56.151
"My phone was on vibrate."

00:00:56.151 --> 00:00:57.650
It just kinda spooked me, you know?

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.410
When we arrived at the main mosque,

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.410
I remember it looking like
the religious Las Vegas.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.520
We were driving through
the mountains at night,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.850
they kind of opened up,

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.070
and there was this glimmering spectacle

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.620
of lights and pulsating energy.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.830
We pulled on this balcony
overlooking the Kaaba,

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.960
which is the black box building
right in the heart of Mecca,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.420
where Prophet Muhammad
threw out all the statues

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.020
and claimed that there's one God.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.940
And there's millions of pilgrims,

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.370
some coming in on first-class flights,

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.720
others are walking their camels

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.760
through the desert with
cracked, bloody feet.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.730
The high of the high
and the low of the low

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.590
and then everything in between.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.990
And everyone's dressed in white.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.260
And I remember looking over at my mother,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.610
and she was on her knees crying.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.070
And so of course, you
know, that made me cry,

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.820
so I buckled and I started crying.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.940
And it was just this
magnificent feeling and force

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.458
of something so much bigger than you.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.400
Epic, out of a movie.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.820
It's futuristic.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.750
They say in Islam that
Hajj is a small version

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.400
of what the Day of Judgment is going

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.310
to look like and feel like.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.930
So it's like a dress rehearsal.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.920
You are supposed to go to
Hajj when you have sinned

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.010
all that you are supposed to sin,

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.060
and in order to clean your sins

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.870
and kinda push the restart button.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.150
I went at a time when, you
know, I was 27 years old.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.150
I'm 42 now so, you know,
I gotta go back. (laughs)
