00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:02.563
Voiceover:The previous video we explored

00:00:02.563 --> 00:00:05.373
how the cosine and sines of angles relate.

00:00:05.373 --> 00:00:07.301
We essentially take the
terminal ray of the angle and

00:00:07.301 --> 00:00:12.600
we reflect it about the X
or the Y axis, or both axes.

00:00:12.835 --> 00:00:14.238
What I want to do in this
video is think a little bit

00:00:14.238 --> 00:00:17.509
about the tangent of
these different angles.

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:19.381
So just as a little bit of a reminder,

00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:23.506
we know that the tangent
of theta is equal to

00:00:23.506 --> 00:00:28.313
the sine of an angle over
the cosine of an angle,

00:00:28.313 --> 00:00:30.382
and by the Unit Circle Definition,

00:00:30.382 --> 00:00:32.172
it's essentially saying,
"What is the slope

00:00:32.172 --> 00:00:34.641
"of the terminal ray right over here?"

00:00:34.641 --> 00:00:37.841
We remind ourselves
slope is rise over run.

00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:40.311
It is our change in the vertical axis

00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:44.107
over our change in the horizontal axis.

00:00:44.107 --> 00:00:46.575
If we're starting at the
origin, what is our change

00:00:46.575 --> 00:00:49.978
in the vertical axis if we
go from zero to sine theta?

00:00:49.978 --> 00:00:53.376
Well, our change in the
vertical axis is sine theta.

00:00:53.376 --> 00:00:55.166
What is our change in the horizontal axis?

00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.979
It's cosine of theta.

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:58.642
So this is change in Y over

00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:02.138
change in X for the terminal ray.

00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:09.709
So the tangent of theta
is the sine of theta

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:11.105
over cosine of theta, or you could view it

00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:15.075
as the slope of this ray right over here.

00:01:15.511 --> 00:01:18.506
Lets think about what other angles are

00:01:18.506 --> 00:01:22.074
going to have the exact
same tangent of theta?

00:01:22.307 --> 00:01:25.240
This ray is collinear with
this ray right over here.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.444
In fact if you put them
together you get a line.

00:01:28.444 --> 00:01:32.042
So the tangent of this
angle right over here,

00:01:32.042 --> 00:01:34.382
this pink angle going all the way around,

00:01:34.382 --> 00:01:36.910
the tangent of pi plus theta,

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.579
or the tangent of theta plus pi,

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.645
obviously you could write theta

00:01:42.645 --> 00:01:45.141
plus pi instead of pi plus theta.

00:01:45.177 --> 00:01:48.968
This should be, just based
on this slope argument,

00:01:48.968 --> 00:01:52.068
this should be equal to
the tangent of theta.

00:01:55.637 --> 00:01:58.205
Lets see if this actually is the case.

00:01:58.713 --> 00:02:01.167
So these two things should be equal

00:02:01.167 --> 00:02:04.435
if we agree that the
tangent of an angle is

00:02:04.435 --> 00:02:08.545
equal to the slope of the terminal ray.

00:02:08.714 --> 00:02:10.108
Of course the other side of the angle is

00:02:10.108 --> 00:02:11.900
going to be the positive X axis based

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.934
on the conventions that we've set up.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.110
Lets think about what it
is when the tangent of

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.345
theta plus pi is in
terms of sine and cosine.

00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:27.473
Let me write this down in the pink color.

00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:29.043
The tangent.

00:02:29.043 --> 00:02:30.544
That's not pink.

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:37.309
The tangent of pi plus theta,
that's going to be equal to,

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:39.245
put the parentheses to avoid ambiguity,

00:02:39.245 --> 00:02:41.945
that's equal to the sine of pi plus theta,

00:02:43.314 --> 00:02:48.473
or theta plus pi, over the
cosine of theta plus pi.

00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:50.437
And in the previous video we established

00:02:50.437 --> 00:02:54.112
that the sine of theta plus pi,

00:02:54.112 --> 00:02:57.160
that's the same thing
as negative sine theta.

00:02:57.316 --> 00:03:01.407
So this is equal to negative sine theta.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.938
And the cosine of theta plus pi,

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:04.902
we already established that's the

00:03:04.902 --> 00:03:07.734
same thing as negative cosine of theta.

00:03:10.383 --> 00:03:11.580
We have a negative divided by a negative

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.311
that you could say the
negatives cancel out,

00:03:13.311 --> 00:03:16.433
and we're left with sine
theta over cosine theta,

00:03:16.433 --> 00:03:19.167
which is indeed tangent of theta,

00:03:19.167 --> 00:03:21.571
so we can feel pretty good about that.

00:03:21.571 --> 00:03:25.700
Now what about the points, or the

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.605
terminal rays right over here?

00:03:32.101 --> 00:03:33.177
Lets think about this point.

00:03:33.177 --> 00:03:38.603
What is the tangent of
negative theta going to be?

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.839
We know that the tangent of negative theta

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:45.980
is the same thing as the
sine of negative theta

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.367
over the cosine of negative theta,

00:03:49.367 --> 00:03:54.034
and we already established
the sine of negative theta,

00:03:54.034 --> 00:03:57.207
that's negative sine theta.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.111
We see that right over here,

00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:00.845
sine of negative theta.

00:04:00.845 --> 00:04:03.313
That's the negative, that's the opposite,

00:04:03.313 --> 00:04:04.976
of the sine of theta,
so we have that there,

00:04:04.976 --> 00:04:07.702
but the cosine of negative theta is

00:04:07.702 --> 00:04:10.379
the same thing as the cosine of theta,

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.879
so these things are the same.

00:04:13.046 --> 00:04:17.048
So we're left with
negative sine theta over

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:19.773
cosine of theta, which is the same thing,

00:04:19.773 --> 00:04:25.407
equal to, negative tangent theta.

00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:30.513
So we see here if you take
the negative of the angle,

00:04:30.513 --> 00:04:32.300
you're going to get the
negative of the tangent,

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.714
and that's because the
sine, the numerator,

00:04:34.714 --> 00:04:36.233
in our definition of tangent,

00:04:36.233 --> 00:04:41.668
changes signs, but the
denominator does not.

00:04:42.102 --> 00:04:43.907
So the tangent of negative theta is

00:04:43.907 --> 00:04:46.668
the same thing as
negative tangent of theta.

00:04:46.913 --> 00:04:51.011
Now, what about this
point right over here?

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.708
Well over here, relative to theta,

00:04:53.708 --> 00:04:56.833
when we're looking at pi minus theta,

00:04:56.833 --> 00:04:59.872
so when we're looking at
tangent of pi minus theta,

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:13.603
that's sine of pi minus theta
over cosine of pi minus theta.

00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:16.946
and we already established
in the previous video,

00:05:17.042 --> 00:05:20.543
that sine of pi minus theta
is equal to sine of theta,

00:05:20.647 --> 00:05:21.902
and we see that right over here,

00:05:21.902 --> 00:05:24.036
they have the exact same sines,

00:05:24.036 --> 00:05:27.710
so this is equal to sine of theta,

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.102
while cosine of pi minus theta,

00:05:30.102 --> 00:05:32.910
well, it's the opposite
of cosine of theta,

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.681
it's the negative of cosine of theta.

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:38.643
And so this once again is going

00:05:38.643 --> 00:05:41.175
to be equal to the
negative sine over cosine,

00:05:41.175 --> 00:05:45.380
or the negative tangent of
theta, which makes sense.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.243
This ray should have the same slope

00:05:48.243 --> 00:05:52.905
as this ray right over here.

00:05:52.905 --> 00:05:54.842
And we see that slope, we could view

00:05:54.842 --> 00:05:59.447
this as negative tangent of theta.

00:05:59.447 --> 00:06:03.310
And we see just looking at these two,

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.836
if you combine the rays, that these two

00:06:06.836 --> 00:06:09.370
intersecting lines have the negative slope

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.543
of each other, they're mirror
images across the X axis.

00:06:13.912 --> 00:06:16.833
And so, we've just seen,
if you take an angle

00:06:16.833 --> 00:06:19.301
and you add pi to the
angle, you're tangent

00:06:19.301 --> 00:06:21.578
won't change because you're going to

00:06:21.578 --> 00:06:23.441
essentially be sitting on the same line.

00:06:23.441 --> 00:06:26.511
pi, everything in degrees,
you're going 180 degrees around.

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:27.908
You're going the opposite direction but

00:06:27.908 --> 00:06:30.314
the slope of your ray has not changed.

00:06:30.314 --> 00:06:32.640
So tangent of theta is the same thing

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.362
as the tangent of theta plus pi,

00:06:36.377 --> 00:06:38.444
but if you take the
negative of your angle,

00:06:38.444 --> 00:06:42.177
then you're going to get
the negative of your tangent

00:06:42.177 --> 00:06:46.177
or, if you were to go
over here, and if you were

00:06:46.177 --> 00:06:52.376
to take pi minus your
angle, then you're also

00:06:52.376 --> 00:06:55.303
going to get the negative of your tangent.

00:06:55.303 --> 00:06:57.234
Hopefully this makes you a little bit,

00:06:57.234 --> 00:06:58.842
this is very useful when you're trying

00:06:58.842 --> 00:07:00.968
to work though trigonometric problems

00:07:00.968 --> 00:07:02.642
or try to find relationships
or even when we're

00:07:02.642 --> 00:07:05.504
trying to use our identities
or prove our identities,

00:07:05.504 --> 00:07:06.578
and essentially what we've done here is

00:07:06.578 --> 00:07:08.845
we have proven some identities,

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:10.302
but it's really helpful
to think about these

00:07:10.302 --> 00:07:14.342
symmetrys that we have
within the unit circle.
