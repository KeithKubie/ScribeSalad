00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.569
Albert Einstein put forward one of the most
profound explanations of the universe in his

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:09.700
general theory of relativity. It wasn’t
a complete picture of the universe, but NOW

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:16.600
science might be one step closer.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.230
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.990
There are two theories that govern mostly
everything in our universe. Einstein’s theory

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.390
of relativity accounts for the big stuff,
the way planets move around a sun. His theory

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.369
says that spacetime is geometric and that
large objects warp spacetime. Think of a bowling

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.370
ball on a sheet. As the bowling ball moves
around the sheet, it bends the sheet around

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.809
it. That’s how large objects warp geometric
spacetime.

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.960
Quantum theory explains all the weirdness
that occurs when things get very very small,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.730
how a photon can be both a particle and wave.
One of the strangest things about quantum

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.309
theory involves an idea called entanglement.
It’s an idea Einstein wasn’t too fond

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.789
of, he called it “spooky action at a distance”.

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.090
For most of the past century, these two theories
seemed at odds with each other. If gravity

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.559
governed everything then these small particles
shouldn’t behave that way. And the puzzle

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.450
of how these two pieces fit together to describe
our universe has been one of the biggest frustrations

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.170
in physics for the past 100 years or so. Thought
it’s not for lack of trying. Dozens of theories

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.250
have been put forward, but not satisfactory
enough.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.710
Until one. After repeated rejections from
journals, Physicist Mark Van Raamsdonk described

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.250
his theory in an essay published in the journal
General Relativity and Gravitation. So in

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.079
one neat theory he ties up most of the loose
ends between the two dominating theories in

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:34.009
physics. He explained that entanglement could
be the basis for geometric gravity.

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.790
His idea considers two model universes, one
is called anti-de Sitter space (AdS). AdS,

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.009
also called the bulk, is similar to ours in
which there’s 3 dimensions, it’s filled

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.659
with quantum particles, and it obeys Einstein's
laws of physics. But it doesn’t expand or

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.990
contract. The other universe, called the boundary
is only 2 dimensions, is filled with elementary

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.680
particles and doesn’t contain gravity. According
to physicist Juan Maldacena, the boundary

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.170
and the bulk are equivalent, they follow the
same physics. Some compare the two universes

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.829
to a balloon. The thin membrane of latex is
the 2D boundary and the air inside makes up

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.929
the bulk. Or others have compared it to a
hologram. Where information is encoded on

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.989
a 2D chip and projected onto 3D space.

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.209
But by using the boundary to describe what’s
going on in the bulk, theoretical physicists

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.930
could now create calculations without using
pesky gravity. And a whole new field of physics

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:23.930
took off.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.540
But the question remained... how are those
two universes connected?

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.069
Well that’s where entanglement comes in.
Entanglement is a pretty fascinating concept

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.540
in physics and to be honest, one I don’t
completely understand. Entanglement when two

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.000
particles are linked through an unseen pathway,
some researchers consider this pathway to

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.360
be the same thing as a worm hole. When particles
are connected in this way, a particle can

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.650
affect the way the other particle spins, even
if there is a vastness of space between them.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.739
So when when observing one particle we know
the state of another. And while this strange

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.730
behavior dominates most of the weirdness we
call quantum physics, it could also be responsible

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.890
for space-time.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.129
According to Raamsdonk “Space-time is just
a geometrical picture of how stuff in the

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.470
quantum system is entangled.” As particles
become entangled with each other they form

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.760
a network that looks like a tree branching
off into many different directions. This network

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.319
is called tensor networks. And according to
Raamsdonk, these networks connect the boundary

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.720
and the bulk. Think of these connections like
scaffolding, holding up the boundary membrane.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.590
If entanglement is reduced to zero, these
connections are gone, and the bulk is pulled

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.180
apart. So entanglement is responsible for
the existence of space-time.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.879
So I must caution that this is theoretical
physics and most of these discoveries have

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:39.680
only played out in mathematical equations
for model universes, not necessarily our own.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.000
So while some research does support this idea,
I’d say more research is needed.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.810
So are you curious for more theoretical physics?

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:46.810
I bet you are!

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.780
What about that whole holographic universe
thing?

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.310
Well Trace and Ian have the spooky scoop in
this episode right here.
