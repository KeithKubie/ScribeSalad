Hey Georgia, do you have a sec?

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:03.469
&gt;&gt; Yeah, what's up Anthony?

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.260
&gt;&gt; So I heard i could use JavaScript to
make Project Compass more interactive,

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.610
but I'm getting confused.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.550
It doesn't look like what I know.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.840
&gt;&gt; Okay,
well let's start with what you do know.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.050
Looks like you wrote this out in Python,
can you explain it to me?

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so
it's just a conditional statement and

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.680
if this code after F is True then it
prints that Anthony has been here,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.509
and if it's not true then it
prints Anthony will visit soon.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's exactly right.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.730
The logic for a conditional statement
is the same in JavaScript as well.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.900
As you can see,
you have your conditional statement

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.000
here in JavaScript, but there
are a couple things that are different.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.520
You have semi colons at
the end of each code block and

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.530
curly brackets between each
conditional statement.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.510
Also, instead of using
the word keyword print,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.805
you would use console.log
to print this code.

00:00:56.805 --> 00:00:59.930
&gt;&gt; Okay, so
I see like the logic's the same, but

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.950
it's just written a little differently.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.370
&gt;&gt; Exactly and as you get a little
bit more into JavaScript,

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.335
you'll start to notice that most of
the logic will be the same as Python.

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:09.520
&gt;&gt; Okay, I'll give it a try.
