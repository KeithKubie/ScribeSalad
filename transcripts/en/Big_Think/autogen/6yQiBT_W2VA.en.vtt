00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 align:start position:0%
so the first I think mistake is that we
 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
so the first I think mistake is that we
pursue<00:00:58.379><c> momentary</c><00:00:59.219><c> happiness</c><00:00:59.660><c> rather</c><00:01:00.660><c> than</c>

pursue momentary happiness rather than
longer-term<00:01:01.670><c> happiness</c><00:01:02.670><c> so</c><00:01:02.910><c> we</c><00:01:03.030><c> do</c><00:01:03.149><c> this</c><00:01:03.300><c> the</c>

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 align:start position:0%
longer-term happiness so we do this the
 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.479 align:start position:0%
longer-term happiness so we do this the
things<00:01:03.840><c> that</c><00:01:03.960><c> will</c><00:01:04.080><c> make</c><00:01:04.229><c> us</c><00:01:04.379><c> laugh</c><00:01:05.129><c> out</c><00:01:05.460><c> loud</c>

the idea was it if there were different
