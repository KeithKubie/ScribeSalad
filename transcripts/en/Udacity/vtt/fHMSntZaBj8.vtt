00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In fact, in English--and in fact, in Greek--there is a particular form of word play

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
called syllepsis, based on exploiting this semantic incongruity.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Let me give you an example of what it looks like in natural language,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and then we'll bring it back to HTML.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In this fragment: "she made no reply, up her mind, and a dash for the door"

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
"made" is being applied to three different things--replies,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
make up a mind, and make a dash for some location.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And it means something slightly different in each of these.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Making a reply means to speak.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Making up your mind means to decide something.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And making a dash for the door means to run for the exit.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But because we have this one function, if you'll permit me,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
being applied to these three different types of arguments,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
there's an incongruity which some may find humorous.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Here's perhaps my favorite example from the same source.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
"She lowered her standards by raising her glass, her courage,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
her eyes, and his hopes."

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This is a very good but very disconcerting poem

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and a lovely example of syllepsis.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Lowered is being applied to standards;

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that means to give up your ideals or try something worse.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Raising her glass, as if in a toast.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Raising her courage--to muster up her willpower.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Raising her eyes to look up at someone.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And raising his hopes because, well, nothing good happens in this poem.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Similarly, there's an error in HTML known as mismatched tags.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We talked about balanced parentheses in parsing--

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the same number of As followed by the same number of Bs,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
or the same number of open parentheses followed by

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
the same number of closed parentheses.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Recall that that's not something we can do with regular languages

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
or regular expressions, but we can capture it with a context-free grammar.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
However, we didn't handle it in our parser,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
so we must handle it now.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
This concept is not particularly tricky,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
but it does require a context-free grammar.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So just to make sure that we're all on the same page,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
there's a bit of a quiz.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I have written three HTML fragments,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
but I've left some things blank.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
What I would like you to do is fill in each blank with the word

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
necessary for each fragment alone to be well-balanced HTML,

00:02:12.000 --> 09:59:59.000
to have its tags match up perfectly.
