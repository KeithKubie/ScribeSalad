00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.530
Payment forms are another type of form
that you'll likely use in your product.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.620
You'll want to keep these simple and
easy to use, so

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.150
that way the user can focus
on purchasing the product.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.110
You'll also want to provide
different payment options.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.600
This form looks a little long, but

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.350
at least there are different options for
payment.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.940
Gumroad is a startup that
does this really well.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.260
Gumroad connects sellers of
digital products to buyers.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.350
You could sell or
buy a variety of things in Gumroad.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.060
Let's say I wanted to buy
a music management book.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.210
I could click on I want this, and I get
redirected to the simplest payment form.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.430
However, don't mistake simplicity for
lack of design.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.010
The devil is in the details with
this form, and there are so

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.650
many great details.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.860
The price for
the item is clearly displayed here.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.030
Input place holders describe
what each field should contain.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.130
And even on the credit card,

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.400
we can see that the format hints at
the spacing groups of four numbers.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.180
I also need to enter a two digit month,
a two digit year, and a CB code.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.450
When I start typing in
my payment information,

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.430
the form selects the credit
card that I'm using.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.620
Don't worry, this isn't my credit card.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.660
Many credit card companies
have reserved prefixes.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.530
Eventually I'll have to enter
at CVV code as well, and

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.440
this form tells me where to find it.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.600
For Visa its on the back
of the credit card.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.370
For other credit cards,
such as American Express,

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.200
we can see that the CV code is
on the front of the credit card.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.140
Now, the one thing missing from this
form, is some indication of trust.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.640
There's a lock down here, but
I don't really know what this means.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.530
Another website, called UXPin,
reminds users about security and

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.690
encryption on their payment form.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.330
Some other sites use logos like these
to remind users about secure payment

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.400
methods.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.640
These types of details
increase conversions and

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.990
make for great user experiences.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.600
They can make your users love not only
your product, but also how they buy it.
