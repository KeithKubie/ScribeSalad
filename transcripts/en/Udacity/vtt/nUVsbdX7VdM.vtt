00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.612
&gt;&gt; Now it's important to understand that there exists an upper limit on the

00:00:03.612 --> 00:00:07.367
number of requests that a browser can make to a single server. The browser

00:00:07.367 --> 00:00:11.507
itself sets this upper limit generally it's about six connections for a modern

00:00:11.507 --> 00:00:15.390
browser. And when the upper limit is reached, the browser will actually block

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.252
subsequent requests until an open connection becomes available. So, for

00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:23.347
instance, if you have 4,000 pending requests, and only six connections are

00:00:23.347 --> 00:00:27.300
available, all the other requests get stacked until something gives.
