00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.335
Here's the situation.

00:00:02.368 --> 00:00:03.836
There are dark forces at play--

00:00:03.869 --> 00:00:06.906
the deep state,
globalists, Bill Nye.

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.877
And this program
will oppose them at all costs.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.545
But just like Lee Harvey Oswald,

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:15.281
I can't do it alone.

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:17.617
We...

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.720
We have...
we have an incredible team

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:22.188
of citizen journalists.

00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:24.457
You may already know them
if you've been a loyal listener

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.493
to the Oppo Radio Network,
or watched our YouTube videos

00:00:27.526 --> 00:00:31.397
or subscribed to our anti-
mainstream Snapchat stories.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.266
And now they're all here,

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:35.034
covering the stories
you need to know about.

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:37.437
Starting with our resident
First Amendment champions

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.740
and social provocateurs,
Josh Sharp and Aaron Jackson.

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:42.909
And here they are.
They're over at Berkeley,

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:45.111
where Free Speech Week
was just cancelled.

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:46.512
Guys, what's going on?

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:49.015 line:0%
Jordan, Free Speech Week
may have been cancelled,

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:50.716 line:0%
but we are not going anywhere.

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:53.352
Because the Constitution
guarantees Americans

00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:54.687
the right to free speech.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.223
And it also guarantees
an audience for that speech.

00:00:57.256 --> 00:00:59.525
Yeah, preferably on TV,
maybe radio,

00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:01.294
we'd also take streaming.

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:04.530
Either way, this crinkly
ol' bitch lets us say whatever.

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:06.232
Yeah.

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:08.267
You don't have to agree with it,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.735
but you do have to accept it.

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:13.439
-Also, follow us on social.
-Yes. -Right, right.

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:14.774
Keep fighting, guys.

00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:17.076
-(cheering, applause)
-That's great.

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:19.145
There's so much to cover here.

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:21.681
As you... as you may know,
many NFL players

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:24.851
have been taking a knee during
our precious national anthem.

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:27.353
For an update, we have
citizen journalist Laura Grey

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:29.389
in her living room.
Laura.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.260
Jordan, I feel attacked.
Is there anything more violent

00:01:34.293 --> 00:01:36.829
than a nonviolent act
of civil disobedience?

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:39.465 line:0%
Those knees
don't belong on the ground.

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:42.702
They belong out on the field,
smashing into groins and faces.

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:44.737
Yes.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.440
Athletes are there
to get concussions,

00:01:47.473 --> 00:01:50.743
-not to make us think.
-Exactly!

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:53.913
Progressives love
freedom of thought so much--

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:57.283
what about freedom<i> from</i> thought?

00:01:57.316 --> 00:02:00.453
You know what... you know what,
if I wanted to spend

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:02.822
my whole Sunday thinking,
I'd watch baseball.

00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:04.657
Yes.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.058
God bless you, Laura.

00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:11.197
Now, obviously,
<i> The Opposition</i> is a lot more

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.799
than just a half hour
of nightly television.

00:02:13.832 --> 00:02:17.069
Over at Opposition Radio,
our resident expert Kobi Libii

00:02:17.102 --> 00:02:19.939
is mid-show breaking down
current events. Let's listen in.

00:02:19.972 --> 00:02:23.476
...which is what a pumpkin
technically is.

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:25.178 line:0%
But to get back to the story,

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:29.115 line:0%
The<i> Washington Post</i> is all over
what's causing these hurricanes.

00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:30.583
Tons of coverage.

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:33.186
Two words you won't see
in any of their articles,

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.188
Maxine Waters.

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:37.056
Why not?

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:39.725
Let's back up and talk eugenics
for a second.

00:02:39.758 --> 00:02:41.327
Yes. Okay, now... Yeah.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.463
You don't hear that kind of talk
from "vetted sources."

00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:46.399
Let's go to Niccole Thurman.

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:49.202
Niccole Thurman's at a Trump
rally waiting for it to start.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:51.537
Niccole, why does
mainstream media insist

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.539
that all black people
support Democrats?

00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:56.209
Ugh. Jordan,
I voted for Obama, okay?

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:58.211
He never did anything for me.

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:01.080
Obamacare was bull(bleep),
all right?

00:03:01.113 --> 00:03:04.417
I get my health care
from the Affordable Care Act.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.252
Yes.

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:08.521
-Now, Niccole...
-(cheering and applause)

00:03:08.554 --> 00:03:11.524
personally, I bet you get
a lot more respect from Trump

00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:12.992
-than Obama.
-Mm-hmm.

00:03:13.025 --> 00:03:15.461 line:0%
The second I walk
into any Trump rally,

00:03:15.494 --> 00:03:19.265 line:0%
it's like the room stops,
all right?

00:03:19.298 --> 00:03:23.269
Like, I am basically
an instant celebrity. (chuckles)

00:03:23.302 --> 00:03:25.271
And then Trump's staff
just brings me

00:03:25.304 --> 00:03:29.275
right here behind the podium
every time.

00:03:29.308 --> 00:03:30.943
I'll tell you what.

00:03:30.976 --> 00:03:33.279
-I will tell you what...
-(cheering and applause)

00:03:33.312 --> 00:03:36.482
Yes. All of my black friends
are so jealous

00:03:36.515 --> 00:03:39.752
that they don't even talk to me
anymore.

00:03:39.785 --> 00:03:42.021
But you know what?
I'm on the Trump train.

00:03:42.054 --> 00:03:44.957
-Woo, woo.
-Yes. Woo, woo, indeed.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.226
-Yeah. -Next, we go
to Tim Baltz in Alabama

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:49.295
watching tomorrow's
Republican Senate primary

00:03:49.328 --> 00:03:51.564
between Luther Strange
and Roy Moore.

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:53.099
Who's looking good, Tim?

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:54.500
Neither one of 'em, Jordan.

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:56.369 line:0%
We need a candidate
further to the right

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:57.870 line:0%
than both of these guys.

00:03:57.903 --> 00:04:01.073 line:0%
Okay, uh, uh, Tim, they're
both pretty darn conservative.

00:04:01.106 --> 00:04:04.877
Roy Moore has conflated
homosexuality with bestiality.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.079
I can't get behind Moore
until he comes out

00:04:07.112 --> 00:04:08.681
against true bestiality,

00:04:08.714 --> 00:04:13.486
which is when animals have sex
with other animals.

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.291
Imagine it, Jordan, a dog having
relations with another dog.

00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:22.028
Yeah. That's how dogs reproduce,
Tim.

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:24.363
-What are you, a Democrat?
-Okay, fine.

00:04:24.396 --> 00:04:26.596
Keep us posted, team.
What a team.
