00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.260
As I record this,

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.400
the Unicode Consortium has just announced 250 new emoji.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:05.900
And

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.140
there was much rejoicing.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:07.940
Um

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.900
unfortunately they include things like

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.780
"Man in Business Suit Levitating".

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.220
And there's a reason for that and, *sigh*

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.060
Well, it's a good question, which is

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.220
"Why are emoji in there in the first place?"

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.660
I've talked about Unicode before. It's meant to be this  universal language.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.240
Well no, universal code, that includes every other language.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.380
It's meant to contain every single script

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.700
every single character you could possibly put down

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.020
that has any meaning.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.200
I mean it's got "Linear A" in it now

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.920
which is an ancient language that no one understands

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.440
but the characters from it
are in Unicode.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.100
And, well, so are emoji.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.400
But why? They're not something that you'd deliberately draw.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.160
They're not doodle-able in the middle of a sentence in scrolled written languages.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.720
But they're in here.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.480
And the reason goes back to the 1990's.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.580
And...

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.400
Well it's an example of a standard

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.940
that the rest of the world imposed on us English speakers.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.499
1999, and we go to Japan.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.500
Now Japan at that point had

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.120
well

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.200
kind of like walled-off private mobile internets.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.640
It kind of had web access on the cell phone something close to it.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.060
But really it was like AOL used to be, if you remember that.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.800
They used to try and funnel everyone through their browser and their platform

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.720
And the Japanese mobile phone companies made that happen.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.740
There was one called DoCoMo which had i-mode.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.240
I'm probably mispronouncing that but I'm an English speaker so that's what I do.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.100
um

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.820
And the idea was, well,

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.600
we've got enough bandwidth to send text.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.400
That's about all.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.700
We can't send pictures. But

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.660
what we could do, 'cause

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.300
we're not using ASCII, we're not using the

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.940
the standard English speaking code

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.520
that says "A" is one byte and "B" is another byte.

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:49.340
We're sending Japanese characters.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.260
We're essentially sending pairs of bytes that say

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.840
"Put this picture in."

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.600
"Put this character in."

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.969
So why don't we make some of those characters

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.960
pictures?

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.560
Why don't we add a smiley face?

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.940
Why don't we add a few other things?

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.480
And one engineer, Shigetaka Kurita,

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.380
watch me looking at my notes to make sure I get that name right.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.040
Um

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.320
Shigetaka Kurita came up with a list of a 176 characters.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.540
And they were characters, they were just 12 by 12 pixel grids.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.880
Really, really simple.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.420
And they were pretty much arbitrarily chosen by him and whoever he asked.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.830
They included a couple of company logos, for crying out loud.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.830
They included the sponsors of i-mode.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.820
And the idea was

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.740
they would install those on the phones that they sent out to users.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.900
And so instead of having to send a picture

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.020
they would just send a character code.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.020
Same as for any other Japanese character.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.680
And if you're using an i-mode phone you would send a smiley face

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.320
and a smiley face would come out the other end.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.260
Which was great if you were both using i-mode phones.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.380
But then all the other network providers came up with their own lists of emoji,

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.360
generally different.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.100
Not in all,

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.780
but in most of the characters

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.120
they chose different ones that has different interpretation.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.080
So if you sent one character from an i-mode phone

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.080
to someone on another network

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.700
then it wouldn't come through as intended.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.010
That's the first stage.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.690
Stage two.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.140
Along comes the Unicode Consortium.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.200
And they say, "Right. All these encoding of all your letters,

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.859
we're just going to put them into one central thing."

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.000
"We're gonna put them into Unicode. Everyone can agree on it."

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.720
"You can send your documents internationally."

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.600
Brilliant.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.080
Except

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.160
all the Japanese people consulting on this said,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.860
"Great you're putting emoji in there as well, right?"

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.720
And the Unicode Consortium had a very long and very pitched battle about this

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.540
and eventually decided that

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.640
yes, emoji would be going in.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.840
Because one of their their goals is that

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.040
you should be able to translate two-ways.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.600
You should be able to translate documents into Unicode

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:44.920
and out of it.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.140
So you need emoji in there or you're gonna lose data.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.040
So,

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.220
in go the emoji.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.280
That's stage 2.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.040
Stage 3.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.540
Apple comes along. And we're a few years later now.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.900
Apple is launching the iPhone in Japan.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.420
And one of the first complaints they get back is,
"It doesn't have emoji."

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:02.309
"We can't ... it's just coming through as junk."

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.580
So Apple in iOS 2, way way back when,

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:06.860
adds emoji.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.660
But you needed a Japanese SIM card in there, and

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.100
no one really noticed.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.280
iOS 4, iOS 5 come along.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.660
They decide,

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.700
"Well we might as well turn this on for everyone. Everyone's using Unicode now."

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.720
"So let's just add a keyboard in there that says: emoji."

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.500
It wasn't meant to go worldwide.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.340
It was never ever meant to become as big as it did.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.620
And yet,

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:26.640
someone noticed,

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.200
"Oh, I can I can have ..."

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.000
-- why am i not holding my phone for this? -- someone went,

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.960
"Oh, I can add an emoji keyboard, there's a setting in there."

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.280
And then

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.180
they sent

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.380
a smiley face.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.940
I'm going to pretend it with a smiley face.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.620
Let's be honest, it was almost certainly the little pile of poo.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.500
They sent it to their friend.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.580
And their friend with an iPhone said, "That's amazing!"

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.460
"This is brilliant! How do I turn that on?"

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.360
And they did.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.340
And they sent it to their friend, and they sent it to their friend.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.840
Accidentally, Apple had created something

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.560
wonderfully viral,

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.940
just by turning on a hidden setting.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.640
So that when massive.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.640
And all of a sudden all the other phone companies are,

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.040
Android, Microsoft are going,

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.020
"Oh, we've gotta add this as well because

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.600
people are texting these emojis to Android phones

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.100
and

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.680
and we're not understanding them!"

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:09.510
So they added it.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.360
Um

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.740
Web browsers now have to try and cope with it.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:13.240
Uh

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.760
Firefox does very well.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.240
Firefox will look through the other fonts on your system for emoji and use them if it can.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.540
Chrome fails somewhat, there's all kinds of hacks being put in there.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.860
Everyone is trying to add emoji to their systems.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.860
Again, never intended to go this far.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.840
But

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.140
here we are.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.260
And then, well

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.280
people who don't understand where this came from

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.060
-- which is, let's be honest, pretty much everyone --

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.740
are looking at the list of pictures and they're going,

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.580
"Apple,"

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.540
-- 'cause they've assumed this is an Apple thing --

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.320
"Apple, why have you added

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.460
bento box?"

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.560
"But not say, taco?"

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.820
"And what is a bento box?" It's a kind of lunch box.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.760
They've said, "Apple, why have you had this kind of weird

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.480
five-pointed

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.680
blossom with a circle in it and some
writing?"

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.370
It's actually this stamp that a Japanese teacher would put on school child's work to say, well done.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.400
And they're saying,

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.380
"Apple, why have you added a symbol for
'love hotel' ?"

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.800
"And what is a 'love hotel' ?"

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.060
And I'm not answering that on this video.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.080
More importantly

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.240
they've said,

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.240
"Apple,"

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.260
"why isn't they're anyone black in here?"

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.660
Now that's that's a whole cultural context I'm really not

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.700
qualified to comment on. But it is still

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.540
a massive oversight. And Apple

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.820
have the, well, fairly reasonable
defense that they're following the standard.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.180
Because it was never meant to be worldwide.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.160
This was settled on by one Japanese engineer and a couple of his friends.

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:35.719
What? Nearly

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.580
20 years earlier?

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.320
That engineer never meant this to go worldwide.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.800
Never really meant it to be used outside Japan.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.760
And yet,

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.120
here we are.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.020
So

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.380
Unicode 7 has just come out.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.120
And this is the excitement. And this is,

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.340
"Oh we've got new emojis."

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.700
"We've got new things to play with."

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.800
So when it finally goes on to your phone

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.720
you'll be able to scroll through the list. And you'll be able to say,

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.280
"Oh, brilliant! They've added a

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.940
a portable stereo boombox!" like it was the 1990's.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:03.880
And you'll be able to say,

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.620
"Oh! They've added a 5 1/4 inch floppy disk!"

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.960
like it's the 1980's.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.080
And they say, "Oh! They've added"

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.480
-- I'm not kidding here --

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.180
"they've added a 'no piracy' symbol."

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.820
And the 'no piracy' symbol,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.500
I am not joking here, is

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.840
a man with a beard

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.880
and an eye patch

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.840
and a big Ghostbusters 'no' symbol through it.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.140
They've added Wingdings.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.340
They have added the entirety of Wingdings.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.880
You remember wingdings, right? It's

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.480
It's the

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.200
it's the font that was from Windows 3.1 that

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.420
that had all the little symbols in it.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.420
It has... I'm not gonna try and draw this.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.460
You are going to have to superimpose this in post somewhere.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.340
They have added

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.540
"Man in Business Suit Levitating".

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.840
That's the formal title.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.260
It was meant to look like an exclamation mark and some kind of

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.020
record company's logo, I don't know.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.320
But that's what's in Unicode.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.010
Those are your 250 new emojis.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.200
They are from Wingdings.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:58.940
Why?

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.540
And I know the reason why.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.040
And the reason why actually does make a little bit of sense.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:09.750
The Unicode Consortium has looked at all the old documents out there that use Wingdings.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.360
They are looking at the emails that are still going round

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.360
that have a "J" them for no good reason, because

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.480
Wingdings mapped "smiley face" to "J".

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.320
So if you put a Wingdings "smiley face" in there and it gets mangled along on the way

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.320
it'll come out as a "J".

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.500
And *sigh*

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.060
and they're looking at this, and they're saying,

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.640
"Right. We can convert these to Unicode. That's going to be our priority."

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.140
Which

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.160
makes an odd sort of sense.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.340
But it doesn't

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.100
solve

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.540
any of the cultural problems.

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:40.740
I mean it just adds new ones.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:41.950
What you have here

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.820
is the equivalent

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.540
of those original emoji.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.840
You have some symbols that were decided on

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.280
literally a quarter of a century ago

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.280
by some engineers

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.800
in Microsoft.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.300
*sigh*

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.100
We haven't solved any problems.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:08:59.910
Not yet.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.500
I mean Unicode 8

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.500
hopefully will come along because there is now

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.720
a massive bun fight going on

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.700
about what symbols and what emoji get added to kind of

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.940
equalize things in Unicode 8. And that's great.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.340
But it also worries me

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.840
because what we have here is essentially a language.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:18.900
We have

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:19.900
some letters

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.680
that are decided on

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.140
by a committee.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:23.960
And that

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:25.620
makes me ...

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.700
Actually that's probably not quite the right emoji.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.460
There's going to be one in here that sums it up ...

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.520
... somewhere in  here ...

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:35.920
(fading) I want ...

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.580
(barely audible) Ok, not those ...

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.800
We'd like to thank audible.com for sponsoring this Computerphile video.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.600

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.420
for the chance to check one out for free.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:55.340
Today I'd like to recommend "The Most Human Human" by Brian Christian

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.020
It all surrounds this Turing Test,

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.640
the idea of, can a computer pretend to be human?

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.020
And if that is the case, then what makes humans human?

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:04.780
Um

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.400
Really really fascinating stuff, so check that out.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.800
Get over to audible.com/computerphile

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.080
And thanks once again to them for sponsoring this Computerphile video

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.680
[Tom Scott] You need something that's going to work more or less for ASCII,

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.780
or at least not break things but still be understood.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.440
So what you do is you start by writing ...
