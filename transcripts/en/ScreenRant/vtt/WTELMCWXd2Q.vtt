00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.241
While most people go to the movies looking
for a good story with some cool action, real

00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:14.200
fans know that there’s more going on than
meets the eye.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.660
When a blockbuster movie is successful, it
usually means that the people who made it

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.950
are even bigger geeks than the people watching
it.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.770
That’s why they sometimes stuff their movies
to the gills with hidden details that most

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.460
viewers won’t even notice.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.770
But for attentive fans, these details make
all the difference.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.131
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Amazing Hidden
Details In Popular Movies You Probably Missed.

00:00:33.131 --> 00:00:36.570
The Human Torch in Captain America: The First
Avenger

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.830
Before we knew him as Captain America, Chris
Evans played Johnny Storm, also known as the

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.830
Human Torch, in 2005’s Fantastic Four.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.510
But did you know that the Human Torch also
makes a cameo in Captain America: The First

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.510
Avenger?

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.510
Don’t believe us?

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.730
Take a look at the 1943 World Expo scene.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.580
As the camera pans across the exhibition,
it passes a man inside of a glass cylinder

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.780
wearing a red suit.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.860
While this costumed figure ain’t Johnny
Storm, it does look an awful lot like the

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.909
original Human Torch, an android created by
Dr. Phineas T. Horton in the 1939 version

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:07.909
of the comic book.

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.490
Will this version of the character ever see
some action the Marvel Cinematic Universe?

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.380
Only time will tell...

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.870
Red Apple Cigarettes in Kill Bill Volume 1
When The Bride touches down in Tokyo to seek

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.370
vengeance against O-Ren Ishii, director Quentin
Tarantino includes a little Easter egg for

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.370
fans of his movie.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.880
The Bride walks past a large advertisement
for Red Apple cigarettes, which is a fictional

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.020
brand that’s appeared in several Tarantino
films, including Pulp Fiction, From Dusk Till

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.520
Dawn and Four Rooms.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.350
Tarantino himself has claimed that all of
his films take place in the same universe

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.820
and this is only one clue.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.910
You need another one?

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.990
The plot to Kill Bill bares a striking resemblance
to the plot of Fox Force Five, the TV pilot

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.890
that Uma Thurman’s character describes in
Pulp Fiction.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.090
Perhaps the series got a title change before
it finally aired?

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.760
Smallville Actors in Man of Steel
For some people, Superman is Tom Welling,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.350
who played a young Clark Kent on The CW’s
Smallville for ten seasons.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.510
Zack Snyder was evidently a fan of the series.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.500
Alessandro Juliani, Chad Krowchuk, Mackenzie
Gray, Tahmoh Penikett, Ian Tracey, and David

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.170
Paetkau were all actors who appeared in Smallville
and later played small roles in Snyder’s

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.170
Man of Steel.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.270
But the most obvious connection between the
two iterations of Superman is Amy Adams.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.630
We all know she plays Lois Lane in the DC
Extended Universe, but before she was famous,

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.330
she appeared in a first season episode of
Smallville.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.010
Adams played an overweight high school student
who accidentally drinks a kryptonite-tainted

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.870
veggie shake that makes her crave human fat.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.739
It wasn’t exactly the most dignified role.

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.900
Millennium Falcon in Star Trek: First Contact
Some fans will tell you that you’re either

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.510
a fan of Star Trek or a fan of Star Wars,
and never the twain shall meet.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.730
Except that’s not true.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.879
In fact, the special effects in Star Trek:
First Contact were created by Industrial Light

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.950
&amp; Magic, a company founded by George Lucas
to work on the Star Wars movies.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.120
One special effects guy, John Knoll, worked
on both First Contact and the Star Wars special

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.189
editions, so he decided to slip a little Easter
egg into the battle of the Federation versus

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:04.189
the Borg cube.

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:08.300
If you look closely, you can see Han Solo’s
Millennium Falcon flying in the background

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.300
of the battle.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.639
It’s pretty small, so you’ll have to zoom
in, but it’s proof that Star Wars and Star

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.390
Trek can co-exist, even in the same movie.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.390
R2D2 in Star Trek (2009)
In fact, that’s not the only time the two

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.390
franchises have got close to each other.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.390
Before JJ Abrams directed last year’s Star
Wars: The Force Awakens, he also rebooted

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.390
the Star Trek franchise in 2009.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.390
Being a fan of both series, however, Abrams
gave Star Wars droid R2D2 a little cameo in

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.390
the Trek movie.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.390
When the Enterprise first encounters Nero’s
Romulan mining ship above Vulcan, it arrives

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.390
in the middle of a battle, surrounded by a
bunch of clunky debris.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.390
One piece of debris is actually R2D2.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.390
While it looks like just another piece of
space garbage to the untrained eye, one can

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.390
pause and zoom in to find our favorite little
droid friend floating past the Enterprise.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.390
He also makes a cameo in Abrams’ Star Trek
Into Darkness, where he gets blown out of

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.390
the Enterprise mid-warp.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.390
R2D2 and C-3PO in Raiders of the Lost Ark
Man, this little guy gets around.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.390
You wouldn’t believe it, but R2D2 makes
a cameo in Steven Spielberg’s Raiders of

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.390
the Lost Ark, this time with his erudite companion
C-3PO.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.390
When Indiana Jones descends into the Well
of the Souls to collect the Ark of the Covenant,

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.959
you can see hieroglyphs of the two droids
on one of the pillars.

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.980
The connection here is that Star Wars creator
George Lucas produced Raiders of the Lost

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.739
Ark, and, of course, Harrison Ford stars in
both franchises.

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.260
In another Indiana Jones/Star Wars Easter
egg, you can see Indy escape from Shanghai’s

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.699
“Club Obi-Wan” at the beginning of Temple
of Doom.

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:50.919
I wonder who that’s a reference to?

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.959
Hidden References in the Lord of the Rings:
The Fellowship of the Rings

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.030
Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship
of the Ring wasn’t the first adaptation

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.209
of JRR Tolkien’s epic novels.

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.439
In 1978, Ralph Bakshi made an animated version
of the epic story.

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:08.239
The movie may have flopped when it came out,
but it developed a cult following over the

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.640
decades, and even inspired some shots in the
better-known Peter Jackson films.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.220
When the hobbit Odo Proudfoot puts his feet
up at the beginning of The Fellowship of the

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.170
Ring, the shot is an homage to a similar image
that appears in Bakshi’s film.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.040
Similarly, when Frodo Baggins and his friends
hides underneath a tree root as hooded wraiths

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.370
pass by above them, the shot is clearly inspired
by Bakshi’s film as well.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.230
Baby Harleys and Jokers in Suicide Squad
One of the more striking images in David Ayers

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.900
Suicide Squad is the shot of The Joker lying
on the floor, surrounded by all of his weapons.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.400
Apparently, the shot was inspired by the opening
scene of the Pink Floyd musical The Wall,

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.590
and the film’s marketing really relied on
it.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.130
But when the camera spins up from The Clown
Prince of Crime, you can also see little onesies

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.030
and twosies laid out on the floor.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.150
What could these be?

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.900
Given that Harley Quinn’s dream-life in
the film involved children, perhaps this is

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.040
a clue to the future of the Joker family?

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.510
Maybe this family of crime really is planning
to settle down?

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.600
The Satellite Dish in Star Wars: The Force
Awakens

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.930
Fans already know that Star Wars: The Force
Awakens is jam-packed with Easter eggs, like

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.410
big-name cameos and little hints and references
to the previous Star Wars films.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.220
Director JJ Abrams is obviously a huge fan
of the franchise, and he really made sure

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.470
to leave his mark on The Force Awakens.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.000
When Rey and Finn fly the fastest hunk of
junk in the galaxy off the planet Jakku, you

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.510
can notice a small design change on the ship.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.370
The satellite dish, which was large and round
in the original trilogy, has been replaced

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.220
with a smaller rectangle dish.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.220
Why is this?

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.270
Well, when Lando Calrissian makes a run at
the second death star in Return of the Jedi,

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.660
the old dish gets shorn off by a collision.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.180
JJ Abrams was just paying attention to Star
Wars canon.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.030
Community Cameo in Captain America: Civil
War

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.150
As with any movie from the Marvel Cinematic
Universe these days, Captain America: Civil

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.400
War is loaded with tiny details for the fans,
from references to the comics to inside jokes

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.470
among the actors.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.660
But one detail has carried through from the
last film in the Captain America franchise:

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.490
the inclusion of a cameo from an alum of the
NBC sitcom Community.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.080
In The Winter Soldier, Danny Pudi (better
known as Abed) appeared as a technician for

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.080
SHIELD.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.990
DC Pierson, who plays a student journalist
in the sitcom, also appeared as an Apple Store

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.990
technician.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.870
In Civil War, the Dean himself, Jim Rash,
appears as an MIT professor begging Tony Stark

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.470
for research money, basically playing the
same character.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.950
The Russo Brothers, who directed the last
two Captain America films, also directed several

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.460
episodes of the fan-favorite sitcom, so it
makes sense that they would want to bring

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.280
back some of their old friends.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.710
So what do you think of our list?

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.360
Did we miss any mind-blowing hidden details?
