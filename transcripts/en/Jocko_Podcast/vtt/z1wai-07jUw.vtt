Losing a teammate, both military and civilian civilian world happens.

2
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.380
How do you assist and promote healing and growth within a team that has lost a

3
00:00:08.381 --> 00:00:09.280
pivotal member?

4
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.160
What do you do when the emotional toll leaves your guys unfocused and is

5
00:00:15.161 --> 00:00:17.680
creating unacceptable risks?

6
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.770
Yeah. Um, you know, I've talked about this,

7
00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:29.820
this before and I think obviously in this can happen,

8
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.850
this is part of life is death and people are gonna die and you obviously we're

9
00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:36.240
all going to deal with,

10
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.330
they're all going to face it at some time in a work environment,

11
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.680
how do you deal with it?

12
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.450
One of the things that I always say is get back to work,

13
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.510
right? You're, yes, you're going to mourn. Yes,

14
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:52.200
you're going to have your memorial services and then you've got to get back to

15
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:55.920
work. And I think if you let people,

16
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.020
if you give them too much time off, if you let them sit around, um,

17
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.570
they're going to get on focus. They're going to start thinking about, you know,

18
00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:06.720
they're gonna start thinking about things that are not good to think about

19
00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:11.130
because we want to, yes, we want a morning. We want to do the,

20
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.380
we want to remember. But at the same time, and I say this all the time,

21
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:17.670
we don't want to dwell. You don't want to dwell in the past.

22
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.750
You want to remember, but don't dwell. So I say, get back to work.

23
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.730
Going back to what we talked about earlier,

24
00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:25.260
find out what your next mission is going to be.

25
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.440
You have more of a reason to achieve your mission because you lost someone that

26
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.170
you've lost. Someone that can't, a kick,

27
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:36.960
that can no longer carry on with their mission.

28
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.630
So for them, carry on with your mission. Go forward. Don't dwell on the past.

29
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.290
Anybody that you lost that you cared about, what would they want you to do?

30
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.460
Would they want you to sit around and sulk and look at the ground? No,

31
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.490
they'd want you to get your gear,

32
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.750
get your mindset straight and get back after it.

33
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.530
So that's what I recommend. I think that that's exactly right.

34
00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:03.810
And I think getting to work, uh,

35
00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:08.640
the reason that's important is if these people, if that person died,

36
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.710
you know, and for the guys that we lost, I, if we just,

37
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.670
if we just gave up and walked away, that means they died in vain for nothing.

38
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.860
And, and we're not going to do that. We're going to,

39
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.270
we're going to double a triple,

40
00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:20.760
quadruple down on that mission to make sure that we win,

41
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.980
that their sacrifices weren't wearing advantage.

42
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.400
I think that's helping the team understand, uh,

43
00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:28.950
what you're accomplishing and why they're doing what they're doing is,

44
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.450
is incredibly important.

45
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.810
And we wrote about that in extreme ownership and talk about it all the time.

46
00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:33.931
That,

47
00:02:33.931 --> 00:02:37.160
that understanding why I'm briefing the team and helping them understand why is

48
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.010
critical. But yeah, focus on accomplishing that mission is a,

49
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.360
is what you gotta do. I think the other thing too is, you know,

50
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.150
do everything you can, uh, take care of that, that,

51
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.230
that person and their family, uh, take care of their family and help them out.

52
00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:51.420
And, you know, that's an obligation that never goes away,

53
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.480
that you're always gonna have. Uh, and that's extremely important.

54
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.040
And something that's, uh,

55
00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:59.510
that's helped me through those difficult losses is by serving others and looking

56
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.600
, trying to look out for others. Uh, and I got to do that even more than I do.
