1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,010
During the Pan s period or some shit.
Pangea. Do you know what that is?

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,170
It's the era. No, it's,

3
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:11,130
well when they think that all of the
continents were connected together.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,050
We are one,
we are one flat earth as one flat table.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,750
Just flat. No, no, no.

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,180
Just obviously not like giant chunk
and then the rest was water and then it

7
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:23,910
spread out, which is fucking
weird. Like what is happening?

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,660
How did that and like also is that
happening on our insides on like it's

9
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:30,720
obviously on a cellular level of the
things. Just splitting and being torn.

10
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:35,430
The fuck apart is, here's the, the
modern pangea map. This is modern.

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,050
It's a modern country
separations and all that because,

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,380
oh this is what it looked like if
he brought up, I thought this was,

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,580
there's more to pitch is still
real America. What is that?

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,160
I thought there was some
knuckleheads that thought that.

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,770
Is that really all of the
continents together? Whoa.

16
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,380
It shows you how much God damn water
there is like that's a mind fuck. Yeah.

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,960
Cause you'd really like to think that
we're all dirt and not as much water.

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,520
It's so much water. It's all water. It's
like a little speck in a huge ass ocean.

19
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,160
This was really crazy so
it was ground dwelling.

20
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:11,640
Motherfuckers have figured out how
sock all the fish out of that water

21
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,170
just to be able to get those suckers out
your bare hands and then they were like,

22
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:22,470
Yo, we need something. We need a
smaller situation. I think until they,

23
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,540
they came up with the
nets and stuff like that.

24
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:25,890
I don't think they were real effective.

25
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,920
I think they just got what they got and
they ate that but the populations were

26
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:33,270
fine but in the last whatever hundred
and 50 years they've been using nets,

27
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,250
they just jacked that whole ocean.

28
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,560
What do you think happened to the
dude who figured out like the hook?

29
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:40,740
He probably got all the pussy in town.
That dude or like hook the fish.

30
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:42,240
He was getting all those fishies.

31
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:46,230
He was getting the ones that were way
deep to what the kind of pussy that you

32
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:50,600
would get back when you invented a book.
You don't want it

33
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,000
in your modern mind you don't,
but back then you're like,
Yo, this is fresh, fresh.

34
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,500
It only smells like musty.
How'd you become a African American?

35
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,810
Something's happening to you.

36
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,010
Wake and bake in this,
taking you to another level.

37
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:11,850
Another level for

38
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,150
sure. Yeah. Let's guess how long ago do
you think they invented the fish work?

39
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,230
Did they even know? I'm going to
say it's a really old invention.

40
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,630
Rolled Arrowhead time
period close to like native,

41
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:34,590
native before pre need
pitches would just break.

42
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:37,770
If you think about a big fish
hooking like a little thin,

43
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,380
what would they make it?
A bone probably must be [inaudible] hard,

44
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,050
but you would think don't
want to be too heavy.

45
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,430
You should just sinking wold also break.
Yeah. I want to be able to go get well.

46
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,840
Yeah. It must've been bone. I bet it
was bone and the bones get brittle,

47
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,960
especially after like you know they're
off the body and they start to calcify

48
00:02:57,481 --> 00:03:01,600
and all that. How old do
you think it is? This guy,

49
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,080
really old juniper. What it says?
Juniper wood was the first one,

50
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:09,010
21 to 23,000 years ago.
Jesus Christ.

51
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,650
There is Norwegians.
Yeah,

52
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,460
they're made from sea snail shells.

53
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,110
There's a bunch of information
I'll put together in this thing.

54
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:24,130
Okinawa island data between 20 2003
80 and 20 2007 70 in that crazy.

55
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,650
They'd get it that close. They're
basically in an inter, you know,

56
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,250
give or take 80 90 years,

57
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,120
hundred years it carbon dating.

58
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:37,360
I mean that's the only thing I remember
from high school. How do you even,

59
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,040
how do you date it back?
Do they find,

60
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,860
is it like a forensic thing where they
grab a fly and they're like, yeah,

61
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:46,150
this was six years ago because of the
juices on the wings. I think it's,

62
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,010
there's like a bunch of factors.

63
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:51,070
Like one of them is the dirt
that's around where they find it.

64
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,770
Like if they find it on the ground,

65
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,180
then it's covered with dirt over
hundreds and hundreds of years.

66
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:59,650
He could take some of that dirt and test
it. Yeah, they can see what's in it.

67
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:04,570
They they're trying to test,
I think. Whoa. That was
crazy. I want those earrings.

68
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,710
Is that a fish hook? I clicked the
other shelves. Those are fresh.

69
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,540
Those are really nice. I would rock
those. What'd you the comedy store?

70
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:18,410
Oldest fish hook found at Okinawa.
Wow. 23,000 years ago. That's crazy.

71
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:21,700
So they're saying that the oldest
fish hook is linked to the Norwegians?

72
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,890
I would say Japanese.
This is Okinawa.

73
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,580
Norwegian thing was saying that
and up until the 1950s there were,

74
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:32,060
they were still using wood and just
like a added fact and one of these make

75
00:04:32,061 --> 00:04:36,220
sense if they all figured it out the
same time, different spots in the world,

76
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,130
you know, wonder if it's one of those
things like, you know, like the,

77
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,110
there's just some weird thing.
Who's that?

78
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:43,900
Is that Rupert Sheldrake is
the morphic residence theory.

79
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,490
He's got this weird theory that I think
the idea is that if some a rat learns

80
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:52,990
amaze on the east coast rats on the west
coast, we'll learn that maze quicker.

81
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,290
What, what, how like uh, like, uh,

82
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:01,210
they don't know the no consciousness
amongst the rats. As weird as it sounds.

83
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,770
There might be some sort
of strange connection that
all rats share and not just

84
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:07,810
all rats,
but all living beings.

85
00:05:07,811 --> 00:05:12,811
His argument was that if this is
demonstrate a bubble with a rat in a maze,

86
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,090
that if they did something
like a with human beings,

87
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,400
if they could figure out a
way to, uh, to prove this,

88
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:21,360
that's likely what's happening.
Is it like he,

89
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,170
he brought up a bunch
of different factors,

90
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:28,171
like inventions that are simultaneously
taking place like all over the world,

91
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:32,140
like one and strain. Yeah. You shouldn't
attribute some of that to education,

92
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:34,700
right? Like, yeah, definitely a
challenge that's going on, like the,

93
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,180
the trends that are
happening in education,

94
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,510
but they also think there might be
something else going on underneath the

95
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:43,390
surface, like on a different
realm. Like if you learn,

96
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,930
if we're all a species and
you're on one side of the world,

97
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:49,600
you learn something that people on the
other side of the world have greater

98
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:53,000
access to it in some weird way.
That's really bizarre.
