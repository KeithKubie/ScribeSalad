00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.610
To implement this method, we'll use the same kind of

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.660
while loop we learned in lesson four. To keep collecting doubles,

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.640
as long as the user enters doubles. Inside the loop, we'll

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.440
read that double, using the scanner that was passed in. And

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.450
then we'll save it. We want to save it in the

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.150
next open spot in scores, which should be at index current

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.540
size. So we'll put nextscore in there. Now there's a new

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.270
element in scores so the size has changed. We'll need to

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.110
increment current size to reflect that. let's see it

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.930
in action. If I run the demo, and enter some

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.440
scores. It saved the scores in the order that I

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.890
entered them. Looks like we're ready to add another feature.
