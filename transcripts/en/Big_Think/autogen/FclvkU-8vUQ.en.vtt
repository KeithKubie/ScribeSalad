during the Holocaust or antiquities or
something like that and then we have the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339
something like that and then we have the

something like that and then we have the
critical section the reviews the writing

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070
critical section the reviews the writing
 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.560
critical section the reviews the writing
is slightly different because in the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570
is slightly different because in the
 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.630
is slightly different because in the
review section you're talking about

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640

giving a value judgment of whether or
 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:19.399
giving a value judgment of whether or
not this show was good or bad

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409
 
 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.679
 
well I think the role of art news is

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689
well I think the role of art news is
 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.899
well I think the role of art news is
kind of painting a broader picture of

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909
kind of painting a broader picture of
 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.410
kind of painting a broader picture of
all the people the institution's the

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420
all the people the institution's the
 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.490
all the people the institution's the
places that are shaping the world of art

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500
places that are shaping the world of art
 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.389
places that are shaping the world of art
so I think it's less maybe in terms of

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399
so I think it's less maybe in terms of
 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.210
so I think it's less maybe in terms of
shaping taste as on reporting all the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220
shaping taste as on reporting all the
 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.950
shaping taste as on reporting all the
different things that are going on out

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960
different things that are going on out
 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.050
different things that are going on out
there

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060
 
 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.550
 
because i think that the writing is

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560
because i think that the writing is
 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.140
because i think that the writing is
excellent I think the writing is

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150
excellent I think the writing is
 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.130
excellent I think the writing is
accessible the way that we write about

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140
accessible the way that we write about
 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.690
accessible the way that we write about
art isn't based on theory I mean it's

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700
art isn't based on theory I mean it's
 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.670
art isn't based on theory I mean it's
not kind of through the lens of

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680
not kind of through the lens of
 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.210
not kind of through the lens of
post-modernism post-structuralism

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220
post-modernism post-structuralism
 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.400
post-modernism post-structuralism
different theory it's it's the right or

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410
different theory it's it's the right or
 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.320
different theory it's it's the right or
certainly know about those things but

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330
certainly know about those things but
 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.900
certainly know about those things but
the writing itself is clear and

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910
the writing itself is clear and
 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.880
the writing itself is clear and
