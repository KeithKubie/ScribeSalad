MALE SPEAKER: Welcome to
Talks at Google, Chicago.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.040
Today we're excited to announce
Frank Schaeffer joining us

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.470
for his second talk
here at Google.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.790
He just spoke in
Cambridge last month,

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.790
and you can find them
talk on our Talks

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.090
at Google YouTube channel.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.870
In introducing Frank,
it's hard to keep it brief

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.320
as it seems unlikely that
one person could have amassed

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.400
a resume that includes
the following-- born

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.140
into a family of prominent
evangelicals, helping found

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.180
the religious right
in the United States,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.280
rejecting that
political point of view,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.420
and becoming a vocal
opponent of the Tea Party;

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.450
directing slasher movies;
becoming a "New York Times"

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.190
bestselling author of both
fiction and non-fiction;

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.560
becoming a visual artist
whose work has been shown

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.260
and collected around the world;
a frequent guest on Rachel

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.690
Maddow with
appearances on "Oprah,"

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.190
"The Today Show," "Fresh
Air," and the "BBC News";

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.600
an in-demand lecturer who
has spoken at Princeton,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.830
the Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.980
No longer a terrible father and
a pretty darn good grandfather,

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.220
but most of all, a thoughtful,
reflective observer

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.540
of the human condition and
our relation to spirituality,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.680
religion, art, and the Universe.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.410
Oh, yeah, one more thing-- we
left out that he survived polio

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.320
and that he also
has recently become

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.250
a member of the
Greek Orthodox Church

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.690
and many, many other things.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.230
There just isn't enough time.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.527
So please join me in
welcoming Frank Schaeffer.

00:01:36.527 --> 00:01:38.862
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:41.205 --> 00:01:43.080
FRANK SCHAEFFER: Thanks
for coming out today.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.390
I gather I'm probably the
last speaker in this room

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.976
before you all move to your
new, even swankier offices.

00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:53.600
But thank you so much for
having me come talk with you.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.320
I really enjoyed the time
down in Cambridge at Google

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.880
and here as well
because as someone

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.430
who grew up as a
terminal dyslexic,

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.954
Google is one of the things that
has come to my aid as a writer.

00:02:08.954 --> 00:02:10.370
In a weird way,
your search engine

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.350
is the only good spell
check in the world.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.240
If I can even think of
two letters in a word,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.460
I will eventually get there.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.060
Whereas all the Word
stuff, without going

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.124
into too much depth,
let alone anything else,

00:02:21.124 --> 00:02:22.290
doesn't quite work the same.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.042
So I actually really
enjoy the possibility

00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:27.500
of coming here and
talking with you

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.430
because you folks, this
company, has actually made

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.910
a huge difference to my life.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.767
And one of the
ways it has changed

00:02:37.767 --> 00:02:40.100
the way I look at things, and
then I'll get into my talk

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.130
in proper, is both
these paintings

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.190
of mine and also this book.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.440
I've had success as an author.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.630
I have had some "New
York Times" best sellers,

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.000
et cetera, et cetera.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.890
But I also someone
who's gotten heartily

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.040
sick of the gatekeepers in
this culture who, for instance,

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.620
when I wrote a book called "Why
I am an Atheist Who Believes

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.386
in God," which is what I'll be
talking about a little today,

00:03:03.386 --> 00:03:05.560
and you all have got some
copies there at the back

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.660
you can take with you that I'll
sign for you if you want them.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.320
Going through the
routine channels,

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.940
the marketing folks from some
of the publishing companies that

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.065
have been very successful
with my books in the past

00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:19.000
said, well, our marketing
people don't even

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.140
know what shelf to put this on.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.582
You've got to decide who
you are and what you are.

00:03:25.582 --> 00:03:27.540
Is this going to go on
the Christopher Hitchens

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.810
and Dawkins shelf, or is this
some sort of spirituality book

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.770
that we'll market like we
would a Deepak Chopra book?

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:36.927
Where's it coming from?

00:03:36.927 --> 00:03:38.760
And of course, the whole
point of the title,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.860
"Why I am an Atheist
Who Believes in God,"

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.850
is a kind of a countercultural
rebellion against the labels

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.550
that our celebrity culture,
our fast moving culture,

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.200
likes to give people
as a shorthand

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.260
so we don't have to think.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.290
And so when I ran into
that, the wonderful fact

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.300
was that being able now to
have an art gallery online

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.320
for my paintings-- these are
two out of my spring series

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.820
that go together,
and I brought them

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.236
because they're
small enough to go

00:04:08.236 --> 00:04:10.740
in my carry-on on a airplane.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.720
Come up and take a look
if you want afterwards.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.990
Or whether it was writing
a book that did not

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.060
fit with the marketing
strategy of people

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.750
who were set in cement since
the 19th century in terms

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.310
of the way books are
published and marketed.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.280
The work that you
all are in at Google

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.440
has actually opened
the doors up,

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.750
and it's very counterintuitive
because I'm a hands-on person.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.380
I only know what I know about
my iPhone and my laptop,

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.460
but I'm not
computer-type of person.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.580
Paintings are labor-intensive.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.120
I get honorable dirt
under my fingernails.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.310
This isn't done at a distance
or on a device of some sort.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.270
Writing is not a
high-tech enterprise.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.540
I used to write
longhand on yellow pads,

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.580
and my wife would
type this thing up.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.170
And I finally learned how to
type about 20, 30 years ago

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.720
and then jumped into computers
and all the rest of it.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.680
But the beauty of the
period of history we are in,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.240
and there is a
real interface here

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.860
between Google and the past,
is that we are now at a time

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.160
when people are growing
up in a mediated reality.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.000
Children, for instance,
you see on airplanes

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.020
who don't have toys or
books or anything else

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.840
aren't looking out the window at
the country passing under them

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.770
but instead are looking
at some tech device

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.570
interpreting the
country for them--

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.610
more likely to be looking at
it on a screen than in reality.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.590
But then you get
to people like me

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.140
who still earn their living
doing this, real stuff,

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.680
that you can feel and
touch that exists only

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.780
in one place in time,
which is a one-off thing,

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.080
or the trend you see of people
going back to vinyl, collecting

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.060
records, or play musical
instruments hands on, busking

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.870
in the street, whatever.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.200
And what has happened,
and what my book--

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.844
this counter-intuitive title,
"Why I am an Atheist Who

00:06:04.844 --> 00:06:06.260
Believes in God:
How to give love,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.180
create beauty, and
find peace," is about

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.870
is this kind of
collision of the old

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.590
and the new where
the best of the old

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.170
is actually
facilitated by the new

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.170
because it gives someone
like me a direct access

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.870
to, for instance, people I
shipped out to collectors

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.260
in Ireland and Switzerland
and all over the US

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.050
and other places in
the world that in terms

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.070
of a geographical location
I could never touch.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.329
But they can Google me.

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:31.120
They can go online.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.270
They can find me.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.150
And after they get
through all the bullshit

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.470
by right-wing activists
about what a horrible person

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.840
I am because I came out
of the religious right

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.790
and became a traitor,
they eventually

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.080
get to some item about
the fact he's a painter.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.410
He's been shown in
this and that gallery.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.100
Or they get to the
fact he's an author.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.850
And they may even
stumble across something

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.550
I have actually written instead
of just the invective written

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:57.130
about me or whatever
they might find.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.180
So I'm someone standing here
as a writer and artist who

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.710
lives in a very different
world than those of you who

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.460
are working for
Google in this room,

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:10.120
and yet you are facilitating
what in actuality would

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.370
be perfectly
understandable to an artist

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.300
in 15th or 16th century Florence
like Fra Angelico or someone

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.460
like that.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.550
That world is now
more alive than it

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.670
was in the pre-computer age
when the gatekeepers were

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.440
able to shut down any
individual who didn't quite fit.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.450
Painting was supposed
to have disappeared

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.210
by now because art critics
in the '50s and '60s

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.120
said that post-American
abstract expressionism,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.540
there would be no more painters.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.660
There are more people painting,
more people are drawing,

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.870
more people going back to
high-tech draftsmanship

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.060
than ever.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.740
And the way they can do
that is because the world is

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.060
no longer created and controlled
for art and the humanities

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.710
by "The New York Times,"
Harvard, a few art

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:56.620
schools, half a dozen theater
critics, but actually,

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.074
is accessible now to everyone.

00:07:59.074 --> 00:08:01.240
The downside, of course,
is you've got a lot of crap

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.830
out there.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.400
The upside is, however,
when you wade through that

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.510
and can make decisions
for yourself,

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:12.740
you now have a world of
creativity at your fingertips

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:17.480
where someone like me who
is an artist and a writer

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.310
can access that world
while knowing nothing

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:25.960
about the technology that
facilitates it, but yet can

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.450
be there.

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.440
One of the great
geniuses of Google

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.669
is making things simple enough
and taking the complexity

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:35.950
out without being
condescending to people

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.360
like me of another generation
who can come into the Google

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.650
world and use it and
have other people use

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:45.910
this to find what we do.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:48.510
So I want to give you a
little flavor of this book,

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:51.330
talk a little more, and then
open it up for some discussion

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.590
because I think we could
have some interesting Q&amp;A

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:55.260
after this.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.719
Let me give you a flavor
of the book in two parts.

00:08:58.719 --> 00:09:00.260
First of all, because
I'm a novelist,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.710
I've written novels like
"Portifino," "Saving Grandma,"

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:06.710
"Zermatt," and "And God said,
'Billy!'"-- works of fiction.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.260
I'm a storyteller.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:12.010
I tend not to put footnotes
in my nonfiction books,

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.037
although I footnoted
a long memoir of mine

00:09:14.037 --> 00:09:16.120
called "Crazy for God"
because people wanted names

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.210
and dates so they would see
I wasn't completely lying

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:23.080
about my unlikely background
of in one lifetime flying round

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.950
in Jerry Falwell's
borrowed jet and being

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.496
the keynote speakers at the
Southern Baptist Convention.

00:09:27.496 --> 00:09:28.780
I'm not kidding you.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.630
23,000 pastors-- this
is in the late '70s.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:35.158
You've never seen so much
blue polyester in your life,

00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:39.520
if you can remember the fashions
in that period of history.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.370
And then fast forward
to the present.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.870
So there's two
aspects to this book.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.917
There's the storytelling,
and then there's

00:09:45.917 --> 00:09:46.920
the didactic exposition.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.420
And I'll just give
you one paragraph

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.930
from the beginning here
that sort of sets up

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.740
a little bit of what the
book is over all about

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.010
and give you a touch
of the storytelling

00:09:56.010 --> 00:10:00.210
and then talk a little more
and then take questions.

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:01.840
Early on in the book
I write, "Maybe we

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.635
need a new category other than
theism, atheism, or agnosticism

00:10:05.635 --> 00:10:12.130
that takes paradox and
unknowing into account.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.070
I believe that life evolved
by natural selection.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:18.450
I believe that evolutionary
psychology explains away

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:22.870
altruism and debunks love
and that brain chemistry

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:25.490
undermines my illusion of
free will and personhood.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:29.460
I also believe that the
spiritual reality hovering

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:34.390
over, in, and through me calls
me to love, trust, and hear

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.940
the voice of my creator.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.275
It seems to me that there is an
offstage and an onstage quality

00:10:41.275 --> 00:10:43.560
to my existence.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.800
I live onstage.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.190
But I sense another
crew working offstage.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.480
Sometimes I hear
their voices singing

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.930
in a way that's as eerily
beautiful as an offstage chorus

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:57.320
in an opera."

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.272
So what I'm trying
to encapsulate there

00:11:00.272 --> 00:11:01.855
at the beginning the
book so is to let

00:11:01.855 --> 00:11:05.840
people know that
real-life experience not

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.620
intellectual ideas about life,
but the actual experience

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.560
that you and I have of
life, of love, of tragedy,

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.960
of discovering our
sexuality, of parenthood,

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:20.560
of whatever it may be, is always
filled with paradox rather than

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.770
certainty.

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:24.660
The only way to get rid of that
paradoxical aspect of your life

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.470
is to become a certainty
addict and to flatten out

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:32.125
the questions with an
overall theory of everything,

00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:34.870
if you could put
it that way, that

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.430
leaves you free to no longer
ask questions that are

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.370
inconvenient to your worldview.

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:44.210
But having traveled from
fundamentalist Christianity

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.700
to an open and paradoxical
embrace of unknowing

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.820
or what was in
history theologically

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.920
called apathetic theology, which
was the theology of unknowing

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.200
about God, not what you
could say about God,

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.940
what you couldn't say.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.860
This actually fits
the way that I have

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.040
experienced reality itself.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.970
And I'll give you
an example of that.

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:09.310
I got my wife Genie pregnant
when we were 17 and 18

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:14.070
and had three
children as a child.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.485
Now I'm a grandfather
of five grandchildren

00:12:16.485 --> 00:12:20.300
and because I got Genie
pregnant when we were 17 and 18

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.915
and my daughter went off to
NYU and got married at 22

00:12:22.915 --> 00:12:24.540
and had a baby and
now moved to Finland

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.780
and is a high-tech energy
consultant for the European

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:29.900
Union.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.094
See, so I'm not completely
living off in the woods

00:12:33.094 --> 00:12:34.510
somewhere getting
people pregnant.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:35.390
She went off and
got an education

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:36.348
and all the rest of it.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:44.370
But in comparing the
difference between me then,

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:48.390
this young jerk who was
mean to his daughter

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.910
because he was an impatient,
young fool with no knowledge

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.827
of parenthood, and
by God's grace,

00:12:54.827 --> 00:12:56.660
wound up as a good
friend with his daughter,

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.940
but only by grace,
to the person now

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.777
who cares for Jack,
Lucy, and Nora,

00:13:01.777 --> 00:13:03.235
my three youngest
grandchildren who

00:13:03.235 --> 00:13:06.344
live across the street
from me-- ages 7, 5,

00:13:06.344 --> 00:13:12.170
and 17 months as a hands-on,
stay-at-home grandfather

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:15.670
most days with those kids while
my son and daughter-in-law go

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:16.190
to work.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:18.830
And Jeannie and I do child care,
and I get up very early morning

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:19.200
to write.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:19.741
I always did.

00:13:19.741 --> 00:13:22.730
It's no sacrifice,
so my work goes on,

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:25.280
and I paint after they leave.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:30.580
But those two
people-- I'm 63 now,

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.690
and I was 17, 18,
19 then-- that you

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:37.790
can have two totally different
people inhabiting one body

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:42.050
and experiencing life completely
differently in the trajectory

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:44.440
of just one human life.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.000
When I think back
to the certainties

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.410
that teenager had
about how to raise kids

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.720
and what to do and
discipline them--

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.040
at that point of my life, I
was into Calvinist theology

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.040
I was raised in that I
was the head of the home,

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.820
and my wife should
do what I tell her.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.730
My child should do
what I tell them.

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:01.070
They should be punished and
disciplined-- spare the rod,

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.600
spoil the child--
all this nonsense.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:08.390
And where I am today with my
grandchildren and the pleasure

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:12.660
and delight that I find in
them-- the idea that somehow

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.260
these truths are fixed and
related to fixed points

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.560
rather than paradoxical learning
curves where you find yourself

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.690
at one point of your life
utterly denying and arguing

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.286
with yourself at another
point of your life,

00:14:25.286 --> 00:14:29.266
if you can understand what I'm
saying-- that this can happen

00:14:29.266 --> 00:14:31.720
in one individual
short lifetime, which

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.900
is like the lifespan of
a fruit fly after all.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.620
I mean, we're just gone.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.680
We're here instantly and gone.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.480
If I've learned one thing,
it's that the only accurate

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.420
description of life's
passage is paradox,

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.189
and the only certainty
is uncertainty.

00:14:48.189 --> 00:14:50.730
And this doesn't mean everything
is relativistic in the sense

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.650
that there's no fixed
points in my life

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.440
that I cling to like
these grandchildren.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.200
But it simply introduces
a note of humanity

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:03.880
into the process of trying to
decide who and what you are.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.610
And so I want to read you
this other little passage that

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:09.400
comes from the book to give
you a flavor of this kind

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.280
of storytelling element
and where my head is really

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.810
having set it up a little bit
more in the argumentative form

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:16.310
earlier.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:22.310
I take these kids are last year
I did-- Lucy is in second grade

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:23.986
now and Jack is in kindergarten.

00:15:23.986 --> 00:15:26.485
But they were both in the same
preschool a couple years ago,

00:15:26.485 --> 00:15:28.068
and this comes out
of that experience,

00:15:28.068 --> 00:15:30.740
and I think that's the nub
of where I'm coming from,

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:35.680
but also this kind of
human story of learning.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.665
"At first the mothers,"
this is in preschool--

00:15:37.665 --> 00:15:38.880
"couldn't figure me out.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.810
What was this old guy
doing hanging around?

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:46.540
Why was he unshaved with unkempt
hair and torn jeans and paint

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:47.130
over his coat?

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.990
Shouldn't someone
call the police?"

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.890
Because I was picking
them up at preschool.

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:56.770
"After seeing me every day
for a year, the moms know me.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:59.130
Some know I'm a
writer and artist.

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:01.910
So the paint-spattered
look is accepted.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:04.270
One mom checked me out
online and discovered

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:06.430
I've been interviewed
by Oprah and Terry Gross

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:07.700
on NPR's "Fresh Air."

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.710
Even a minor celebrity is
accorded some eccentric artist

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:15.180
slot, at least in the
arts-friendly Boston area.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.704
I could show up in my bathrobe
and slippers these days

00:16:17.704 --> 00:16:18.620
and no one would mind.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:22.835
I'm just one of the gang,
albeit somewhat of a character.

00:16:22.835 --> 00:16:24.585
The mothers and I
discuss one child's cold

00:16:24.585 --> 00:16:27.450
and how fast the rest of
us are likely to catch it.

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:31.100
We commiserate about the
latest pinkeye blight.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.660
We talk about one child
who wakes up in the night

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:37.210
and celebrate the quantum
leap another little girl made

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:41.470
with her drawing skills after
discovering chalk pastels.

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:45.570
We know who is pregnant with her
second or third child and share

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:47.404
strategies for helping
the little boy who

00:16:47.404 --> 00:16:48.820
was scared of
pooping because he's

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.600
sure something is down there.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.170
We congratulate one mom
for finally getting a job

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:56.020
with health care
insurance benefits

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:59.630
and commiserate with another
about the challenging child

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:02.360
care schedule of
the night nurse.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.300
Some of the mothers are
stay-at-home parents,

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.030
while others hurry away
from the office at lunchtime

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.295
to meet their child, deliver
her to the babysitter,

00:17:09.295 --> 00:17:11.260
and race back to work.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.960
Some have told me about problems
with teenage stepchildren,

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.869
previous marriages,
divorces, and their struggles

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:19.800
to fit into New England after
moving from a friendlier

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.290
part of the country.

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:26.200
Some moms arrive in old cars
while others drive new SUVs.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.565
No matter what we drive
or earn or if we're

00:17:28.565 --> 00:17:31.820
married, black, brown, white,
single, gay, heterosexual

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.930
or divorced, when we
get down on our knees

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:36.600
at eye level with our babies
as they run into our arms,

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.420
we understand each
other perfectly.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.740
The child we're meeting
touches the core of our being.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:46.020
Every mom delights in the
pint-sized human shouting,

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.064
hi mommy.

00:17:48.064 --> 00:17:50.480
They shout a greeting that
makes my heart skip is, hi, Pa.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.210
Our shared experience
of vulnerability

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:58.460
erases the age and
gender differences

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.870
between the young
mothers and me.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.350
We share a fearful solidarity.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.250
Call it the flip side of love.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:09.910
If anything awful were to
happen to the child clambering

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:15.040
into our arms, the Universe
as we know it would end."

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.700
And that's the truth of human
existence, as I understand it.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.460
It's not some big summary
of theology or philosophy

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:21.980
or marketing strategy.

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.600
That's it.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.500
And everything else
is a distraction,

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.194
and what's so
interesting to me is

00:18:27.194 --> 00:18:28.860
when I was having
lunch today with Josh,

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.669
I was trying to
think about what he's

00:18:30.669 --> 00:18:32.460
talking about his
struggles with his child,

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.860
and I'm talking about
my grandchildren.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.920
And they way I would
put it is this--

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:40.640
at age 63 with
five grandchildren

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.800
having had a lot
of striving years.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.687
I was in Hollywood.

00:18:43.687 --> 00:18:44.770
I made four feature films.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:45.590
They were all crap.

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:48.196
But nevertheless, I sat
in the director's chair.

00:18:48.196 --> 00:18:49.570
I've had a couple
of bestsellers.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:51.370
I've done this and that.

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:54.130
That said, I can honestly
say that the core

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:58.320
of the human relationships
that story gets to

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.695
is the only part
of my life today

00:18:59.695 --> 00:19:02.990
that I have no second
thoughts about.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.630
There's no period of my life
or no activity, no achievement,

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:08.456
or no failure that I look
back on without another point

00:19:08.456 --> 00:19:13.782
of view, like maybe this
was just a waste of time.

00:19:13.782 --> 00:19:15.490
There was a year when
my kids were little

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:17.531
before I move to the States
from Switzerland when

00:19:17.531 --> 00:19:20.540
I spent six months on the road
away from my children doing

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.550
stupid things like being at the
Southern Baptist Convention,

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.070
sharing the platform with
Ronald Reagan at the Christian

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:28.880
Broadcasters Association,
hanging around people

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.600
like Jack Kemp who
was then running

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.470
or soon to run for
vice-presidential candidate

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:34.770
for Bob Dole, blah, blah, blah.

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:37.870
At the time, it was all very
exciting and high pressure.

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:42.502
It was a big deal--
all the rest of it.

00:19:42.502 --> 00:19:45.880
I look back on that
now as 99% wasted time.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.630
The only glimmer of
hope I have in that

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:51.790
is that I learned from that what
true, unmitigated, unvarnished

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:55.800
bullshit looks like and
can now avoid it better

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.866
in the last years of my life.

00:19:57.866 --> 00:19:59.690
But that's it.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:03.580
But when I am with Laura,
who's 17 months old,

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.360
and she comes in every morning
and put her arms around my neck

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.830
and lays her head
on my shoulder,

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.610
and I take care of
her for three or four

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:13.540
blessed hours while Genie
finishes her day's work,

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:17.680
there is not second of that time
that I would trade literally,

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.590
and this is not hyperbole, for
anything anyone in this room

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:24.460
or anywhere in the world could
offer me at any given moment,

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:25.420
seriously.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.210
I wouldn't walk away
from 10 seconds with Nora

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:30.954
to guarantee my next book
is a bestseller if that

00:20:30.954 --> 00:20:32.810
was the tradeoff.

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:35.290
And if I need to write, I
just get up a little earlier.

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:36.430
This is not altruism.

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:39.250
This is the most selfish
statement I could make to you.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:42.800
But it's made from a point of
view of actual life experience.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.900
So when I come into
places like Google,

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.990
or I talk at writers
conferences, or universities

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:49.430
to a lot of high-powered people.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.290
You've never met more
nervous and unhappy people

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:52.623
than PhD candidates, by the way.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:21:00.099
My feeling often is to
try to say, hey, look,

00:21:00.099 --> 00:21:01.890
let me give you something
that maybe you're

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:05.000
not expecting in this talk
on the collision of religion

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.510
and politics, which is why, for
instance, Rachel Maddow will

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:08.010
have me on.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:15.280
Let me, as Oprah would say,
share my heart with you.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.970
Do not do as much as I did
in more formative years

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:22.650
that I now look back as
unmitigated, wasted time.

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:24.900
And I'm not talking about
the religious right.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.145
I mean, don't do so
much now that you

00:21:28.145 --> 00:21:30.520
will regret when you
get past the hunger

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:34.260
for your striving years
and realize that 99% of it

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.940
was bullshit.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.170
You have to have the human
dimension to your life

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:40.370
or you will regret it.

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:41.430
I promise you that.

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.080
Now, I know a few
minutes ago, I said

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.163
I'm not certain about
anything, and I know I sound

00:21:45.163 --> 00:21:46.980
pretty certain about that.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.440
But that's my experience.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.090
And the paradox
of that experience

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:53.120
is this-- the
things that I wanted

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.870
most at some parts of my
life actually turned out

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:57.957
to be the most hollow
and meaningless.

00:21:57.957 --> 00:21:59.540
The things that I
thought would always

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.181
be around like these
children of mine

00:22:01.181 --> 00:22:03.680
I had that I didn't pay enough
attention to because I was so

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.570
busy doing my hotshot bullshit.

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:10.150
The times with my wife
building a relationship where

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:13.414
I was fool enough to
not realize that the way

00:22:13.414 --> 00:22:15.330
that you establish a
relationship with someone

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:17.010
is not going to some
seminar or reading

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:20.020
a book or philosophy
of dating or trying

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.250
to meet the perfect person.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.150
It's bringing your lover or
your wife, whomever you're with,

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:26.580
a cup of coffee in
bed in the morning.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.120
It's cleaning up
a little bit when

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.180
she's too tired to do that.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:35.010
Forget the roses and all the
rest of it after a fight.

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:37.100
Have the humility to
say you were wrong.

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.770
It's the human
stuff that we take

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:41.100
for granted that
actually takes a lifetime

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:45.080
to get to where you can look
back and see a path that

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.196
got you to that place.

00:22:46.196 --> 00:22:47.570
And the only thing
I don't regret

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:50.111
about my checkered and stupid
past that if you read the book,

00:22:50.111 --> 00:22:52.149
you'll get a little
bit of a hint of

00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:54.190
is that it got me to where
I'm standing right now

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:57.650
this afternoon with five
grandchildren waiting

00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:00.050
for me who love me, a daughter
who will Skype tomorrow

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:03.005
morning again from Brussels
where she works at the European

00:23:03.005 --> 00:23:05.690
Union and who will
tell me where she is.

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:08.090
What I do when I'm
talking here to you guys--

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:10.020
she puts her laptop
where she's talking

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.075
and during her talk sometimes
just puts it on Skype

00:23:13.075 --> 00:23:15.014
and turns it around
so her dad can

00:23:15.014 --> 00:23:16.680
see where she is and
then turns it back,

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.890
and we only have a
10-second communication.

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:25.800
That's the moment of my day
that lights up because here's

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.780
a child who had
a tough childhood

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:30.110
with a strict, stupid
father, who was a kid

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:35.210
raising a daughter who's
turned into this golden grownup

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:38.560
and who loves me enough to
share a little piece of her life

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.960
with me just about every day
to show me what she's up to.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:46.480
And when I look at that
structure of a day pitching

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.830
my new book to my agent.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:49.650
He's going to be sending it out.

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:51.230
All that stuff matters.

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:54.000
But it only matters the way
footnotes in books matter.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.370
It isn't the real story.

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:59.280
And so this book really
is a couple of things.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:03.300
It came out a memoir I wrote
called, "Crazy for God,"

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:06.770
and the reason I wrote this
book is that it started when

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:08.780
Christopher Hitchens, the
author before he died,

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.488
read "Crazy for God"
and really liked it.

00:24:10.488 --> 00:24:12.815
He emailed me a number of
times and started calling me

00:24:12.815 --> 00:24:15.127
as he read his way
through it, telling me

00:24:15.127 --> 00:24:16.710
he thought it was a
good book, and I'm

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:19.235
a good writer-- all very nice.

00:24:19.235 --> 00:24:20.860
And then he got to
the end of the book,

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.280
and we had our
last conversation.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.950
He says, I'm really disappointed
because I thought you were now

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:27.680
going to finish the book by
saying you become one of us--

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:31.195
one of us being on the cusp of
the new atheist movement that

00:24:31.195 --> 00:24:32.390
was emerging then.

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:33.820
And he said, I
finished the book.

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.650
I don't even know
what you believe.

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:38.330
You sort of sound like
a person of faith still.

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:41.104
Why don't you just
take the step?

00:24:41.104 --> 00:24:43.270
At the same time, some of
my own evangelical friends

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:45.930
from my past because my
father, Francis Schaeffer,

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:47.700
was this well-known evangelical.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:49.616
I don't mean well-known
on the street.

00:24:49.616 --> 00:24:51.400
I mean, well-known
in his ghetto.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:55.560
We all have our little
ghettos we live in.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.725
I get emails from them
saying, we love the story.

00:24:57.725 --> 00:24:59.100
It's time somebody
told the truth

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.641
about the rise of
the religious right

00:25:00.641 --> 00:25:01.750
and how it all came about.

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:02.700
But we're very disappointed.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.491
We thought you'd get
to the end of the book

00:25:04.491 --> 00:25:06.665
and declare a
straightforward declaration

00:25:06.665 --> 00:25:10.090
that in spite of all this,
you're still a man of faith.

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:11.830
Literally, if you
changed a line or two

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:13.850
from my evangelical,
fundamentalist friends

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:17.360
and from my atheist
fundamentalist friends,

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.010
it was the same email, and
what was bothering both of them

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:23.980
was ambivalence and paradox
of being able to say, look,

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:27.400
the actual way life
is, is not a series

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:31.180
of watertight conclusions
which now obviate you

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.590
from thinking anymore.

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:35.526
One question just
leads to the next,

00:25:35.526 --> 00:25:39.140
and it's the overall
experience, and where it matters

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.830
is not that you get your
head right with God if you're

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:45.710
an evangelical or get your
philosophy right and march

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:49.290
side by step with Chris
Hitchens or Dawkins.

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:52.980
What matters is
your relationship

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:58.490
with the people in your life,
who you love most about whom

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:00.560
you will regret
nothing except that

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.770
you treated them
badly sometimes,

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:04.320
but will look back
and understand

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.660
that the actual purpose of
all this other stuff was that.

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:12.120
And so the intellectual
discussion about life

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:16.840
and about its meaning and
about philosophy and theology

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.215
masquerades as the
point itself as

00:26:19.215 --> 00:26:21.910
if the old evangelical theology
was if you can get your heart

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:23.910
right with God and believe
the correct theology,

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:26.940
you'll be saved, and
otherwise, you're lost.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:28.500
In my experience,
and what I argue

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.960
for-- why I'm an atheist
who believes in God,

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.010
and why the book finishes
up with this subtitle, "How

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.950
to Give Love, Create
Beauty, and Find Peace,"

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:40.440
is to sidestep
what everyone tells

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:47.430
you are the big questions-- your
career, who you should marry,

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:52.080
when to have children, how
your biological clock is doing,

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.580
if you believe in God
or not-- and realize

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:57.800
that the real game and the only
game, and the only thing you

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.700
will not regret is the
time you spend not looking

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.900
for perfection of belief
or the perfect mate

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:06.960
or when you should have a child,

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.370
but to work with what you
have on the human scale

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:12.596
and make that work.

00:27:12.596 --> 00:27:13.900
That's it.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.142
That is the only game in town.

00:27:16.142 --> 00:27:18.130
In a way, I sometimes
look at the super-wealthy

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:19.820
in our country,
and of course, I'm

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.480
not thinking of Donald
Trump right now.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:27.790
And I say to myself, a great
amount of wealth is actually,

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:31.550
I think, a form, finally,
of mental illness

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:34.140
because the time it takes to
generate that type of wealth,

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.650
unless you're just very
lucky as an artist,

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:39.390
and you just get famous because
someone loves your first album

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:41.005
or you invent
something incredible,

00:27:41.005 --> 00:27:45.077
and it becomes a phenomenon.

00:27:45.077 --> 00:27:46.660
But for the kind of
people who set out

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.370
looking for a wealth
as an end in itself,

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:55.640
the energy that demands means
that they have made a trade.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.030
They have trampled on the
relationships that, in the end,

00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:00.590
were the whole point
anyway-- many, many times.

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:02.628
I'm not saying for everyone.

00:28:02.628 --> 00:28:05.002
So in a sense, someone who's
chased that kind of weatlh--

00:28:05.002 --> 00:28:06.890
the kind of person who
really, really, really

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:08.640
wants to head to Wall
Street and make just

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.460
a shitload of money-- that's
where their head's at.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:14.120
This is a form of sickness.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.750
And so our whole definition
of success in this world

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:22.370
is very odd, because we
define mental illness

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:25.840
that we call success according
to the American dream,

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.580
as an end in itself that's
worth sacrificing everything

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:30.500
to-- the human relationships.

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.690
And so I guess at the
grand old age of 63

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:35.860
and looking at these
grandchildren of mine,

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:38.210
my question is no longer,
how much money did you make?

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:40.418
Did you ever get that PhD
and become a vice-president

00:28:40.418 --> 00:28:43.340
of your corporation?

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:47.107
What's your relationship with
your lover and your child?

00:28:47.107 --> 00:28:48.690
How much time do you
have in your life

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:49.648
for your grandchildren?

00:28:49.648 --> 00:28:52.980
And by the way, does the
word mortality ring a bell?

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:55.270
Did you think this
was going on forever?

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:57.925
And that in turn becomes very
close to the sort of questions

00:28:57.925 --> 00:28:59.974
that the prophets in
every religious tradition

00:28:59.974 --> 00:29:03.415
asks, whether it's a
religious tradition that

00:29:03.415 --> 00:29:05.580
is fastened in something
like Christianity

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:08.750
or a pseudo-religious
tradition of philosophy

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:11.480
that those questions
of character--

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.200
those questions of personal
growth, those questions

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.940
of having room in your life
for the purpose of life

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:20.360
itself, which is not all
this stuff around you,

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.030
but is the actual
experience of love--

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:25.560
the actual experience
of relationships,

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:29.820
the actual experience
of unconditional trust.

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.430
These are the things
that all this other glass

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:35.250
and steel we have around us
looking out of this building,

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:37.700
without which,
this is just crap.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.903
And essentially, what
I'm going for here

00:29:39.903 --> 00:29:42.220
in the book is saying
that if you begin

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.660
from the idea of
paradox and you begin

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:46.320
from the idea of
human relationships

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:50.240
and you begin from the idea
of rejecting these certainties

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.080
that you hang everything
on-- get your PhD,

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.470
make this much money per
year, wait until you're

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:57.770
this certain age
to have a child,

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.220
try to meet the perfect
mate, get rid of the person

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.770
you fell love in
with in high school

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:03.180
because it wasn't
the right time,

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:05.230
and now you're 40 and
looking around-- OK,

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:06.900
now you've got all
your ducks in a row.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.441
You step out, and
you're going to try

00:30:08.441 --> 00:30:10.860
to get this perfect
relationship going.

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:13.580
That is applying the business
model, which is broken.

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:16.990
It's a mental illness to
the core of life itself

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:19.490
which can't be treated that way
because last time I checked,

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:22.250
we're biological machines
that look at the world

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:23.910
through spiritual eyes.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:25.472
So we're always at
war with ourselves

00:30:25.472 --> 00:30:27.055
because we have this
physical reality.

00:30:27.055 --> 00:30:29.050
Yet, we don't see it that way.

00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:32.870
I'm a biological machine, so why
would I do something like this?

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:34.683
It has nothing to
do with survival.

00:30:34.683 --> 00:30:37.700
I can make money without
selling paintings.

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:39.039
Why do I do this?

00:30:39.039 --> 00:30:40.455
Well, these are
the questions that

00:30:40.455 --> 00:30:43.950
are unanswerable because our
evolutionary cycle of history

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:45.490
from being
single-celled creatures

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:49.170
until the present coming
out of the material Universe

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:52.240
doesn't really have room for
the need for art and aesthetics

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.040
and why somebody would sit
around doing stuff like this

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:58.130
or take all this
time and waste it

00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:59.850
by taking care of
their grandchildren

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:03.260
or look back on the successes
and see them as failures

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:07.023
in as much as they were taken
away from the things that

00:31:07.023 --> 00:31:09.131
in the end really mattered.

00:31:09.131 --> 00:31:10.880
So I'd like to hit you
with those thoughts

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:14.040
and just go back to the theme
that I had at the beginning,

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.039
and we'll have a
little Q&amp;A session.

00:31:16.039 --> 00:31:17.330
I wanted to read you something.

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:19.413
Obviously, I didn't know
I'd be talking at Google,

00:31:19.413 --> 00:31:20.670
so I'm not sucking up to you.

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:23.910
But this is actually
what I wrote.

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:26.060
"A new generation is
embracing human connection

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:28.090
rather than debunking it.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:30.590
The liberating results are real.

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:32.470
The geeks, bless
them, are killing off

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:35.410
the jaded, cold-hearted
gatekeepers.

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:37.520
When I was young
artist in the 1970s,

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.950
I had to travel to a gallery,
slide in a sweaty hand,

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:41.880
and beg for a meeting
with the owner

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.510
if I wanted to sell a painting.

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:45.640
If the owner loved my
work, I'd be invited back

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.530
a year or two
later, and he or she

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:50.580
would put a few
paintings in a show.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.520
I wandered off into
the movie business

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.730
and quit painting and found the
same was true there with script

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:57.510
meetings and all the rest.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:01.870
When I resumed painting in
2006, I worked for eight years

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:04.370
until I liked my work
enough to show it.

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:07.460
I started a website in 2014
and now sell art directly

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:10.830
to collectors worldwide.

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:12.410
There are no
gatekeepers in sight.

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:17.110
It's just me directly in touch
with people who like my work."

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:19.920
In other words, the
baggage is stripped away

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.980
by the technology.

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.510
And we get back to the basic
human relationships facilitated

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:25.270
by something that
is inhuman, just

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:27.067
like I'm a biological machine.

00:32:27.067 --> 00:32:28.900
But I look at the world
with spiritual eyes.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.566
So here's this weird thing.

00:32:30.566 --> 00:32:32.190
Google ought to start
its own religion.

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:35.300
It worked for scientology.

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:36.830
"The same goes for my writing.

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:38.380
I self-published this book.

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:40.860
Given the bestselling status
of some of my previous books,

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:42.883
several of my former
secular publishers

00:32:42.883 --> 00:32:44.503
and several religious
publishers were

00:32:44.503 --> 00:32:45.911
interested in publishing it.

00:32:45.911 --> 00:32:47.660
However, they wanted
me to craft this book

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.600
to fit their
marketing strategies.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.780
Does it belong to new atheist or
the religion shelf, they asked.

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:56.060
Can you rewrite it to fit
one or the other market?

00:32:56.060 --> 00:33:00.210
My answer was no, yet, you
are reading the book I wrote.

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:03.280
I don't view you as
a market segment.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:07.180
I view you as my partner, an
individual reader, a friend,

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:10.640
as complex and maybe even
as conflicted as I am.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.940
Why should either of
us fit in anywhere?

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.080
My liberators in
Silicon Valley have

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.810
freed me to write for
you directly and say

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:23.670
what I want to anyone
when I want to say it.

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:25.940
The internet and its
innovators are doing more

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:29.230
to facilitate the reemergence
of content-laden, craft-rich,

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:33.496
hands-on individuality and
perhaps even spirituality

00:33:33.496 --> 00:33:37.660
than all the galleries,
agents, critics, churches,

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:40.310
and publishers combined."

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:43.064
And that brings this
talk to the conclusion,

00:33:43.064 --> 00:33:44.480
and we'll have a
couple questions.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:48.600
And so I would just simply
say, think of the paradox.

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.950
The most spiritually
facilitating organizations

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:57.460
in the world are high-tech firms
which deal in ones and zeroes

00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:00.480
electronically about as far away
from the human experience you

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.070
can get.

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:05.200
And yet, I can sit in my studio
and paint because of that.

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.360
I can go directly to a reader.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:12.040
I can be in my office at any
time I want working online.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.630
I don't have to be in
the Harvard library.

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:16.850
What took me three
weeks before Google,

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:18.920
I can do in three
minutes, literally.

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:22.510
And guess where I can
take that time and use it?

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:24.889
I can play with Nora.

00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:27.540
I can be in my front yard as
she picks up wind falls and eats

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:28.373
them off the ground.

00:34:28.373 --> 00:34:29.898
And I say, never
mind, worms never

00:34:29.898 --> 00:34:32.491
hurt anybody She's enjoying it.

00:34:32.491 --> 00:34:33.199
I won't tell her.

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:34.750
We're just primates after all.

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:37.030
She likes this.

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:40.739
So that paradoxical kind
of view of technology

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:42.870
is what I hope people
who work for Google

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:45.370
and other high-tech
companies understand.

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:47.350
And that is, in the
end, what you're doing

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:50.790
is not about science or money.

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:54.179
What you're doing is,
for me, is letting

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:56.360
me play with the granddaughter
because I don't have

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.230
to sit in the library all day.

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:02.910
But, and here's the taffy,
the kind of ambitions out

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:05.460
of which things like
Google sprang also

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:07.987
can grind people up in the
same way the movie business can

00:35:07.987 --> 00:35:09.820
or the publishing
business or anything else.

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:14.460
And I would urge you to,
especially if you're not as old

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:17.375
as I am, do not trade
in what in the end

00:35:17.375 --> 00:35:18.980
will be the things
for your own life

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:22.380
that actually work
for you forever,

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:25.580
combining this biological
animal with this creature who

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:28.050
looks at the world
through spiritual eyes.

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:30.470
Don't trade in that
possibility for yourself

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:32.890
while you're giving someone
like me that opportunity.

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:34.600
That would be a shame.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.430
Find the Nora in your own life.

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:39.300
Find the Genie to
bring a cup of coffee

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.320
to in bed in your own life.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.050
Find the thing that
you care about more

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:46.910
than working strategically
within a corporate environment

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:53.070
so that you wind up as a
person and not simply float

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:54.860
with your feet and
your time, as it were,

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.650
for the biological
machine, but rather

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:59.580
understand you're also
looking at the world

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.042
through spiritual eyes.

00:36:01.042 --> 00:36:03.000
And the reason I wrote,
"Why I'm an Atheist Who

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.970
Believes in God," is to just
open that discussion up.

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:07.670
So with that,
thank you, and I'll

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:11.530
repeat the questions you ask
so that Josh can get them

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:13.720
on the tape he's
making, and you can

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.040
ask about anything you want.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:18.580
It doesn't have to stick
with the talk here.

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:19.545
Whatever comes to mind.

00:36:19.545 --> 00:36:22.045
And we'll take the rest of the
time on a couple of questions

00:36:22.045 --> 00:36:26.510
and just feel free to shout them
out or disagree or whatever.

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:28.010
There is an escape
route here if you

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:29.260
didn't like what I was saying.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.900
I can make the door before you
can get to me, polio or not.

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.116
So let's go for it.

00:36:37.861 --> 00:36:38.360
Yes?

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.922
AUDIENCE: Yeah, this
is amusing to me

00:36:43.922 --> 00:36:45.279
because it's very similar.

00:36:45.279 --> 00:36:46.820
I feel like it's a
very similar path.

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:49.360
I was working in Washington
with a lot of groups

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:52.700
that you probably
criticize on Rachel Maddow.

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:54.410
I got really caught
up [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:57.220
I decided lets just move
across the country to focus

00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:00.300
on family or more
of the personal life

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.580
you were talking about
with the ambivalence,

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:06.016
with the loss of either
political or religious ambition

00:37:06.016 --> 00:37:09.320
and just saying it's OK
not to know the answer.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:12.430
Do you ever struggle
for what is the good you

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:15.460
want to do in life, or how do
you bring good into this world

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.220
without a very
certain direction?

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.980
FRANK SCHAEFFER: Sure, I
think it's a great question.

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.470
How do you bring
it into this world

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:21.550
without a certain direction?

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:23.360
If you're all into
ambivalence and paradox,

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.810
do you ever donate blood?

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:27.020
Or is that paradoxical
too, so to speak, right?

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:28.030
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:30.530
FRANK SCHAEFFER: Yeah, and I
would start in bite-size pieces

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:32.440
again without drawing
a huge conclusion.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:35.800
The first thing I do is that
with my three granddaughters,

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:39.180
they will have known someone
who was a male figure who

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:41.629
loved them unconditionally
and who gave them

00:37:41.629 --> 00:37:43.170
the security of
knowing that they are

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:46.040
smart and beautiful and
talented and articulate,

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.840
and I am in the corner.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.966
So I will send three young
women into the world who

00:37:49.966 --> 00:37:52.298
will make their own choices
and make their own mistakes,

00:37:52.298 --> 00:37:53.978
but they will not
look back and say

00:37:53.978 --> 00:37:55.616
there was no one there for me.

00:37:55.616 --> 00:37:57.020
That I will guarantee.

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:59.520
That's the beginning
of changing the world.

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:04.020
They will be fully operational,
equipped, young women

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:07.840
who at least knew one man who
really had their good at heart,

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:11.740
and that doesn't include their
father, who is also great.

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:14.960
So I'm just starting with that
in terms of what can I do.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:19.389
My two grandsons I hope will
go into the world understanding

00:38:19.389 --> 00:38:21.430
that they had a grandfather
who was humble enough

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:24.450
to apologize when he
yells at them and mean it,

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:27.525
who sends them out knowing that
manhood is not abusing people

00:38:27.525 --> 00:38:29.470
and lording over
them, who are not

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:33.000
going to join some fraternity
and think it's a good, fun

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.910
thing to get a young
woman drunk and abuse

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:39.160
here because they were
exposed to somebody

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:42.260
who treated them and treated the
women in his life around him,

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:46.930
at least at this age, with
some dignity and respect.

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:49.620
And instead of having a bunch
of crap stuff in the house

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:52.010
talking down to them,
there are open art books

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:53.830
in just about every room.

00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:56.520
And I don't think it's normal
to have a child growing up

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.390
knowing who all
the superheroes are

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:00.220
who's never heard of Mozart.

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:03.694
I don't think it's normal to
start with Disneyfied pablum

00:39:03.694 --> 00:39:05.860
when you have a world of
child literature out there.

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:06.984
So they will have had that.

00:39:06.984 --> 00:39:10.100
So I am investing
my time in trying

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:13.460
to be subversive of what I
think are the false values

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:15.100
of an entertainment culture.

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:16.780
Concentrate on the personal.

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:19.470
Concentrate on the
art that lasts.

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:20.389
Go for the good stuff.

00:39:20.389 --> 00:39:22.680
Try to get it into their
heads before all the marketers

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.540
arrive with the crap.

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:25.540
That's job one.

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:26.860
That's just the grandchildren.

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:30.050
Extend that out to
the grown children

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:31.620
and you are there
for them, and you

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.930
are apologizing for
the mistakes you made,

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:36.530
and you are talking
to your wife,

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:38.540
and they see you fight
with her, and you

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.530
are backing down and
saying, I'm sorry,

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:43.280
I've been an asshole today, and
you don't mind if they hear it.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.080
So they're growing
up in an environment

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:47.830
where this old idiot has
at least learned something

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:50.440
to pass on to them
by the doing of it.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.310
That to me is interacting
with the world.

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:54.890
And when it comes
to political things,

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:57.274
I was one of the first
bloggers for "Huffington Post."

00:39:57.274 --> 00:39:58.940
I have done a lot of
political blogging.

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:00.142
I have two kinds of writing.

00:40:00.142 --> 00:40:01.892
The nice guy is here,
and the cage fighter

00:40:01.892 --> 00:40:03.974
is in some of my blogs.

00:40:03.974 --> 00:40:05.390
For instance, the
one that I wrote

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:07.820
called, "The Slow Motion
Lynching of President Barack

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:13.220
Obama" that had a huge, millions
of reads around the world

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.560
and was about the fact
that I'm ashamed to be

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:18.440
a white American in a political
environment that takes

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:21.362
our first African-American
president, who also had more

00:40:21.362 --> 00:40:23.445
on his desk on day one
than anybody we've ever put

00:40:23.445 --> 00:40:25.670
in the White House,
treated him like shit,

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:28.000
lied about him
consistently, and formed

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.500
an entire governmental
opposition to this man based

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:35.560
on rather bring the country
down, risk the economy,

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:39.275
stall the government, default
on our international debts

00:40:39.275 --> 00:40:41.880
rather than let him have
any modicum of success.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:43.427
And so I say what
I think about that

00:40:43.427 --> 00:40:45.255
from the platform
of a writer who

00:40:45.255 --> 00:40:46.467
has a little big of platform.

00:40:46.467 --> 00:40:47.550
Not much-- I'm not famous.

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:48.466
I just earn my living.

00:40:48.466 --> 00:40:49.830
That's it.

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:51.930
But I do turn
around and hit hard

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:53.815
when it comes not to
defending my views

00:40:53.815 --> 00:40:55.970
but to political views.

00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:57.670
Now, right or
wrong, I don't think

00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:00.315
that those things can't go
together speaking of paradox.

00:41:00.315 --> 00:41:03.240
I think you can be this
grandfather who's concentrating

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.360
on what's in front of you.

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:06.144
And at the same time,
you can speak out

00:41:06.144 --> 00:41:07.060
and use your platform.

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:11.730
So those would be some of the
things that in my own life,

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:13.638
I try to work together.

00:41:13.638 --> 00:41:14.606
Yeah, another question.

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:20.410
Come on.

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:22.034
You all have something
you want to say.

00:41:22.034 --> 00:41:25.670
You can't have agreed with
everything I said or liked it.

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:27.990
Throw something.

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.677
Yes, please.

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:38.370
AUDIENCE: So I think a lot of
these ideas are really cool,

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:40.490
and they sound good,
especially for people

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:43.394
who work in an office all day.

00:41:43.394 --> 00:41:44.810
But I'm just
wondering what do you

00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:50.170
think about the other side in
terms of the only people who

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:52.700
go on a different path
and are college dropouts

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.000
that you hear from
are the ones who

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.040
are really successful like
Mark Zuckerberg or someone

00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:59.540
like that.

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:06.520
But the people who go off,
live an alternative lifestyle,

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:11.130
and find that they're not
able to succeed or just

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:13.560
have regrets or disillusionment.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:16.850
I'm just wondering if you've
experienced that-- if you

00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:18.079
have any perspective on that.

00:42:18.079 --> 00:42:20.120
FRANK SCHAEFFER: I think
that's a great question.

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:23.320
You only hear success
stories, alternative stuff.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.650
Remember, I came
out of the '60s.

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:28.620
So I know all about how
countercultural alternatives

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:29.950
turn out.

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:31.860
And they usually don't.

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:35.294
But I'm not talking so much
about dropping out of a system.

00:42:35.294 --> 00:42:36.793
I'm talking about
carving a life out

00:42:36.793 --> 00:42:41.320
within that where you get
your priorities straight.

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.720
It's up here.

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.110
It isn't out there.

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:47.636
So the fact of the matter is
the first business at hand

00:42:47.636 --> 00:42:51.410
is to decide what we really care
about as an individual whatever

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:53.320
the environment is
whether it's in an office,

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.486
whether it's in an corporation,
you're a freelancer,

00:42:55.486 --> 00:42:56.970
you're a writer,
self-unemployed,

00:42:56.970 --> 00:43:00.840
as I call myself--
whatever it may be.

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:02.660
That factor doesn't
change how we

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:03.925
relate to another human being.

00:43:03.925 --> 00:43:05.550
And this is why I'm
still so interested

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:07.200
in spirituality, and
most particularly,

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.280
the example of Christ.

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:12.030
And my atheist friends
will hate that I just

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:14.200
said Christ instead of
Jesus because that intimates

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.070
you think he's the Son of God.

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:18.030
So, hey, looking
into the camera here.

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:19.990
Stop being so theological.

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:22.360
I was raised the
way I was raised.

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:27.094
So I'll call him Christ
if I damn well want to.

00:43:27.094 --> 00:43:28.510
But the fact of
the matter is when

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:31.280
you look at the teaching
of Jesus who has never

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:34.890
the law with, he always said,
well, here's what the law says,

00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:37.010
and then he had this
big word he uses.

00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:38.660
But here's what I said use.

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:40.155
So the law says
throw these stones

00:43:40.155 --> 00:43:41.740
at this woman
caught in adultery.

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:43.220
But here's what I'm telling you.

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.780
The law says when he talks to
this American woman-- I have

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:49.347
some of this in the book--
we shouldn't even be talking

00:43:49.347 --> 00:43:51.430
together because I'm a
Jew, and you're [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:54.240
and this is like Jesus
meeting a leader from ISIS.

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.530
Really, they hated each other.

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:56.970
We shouldn't even be
on the same mountain.

00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:58.640
She is saying, we
shouldn't be talking.

00:43:58.640 --> 00:43:59.890
He says, none of this matters.

00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:01.680
The day is coming
when it's not going

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:05.490
to be an issue of the law
but truth and spirit--

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:07.680
exactly what I'm
talking about here.

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:13.010
So I think that our battle
is not where we work.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:15.010
Our battle is not our career.

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:17.970
Our battle is not whether
you're working in an office

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:21.325
or drop out and live this
fanciful, Mark Zuckerberg,

00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:23.340
whatever it is, life.

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:27.910
I think our battle genuinely
is a spiritual battle.

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:30.410
And it's the battle to see
other human beings as we

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:33.550
see ourselves first and not
to see everybody around us

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:36.260
as useful tools to climb
something that, in the end,

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:38.135
turns out to be
totally self-defeating

00:44:38.135 --> 00:44:39.885
because while climbing
it, we have ignored

00:44:39.885 --> 00:44:42.093
the real thing that would
have given our life purpose

00:44:42.093 --> 00:44:43.260
and meaning.

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:45.760
So I don't think this
battle is won or lost

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:49.200
by people who are conventional
or unconventional or corporate

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.510
or artistic.

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:54.200
The most people creative in
the world right now are working

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:57.630
often in corporations like
Google, like Microsoft,

00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:59.200
like Facebook .

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.030
It isn't a question
of the artist types

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:04.340
and the spiritual types
versus the creative types

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:05.781
versus the business types.

00:45:05.781 --> 00:45:07.280
There's an amalgam
there, and that's

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.510
another paradoxical truth.

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:11.760
So I would just say,
spirituality really matters.

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.760
This is one place
I totally get off

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.635
the boat with the new
atheist movement that

00:45:15.635 --> 00:45:17.641
boils all down to
science and fact

00:45:17.641 --> 00:45:19.140
in the same way
that fundamentalists

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:22.280
of the Christian Right boil
it all down to theology,

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:25.970
taking America back--
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:30.110
I think we have to come up with
a different vocabulary that

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:32.030
bypasses these surface
differences-- who

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:35.570
works in an office, who's gay,
who's straight, who's black,

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:37.720
who's white-- who's
a grandfather, who's

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:38.759
never had any kids?

00:45:38.759 --> 00:45:40.550
And understand, there's
a much deeper truth

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:44.240
we're all going for, and
that is our relationship

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:46.890
with human beings around
us, and through them,

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:48.894
the world around all of us.

00:45:48.894 --> 00:45:51.820
And that's something that's a
matter of how we see things.

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:55.910
Now, weirdly enough, that
also leads to a create life.

00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:57.570
And I think the two
things go together.

00:45:57.570 --> 00:46:00.140
So that may not be a
full enough answer,

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:02.372
but it's the best I can do.

00:46:02.372 --> 00:46:02.872
Yeah?

00:46:02.872 --> 00:46:03.580
Another question.

00:46:05.824 --> 00:46:07.740
AUDIENCE: So it seems
to me that you're really

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:10.884
making a comment here about
human element and that

00:46:10.884 --> 00:46:12.800
[INAUDIBLE], and that
we shouldn't really live

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:14.760
in these different extremes.

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.025
But when we look
at our government,

00:46:17.025 --> 00:46:23.660
we have the guns, religious,
Republican views--

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:24.380
all the stuff.

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:26.530
Then we have the far Left.

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:29.300
What are your thoughts on that,
and how do we break this cycle

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:32.946
and get out of this
packaging that everything

00:46:32.946 --> 00:46:34.319
has to sit in today?

00:46:34.319 --> 00:46:36.860
FRANK SCHAEFFER: Well, I think
one way the cycle gets broken,

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.720
and I promise you
I'm not doing this

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:42.506
because of where-- because of
this-- the Google thing here.

00:46:42.506 --> 00:46:48.140
But the availability of
information and choice is huge.

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:50.300
So one of the big
generational shifts--

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:51.970
it's not an accident,
for instance,

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:55.620
that the attitudes towards gay
men and women and transgender

00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:57.450
and transexual
people has changed.

00:46:57.450 --> 00:46:59.640
Sure, there is some
cultural impetus.

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:02.010
Sure, there was some
entertainment and some TV

00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:04.486
programs that humanize people.

00:47:04.486 --> 00:47:06.438
But the real thing
is the same phenomena

00:47:06.438 --> 00:47:08.820
that you find in a family
where someone is gay

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:11.320
or they know someone who's gay,
and it's like wait a minute,

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:12.860
it isn't them anymore.

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:18.040
It's my friend Joe over
here or my daughter whoever.

00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:25.279
The humanizing of the
other is the battle today.

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:33.880
The humanizing of the
other is our battle today.

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.030
And the question is,
how do we do this?

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:39.660
Well, Google is doing it simply
by putting the information

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:42.090
out there.

00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:44.470
It's not achieving
the final result.

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:46.640
That's up to individual
human beings.

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:52.550
But it's hard to demonize people
you know a click away when you

00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:57.260
can have their life, and their
picture, their story-- whatever

00:47:57.260 --> 00:47:58.620
they're putting on YouTube.

00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:01.140
It's tough to demonize them
because now we know them

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:03.510
intimately in a way
two generations ago,

00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:05.780
no one could know
anyone who didn't

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:07.800
spend a lifetime researching.

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:10.240
So the intimacy of the
information highway

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:14.110
is one of the great things
we can look for to help us.

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:15.530
This has to continue.

00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:17.380
And what we mustn't
allow to happen,

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:19.610
and this is my own
humble opinion,

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:22.660
I'm certainly not an expert, is
commercializing the information

00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:24.680
highway to the point
where it looks like you're

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:28.410
being conned when you go on it.

00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:30.700
This will poison us.

00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:34.762
This will poison us because
we need to keep it idealistic.

00:48:34.762 --> 00:48:36.610
We have to have accessibility.

00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:38.282
So I think that's
one huge point.

00:48:38.282 --> 00:48:40.157
and the second point I
think that's happening

00:48:40.157 --> 00:48:41.700
is that I'm not pessimistic.

00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:44.334
I think there's a generational
shift taking place.

00:48:44.334 --> 00:48:47.450
The anger you see gathered
around Donald Trump--

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:50.450
these insane people who--
Mexicans are rapists.

00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:51.780
And we've got to build walls.

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:55.910
All this horrible, and may I
just say it, un-American filth

00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:59.324
of fascist crap.

00:48:59.324 --> 00:49:00.452
It's not American.

00:49:00.452 --> 00:49:01.660
This is not in our tradition.

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:03.740
Well, sure, it's Jefferson
being a slave owner.

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:05.160
It's very American.

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.680
But it's not the
America we all want

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:12.110
to think we're part of-- this
circle the wagons attitude.

00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:15.640
The only way to combat that is
for the succeeding generation,

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:18.910
the younger people, to simply
hold in their long enough

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:22.492
for these idiots to
begin to go away.

00:49:22.492 --> 00:49:23.950
And when you look
at, for instance,

00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:29.640
who Fox News's basic viewer
is, he's a guy my age.

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:33.470
And he is like me, not going
to be around as long as some

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:34.990
of the younger
people in this room,

00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:36.114
although I intend on being.

00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:42.200
So I think there's a
generational shift coming.

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:45.990
I wouldn't get too terribly
pessimistic right now.

00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:47.180
I think there really is.

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:50.260
And I think the
fury you see in ISIS

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:52.140
and the fury you
see in the Taliban

00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:55.390
and this horror of destroying
the great cultural monuments

00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:58.720
of North Africa in the name
of Islam, all this stuff,

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:01.410
or why people would
coalesce around

00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:03.490
a Donald Trump and his
hate-filled language

00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:06.110
and the whole Republican
effort to try to shut down

00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:09.680
President Obama over
these last years,

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:13.160
actually, there's an
encouraging part to that,

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:14.890
because in my experience
of human life,

00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:17.620
anyway, you don't get
that level of passion

00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:20.280
from people who feel
secure and that they're

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:21.160
on the winning side.

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:22.478
They know they're losing.

00:50:22.478 --> 00:50:23.780
The demographics are shifting.

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:28.010
This country will be brown,
and we are becoming younger

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:31.490
in terms of our attitudes and
gay people will get married,

00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:34.160
and it doesn't matter
whether somebody

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:36.280
says she won't give
a marriage license

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:38.110
or Donald Trump comes along.

00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:40.380
It's sound and fury
signifying nothing.

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:42.390
It's damn hard to
live through if you're

00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:43.930
looking toward a future.

00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:48.390
But, actually, and I know you
don't hear this too often,

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:50.800
but I'm very optimistic
about the future of North

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.320
America in so many ways.

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:55.510
As I go around talking in
schools and universities,

00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:57.860
I don't meet hate-filled people.

00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.570
I talk to people who
are open to others

00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:02.090
most of the time,
who want to live

00:51:02.090 --> 00:51:04.524
lives that incorporate others.

00:51:04.524 --> 00:51:07.160
Attitudes are changing, and I
think the information highway

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:08.890
has a lot to do with
that, and I think,

00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:11.304
as I've said in the book,
one of the things I say

00:51:11.304 --> 00:51:12.970
"Why I'm an Atheist
Who Believes in God"

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:14.680
is one of the paradoxes
in my own life

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:18.030
is that the most spiritually
alive place right now is,

00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:21.590
you could say, the least
traditional and the least

00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:26.780
spiritual in that it's also,
again, the internet highway.

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:28.911
The discussion I have
on my Facebook page.

00:51:28.911 --> 00:51:30.660
I happen to answer all
the messages I get.

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:32.640
I happen to answer
all my emails.

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:36.700
I try to take that human
element into a discussion

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:37.430
with my readers.

00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:40.620
It's one reason I
enjoy being a writer.

00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:42.452
It's being facilitated,
paradoxically,

00:51:42.452 --> 00:51:44.410
by something that doesn't
seem to have anything

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:47.910
to do with spirituality,
and yet it really does.
