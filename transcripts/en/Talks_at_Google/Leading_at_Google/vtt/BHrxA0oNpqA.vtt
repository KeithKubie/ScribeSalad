I'm ecstatic to have

a prolific person with

00:00:14.315 --> 00:00:18.690

I'll introduce Wilson White,

00:00:39.454 --> 00:00:40.749
Malkia.

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:42.290
MALKIA CYRIL: Didn't
do none of that.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.740

Born of parents in the Black

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.815
and originally from Brooklyn--

00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:57.575
MALKIA CYRIL: Brooklyn!

00:01:57.575 --> 00:02:00.816
SPEAKER 1: More
specifically, Bed Stuy,

00:02:00.816 --> 00:02:03.062
Malkia is now one of
the few leaders of color

00:02:03.062 --> 00:02:05.020

and a proud leader in the
Black Lives Matter Network.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.729
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.364
Wilson White and Malkia Cyril.

00:02:14.364 --> 00:02:17.112
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:17.112 --> 00:02:18.730
WILSON WHITE: All
right, so I think

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.090
we're going to have a pretty
fascinating discussion

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.390
with Malkia here today.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.080
In terms of how
this will work, I

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.530
will get us kicked off with a
few questions back and forth,

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.050
and then kick if
off to the audience.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.019
I think people on livestream
can also ask questions as well.

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.810
But just to kind of
set the frame for this,

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.920
I did not grow up in
Brooklyn, New York.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.770
I grew up in a very small
town in South Carolina.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.900
Attended church every day,
grew up in the AME Church.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.660
And whenever I'm in
a setting like this

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.815
where I have to moderate
something or give

00:02:54.815 --> 00:02:58.739
a public talk, I'm reminded of
what my pastor told growing up.

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.280
Which is, whenever
you're doing this,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.100
you've got to
remember the five Bs.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.342
Which is, be brief,
brother, be brief.

00:03:06.342 --> 00:03:09.491
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:09.990
Yeah.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.406
Taking that advice
from my pastor,

00:03:11.406 --> 00:03:12.672
I'm just going to jump in.

00:03:12.672 --> 00:03:15.660
We've heard a bit
about your bio,

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.040
but I'd like you to give us a
little more context and color

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.590
on where you've been, and how
you ended up doing the work

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.950
that you're doing at the
Center for Media Justice.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:25.950
MALKIA CYRIL: All right.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:26.949
Well, thanks for asking.

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:28.521
Can y'all hear me all right?

00:03:28.521 --> 00:03:31.500
I don't know about the
whole mic situation.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.430
But I was born in
Brooklyn, Bed Stuy.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.110
And those who may go
to Bed Stuy today,

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.830
you have absolutely no idea
what it looked like in the 19--

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.390
in the mid-1970s and the 1980s.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.970
Because then it was a war zone.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.280
Then there were heaps
of trash burning

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.700
and large tenements that
were completely undealt with.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.170
It is the largest
black community

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.990
in the country, black
neighborhood in the country.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.310
It was one of the
poorest outside of--

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.760
in the Northeast,
black neighborhoods

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.162
in the country, and I
lived on the corner.

00:04:14.162 --> 00:04:17.649
Now, I don't know-- anyone
who grew up in a hood,

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.920
like in a ghetto,
in an urban ghetto,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.770
knows what the corner is like.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.350
Because that's where
everything goes down.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.160
And I always asked my mom,
why would you move us here?

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.800
Why would you-- you were
in the Black Panther Party.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.050
You knew all about the black
liberation and black power.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.680
Why would you move us to a
place where we could die?

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.180
You know?

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.115
I felt like that was
a legitimate question.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.620
And she would say to me,
well, I could move you

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.140
to a white neighborhood.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.980
I could send you somewhere
where you would fear yourself

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.680
and other people like you.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.320
I could put you
in private school,

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.880
and you could grow up with lots
of chances, lots of whatever.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.170
But you wouldn't
have fought for that,

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.920
and those chances
wouldn't be chances

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.810
that then anyone else
around you, other people,

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.970
were able to receive
because of you.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.080
So we're here in order
to fight for our people.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.330
It's not just about you, and
it's not just about your life.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.140
It's about our lives together.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.720
And it was a hard lesson
for me, because as a child,

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.590
it's like, no, it's about me.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.780
But she made it very clear from
the gate that it's never just

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.690
about me.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.660
Another funny thing that
she always used to do,

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.660
or that I think this story
gives you a good picture

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.750
into how I came to be here.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.556
So it was mentioned
that I was poet.

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:58.840
So I wrote a chat book.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.840
I got it published by
Kitchen Table Press, which

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.070
is the press that Audrey
Lorn, and Barbara Smith,

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.460
and folks who were originally
affiliated with it.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.190
And I was about 13
or 14, and my mom--

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.880
it was all my mom's pushing
to make that happen.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.580
She bought all these
copies of the book,

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.090
and she's like, yes, now
let's go to Restoration Plaza

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.530
and sell these books.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.030
I'm like, OK.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.490
So I go to Restoration Plaza,
which is like a little shopping

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.500
area in Brooklyn.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.000
Sold all the books.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.410
I make like $1,500.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:31.590
I'm so excited.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:32.370
I'm like, yes.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.320
I got money in my pocket, I
didn't even have to sell drugs.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.470
I'm rich-- $1,500.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.320
So I bring the money back,
and she's like, OK, great.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.020
And she peels off a $100
bill and gives it to me.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.699
I said, I'm confused.

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:45.990
WILSON WHITE: Yeah, $1,500 is--

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.760
MALKIA CYRIL: I sold $1,500
and did all the work.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.380
And she said, you know
when you have a gift, that

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.640
means you have to give it.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.815
It doesn't belong to you.

00:06:53.815 --> 00:06:56.190
All of the rest of this money
is going to the local women

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.499
and children's shelter.

00:06:57.499 --> 00:06:58.790
And that's what happened to it.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.810
So that's like how
I was raised, right?

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.700
You know, it's not
just about you.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.980
It's about your people.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.560
When your body is on the
line, it's for a reason.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.990
And so my mom was a member
of the Black Panther Party.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.740
She ran their breakfast program
in the New York Chapter.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.530
She also was editor for the
"Black Panther Newspaper."

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.125
So she taught me really early
on an appreciation for art,

00:07:25.125 --> 00:07:28.540
for culture, for words.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.710
She believed in journalism.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.350
She was an educator.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.950
She ran out of the
wider community college

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:39.040
in New York all of the
educational programs for folks

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.810
in prison in New York.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.640
So that is where I come from.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.150
And so coming into a focus on
media and telecommunications

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.530
technology, [AUDIO OUT].

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.560
WILSON WHITE: Having
that background--

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.500
MALKIA CYRIL: Yeah, it
was very easy for me.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.291
WILSON WHITE: We're
saying that background,

00:07:56.291 --> 00:07:58.405
the context from your
upbringing, how that made

00:07:58.405 --> 00:08:01.420
the transition into what
you're doing in terms of media

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.609
adjustment was fairly easy.

00:08:02.609 --> 00:08:03.400
MALKIA CYRIL: Yeah.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.260
So let me crystallize that.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:10.890
So number one, in the '80s,
news coverage was filled with

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.060
stereotypes about
superpredators,

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:18.260
black teenage superpredators,
black crack babies,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.300
black welfare moms--

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.870
black, black, black criminals.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.470
And that was about me.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:29.550
That was about me and my
friends and my family.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:34.309
And so as I became an
organizer, my first mandate

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:37.490
was always to address
this question of me

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.760
and how the infrastructure
of meaning--

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.669
the news, the
education system, all

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:45.830
of these pieces
of infrastructure

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.250
that produce what we read,
watch, and listen to,

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.320
how they're implicated.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.230
And they are part of the problem
if what they produce actually

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:58.310
results in these criminalizing
policies, so on and so forth.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:02.720
So that became my focus,
laser-sharp, as I moved on.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.270
But I realized that I can't do
anything about the narrative

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.810
problem if I don't address
the structural problem

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.430
behind those narratives.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:11.900
So that's how I came here.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.110
That's why I work on technology
policy, media policy, and all

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:16.550
of that.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:17.990
I'm not a lawyer.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.370
I'm not a policy wonk.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:20.330
I'm not a technologist.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:24.780
I'm an organizer who cares
about how meaning is produced

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.924
and what that means for
black and brown people

00:09:26.924 --> 00:09:27.590
in this country.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.856
WILSON WHITE: Very good.

00:09:27.856 --> 00:09:29.990
So I want to stick
with that theme.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.540
So in preparing for
this talk, I had

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:36.735
this wide-ranging discussion
that I was prepared to do.

00:09:36.735 --> 00:09:40.190
And then on Friday, the verdict
came down in the Castile

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.320
shooting case out in Minnesota.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.310
And I felt like having
this conversation with you,

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:49.310
I'd be remiss if we didn't
talk about that case,

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.080
particularly as
it relates to what

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.910
you do in terms of the media
and narratives that come out

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:55.950
of the media.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:58.713
So, of course, I was hurt by--

00:09:58.713 --> 00:10:04.310
I still am-- the verdict
itself, a verdict of acquittal.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:06.190
Not because of that
individual case,

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:10.670
but because it's the next
chapter of essentially

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:16.150
a law-abiding citizen being
killed by a police [INAUDIBLE]..

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.140
This was the next
chapter of that.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:22.450
But what I was most struck by
was the media response, or lack

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:25.890
of response, to that verdict.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:29.470
Is the media just exhausted
with these killers?

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:31.222
Is society exhausted?

00:10:31.222 --> 00:10:32.810
Why is that?

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:36.560
MALKIA CYRIL: Look, we're
dealing with 400 years

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.270
of anti-black criminalization.

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.950
So that is going
to show up in how

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:46.310
news talks about the murder--

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:48.520
and I will continue
to call it a murder--

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.100
of a black man on Facebook Live.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.500
Everybody could see it.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.300
So let me back up.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.100
So number one, I
always say that you

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:02.860
can't extract 400 years of white
supremacy from any institution

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:10.180
simply by adding technology.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.931
So people thought that by the
fact that you could watch--

00:11:12.931 --> 00:11:14.430
WILSON WHITE: Yeah,
cellphone video.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.666
MALKIA CYRIL: --the cellphone
videos, Facebook Live,

00:11:17.666 --> 00:11:18.970
body-worn cameras.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.990
The fact that you could
watch would somehow

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.230
increase the measure of justice.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:24.430
That's not the case.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.240
Watching is not justice.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.240
It's just watching.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.310
So I'll say this.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:33.040
Number one, I'm hurt.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.420
But I also understand that
this is a structural problem.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:43.030
These news outlets are at
the very top, mostly white.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.900
At the very top,
they're mostly men.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.830
That is just the fact.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:49.240
And so when it
comes time to make

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.200
editorial decisions,
about, number one,

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:58.750
do you take the official
word of police as the truth?

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.290
That's the first question
that often these journalists

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:05.380
have to answer when they're
reporting on these cases.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.900
So, for example, the
sister who was just

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.450
murdered yesterday in Seattle--

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:15.090
a pregnant black woman
called the police

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.470
to report a burglary,
opened the door.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.840
She had a knife, presumptively--

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.520
presumably, rather, because
she was being burgled.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.220
She thought she
was being burgled.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.480
She had mental health issues.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.770
They shot her almost on-site.

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:29.950
She's dead in front
of her three children.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:30.116
WILSON WHITE: Yeah.

00:12:30.116 --> 00:12:31.115
And she called the cops.

00:12:31.115 --> 00:12:33.990
MALKIA CYRIL: She called them.

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:38.615
And whether we're talking
about black men, black women,

00:12:38.615 --> 00:12:41.530
our Muslim brothers and
sisters across race who are

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:44.270
being murdered by vigilantes.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:47.730
Because I want to really
also say that police--

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:49.470
it's not just the
official police.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.070
It's also those who
feel that they've

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:56.260
been deputized by this
heightened white supremacy

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.120
that we're dealing
with right now.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.110
So whether it's the
official police or those

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:03.016
who feel they have
been deputized

00:13:03.016 --> 00:13:07.840
by this type of policing,
we are dealing with a moment

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:16.940
where anti-black criminalization
is being pumped up

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.640
by media coverage.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.460
It's being sustained
by media coverage.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.460
And I think that these
outlets have a responsibility

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:29.560
to be very clear that the
police narrative is not

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.380
the official story.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.070
Let me just say this.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:37.940
The title, the headline when the
woman was killed in Seattle--

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:38.830
so yesterday.

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:42.760
It said, "armed woman
killed by police."

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.610
How do you know she was armed?

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.240
Was there some video?

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.870
It's just basically
the police statement

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.040
that they built the
headline off of.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.500
So this is the kind of
practice that we have to end.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.640
This is the kind of
practice that news outlets

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.870
have to stop doing right now.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:01.150
I don't think it's fatigue.

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:01.810
I really don't.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:03.970
I think it's racism.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.770
And I think that
they've been reporting

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:07.420
like this from the gate.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.470
This is not new.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:10.840
So that's where we're at.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.840
We need to directly
confront any outlet that

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.180
has an editorial role.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.800
And that's not just news media.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.860
That's also social media and
other kinds of technology

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.890
companies that curate that--

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:26.420
WILSON WHITE: So let me
stay there for a second,

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.060
because I'm still
processing this.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.960
And I saw the news of
the Seattle incident

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.390
yesterday when that came
across the wire as well.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.210
So this is still top of mind.

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:39.860
So as a lawyer, I know there's
Supreme Court precedent,

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.360
at least in this
country, in the US,

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.225
that gives law enforcement
significantly--

00:14:45.225 --> 00:14:47.080
I think the standard
is something

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:51.260
like law enforcement officers
can discharge by standard force

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:56.350
if they believe or have a
fear that the suspect poses

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:57.400
a threat to them.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.444
So even if that threat
is that this person is

00:15:00.444 --> 00:15:01.860
going to charge
them with a first,

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.220
they can discharge their
weapon and kill the person,

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.170
almost with impunity.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:09.190
And that's kind of written
into a Supreme Court precedent,

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:13.350
which, as you know-- and that's
kind of what you stated here--

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:17.860
by having that fear be
part of the legal standard,

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:25.240
it almost bakes in that racial
bias into the legal standard.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.040
So from an organizing
standpoint,

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.520
because you are an
organizer, what can or should

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.890
we be doing to try to put
pressure on the system

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.800
to change that legal standard?

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.531
Which, I think,
in a lot of ways,

00:15:36.531 --> 00:15:38.280
is the reason why we
don't see convictions

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.280
in these types of cases.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.200
MALKIA CYRIL: I think
that's a great question.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.270
And I don't think anyone
has a very clear answer,

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:44.470
to be honest.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.090
I think that,
first of all, let's

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.630
understand that some
of the first police

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:50.650
officers in this country were--

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:55.000
their job was to catch
runaway slaves and to patrol.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.660
Their purpose was largely
to capture runaway slaves

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.000
and patrol for runaway slaves.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:08.620
Early legal precedent
dictated that a black man

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.990
has no rights a white
man is bound to respect.

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:16.540
All of these legal
standards have

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.110
been baked into how we
think about and deal

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:21.520
with policing in this country.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.480
And so when you
ask this question,

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:30.700
what can be done to extract or
to add pressure to the system?

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:34.390
Number one, there's an
entire legal strategy at work

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:38.477
that folks are using, both
in terms of trying to--

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:45.280
so there are lots of
places where lawyers are

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.320
trying to attack the system.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.994
One of the places
that organizers

00:16:48.994 --> 00:16:50.410
are trying to
attack the system is

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:54.080
by changing who our prosecutors
are in different cities

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.400
and states.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.210
So there's been an entire
campaign by Color of Change

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:02.340
to transform the face
of prosecutors and DAs

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.422
in this country.

00:17:03.422 --> 00:17:05.810
I think that's one way, right?

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.650
But we also see that in
Baltimore, when a district

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:14.319
attorney tried to actually
convict some officers,

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:17.410
not only did that
not happen, but she

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:21.890
was completely outcasted and
also made into a criminal.

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.849
She faced criminal charges,
because that's what

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:26.630
the system is set up to do.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:28.060
And it's not set up--

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.670
so when we talk
about police reform,

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:33.580
when we talk about, for
example, body-worn cameras,

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:37.330
this is one place where there's,
I think, a false solution being

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:40.420
offered, where you're
offering to people

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:47.160
this opportunity to
record, but that does not

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.550
invest any change.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:52.320
There's no change
involved in that.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.560
These piecemeal
reforms are not going

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.060
to make it so that police
don't kill black people.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.901
The only thing that
will make it so police

00:17:59.901 --> 00:18:01.400
don't kill black
people is if we are

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:07.600
able to abolish policing
as we currently know it

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.060
and rebuild it
into something that

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:12.280
actually has a new
form of security,

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.660
new forms of accountability.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:17.230
That's the only thing that
I think is going to work.

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:22.000
We can attack-- we can run
our various legal strategies.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.070
We can make piecemeal reforms.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.960
But we can see--

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.490
right now, the
Justice Department

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:28.690
is actively rolling
back any reforms

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:32.480
that have been moved forward Any
consent decrees, any of that.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.870
So in reality, what
we know is this--

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:37.190
it's a question of power.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:40.810
Who has the power will
determine what the results are.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:44.650
And two, these piecemeal
reforms, they just don't work.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:47.260
We've been trying them
for hundreds of years.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.574
They do not work.

00:18:49.574 --> 00:18:51.740
WILSON WHITE: I want to
clap, but I'm the moderator,

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:55.230
so I'm not supposed
to be clapping.

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:56.680
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.500
I agree with that, Malkia.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:02.230
And I think that is a
significant challenge

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:03.010
for our country.

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:05.400
And so, personally,
I'm glad to see

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.627
that we have soldiers like
you on the battlefield,

00:19:08.627 --> 00:19:10.710
pushing these issues and
raising our consciousness

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.340
on the importance of making
sure that that kind of stuff

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:14.220
is done.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:18.100
I'm going to try to get off my
soapbox on the police shooting

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.150
issues for a second and switch
now to one of the things

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.730
that you've been
very outspoken on.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:28.500
And that's net neutrality
as a civil rights issue.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.130
So net neutrality is
certainly an issue

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:36.310
that we are in the thick of
as Google, as an internet

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.325
content company.

00:19:38.325 --> 00:19:40.450
But this notion of net
neutrality as a civil rights

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:40.950
issue.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:42.089
What do you mean by that?

00:19:42.089 --> 00:19:43.630
MALKIA CYRIL: Well,
let's not get off

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:47.230
the soapbox of police shootings,
because net neutrality has

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:50.356
everything to do with whether
or not police can shoot and kill

00:19:50.356 --> 00:19:51.770
us with impunity.

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:53.530
Here's the reality.

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:58.510
I don't care about Netflix
versus Comcast versus--

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:01.069
I don't care about
these big companies.

00:20:01.069 --> 00:20:02.110
You know what I'm saying?

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:03.220
I honestly don't.

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:06.100
What I care about
is Philando Castile.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.040
I care about whether
or not you'll

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:14.890
be able to see this shooting and
have the spark of outrage that

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:18.075
can turn into a wildfire
of protests, that can turn

00:20:18.075 --> 00:20:19.640
into a movement for change.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.990
Because the thing is that
without being able to see it,

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.020
you can't do that.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.330
That's the bottom line.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:28.650
And for me, that's what net
neutrality is all about.

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:29.525
You know what I mean?

00:20:29.525 --> 00:20:32.815
For some people, it's a
contest between major companies

00:20:32.815 --> 00:20:35.660
and who can get
the fastest access.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.210
There's a question around
what the market can bear

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:40.585
and what it can't,
and regulating

00:20:40.585 --> 00:20:41.950
that and all of that.

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:43.770
And that's for other
people to talk about.

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:48.370
Somebody else can come and talk
to you about those specifics.

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:49.450
I'm fine with that.

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:52.450
For me, I only care
about net neutrality

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:56.040
because it opens the
door for more mobility.

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.930
It opens the door for black
people to speak freely.

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:01.470
It opens the door
for us to bypass

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:03.027
what I consider to be a--

00:21:03.027 --> 00:21:04.110
not what I consider to be.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:09.670
What facts tell us is a
white-dominated cable news

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:11.110
media.

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:13.360
You know, entertainment media.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.520
From entertainment
to news, right?

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.890
That we're able to
bypass those gatekeepers

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:19.140
and speak for ourselves.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.920
That's what we've been
trying to do from day one.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:26.620
When we built the first
black press and white writers

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.170
came and burned it down, we were
trying to speak for ourselves,

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:31.595
to plead our own cause.

00:21:31.595 --> 00:21:33.470
And that's what we're
trying to do right now.

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:40.230
Now, there are some
who profit from the--

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:43.080
let me say this thoughtfully.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:47.530
There are black organizations,
Latino organizations,

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:51.780
Asian organizations,
who have decided

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:57.832
that the only way to and to--

00:21:57.832 --> 00:22:01.290
I want to be real thoughtful
about how I speak here.

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:07.500
But that the only way to make
their money and be sustainable

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.636
is to partner with
telecommunications companies.

00:22:11.636 --> 00:22:16.150
Now, the thing is that if you've
been alive for the last 10

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:19.970
years, you also know that
those same organizations are

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:21.820
fading in significance.

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:25.900
That a generation is
emerging that wants

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.810
more than a partnership
with the same companies that

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:31.600
are denying them mortgages.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.730
We don't want to just
partner with Wells Fargo.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:38.050
We don't want to simply march
in parades with the Homeland

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:39.070
Security.

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:41.990
That's why we protest
at gay pride parades.

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:43.660
They're like, but you're gay.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.775
I'm like, not that kind
of gay-- born black.

00:22:45.775 --> 00:22:47.305
You know what I'm saying?

00:22:47.305 --> 00:22:48.180
You know what I mean?

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.040
That's why we protest,
because it's not--

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.610
we're not interested
anymore in receiving

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:57.929
their handouts in order
for us to get our freedom,

00:22:57.929 --> 00:22:59.470
because it won't
lead to our freedom.

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:04.690
So net neutrality for me
is not only an opportunity

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:08.770
to divest from that
kind of corporate power.

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:13.840
It's also an opportunity
to invest in black speech,

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.670
in black-- in a different kind
of black power, 21st century

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:21.260
black power that allows
us to not only speak

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:24.411
freely, but create our black
businesses that we create

00:23:24.411 --> 00:23:24.910
online.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:27.855
When people talk about
Black Twitter, it's like--

00:23:27.855 --> 00:23:28.690
I hate that.

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:32.320
Because you're giving all the
love to Twitter, but black

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.520
is the part that is making it
interesting and profitable.

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:40.280
And it's the content
creators that are--

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.255
they might speak on Twitter.

00:23:42.255 --> 00:23:43.570
But actually, they're bloggers.

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:46.030
And they have
their own websites,

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:49.150
you know what I'm saying, that
create all of this content that

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:52.730
then becomes the--

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:54.700
that gets the name
Black Twitter.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.280
So that's what I mean when
I say net neutrality is

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:58.700
a civil rights issue.

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:03.990
It's an opportunity to bypass
structural racism in media.

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:07.400
It's an opportunity to
bypass economic racism

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.170
and create online.

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:13.180
It's an opportunity to
build movements and build

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.910
political power that is
decentralized, distributed,

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:20.224
and doesn't rely on
the Democratic party.

00:24:20.224 --> 00:24:21.640
And I think that
that is something

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.720
that we need more
than ever today.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.930
WILSON WHITE: Well, we see
the current administration

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:30.670
is taking steps to kind of
rollback some of the steps that

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:34.900
were taken on the net neutrality
conversation previously.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:38.460
Do you think that this
position, this perspective

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.530
on net neutrality as
a civil rights thing,

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:46.530
as a divide issue, do
you think that's getting

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:50.500
the type of audience that it
should get in this debate?

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.900
MALKIA CYRIL: No.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:56.050
What's happening is this--

00:24:56.050 --> 00:25:00.820
we have an FCC
chair, the Chairman

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:06.120
of the Federal Communications
Commission, who is--

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:10.780
let's say-- so first, he decided
to eliminate broadband privacy

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:15.240
rules that had been
hard-fought and won.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:18.160
He just eliminated
the prison phone

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.350
rules that we won also that
lowered the cost of calls

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.880
from prison.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.309
So he eliminated those.

00:25:24.309 --> 00:25:25.975
And when I say
"eliminated," what he did

00:25:25.975 --> 00:25:27.530
was he refused to
fight for them,

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.250
and so the court
eliminated them.

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:32.620
And so it's in that context.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:36.610
It's in the context
of an FCC chairman,

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:40.750
chosen by Donald
Trump, who is rolling

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:44.870
back all of the civil
and consumer rights

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:47.780
policies that have been won
over the last five years.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:54.670
So the attack now on net
neutrality, the justifications

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:59.180
that are being used are,
one, it's bad for investment.

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:02.590
Well, demonstrate to me
any evidence of that.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:03.560
Because they can't.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.330
There's no evidence of that.

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.240
So it's a talking point.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.630
And they keep saying it
will hurt smaller ISPs.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:13.830
But the actual evidence that
has been produced/demonstrated

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:18.430
that actually those small ISPs
have thrived over the last five

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:21.910
years of which net
neutrality has been--

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.400
over the last three
years that net neutrality

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.280
has been the rule of the land.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.800
The second justification they
give is it's not necessary.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.400
We've been doing fine for
the last however many years.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.492
It's good.

00:26:34.492 --> 00:26:35.950
And I'm thinking
to myself, it just

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:40.450
reminds me of when people
marched on the South,

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:43.014
and Southern white
sheriffs said,

00:26:43.014 --> 00:26:44.430
why do you want
to come up in here

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.820
and stir up the good Negroes?

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:48.210
We fine.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.126
We don't have any problems here.

00:26:51.126 --> 00:26:53.250
So this is the thing--
they're fine because they're

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:57.120
talking about a status
quo that was never fine.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:01.510
And why we need rules
in the first place

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:04.330
is because there's been
a concentration of power,

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:07.370
corporate power,
that will further

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:10.014
deny people of color--
not only black,

00:27:10.014 --> 00:27:11.430
but other people
of color as well,

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:14.440
and poor people across race--
the opportunity to speak.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.540
That's why we need
those rules in place.

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:19.430
So, no, I don't think
that net neutrality

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:22.176
as a civil rights issue
is, at this point,

00:27:22.176 --> 00:27:23.550
under the current
administration,

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:28.760
going to get any play at
all, unless we make it so.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.450
If we do it, yes.

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:33.070
And we're going to have
to step up our tactics.

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:36.730
I believe that it's
not like before where

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:41.350
we could go in and negotiate
with semi-reasonable people

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:43.940
and have a conversation.

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.580
It's not like that.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:46.485
This is now.

00:27:46.485 --> 00:27:48.790
Let me tell you what they did.

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:52.050
People did a protest at
the FCC, and so the FCC

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:54.490
banned them for life.

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:55.660
You can't do that.

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:56.590
That's illegal.

00:27:56.590 --> 00:28:00.610
You can't ban people
for life from a public--

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:02.930
you can't do it,
but they did it.

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:04.310
That's what they said.

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:06.310
They told them they can't
wear any t-shirts that

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:08.437
say anything about
net neutrality--

00:28:08.437 --> 00:28:09.520
only about net neutrality.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.311
You could wear t-shirts
about other things.

00:28:11.311 --> 00:28:12.220
You can't do that.

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:14.170
That's a First
Amendment violation.

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:17.370
You cannot do that.

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:19.760
So this is what we're
dealing with right now.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.750
So this is not a
reasonable situation.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:25.077
It is beyond the question
of net neutrality.

00:28:25.077 --> 00:28:26.910
I don't even like the
term "net neutrality."

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:30.010
As a black person, you know
the internet is not neutral.

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:32.120
We know that.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.981
So whatever, you
know what I mean?

00:28:33.981 --> 00:28:37.150
I'll speak their language
so we can get it done.

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:40.060
But what we need is
we need some equality.

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.190
We need some justice.

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:43.690
And that's what
we're fighting for.

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.440
WILSON WHITE: So I'm
going to stick there,

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:49.900
because in that answer
there were some tech issues

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:50.920
kind of woven in there.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.904
So we're at Google,
big tech company.

00:28:53.904 --> 00:28:55.570
Even on the net
neutrality conversation,

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:57.230
we're very much
involved with that.

00:28:57.230 --> 00:29:01.030
But thinking more broadly
about tech and civil rights,

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:04.860
what role do we
play, should we play,

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:09.550
as a tech company in the
modern civil rights movement,

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:12.369
both at Google and the
tech industry generally?

00:29:12.369 --> 00:29:13.160
MALKIA CYRIL: Yeah.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:17.500
It's a big question,
but I think there's

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.480
some really clear
points of intervention

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:24.770
that tech companies
should make in general.

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:28.000
I like to follow this
four-pronged approach.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.800
I call it "digital sanctuary."

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:35.090
It's my own way I think about
it, so I'll share it with you.

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:36.500
One is we talk about--

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:41.920
sanctuary legally
has been a term

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:48.700
used when cities and states defy
federal laws that they think

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:54.060
are immoral or unjust, or
that they think are actually

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:56.720
illegal, that violates
parts of the constitution

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.820
or violate basic human rights.

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:03.260
And that term has
come up in terms of--

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:07.330
within the movement around
undocumented immigrants, right?

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:09.620
But I think that we're
at a point where the term

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:13.980
"sanctuary" does not only
and should not only refer

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.470
to undocumented immigrants.

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:17.380
It should refer to
all those whose civil

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:21.540
rights have been violated or
truncated by this country,

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:22.780
within this country.

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:25.174
So when I think about
digital sanctuary,

00:30:25.174 --> 00:30:26.590
I'm thinking about
basically, what

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:30.590
are the tech policies,
practices, and practitioners

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:34.660
that we need to extend
human rights to all people?

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:36.700
Civil and human
rights to all people.

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.720
So I think about
it in four ways.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.260
One is I think that we need the
tech industry to demonstrate

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.430
some level of defiance.

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:49.630
I think that it is not time
to maintain the status quo.

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:51.290
To me, it is never that time.

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:53.620
But as long as you
have vast inequalities,

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.800
that time never exists.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:31:00.070
But I think, in particular,
technology companies

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:03.280
on some level are
the line between

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:09.100
serious authoritarianism and
some measure of resistance.

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.450
There is a corporate
class here that needs to--

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:16.240
a part of the business class
that needs to fight back.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:21.250
And that needs to be very
clear that if it sides only

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:24.780
with shareholders and
those who are profiting,

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:27.680
it will lose its consumer base.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.640
Because consumers--
all the rest of us--

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.350
need protection.

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:35.120
And there is a question when
you're dealing with a giant.

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:39.020
And right now, a consolidated
federal government is a giant.

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.320
It is a beast.

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.410
It is a monolith.

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:44.080
And it is crushing
people right and left.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:47.350
You need a giant
to fight a giant.

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:50.410
And I think that some of
these big tech companies

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:51.470
need to be that giant.

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:54.440
They need to be giants for
civil and human rights.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:54.940
Yeah.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:58.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:02.140
So I would say
defiance is an order.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:06.010
And that means defying
things like the Muslim ban.

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:07.996
When we talk about
Muslims, you think

00:32:07.996 --> 00:32:10.960
we're talking about some people
over there in the Middle East,

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.530
somewhere else.

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:14.470
But first of all, let's
be clear that Muslims

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:15.970
exist all over the world.

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:18.760
Let's be clear that in the
United States, 40% of Muslims

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.290
are black.

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:24.850
So this is an issue
concerning black people.

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:27.645
And when we look at the
sisters in Washington State,

00:32:27.645 --> 00:32:30.164
in Portland, who were
attacked, and then

00:32:30.164 --> 00:32:32.080
the three white men
stepped in and two of them

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.827
lost their lives, one of
those sisters was black.

00:32:34.827 --> 00:32:39.750
The other sister was a
Middle Eastern Muslim.

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:42.609
My point is this is a black
woman, a Muslim woman--

00:32:42.609 --> 00:32:43.400
black Muslim woman.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.320
So I just want to be
clear, this is an issue

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.990
that affects black people.

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:49.760
So the Muslim ban, defy it.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:54.260
Defy it from gate to the end.

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:58.930
All of these extra
legal requests

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:01.410
for data by law
enforcement agencies?

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:01.935
Defy them.

00:33:01.935 --> 00:33:03.260
Say no.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:06.130
Even if it's against the
law, the law that they set.

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:08.440
Because these are laws that
they're creating right now.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:09.481
They're just making them.

00:33:09.481 --> 00:33:10.370
Executive orders?

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:11.310
That's the law.

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:15.030
You have to choose whether you
will comply with it or defy it.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.387
And there comes risks with that.

00:33:16.387 --> 00:33:17.970
But I'm going to
tell you, as somebody

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:22.120
who puts my body on the line
in protests on a regular basis,

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:25.044
I feel like, yes, put
your money on the line.

00:33:25.044 --> 00:33:27.280
Put your money on the line.

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:28.700
That's what we need to do.

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:29.760
I think another piece--

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:34.000
we talked about defiance,
so there's that.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.820
So let me just
say this, defiance

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.350
is about not giving
up your data.

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:38.058
Don't give it up.

00:33:38.058 --> 00:33:39.940
Don't give it up.

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.315
And I think that
there's all kind

00:33:41.315 --> 00:33:44.140
of complicated lines in there.

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:47.270
There's questions of terrorism,
counter-terrorism work.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:48.520
And I understand that.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.790
I also understand that
within the conversation

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:54.170
about counter-terrorism
and terrorism,

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:57.505
black people are being
cast as terrorists.

00:33:57.505 --> 00:33:59.980
And so there has to be a line.

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.870
There has to be a line drawn.

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:04.230
Whereas, white
supremacists, for example,

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:06.100
are not being cast
as terrorists.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:10.239
White supremacists who drive
their cars into mosques.

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:12.830
White supremacists who
slit people's throats.

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:17.326
White supremacists who
actively kill people,

00:34:17.326 --> 00:34:18.909
they are not be
considered terrorists.

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:22.489
But Black Lives Matter
who protest and march.

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:27.520
And maybe somebody-- a random
person might throw a garbage

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.670
can through a window.

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:30.070
I don't know nothing about that.

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:32.869
But what I'm saying is
that is property damage.

00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:35.139
These people are slitting
people's throats.

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:36.500
They are killing people.

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.333
And they're not being
considered terrorists.

00:34:38.333 --> 00:34:41.060
So there's a context for
these requests for data,

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.440
and we need to defy them.

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:46.150
I think that tech companies
need to, obviously,

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:49.179
be very active and not only
to fight for an open internet,

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:52.030
but all of the
ways in which folks

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:55.510
are trying to maintain
an open, secure,

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:56.889
and affordable internet.

00:34:56.889 --> 00:35:00.250
So whether we're dealing
with the questions

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:03.190
that fiber brings up, or
whatever the case may be.

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:07.200
Working with local coalitions,
working where people are,

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:12.820
and divesting from
white supremacy.

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:14.710
And I know this was
a challenge, right?

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:18.195
When during the election
cycle of Donald Trump--

00:35:18.195 --> 00:35:21.280
and folks were saying, don't
give this man no money.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.320
What is wrong with you?

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.366
Don't do it.

00:35:23.366 --> 00:35:25.599
A lot of tech companies
struggled with that.

00:35:25.599 --> 00:35:27.890
They were like, well, we give
some to the left and some

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:28.850
to the right.

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:32.619
This is not a zero sum game.

00:35:32.619 --> 00:35:33.910
It's not a level playing field.

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:35.840
You don't just give some
to the left and some

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:36.630
to the right side.

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:37.713
That's not how this works.

00:35:37.713 --> 00:35:40.240
You either support
hate or you don't.

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.650
You either invest
in white supremacy

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:45.092
or you divest from it.

00:35:45.092 --> 00:35:46.940
There's no place in the middle.

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:47.690
That's it.

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:50.030
Either you support it,
and you help it grow,

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:52.130
and you foment it,
and you allow it--

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:53.570
you give it food.

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:56.790
You allow it to feed on
your profits or you don't.

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:58.250
Or you starve it.

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:01.740
That's the choice that I think
tech companies need to make.

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:05.114
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:05.114 --> 00:36:07.090
WILSON WHITE: I have
a few more questions.

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:09.230
I definitely want to dive
in on a couple of those.

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:12.290
But I'm going to open
it up to the audience

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:14.520
now for a few questions.

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.640
See what's on top of
mind for you guys.

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:19.440
AUDIENCE: So my question
was around the concept that

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.340
was mentioned [INAUDIBLE],,
like suspended compression

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.350
being like a bird cage.

00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:25.141
And there's like all
these different pieces

00:36:25.141 --> 00:36:26.612
that encapsulate--

00:36:26.612 --> 00:36:29.420
that include mass incarceration.

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:31.863
How do you connect all
the different people

00:36:31.863 --> 00:36:33.710
who are fighting for
these different issues?

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:36.420
So whether it be the
social responsibilities

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:39.179
of tech companies, whether it be
different rights action groups.

00:36:39.179 --> 00:36:40.970
Everyone's doing these
kind of initiatives,

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:42.590
but how do we stay
on the same page,

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:45.320
so we're actually-- instead
of just standing on one piece,

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.707
then it's like another
piece is replaced by that?

00:36:47.707 --> 00:36:48.540
How do we stay seen?

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.040
WILSON WHITE: How
do we make sure we

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.620
have a comprehensive
approach to this

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:55.930
rather than a piecemeal tackling
various components of an issue?

00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:58.910
MALKIA CYRIL: Well, I think
that we look at the root.

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:02.260
So there are some core
things that are going on.

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:06.620
One is we see that there is
a rise of authoritarianism.

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:09.920
And that authoritarianism
is resulting in--

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:13.790
has a variety of impacts
on different issues.

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:17.970
But at its core, that rise of
authoritarianism is a problem.

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:22.370
And the rise of authoritarianism
coincides with the rise

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:24.390
of explicit white supremacy.

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:28.030
So if we can have a very
clear analysis, number one,

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:29.842
that helps us to connect issues.

00:37:29.842 --> 00:37:32.300
So we talk about-- whether we
talk about mass incarceration

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.340
or climate change,
for example, we

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:39.650
know that our inability to
affect the federal government

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:41.930
right now is a problem.

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:46.680
So that's one kind of like big
lens through which we can look.

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.560
Number two, if we
just really get

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:56.570
clear that the concentration of
wealth and economic inequality

00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:59.925
is a partial cause
of racial inequality,

00:37:59.925 --> 00:38:03.590
if we can be clear about that
relationship, the relationship

00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:06.240
between the economy
and the civil society

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:10.690
issues of racial inequality,
that helps us also.

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:13.660
So if we don't have to segment
into mass incarceration

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.260
or education or--

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:18.284
these are effects,
you know what I mean?

00:38:18.284 --> 00:38:19.200
These are all effects.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:23.781
If we can focus on causes,
then we can stay clear.

00:38:23.781 --> 00:38:26.030
WILSON WHITE: There's a
question on the Dory, which is

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:31.136
our internal questioning list.

00:38:31.136 --> 00:38:32.635
SPEAKER 1: Let's
take this question.

00:38:32.635 --> 00:38:33.635
WILSON WHITE: All right.

00:38:33.635 --> 00:38:35.750
So can net neutrality
be a reparations

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:38.810
of sorts for groups that have
had their histories hidden

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:41.140
by media ignoring
or misrepresenting

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.136
their narratives?

00:38:42.136 --> 00:38:44.510
I think of the way Native
Americans and African Americans

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:47.630
have been portrayed over time,
and how net neutrality can open

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:50.752
pathways for community media.

00:38:50.752 --> 00:38:53.210
MALKIA CYRIL: Let me take the
second part of that question.

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:55.100
Absolutely, net
neutrality can open

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.750
pathways for community
media and community voices,

00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:59.480
allowing a little--

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:01.010
small dogs to be heard.

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:05.027
The big dogs don't get to
take up all the airtime.

00:39:05.027 --> 00:39:07.710
That said, I think the
fight for reparations

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:10.250
is a different fight.

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:11.615
I think it's a necessary fight.

00:39:11.615 --> 00:39:14.451
I think people don't understand
what reparations means.

00:39:14.451 --> 00:39:15.950
A lot of times, you
say reparations,

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:19.230
people think, oh,
I want my money.

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:20.600
Let me get my money.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:24.080
And the thing is
it's not about that.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.690
It's about shifting power.

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:27.230
Because one of
the reasons that--

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:31.160
when slavery was
proclaimed over and there

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:34.320
was a whole period
in American history

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.610
called the
reconstruction, right?

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:39.410
And where there were all those
promises made to black people

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:42.280
about what we were going to
get for our hundreds of years

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:42.980
of enslavement.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:46.610
And none of those
things came to pass.

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:49.000
A handful of people
got their 40 acres.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.690
Most people did not.

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:52.370
And the reason
that that matters.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:57.011
Like today-- I don't you if you
know, but today is Juneteenth.

00:39:57.011 --> 00:39:57.510
Juneteenth!

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:58.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:02.760
And why that's important is
all around the country today,

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:07.940
black people are doing an
action called 40 Acres, 40 Days,

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:11.080
and taking back land all
over this country today.

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:14.040
And why that
matters, I think, is

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:17.290
because when we take
back physical land,

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:19.990
there's a correlation
to the digital space we

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:21.330
have to reclaim as well.

00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:23.640
And that's part of how
I see the relationship

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.535
between this fight
around net neutrality

00:40:25.535 --> 00:40:27.540
to this fight around land.

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:29.580
We have to actually--

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:30.750
land matters, right?

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:35.940
Native Americans understand
that because their people were--

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:38.770
genocide against our
indigenous brothers and sisters

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:40.290
was for the land
and for what was

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:43.480
inside of the land or water--
the natural resources.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.810
Folks didn't just steal
Africans from Africa.

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:49.995
They also stole gold, ivory, and
all kinds of other resources.

00:40:49.995 --> 00:40:55.830
So when we understand how
Europe and America came

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:58.380
to have the level of
wealth that they do.

00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:00.720
And we understand
that that wealth

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:05.780
is built on stolen property,
on the theft, on laws broken,

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:08.330
on lives and bodies broken,
then we can actually

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:12.330
understand reparations in
a completely different way.

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:15.070
You don't need to give me
something that I haven't heard.

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:16.500
It ain't about that.

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:18.364
You stole from the people.

00:41:18.364 --> 00:41:19.780
You stole from the
people in order

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:21.420
to create your own wealth.

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:24.540
And that wealth now needs
to belong back to the people

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:25.940
that you stole it from.

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:27.870
And so that's the
same idea when we

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:31.110
think about digital equality.

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:34.470
We're also talking about
claiming digital space,

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:38.430
claiming that space, giving it
to those whose content actually

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:39.787
is your bank.

00:41:39.787 --> 00:41:41.370
That's where you're
getting your money

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:46.180
from is all the people
that's actually online.

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:49.536
SPEAKER 1: Question
in the back here.

00:41:49.536 --> 00:41:52.560
WILSON WHITE: I'll
repeat the question.

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.269
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:55.269 --> 00:41:56.685
WILSON WHITE: So
tell me what this

00:41:56.685 --> 00:42:00.570
has fared-- but essentially, can
we attack some of this problem

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:03.050
through the educational
system at the earliest ages,

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:07.710
getting young people to see
the world in a broader context

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:11.810
and not using educational
system to deconstruct

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:13.470
some of these
preconceived biases that

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:16.725
are baked into society?

00:42:16.725 --> 00:42:18.100
MALKIA CYRIL: So
they did a study

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:21.170
and they found that
by the age of five,

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:25.890
children already very
serious racial biases.

00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:28.130
And that's before
you've gone to school.

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:33.050
So I just want to say that
to start out with, right?

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:35.280
I think it's
important-- a couple

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:36.630
of things that are important.

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:40.450
One is my sister actually
runs a daycare center.

00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:43.780
And it's a daycare center
focused on black children.

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:45.770
It's an Afrocentric
daycare center.

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:49.000
And they drum in the morning
with their little djembes,

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.710
and they have a
cute, little time.

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:54.450
But one of the reasons that I
think is so important that she

00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:57.210
has this daycare center--
it's called Little Maroons--

00:42:57.210 --> 00:43:01.425
is because, actually, we
have to teach each other how

00:43:01.425 --> 00:43:02.790
to be free.

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:04.860
And I think that
freedom is something

00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:08.390
that I think black people
in the fight for freedom,

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:12.150
this constant quest for
freedom, is something

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:16.510
that black people have
generously and brilliantly

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:19.060
offered to the rest of society.

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:20.980
Because actually,
the fight for freedom

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:23.160
is not only a fight
for black folk.

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:25.590
It's also a fight for everyone
else, including white folk.

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:29.390
The white folks are
imprisoned by white supremacy

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:32.920
the same way the jailer
is imprisoned by the jail.

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:36.650
So what I want to say is this.

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:40.255
Yes, the educational system
is part of the infrastructures

00:43:40.255 --> 00:43:42.210
that produce meaning.

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:45.350
When we think about media,
we think about technology,

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:48.320
we also should be thinking
about the educational system

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:51.660
as part of that setup, right?

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:54.560
But the goal should not
be to teach children not

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:57.330
to see each other,
but to see people

00:43:57.330 --> 00:44:01.520
as not black or not white.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:02.460
I am black.

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:05.130
I would like to be seen as such.

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:08.850
And with my blackness comes
a history and a positioning

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:10.700
in society and a struggle.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:13.890
And it's very rich and I
think it has a lot to offer.

00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:16.380
So I don't believe that
we should be teaching

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:18.650
our children to be colorblind.

00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:20.470
I think that that
is actually false.

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:22.540
I think we should be
teaching our children

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:23.820
to be freedom fighters.

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:27.340
And we should be teaching
them how to survive.

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:31.484
Throughout history, if
you live by the river,

00:44:31.484 --> 00:44:33.650
you teach your child where
to go in the river, where

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:34.670
not to go in the river.

00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:38.140
You teach your children
how to survive around fire.

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:40.695
You teach them how to
live in the context

00:44:40.695 --> 00:44:44.430
and natural environment
that is around them.

00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:45.900
We also have to
teach our children

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:48.900
how to live in the political
environment that is around

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:49.500
them.

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:51.030
And so that means--

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:53.942
we used to have home
economics classes.

00:44:53.942 --> 00:44:56.150
But you know, when are we
going to teach our children

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:59.220
how to balance
checkbooks and how

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:02.400
to protect themselves online?

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.980
All of this is
part of being free

00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:08.070
in the political
environment that we are in.

00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:10.300
So number one, let's
teach our children

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:11.390
to be freedom fighters.

00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:14.140
Number two, let's not teach
them to be colorblind.

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.870
Number three, yes, let's
use the educational system,

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:19.180
but understand that all those
same biases are baked in.

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:21.830
So if you want to use
the educational system,

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:24.875
we actually need to
organize around that.

00:45:24.875 --> 00:45:26.250
We need to change
the curriculum.

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:28.900
We need to change how
teachers are trained.

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:32.970
It's not just about teaching
kids to be nice to each other.

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:33.950
You feel me?

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:38.230
We need to actually
train them to organize.

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:41.110
All over the world people know
who the president of the United

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:42.442
States is.

00:45:42.442 --> 00:45:47.600
Do you know who the
president of Mozambique is?

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.935
I'm just saying,
we dumb up in here.

00:45:49.935 --> 00:45:51.217
You know what I'm saying?

00:45:51.217 --> 00:45:52.550
I'm telling you, you might know.

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:53.712
Did you raise your hand?

00:45:53.712 --> 00:45:54.188
AUDIENCE: I'm actually
asking a question.

00:45:54.188 --> 00:45:55.140
MALKIA CYRIL: Oh, you're
asking a question?

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:56.092
I don't know either.

00:45:56.092 --> 00:45:57.520
I'm dumb, too.

00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:00.476
I'm saying we have a
terrible educational system.

00:46:00.476 --> 00:46:01.540
You know what I'm saying?

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:04.340
We got little children in
Palestine running around,

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:07.340
know exactly what's going
on up in United States.

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:09.350
Feel me, we do
not know the same.

00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:11.260
Adults do not know the same.

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:14.520
So there is an entire
overhaul that we

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.200
need in our education system.

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:19.550
And I can tell you,
Betsy DeVos is not

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:21.162
going to bring that to you.

00:46:21.162 --> 00:46:22.620
She's not going to
do that for you.

00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:24.536
WILSON WHITE: I'm not
going to touch that one.

00:46:24.536 --> 00:46:27.325
MALKIA CYRIL: I'm just going
to be the one to say it myself.

00:46:27.325 --> 00:46:27.950
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:29.900
So first, thanks for coming.

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:32.661
This is a great conversation.

00:46:32.661 --> 00:46:34.160
I want to just get
back to something

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:35.720
that you mentioned earlier.

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:39.710
You talked about basically,
like the criminalization

00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:42.410
of black as itself, right?

00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:46.570
And how that gets
perpetuated in the media

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:48.760
as the media being
part of the problem.

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:51.095
One thing I'm
curious about is as--

00:46:51.095 --> 00:46:52.910
Father's Day was just
yesterday, right?

00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:01.080
The narrative has been for years
that black fathers are absent,

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:01.940
right?

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:06.160
And then, a couple years ago,
they do an actual study on it.

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:09.680
And they find that black
fathers are the most involved

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.900
in their children's lives.

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:14.390
Yet, that narrative
is not the narrative

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:17.070
that's going to still be talked
about day in and day out.

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:19.250
So when people talk
about black parents,

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:21.550
they're still thinking
that they're absent.

00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:24.560
I'm curious about
your thoughts on--

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:27.575
how do we spread
these narratives

00:47:27.575 --> 00:47:30.780
and make those the
new stereotypes

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:35.970
that we give to black folks as
opposed to the negative ones?

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:41.030
MALKIA CYRIL:
Transforming narratives

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:45.500
is a long-haul project.

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:49.430
People think that we can
insert some new talking

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:52.300
points, messages, and there's
going to be a new story.

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:55.900
But these narratives
aren't about what's said.

00:47:55.900 --> 00:48:00.110
These narratives are
produced by how things are.

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:02.960
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.750
Communications
experts always are

00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:10.160
very interested in neuroscience
and how people think,

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:13.640
and how to make brain maps
and understand information.

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:16.670
And one of the
things that is clear

00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:19.600
is that simply
telling people facts

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:21.640
doesn't change
what they believe.

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:23.206
You know what I mean?

00:48:23.206 --> 00:48:24.652
They'd be like, you lying.

00:48:24.652 --> 00:48:25.579
They'd be just like--

00:48:25.579 --> 00:48:26.370
WILSON WHITE: Fake.

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:26.794
MALKIA CYRIL: Yeah.

00:48:26.794 --> 00:48:27.642
That's fake.

00:48:27.642 --> 00:48:29.070
That's not real.

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:34.190
And that's because everything
else affirms the lie.

00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:38.420
So all the way to the--

00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:41.150
if you over-incarcerate
black people,

00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:43.550
you have one or two
explanations for that,

00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:49.121
either racial discrimination
or black criminality.

00:48:49.121 --> 00:48:49.620
That's it.

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:52.620
Those are the two explanations
for over-incarceration.

00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:56.180
We can produce facts that
demonstrate racial bias, which

00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:58.180
we have many, many times.

00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:01.610
And yet, you have a huge
portion of the population

00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:04.470
that believes that the
answer is black criminality.

00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:06.580
And you cannot convince
them otherwise.

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:11.440
So I'm of the mind that while
narrative change is necessary,

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:14.770
I'm of the mind that it will
come about because of material

00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:15.940
change.

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:18.110
We actually have
to change the laws.

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:20.870
We actually have to change
the way judges work.

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:25.850
We actually have-- we have to
change the material conditions,

00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:30.596
and those will begin to
affect the narrative.

00:49:30.596 --> 00:49:34.390
Kwame Ture said, it don't
matter if you want to lynch me.

00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:36.450
It matters if you have
the power to lynch me.

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:39.120
So you could say or
believe whatever you want.

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:39.736
That's fine.

00:49:39.736 --> 00:49:41.780
You could think that
black fathers are absent

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:44.300
all day and night if that's
what you want to believe.

00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:50.190
But do you have the power to
then defund black families?

00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:53.120
Because if you do as a
result of that stereotype,

00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:56.360
that's where I feel like
we need to make the change.

00:49:56.360 --> 00:50:01.333
I think simply saying new
things, it doesn't work.

00:50:01.333 --> 00:50:05.330
It doesn't work when an entire
system around those words

00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:07.729
tells you something else.

00:50:07.729 --> 00:50:10.145
WILSON WHITE: I think we have
time for two more questions,

00:50:10.145 --> 00:50:14.061
if we have any from
the audience here?

00:50:14.061 --> 00:50:14.560
All right.

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:15.470
Oh, we have one.

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:18.750
And I have the last one.

00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:22.190
MALKIA CYRIL: When he
said two, he meant one.

00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:24.330
AUDIENCE: Do you
predict a resurgence

00:50:24.330 --> 00:50:26.700
of very aggressive
color discrimination

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:30.427
and other disenfranchising
ways to affect communities

00:50:30.427 --> 00:50:31.010
in the future?

00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:32.560
So my conflict with
this when I was

00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:34.380
hearing about
[INAUDIBLE] election

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:37.234
and hearing about other
governments and other people

00:50:37.234 --> 00:50:39.400
getting involved in it, it
reminds me really quickly

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.160
of [INAUDIBLE] in Tennessee.

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:45.252
It reminds me of very
quickly gerrymandering laws

00:50:45.252 --> 00:50:47.710
that we've still struggled to
deal with the last 400 years,

00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:48.105
right?

00:50:48.105 --> 00:50:49.350
So I imagine in the
next few elections

00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:51.624
we're going to see this in a
much more aggressive fashion.

00:50:51.624 --> 00:50:53.332
Because not it's
physical gerrymandering,

00:50:53.332 --> 00:50:54.847
it's actually along
the line of how

00:50:54.847 --> 00:50:56.430
do I find the ways
to make it that you

00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:58.304
can't get this information,
you can't make it

00:50:58.304 --> 00:50:59.220
to the voting hall.

00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:00.160
What do you think about this?

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.201
MALKIA CYRIL: I think that
it's not a prediction.

00:51:02.201 --> 00:51:04.350
It's already happening.

00:51:04.350 --> 00:51:09.190
I think that right
now, we are seeing--

00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:12.314
in local elections, we're seeing
fierce voter intimidation,

00:51:12.314 --> 00:51:13.730
particularly
throughout the South.

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:21.600
We've seen it in different
cities throughout the South.

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:27.000
We're seeing extremely
aggressive attacks that

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.980
aren't necessarily
correlated to voting,

00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:34.740
but that are absolutely
targeted towards people

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:39.000
of color, particularly
immigrants, blacks, and Muslims

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.550
right now.

00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:45.146
So I think this
dystopic future is here.

00:51:45.146 --> 00:51:46.020
You know what I mean?

00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:47.730
It's happening now.

00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:50.847
And so I think the
question is, what are we

00:51:50.847 --> 00:51:52.250
going to do about it?

00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:56.530
And people are starting
to marshal defense forces.

00:51:56.530 --> 00:52:01.460
We're in a scarier time
than I think people realize.

00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:06.630
And this idea that any one of us
can stand by and be a bystander

00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:09.120
is gone.

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:11.760
Either you do something
or you do nothing.

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:13.720
And that's where
I'm at right now.

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:18.130
So I definitely think it's
going to escalate, especially--

00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:19.860
and it's going to
escalate around voting,

00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:22.790
but it's going to escalate
also around natural resources.

00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:25.290
I think people-- when you
talk about water wars,

00:52:25.290 --> 00:52:27.840
like we're there.

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:31.310
People are fighting
right now for clean water

00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:33.570
in various parts
of this country.

00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:35.500
And those people
are black and brown.

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:38.640
Those people who cannot get
clean water are black and brown

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:40.050
people.

00:52:40.050 --> 00:52:42.150
So that's part of
why I say when we

00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:46.890
talk about the role
of tech companies,

00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:53.501
it's not a romantic question.

00:52:53.501 --> 00:52:54.500
Do you know what I mean?

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:56.600
It's not like esoteric.

00:52:56.600 --> 00:53:00.800
It's not like moral, or you
should be on the side of good.

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:04.140
It's like, are you going
to protect life or are

00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:06.140
you going to serve death?

00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:08.910
That is where
we're at right now.

00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:15.960
And so that is the question that
I would throw back out to you,

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:19.123
because that is where we're at.

00:53:19.123 --> 00:53:20.990
Aggressive attacks
against people

00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:23.780
that look like me,
and you, and others.

00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:25.295
Aggressive attacks
against women.

00:53:25.295 --> 00:53:26.605
I don't know if
you've noticed, but

00:53:26.605 --> 00:53:28.188
many of these attacks
against Muslims,

00:53:28.188 --> 00:53:31.870
they have been Muslim women.

00:53:31.870 --> 00:53:32.760
Children, in fact.

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:34.550
They're teenage girls.

00:53:34.550 --> 00:53:38.660
The young woman who was
just found beaten to death

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:40.930
and drowned in a
pond in Virginia,

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:43.840
a young Muslim
girl, 17 years old.

00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:47.900
Yesterday, beaten to death.

00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:49.910
This is where we're at.

00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:53.820
Beaten to death by a
random dude who passed by.

00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:55.160
Did not know her.

00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:57.410
They're not
connected in any way.

00:53:57.410 --> 00:53:59.820
So this is where we're at.

00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:04.070
And we have a responsibility
to do everything we can,

00:54:04.070 --> 00:54:06.340
anything we can to stop it.

00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:07.340
WILSON WHITE: All right.

00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:13.150
In 140 characters or less,
what keeps you up at night?

00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:15.210
MALKIA CYRIL: Well,
I think I mentioned,

00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:20.605
like I do believe tech companies
stand between a certain--

00:54:20.605 --> 00:54:24.820
a heightened authoritarianism
and a heightened resistance.

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:28.210
And I think that I'm terrified
that they will choose

00:54:28.210 --> 00:54:31.020
their profits over people.

00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:33.270
I think that that is a
very likely scenario.

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:36.470
And the only way that
that will not happen

00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:39.136
