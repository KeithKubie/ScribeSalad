00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.870
Sal: We know that if we leave
water to its own devices-- so

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.010
you have some H2O-- that it's
an equilibrium with the

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.240
autoionized version of itself.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.850
So a little bit of it will turn
into some hydrogen ions,

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.000
and we know that this really
takes the form hydronium.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.400
That these attach themselves
to other water molecules.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.580
And it could be H3O, but
we'll just write it

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.640
as a hydrogen ion.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.240
Which is really just a
free-floating proton.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.870
Plus hydroxide ion.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.480
And we also know that in kind of
an equilibrium state at 25

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.850
degrees Celsius.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.420
And remember, equilibrium
constants and equilibrium

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.040
reactions are only dependent
on the temperature.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.790
Nothing else.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.480
For a given molecule,
of course.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.905
So 25 degrees Celsius.

00:00:48.905 --> 00:00:51.640
And we also know, we did this
two videos ago, that the

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.410
equilibrium constant-- as
a review, that's the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:01.990
concentration of the products
divided by the concentration

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.230
of the reactants.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.279
But the reactant in this
case is just water.

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:06.590
It's the actual solvent.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.660
And if the reactant is what
you're-- it's everywhere.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.780
So if you just go back to that
intuition example, the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.880
probability of finding
it is 1.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.300
So it's just always there,
so you don't included it.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.670
So you can just say divided by
1 or whatever, and this is

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.650
equal to the equilibrium
constant of water.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.350
We learned that that's
10 to the minus 14.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.520
Because water by itself will
have a hydrogen concentration

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.630
of 10 to the minus 7 and a
hydroxide concentration of 10

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.880
to the minus 7.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.980
And if you take a log of
everything-- so if you take

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.280
the pKw--

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.220
What was that?

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.185
If you put a p in front of
something, that means you're

00:01:49.185 --> 00:01:51.020
taking the negative log of it.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.470
So the negative log of 10 to the
minus 14-- the log base 10

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.050
up to the minus 14
is minus 14.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.410
So the negative log
is just 14.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:07.770
So pKw is 14 and that is equal
to-- if I take the negative

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.960
log of this side right here--
let me do that.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.520
This is just a logarithm
property.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.870
This is more math
than chemistry.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:23.660
So the log of H plus times OH
times our hydroxide ion.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.710
That's the same thing, just
the logarithm properties.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:32.180
It's the same thing as minus
log of H plus minus, or you

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:40.150
could say plus the minus
log of OH minus.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.730
And what is this?

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.540
well this is just the
pH, which is equal

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.900
to the minus log.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.830
This is 10 to the
minus 7, right?

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.250
10 to the minus 7.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.860
The log of that is minus 7.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.660
You have the minus in front.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.570
So its pH is equal to 7.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.360
And what is this?

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.140
This over here.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.910
This is our pOH.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.710
The minus log of the hydroxide
concentration.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.420
And of course, that was also
10 to the minus 7.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.600
And so our pOH is equal to
log of that is minus 7.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.580
You have a minus in front.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.000
It's equal to 7.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.050
So you get right there that
little formula that the pKw,

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.520
or the negative log of the
equilibrium constant of water,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:41.240
pKw is equal to the pH of water
plus the pOH of water.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.780
And this, at 25 degrees Celsius,
this is the thing

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.550
that's going to stay constant
because we're going to start

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.730
messing with these things
by throwing acid and

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.090
base into the water.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.620
This thing is always going to
be 14 at 25 degrees Celsius.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.820
Remember, as long as you keep
temperature constant and

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.230
you're not messing too much with
the molecule itself, your

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.200
equilibrium constant
stays constant.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.940
That's why it's called
a constant.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.710
So with all of that out of the
way, let's think about what

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.960
happens if I throw some acid
into a-- let's say I have some

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.210
hydrochloric acid.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.260
I'll use colors more
creatively.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.270
So I have some hydrochloric
acid.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.700
It's in an aqueous solution.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.900
We know that it disassociates
completely, which means that

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.400
we're just left with the
hydrogen ion, on which of

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.730
course really attaches itself to
another water molecule and

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.750
becomes hydronium.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:51.570
Plus the chlorine anion,
or negative ion.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.850
Right there.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:09.080
And let's say that I do this
with 1 molar-- or, you know,

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.280
this is also sometimes written
as 1 capital M-- of

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.770
hydrochloric acid.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.600
So essentially what
am I doing?

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.610
I am taking 1 molar of
hydrochloric acid, literally

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:26.980
means that I am taking 1
mole of HCl per liter

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.040
of our whole solution.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.160
Which is mainly water.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.750
It's an aqueous solution.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.000
Per liter of water, right?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.750
So what's my concentration going
to be of these things

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.380
right here?

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.120
Or in particular, what's
the concentration of

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.470
the H going to be?

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.250
Well, if this disassociated
completely, right?

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.340
So all of this stuff-- this is
not an equilibrium reaction.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.940
Remember.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.230
I only drew a one way
arrow to the right.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.190
There's no even small
leftwards arrow.

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.250
This is a strong hydrochloric
acid.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.510
So if you really put one molar
of this in an aqueous

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.390
solution, you're not going
to see any of this.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.650
You're going to just see this.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:11.290
So you're going to have the
hydrogen concentration here in

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:16.090
the aqueous solution is going
to be equal to 1 molar.

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.770
And there's also going to be 1
molar of chlorine anions, but

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.540
we don't care about that.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.910
If I haven't said already, it
would be nice to figure out

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.330
what the pH of this
solution is.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.830
Now that I've thrown
hydrochloric acid in it.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.055
Well the pH is just the hydrogen
concentration.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.640
We already have the hydrogen
concentration.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.200
That's 1 molar, or 1 mole
per liter of solution.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:53.450
So the pH is going to be equal
to the minus log base 10 of

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:54.770
our hydrogen concentration.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.900
Of 1.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.150
10 to the what power
is equal to 1?

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.970
Well, anything to the 0
of power is equal to

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:02.930
1, including 10.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.980
So this is equal to 0
minus 0 is just 0.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.390
So your pH is 0.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:15.200
So if you have 1 molar of
hydrochloric acid, and you

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.050
throw it into an aqueous
solution.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.950
And, well, I guess I'm saying
you're putting it into a

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.430
solution when I tell
you it's 1 molar.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.750
So if you have a concentration
of 1 mole per liter of

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.200
solution, where the solvent
is water, you will end up

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.940
with a pH of 0.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.190
The pH of 0.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.750
So pH of water without
any acid in it, that

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:44.670
was equal to 7.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:49.380
And this is considered
a neutral pH.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:54.000
Now we know that if you were
to have an aqueous solution

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.020
with 1 molar of hydrochloric
acid, we can say-- I'll do it

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:07.920
in red because-- pH of HCl
in water is equal to 0.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.430
So obviously a low pH
is more acidic.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:14.610
And we went over that
in previous videos.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:18.410
And let's figure out what the
pOH of hydrochloric acid is.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:24.860
pOH of hydrochloric acid
in an aqueous solution.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.490
Well, this all goes back to Le
Chatelier's Principle, right?

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:29.925
If you go back to what
we said before.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.380
This is just pure water
right here.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.549
If we may have put 1 molar of
hydrochloric acid in here,

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:46.070
we're essentially just throwing
a ton of hydrogen

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.950
protons in there.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:50.270
We're substantially increasing
the concentration of this.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:52.910
And Le Chatelier's Principle
says oh, well that means that

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.650
a lot of this is going to be
consumed and the reaction will

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:56.870
go and this direction.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.160
The equilibrium reaction will
go in that direction.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.130
But remember.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.410
Water by itself only had a 10 to
the minus 7 concentration.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:10.860
We're throwing in a million--
I mean it was one ten

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.220
millionth of a mole per liter.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:17.110
Now we're throwing in--
what is that?

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.760
10 to the 7th.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.350
We're throwing in 10 million
times as much hydrogen ions

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:23.480
into that water.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.300
So all of this stuff
just gets consumed.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.380
Maybe it goes there.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:30.480
And so the concentration of this
gets thrown down really

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.610
far because we're
dumping so much.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.950
And the concentration of this
goes up because it can only

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.020
consume so much of these guys.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.430
There's not that much of this.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.890
There's only 10 to the minus
7th molar of this.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.180
So this ends up being 1 molar.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.110
And if this ends up being 1
molar-- because 10 to the

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.420
minus 7th molar, essentially,
you can kind of view it as it

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.590
all gets consumed with
the stuff over here.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.680
What ends up being the
concentration of the OH?

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.840
Well, we already know that the
pKw is 14 of water at 25

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:03.320
degrees, and the pKw of water
is equal to the pH of your

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.250
solution plus your pOH.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:12.330
So if your pH for hydrochloric
acid is 0, right?

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.275
We have 1 molar of hydrochloric
acid.

00:10:14.275 --> 00:10:19.590
Then your pOH of 1 molar of
hydrochloric acid is 14.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:24.070
So right here, our pOH
is equal to 14.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.160
Now let's do the same thing
with a base and figure out

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:26.970
what its pH is.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.480
A strong base.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.640
And I think you'll see that
it's the opposite.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.706
So let's say I had potassium
hydroxide.

00:10:35.706 --> 00:10:37.510
It's a strong base.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:43.630
So it completely disassociates
in water to potassium cations.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:46.220
Positively charged ions.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:50.130
Plus hydroxide anions.

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:51.420
It completed disassociates.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.650
So if I put anything in an
aqueous solution-- I should

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:54.900
write that down.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:02.460
Aqueous solution just means we
are in water, of course.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.940
And if we essentially put
1 molar-- remember the

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.080
concentration matters.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:07.950
You can't just say,
oh, hydrochloric

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.320
acid has a pH of 0.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:09.420
No.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.320
You have to say 1 molar
of hydrochloric

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.700
acid has a pH of 0.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.050
And actually I didn't
write that.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:15.660
Let me write that.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:16.910
1 molar.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:22.380
And I'll leave you to figure out
what the pH or the pOH of

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.310
2 molars of hydrochloric
acid is.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.950
Or a 10 molar of hydrochloric
acid.

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.700
And figure out what
those pH's are.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:36.090
But if we have 1 molar, of
potassium hydroxide.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.170
We have 1 molar of this.

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:42.940
And it completely disassociates

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:43.610
when it's in water.

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:47.610
So you have none of
this left over.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:50.480
What's your concentration
of OH?

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.860
When your OH concentration
is going to be 1 molar.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.070
Right?

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:58.300
If you had 1 mole per liter of
this, you're going to 1 mole

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:58.840
per liter of this.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.170
Because all of this just
disappears in the water.

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:02.440
So what is your pOH?

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.260
POH is just the negative
log of this.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.450
The log of 1 is 0.

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:12.700
The negative of 0 is 0.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:19.120
And then your pH in this
circumstance-- well, you could

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.700
say, oh, it was the hydrogen
concentration.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.550
You don't know what the hydrogen
concentration is, but

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.320
you know that when you throw
a bunch of this stuff, it's

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.170
going to sop up a bunch of
hydrogen and the hydrogen is

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:27.110
going to go down a lot.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:28.480
But you're like, well,
how do I measure it?

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.650
Well, you remember it.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.300
25 degrees Celsius.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.930
The equilibrium constant
of water is equal to

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.140
the pH plus the pOH.

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.630
We showed that at the beginning
of the video.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:43.250
So 14 is equal to
your pH plus 0.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:45.430
That's our pOH in this case.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:49.180
So our pH is 14.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.720
So if you have 1 molar-- I used
potassium hydroxide in

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.820
this case-- but if you have 1
molar of a strong base-- let

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.305
me write that down.

00:12:57.305 --> 00:13:05.440
1 molar of strong base.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.210
Remember, strong is kind of an
official term in chemistry.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:11.120
It means complete
disassociation.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:17.980
You have a pH of 14 and
you have a pOH of 0.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:22.440
If you have 1 molar
of strong acid.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.680
If someone says that they have
something with a pH of 0 that

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:31.520
they would like to maybe throw
at you, you should decline.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.640
Because it'll probably
hurt your

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.260
chances of-- well, anyway.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.360
So let's say you have 1
molar of strong acid.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:47.880
It's a pH of 0 and
a pOH of 14.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.430
Anyway, maybe in the next video
I'll actually show you--

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.580
This might give you the
impression that this is an

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:53.810
absolute scale.

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:57.490
That 0 is as acidic as you can
get, and 14 is as basic as you

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.290
can get when you get the
pH, but that's not

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:00.000
that's not the case.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.630
You can actually get
above this or you

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:02.450
can get below this.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:07.210
This was this when you had one
1 molar of a strong acid.

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:10.240
If you had 2 molars of a strong
acid-- actually if you

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.610
had 10 molars.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:11.840
Right?

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.830
Let's say you get your hydrogen

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:19.910
concentration to 10 molar.

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:23.150
So if you had 10 molar of a
strong acid, you apply that in

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:24.080
an aqueous solution.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.090
It is, when I say it's a
molar by definition.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:28.750
What's your pH going to be?

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:33.020
Your pH is going to be the
minus log base 10 of 10.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.420
The log, base 10 of 10, is 1.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.270
10 to the first power is one.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:37.830
So this is equal to minus 1.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.770
So minus 1 pH would-- if
you had 10 molar of say

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:45.140
hydrochloric acid or nitric acid
or anything like that.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.060
Anyway, that's all
for this video.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.070
I'll see you in the next one.
