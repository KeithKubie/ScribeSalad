GEORGE PACKER: I'm
George Packer.

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.130
I'm a fellow New Yorker.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.480
That's my latest book, "The
Unwinding: An Inner History in

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.540
the New America." And I'm on
staff of "The New Yorker"

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.950
magazine, where I've been a
staff writer for 10 years.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.250
And it's great to be in
heaven at Google.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.720
I was on the West
Coast version of

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.450
heaven a few weeks ago.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.515
So forgive me if I say a few of
the things that I said out

00:00:26.515 --> 00:00:28.250
in San Francisco.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.410
But I'm going to leave a lot
of time for questions.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.190
And because you're New Yorkers
and not San Franciscans, I

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.500
don't expect you to be as polite
as they were out there.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.740
So "The Unwinding" is a book
about the past generation of

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.910
American life really from the
late '70s up to the present,

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.310
and some of the big changes that
have passed through the

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.480
country and changed
people's lives.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.440
It's really a book about how
certain institutions that used

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.920
to work on behalf of the
majority of Americans, sort of

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.470
supporting the aspirations of
middle class Americans, from

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.690
schools, government
corporations, to the media,

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:25.190
have eroded, and how the idea of
a kind of cohesive society

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.810
has begun to fall apart.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.710
And how the deal that used to
exist among Americans, which

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.410
said that if you worked hard
and if you educated your

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.080
children, that not only would
you have a secure place and

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.590
they might have an even better
one, but you would have

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.740
recognition in society.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.640
There would be a place
at the table for you.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.910
And although that deal left out
a lot of Americans, it had

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.740
within it the tools to correct
those injustices and to

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.980
include more.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.190
And over the past generation,
that deal, which you could

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.860
call the social contract, has
frayed to the breaking point

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.190
so that more and more we are a
country of winners and losers.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.410
We are both more free and less
equal than a generation ago.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.320
We are more inclusive
and more stratified.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.370
Those two things have been
happening at the same time.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.380
These are not unfamiliar
themes.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.220
And, in fact, you've probably
heard of a lot of books that

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.490
deal with issues like income
inequality, globalization, the

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.880
effect of the information
revolution on society, the

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.110
decline of the middle class,
political polarization, the

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.220
rise of both organized money
in Washington and also an

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.140
organized right wing
in Washington.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.850
All of those are themes of "The
Unwinding." But they're

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.080
not talked about explicitly
because this is not another

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.330
policy book.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.280
It's not another "10 things that
are wrong with America

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.100
and 10 ways to fix them." I
don't have a prescription.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.250
So don't ask me for one.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.160
What this is closer
to is a novel.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.240
It reads like a big, panoramic,
but also quite

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.530
intimate novel about American
life over the past generation

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.270
except that all of it had
to clear fact-checking.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.590
It's all true.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.160
But it has texture and the focus
on individual lives that

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.250
you expect from a novel.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.360
And I hope it has the narrative
power and the pull

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.460
of a novel that makes you want
to know what happens next, and

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.920
what's going to happen to these
characters, and how are

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.960
they going to recover from the
latest setback in their lives.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.500
So I'm going to read from the
very short prologue, which

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.160
will give you a feel for the
language of the book and for

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.720
the scope of the book.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.570
And then I'll introduce some
of the characters a bit.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.940
And then we should spend most
of the time having a

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.190
conversation.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.680
No one can say when the
unwinding began, when the coil

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.420
that held Americans together
in its secure and sometimes

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.670
stifling grip, first gave way.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.649
Like any great change, the
unwinding began at countless

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:22.490
times, in countless ways.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.270
And, at some moment,
the country--

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.120
always the same country--

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.220
crossed a line of history
and became

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.080
irretrievably different.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.880
If you were born around 1960
or afterward, you've spent

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.320
your adult life in the vertigo
of that unwinding.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.300
You watched structures that had
been in place before your

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.060
birth collapse like pillars of
salt across the vast visible

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.430
landscape--

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.680
the farms of the Carolina
Piedmont, the factories of the

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.630
Mahoning Valley, Florida

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.270
subdivisions, California schools.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.820
And other things harder to
see, but no less vital in

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.790
supporting the order of everyday
life changed beyond

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.130
recognition--

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.260
ways and means in Washington
caucus rooms, taboos on New

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.020
York trading desks, manners
and morals everywhere.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.980
When the norms that made the old
institutions useful began

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.150
to unwind, and the leaders
abandoned their posts, the

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.900
Roosevelt republic that had
reined for almost half a

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.340
century came undone.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.860
The void was filled by the
default force in American

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.260
life, organized money.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.220
The unwinding is nothing new.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.170
There have been unwindings every
generation or two, the

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.010
fall to earth of the founders
heavenly republic in a noisy

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.770
marketplace of quarrelsome
factions, the war that tore

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.890
the United States apart and
turned them from plural to

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.260
singular, the crash that laid
waste to the business of

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.910
America making way for
a democracy of

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.690
bureaucrats and everymen.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.840
Each decline brought renewal.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.460
Each implosion released
energy.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.700
Out of each unwinding
came a new cohesion.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.260
The unwinding brings freedom
more than the world has ever

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.640
granted and to more kinds of
people than ever before.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.010
Freedom to go away, freedom to
return, freedom to change your

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:27.200
story, get your facts, get
hired, get fired, get high,

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.320
marry, divorce, go broke, begin
again, start a business,

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.700
have it both ways, take it to
the limit, walk away from the

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.840
ruins, succeed beyond your
dreams and boast about it,

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.340
fail abjectly and try again.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.150
And with freedom, the

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.790
unwinding brings its illusions.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.910
For all these pursuits are as
fragile as thought balloons

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.870
popping against circumstances.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.900
Winning and losing are
All-American games and in the

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.910
unwinding, winners win bigger
than ever, floating away like

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.860
bloated dirigibles.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.430
And losers have a long way to
fall before they hit bottom.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.400
And sometimes they never do.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.890
This much freedom leaves
you on your own.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.500
More Americans than ever
before live alone.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.100
But even a family can exist in
isolation, just managing to

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.070
survive in the shadow of a huge
military base without a

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:25.490
soul to lend a hand.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.510
A shiny new community can spring
up overnight miles from

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.600
anywhere, then fade
away just as fast.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.080
An old city can lose its
industrial foundation and 2/3

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.060
of its people while all
its mainstays--

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.510
churches, government,

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.240
businesses, charities, unions--

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.750
fall like building flats
in a strong wind,

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.640
hardly making a sound.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.770
Alone on a landscape without
solid structures, Americans

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.520
have to improvise their own
destinies, plot their own

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.070
stories of success
and salvation.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:05.050
A North Carolina boy clutching
a Bible in the sunlight grows

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.910
up to receive a new vision of
how the countryside could be

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.760
resurrected.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.790
A young man goes to Washington
and spends the rest of his

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:17.030
career trying to recall the idea
that drew him there in

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.520
the first place.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.670
An Ohio girl has to hold her
life together as everything

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:25.750
around her falls apart until
in middle age she finally

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:29.720
seizes the chance to do
more than survive.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.580
As these obscure Americans
find their way in the

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:36.890
unwinding, they pass alongside
new monuments where the old

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:39.360
institutions once stood.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.520
The outsized lives of their
most famous countrymen,

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.120
celebrities who only grow
more exalted as

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.250
other things recede.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:52.830
These icons sometimes occupy
the personal place of

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:54.600
household gods.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.890
And they offer themselves as
answers to the riddle of how

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:01.260
to live a good or better life.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.560
In the unwinding, everything
changes and nothing lasts,

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.330
except for the voices--

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.230
American voices--

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:14.120
open, sentimental, angry, matter
of fact, inflected with

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:19.820
borrowed ideas, God, TV, and
the dimly remembered past.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.090
Telling a joke above the noise
of the assembly line,

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.490
complaining behind window
shades drawn against the

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:29.720
world, thundering justice to
a crowded park or an empty

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:34.640
chamber, closing a deal on the
phone, dreaming aloud late at

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.160
night on a front
porch as trucks

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.370
rush by in the darkness.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:44.940
So that prologue gives you
a map of the entire book.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.820
It introduces you to all the
key people and places that

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:49.700
you're going to meet.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:54.270
And what I wanted to do was to
combine the very obscure

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.080
people you've never heard of--

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.110
and would be unlikely to
hear of if not for

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:01.680
reading about them--

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:07.610
to the most famous people in the
country, from Tammy Thomas

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:10.650
who is the Ohio girl growing
up in Youngstown amid the

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:14.170
collapse of the steel industry
and the collapse of the city,

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.960
trying to survive and raise
three children on one of the

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:21.290
last good assembly
line jobs left.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:24.920
To Newt Gingrich, who stands,
I think, more than any other

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.740
politician, for the toxic
atmosphere of demonization

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:34.120
that we've come to expect as
normal in our politics.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.830
From Jeff Connaughton, who's the
Washington guy who arrives

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:43.140
there full of idealism and
becomes an aide to a young

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:47.130
senator named Joe Biden,
thinking he will ride Biden's

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:50.960
charisma into the White House,
and then gradually becomes

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.760
disillusioned and ends up
becoming a lobbyist and

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.070
passing through that revolving
door that so many people in

00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:02.250
Washington do, makes a lot of
money, loses a lot of money in

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.920
the financial crisis, which is
sort of the critical moment--

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:06.620
the reckoning--

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.810
for almost all the characters in
the book, and decides to go

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:14.280
back into government one last
time as the chief of staff to

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.120
Biden's successor, Ted Kaufman,
in order to try to

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.500
make Wall Street pay
for what it did in

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.920
the financial crisis.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:32.490
From him to Alice Waters, the
food evangelist of local

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:34.570
cuisine and organic food.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:38.800
From Peter Thiel, whom you
probably know is the founder

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.220
of PayPal and the first outside
investor in Facebook

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:49.920
and a libertarian philosopher of
sorts in his own right, to

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:55.860
Jay-Z, who as much as anyone
sort of represents the culture

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:59.350
of coming from nowhere to the
top and what it says about

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.940
celebrity today.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.140
So you move between people
you don't know

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.150
and the most famous.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:09.310
You also move between
the power centers--

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:13.070
Washington, Wall Street,
Silicon Valley--

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:17.290
and some of the forgotten parts
of the country, such as

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:21.660
the textile and tobacco region
of North Carolina where you

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:25.220
meet a man named Dean
Price, who is the

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.780
son of tobacco farmers.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:30.600
His father was a failed
fire-and-brimstone preacher

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.410
who eventually took
his own life.

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:37.430
And Dean grew up in the shadow
of his father's failure,

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:41.280
determined to become independent
and to make his

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.880
own way as an entrepreneur.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.790
And Dean's set up a chain of
truck stops and fast food

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:51.670
restaurants along a stretch of
US 220 between Greensboro,

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.240
North Carolina and Martinsville,
Virginia.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.370
And for a while, he was making
a go of it selling gas and

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:02.110
fried chicken until he realized
that Walmart up the

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:09.100
hill on the interstate or on the
state road and Sheet's Oil

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:13.740
next door with low-cost gasoline
were squeezing him so

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:14.650
that he couldn't compete.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.200
The word he used was hogtied.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.080
The multinationals
had him hogtied.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.490
And meanwhile, the economy of
the region was plummeting so

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:24.160
that people were more and more
dependent on Walmart for

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.060
everything that they needed.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.070
So in the middle of his career,
with his chain of

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:32.140
truck stops beginning to topple
with the financial

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:37.620
crisis, Dean Price, who in
unconventional ways is a very

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.920
religious man and sees his life
as a kind of a quest, had

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.250
an epiphany.

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:45.960
And that epiphany was he needed
to get away from this

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.570
model of selling imported
oil and fast food.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.890
He needed to move
into alternative

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:53.940
energy, into biodiesel.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.300
And that the source of it was
all around him, these fallow

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.220
tobacco farms that could
be used to grow canola.

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.910
And out of canola oil could
come biodiesel.

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.835
All the fast food and barbecue
joints around him that threw

00:14:05.835 --> 00:14:09.710
out their waste oil at the end
of the night, that waste oil

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:11.760
could be used to
make biodiesel.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.580
So at the passage I'm going to
read now, Dean is just on the

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:20.760
cusp of this epiphany of moving
out of his old business

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.710
into this new one, still an
entrepreneur, but with a

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.640
vision of not just how he could
make a fortune, but how

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.440
he could remake the countryside
which had fallen

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.195
on these hard times.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.490
The landscape Dean had returned
to where he planned

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:43.320
to live out his life was very
old and also new, as

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:47.310
particular as anything in
America and also as generic,

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.260
as beautiful and as ugly.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:54.270
In his imagination, it had
become a nightmare, so

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:57.840
profoundly wrong that
he called it sinful.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.910
And he hated the sin more than
any casual visitor or distant

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.170
critic possibly could.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:08.650
Yet he also saw here a dream of
redemption so unlikely and

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:12.100
glorious that it could only
fill the mind's eye of a

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.810
visionary native son.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:18.210
Once, driving through Cleveland
County, Dean

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:21.920
happened to pass the hardshell
Baptist Church that his father

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.200
had once tried to get but
failed, the failure that had

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.930
broken his father's will.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.630
Dean had gone down with them to
Cleveland County and heard

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.340
the sermon that his father had
given for his audition back

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.600
around 1975.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.570
So that decades later, he
recognized the church.

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:43.050
And he also noticed that there
was now a fucking Bojangles

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:44.790
right next door.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:48.260
For Dean, Bojangles had come to
represent everything that

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.430
was wrong with the way Americans
lived, how they

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.480
raised their food and
transported it across the

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:58.200
country, how they grew the crops
to feed the animals they

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.240
ate, the way they employed the
people who worked in the

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.730
restaurants, the way the money
left the community.

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:07.050
Everything about it was wrong.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:08.430
Dean's own business--

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.470
gas and fast food--

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.580
had become hateful to him.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:16.330
And he saw the error of his ways
as his father never had.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.910
And the conjunction of his
father's legacy and his own

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:24.260
struck him with bitter irony
as he drove past.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.590
He was seeing beyond on the
surfaces of the land to its

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.400
hidden truths.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.500
Some nights he sat up late on
his front porch with a glass

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:37.900
of Jack and listened to the
trucks heading south on 220

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.220
carrying crates of live chickens
to the slaughter

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:45.520
houses always under cover of
darkness, like a vast and

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.570
shameful trafficking.

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:50.370
Chickens pumped full of hormones
that left them too

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.300
big to walk.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.570
And he thought how these same
chickens might return from

00:16:55.570 --> 00:17:00.160
their destination as pieces of
meat to his floodlit Bojangles

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.160
up the hill from his house.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.770
And that meat would be drowned
in the bubbling fryers by

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:08.800
employees whose hatred
of the job would leak

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.920
into the cooked food.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:15.240
And that food would be served up
and eaten by customers who

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.339
would grow obese and end up in
the hospital in Greensboro

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:22.109
with diabetes or heart
failure, a

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:23.859
burden to the public.

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:27.060
And later, Dean would see them
riding around the Mayodan

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:30.840
Walmart in electric carts
because they were too heavy to

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.450
walk the aisles of the
super center, just

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:34.705
like hormone-fed chickens.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.820
Somehow in North Carolina, that
passage got a big laugh.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.325
Maybe not in Google New York.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.210
Dean's story, the story of Tammy
Thomas in Youngstown,

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.870
Jeff Connaughton in Washington,
Peter Thiel in

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:56.380
Silicon Valley are the backbone
of the narrative.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:00.240
And you move between them as
their lives move from the late

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.480
'70s to the present and as you
also meet the VIPs, the

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.200
celebrities, who cast a
different light on the big

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.270
events and trends
of the period.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:15.250
And I hope that the overall
feeling is not completely one

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:16.450
of darkness and despair.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:20.510
I've been accused of peddling
a pessimistic message here.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:24.610
But when you know someone like
Dean Price or Tammy Thomas,

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:28.250
when you listen to Peter Thiel
talk about the future, when

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.660
you see someone like Jeff
Connaughton coming back to try

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.990
to right the wrongs of
Washington, it's very hard to

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:36.810
be completely pessimistic
about America.

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:40.980
I get pessimistic when I think
about the big picture, like

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.960
the 10 things wrong with America
and how to fix them,

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.090
when I think about Washington
and Wall Street.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:51.210
But when I'm writing about these
individuals, there's a

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:55.480
certain resilience and a
resourcefulness in them, a

00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:00.530
refusal to quit that might be
particularly American and that

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:03.600
tells me there's still people
who have an investment in what

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.950
used to be called the
American Dream.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:09.880
So that's "The Unwinding." And
now I am happy to try to

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.870
answer whatever questions
you might have.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.960
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.260
GEORGE PACKER: Hi

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.450
AUDIENCE: So one of the things
that your prologue was making

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:25.580
me think about was the
connection between the

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:30.590
breakdown of community
structures and the lack of

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:33.520
money caused by the financial
collapse.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.660
Our CEO Eric Schmidt, one thing
that he's said from time

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.700
to time is more money solves
all known problems.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:40.830
GEORGE PACKER: All
known problems.

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:41.210
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:41.850
GEORGE PACKER: Right.

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:44.840
AUDIENCE: I don't necessarily
agree.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:48.530
But do you think, without the
financial collapse, this

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:50.540
breakdown of community would
still be going on?

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.890
Do you think it was
just unmasked by

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:54.170
the financial collapse?

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:55.365
Or do you think it was
brought about by

00:19:55.365 --> 00:19:56.290
the financial collapse?

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:58.060
GEORGE PACKER: I think it
was unmasked by it.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.890
That's why my book
begins in 1978.

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:02.570
My guess is most people
in this room

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:05.240
were not born in 1978.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.590
I was a teenager.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:11.380
It seemed like a dreary,
formless, impossible to define

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.410
kind of dismal time.

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:14.520
Jimmy Carter was in
the White House.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:19.660
The big song was the Bee Gees
from "Saturday Night Fever."

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.910
And yet, looking back, that
was a key moment.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:24.830
Several things were
happening at once.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.350
And so to answer your question,
it's been a

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:31.060
generation-long development
that the financial crisis

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:36.080
accelerated, brought out in the
open, but didn't cause.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.420
De-industrialization really
began to take off.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.850
Tammy Thomas' story from
Youngstown is about what

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:44.230
happened when the steel
mills started

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:46.030
shutting in the late '70s.

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:48.380
The rise of the personal
computer--

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.810
the Apple II in 1977 was like
the beginning of, really, the

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:56.940
popularisation of computers,
which led to what you do.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:02.460
And big money coming to
Washington began around '78

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.190
with lobbying as
a major force.

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:06.910
So did the rise of
the new right.

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:09.120
Gingrich came to Washington
in '78--

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.240
that's one reason why he's
profiled in the book--

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.110
with a purpose not to build up
the institution of Congress,

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:20.490
but to tear it down and out of
the rubble to build his own

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:24.300
base of power and the power of
the conservative movement.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.000
So what you see is the beginning
not of building

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.290
institutions, but of
tearing them down.

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:31.240
And you see the physical
results in towns

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.190
all over the country.

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:34.950
But you also see the social
results in the lack of

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:39.870
structures that people
can count on.

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:42.980
Now one thing we might talk
about is whether the structure

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:46.640
called the internet is beginning
to replace those old

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.600
social structures.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.080
And we can discuss that.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.030
But I think you were getting at

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.180
something with your question.

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:56.710
And if so, I agree with you that
this has been something

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:59.130
much longer than just a
five-year process, as you will

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:02.510
find out if you ask anyone from
the Midwest or from rural

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:03.690
North Carolina.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:04.940
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:07.390
GEORGE PACKER: Yes?

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:10.520
AUDIENCE: You alluded to the
public school system in

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.870
California.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:15.485
But my sense was that while
California may be the worst of

00:22:15.485 --> 00:22:18.800
it, the public school system
all over the country has

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.850
degraded since the '70s.

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:22.280
Why pick on California?

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.210
And what do you have to say
about the public school system

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:28.260
in the US overall over
the last few decades?

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.540
GEORGE PACKER: Well, I'm picking
on California because

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:31.840
I'm a product of the California

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.890
public school system.

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:36.920
And I graduated, again, in
that key year of 1978.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.110
Maybe I've started the book
then because I think

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:42.330
everything began the year I
got out of high school.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:45.750
But, in fact, that was also the
year of Proposition 13,

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:49.710
which was the first big shot
fired in the tax revolt and

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:54.170
which initiated a wave of
anti-tax initiatives across

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:54.790
the country.

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:57.480
And in California, the results
were almost immediate and

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.470
devastating.

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:00.790
It went from being the best
public school system in the

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:03.900
country and then over the
following decades to being

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.550
down there close
to Mississippi.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.240
Now there are other
reasons, too.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.550
There are social reasons.

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:11.810
There's reasons of poverty,
of how people raise their

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:14.250
children, of family structure.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:15.780
But without the funding--

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:17.730
and I know this because
my son goes to public

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:18.510
school here in New York.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:20.480
And I have to bring in the
paper towels at the

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.790
start of the year.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:24.590
When I was in school, the
parents did not have to bring

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:25.330
in the paper towels.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:28.880
So there's been a starving of
resources of public schools

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.710
across the country, which is
maybe what you're getting at.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.230
But California is the most
egregious case, so they

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:37.170
deserve to be picked on.

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:38.810
Yes?

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:40.560
AUDIENCE: One of the reasons
that I'm excited about your

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:44.320
book is that when the folks that
I know in Silicon Valley

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.160
and myself talk about the
institutions that you're

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.090
talking about, we talk
about them in a very

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:50.670
technocratic way.

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:53.770
When we talk about government,
we talk about externalities

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:55.770
and nudges and things
like that.

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:57.800
And certainly in your book--
and it seems like the

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.240
characters that you're talking
about-- there are the VIPs and

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.270
then there's the rest--

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:04.060
it seems like there's a thread
that these things have some

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.150
sort of moral significance.

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:08.200
And I was wondering if could
talk about that distinction.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.600
GEORGE PACKER: That's a
great way to put it.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.730
You're absolutely right.

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:14.370
I mean, institutions are
complicated things.

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:19.826
And they're made up of rules, of
traditions and precedents,

00:24:19.826 --> 00:24:23.860
of the technical ways in which
they function, but also of

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:27.290
deals between people and of
people's attitudes toward each

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:30.230
other, and what corners they're
willing to cut, and

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:31.680
how much they're willing
to get away with.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.800
And one of the things that's
happened over the past

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:37.210
generation is our leaders have
been willing to get away with

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:38.280
more and more.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.150
And the taboos and sort
of social stigmas

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:42.390
have dropped away.

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:45.440
And once that happens, it's hard
to put them back because

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.465
people don't want to be the
sucker at the table.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.330
I wrote a piece that maybe some
of you saw in "The New

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:56.965
Yorker" about the political
culture of Silicon Valley.

00:24:56.965 --> 00:25:01.200
And there seems to be more and
more interest in government in

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.320
Silicon Valley.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:08.610
And one expression of that is an
idea of using technology as

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:12.060
a model for how government can
be organized and how to fix

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.100
what's wrong with government.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.020
So that we have new apps that
are there really more for

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:18.550
citizens to use in order to
interact with government and

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:21.310
to improve the way it works.

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:22.460
I have nothing against those.

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.590
I think they're all
good steps.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.290
I just don't want to
over-hype them.

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:31.880
Because government really
comes down to power and

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.190
resources and conflicts of
interests and conflicts of

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:40.560
values, which don't really yield
to technological fixes.

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.460
It has an engineering component,
but it also has a

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:47.490
moral and a social component.

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:51.510
Issues of justice and fairness
can't be solved by computers.

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:59.310
So although I'm interested in
Citizenville, I don't look to

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:02.360
it for all the answers.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.230
Yes?

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:05.290
AUDIENCE: In your introduction,
you talk about

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:08.210
the unwinding and subsequent
renewals

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:10.750
throughout American history.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:14.030
Given that you've studied the
unwinding, what are you seeing

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:16.700
as being what could potentially
be the renewal?

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.060
GEORGE PACKER: You know, there's
several models that

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.830
I've seen out there.

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:23.170
And I'll talk about them.

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:27.660
And then I'll tell you why I
don't see in any of them a

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:31.790
really convincing long-term
solution.

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:36.980
One is localism, which is to say
Washington does not have

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:37.580
the answers.

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:39.210
It's just a paralyzed place.

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:39.970
And it is.

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.650
I was just there a week
ago on my book tour.

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:45.110
And as soon as I got out at
Union Station, I just felt

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:47.980
this heaviness settle over
me like this is not

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.270
where things get fix.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.800
This is where problems
are made.

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.000
So it's become a self-fulfilling
prophecy.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.090
Do you remember Ronald Reagan's

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:56.070
first inaugural address?

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.110
He famously said government
is not the

00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:59.380
solution to our problems.

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.190
Government is the problem.

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:05.010
By saying that, he guaranteed
that it would be true.

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:08.610
And it's become true because
there are a lot of people in

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:12.480
Washington who want to
see government fail.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.390
Imagine if you had people at the
head of tech companies who

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:17.750
wanted to see technology fail.

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:20.790
It would fail.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.910
So in response to that, there
is a sense among people,

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:26.930
including people like Dean Price
in North Carolina, that

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:29.510
they have to find answers
where they are for the

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:30.810
problems that they have.

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:33.590
And one thing I really admire
about Dean and Tammy Thomas in

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:35.310
Youngstown is they
have not left.

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:38.410
They've stuck it out in these
hard-pressed areas and

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:40.130
improvised answers.

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:45.100
For Dean, the answer to the
failure of tobacco is not

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.760
tobacco or a cash crop.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.980
It's to use the land, to
revitalize the land, doing

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.340
something that needs to be done,
which is to create fuel

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:55.940
in order to get us off foreign
oil and off our

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.200
dependence on it.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:01.880
So that holds some promise, I
think, for North Carolina.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:07.970
But is localism multiplied
across the country going to

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:11.490
solve these bigger institutional
erosions?

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:15.870
I'm skeptical because we're just
too complex a society.

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:18.390
We're too intertwined.

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:22.220
We're too interconnected, and
not just by technology.

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:26.000
For every little region to have
its own Dean Price as an

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.730
entrepreneur with an idea,
it's a good thing.

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:34.490
But it doesn't have, to me, the
makings of something that

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:38.510
can really re-bind the country
in the way that, say, the New

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:41.410
Deal did after the Wall
Street crash.

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:43.600
And another model
is the internet.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:47.160
There's some writers like Steven
Johnson who hold the

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:52.500
internet up, and the concept of
peer networks, of breaking

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:57.350
down hierarchies and
establishing connections with

00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:04.380
people across different groups
by virtue of something like

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:10.070
Kickstarter, something like
Wikipedia, something like a

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:14.865
new currency that don't rely on
centralized models and on

00:29:14.865 --> 00:29:18.860
government structures, but are
much more happening in civil

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:22.160
society and happening
through technology.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:26.260
And there, too, you know, Peter
Thiel is in my book

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:30.820
because although he's a tech
billionaire and one of the

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:35.710
most successful tech investors
in the world, he asks the

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:39.010
skeptical questions that need
to be asked, and that should

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:41.600
be asked, above all, at
a place like this.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:45.610
How much of a change are
we really making?

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:48.530
How broad is it?

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:52.960
Why is it that the 35 years
from the Apple II to the

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:58.670
present, to the apotheosis of
Google and Facebook, have also

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:01.890
been 35 years of middle
class decline?

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:04.440
Is there a relation between
those two phenomena?

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.720
Are they independent?

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:09.070
These to me are key questions,
and questions that all too few

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:12.760
people in Silicon Valley are
answering or even are asking

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:16.980
because their success has
decoupled them, to some

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:20.380
extent, from the fate of the
rest of the country.

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:25.120
So Thiel is a skeptic that the
internet is more than a net

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:28.040
positive, but not a big one, as
he put it to me, which is a

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:32.850
shocking thing to hear from
the founder of PayPal.

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:37.220
He doesn't think the internet
has done enough to raise

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:40.430
living standards and bring broad
prosperity in the same

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:43.410
way that the earlier
industrial age did.

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:44.710
Maybe it's too soon.

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:47.620
You know, maybe in the
next generation

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:48.890
we'll see the benefits.

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:53.600
But when I hear some people it
tech talking about, well, cash

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.990
value is overrated.

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:58.590
And what we really need to focus
on is all the social

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:01.330
value of technology companies.

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:03.680
That's when I get a little
bit suspicious.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.630
Because it seems as if you're
saying as long as you have

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:10.280
very cool new ways to hang out
with your friends online and

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:14.050
otherwise by mobile, you
shouldn't worry too much about

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:15.620
whether there's a job for you.

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:18.100
Because jobs are overrated.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:21.970
Well, tell that to Tammy
Thomas in Youngstown.

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:25.930
So that's a long way of saying
there are new ideas about how

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:28.610
society is reorganizing
itself in this wide

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:31.460
open and chaotic time.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:35.570
I haven't seen the outlines of
a convincing reorganization

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:42.360
that actually will bring broad
benefits to most of us.

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.150
Any more?

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:44.890
Yes?

00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:49.680
AUDIENCE: So as institutions are
declining that people used

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:53.240
to rely on, what did you find?

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.000
Were there any patterns in the
characters of your books on

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.200
what people were falling back
on to do what they needed to

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.450
do in their lives?

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:01.700
GEORGE PACKER: That's
a great question.

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:05.750
You're on the right track.

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:10.020
Yes, Dean Price does not have
a business association or a

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:14.760
newspaper or union or a local
college behind him.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:21.400
So what he has is a very
American faith in himself

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:25.610
handed down through different
folk philosophers from our

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:31.060
past starting with Emerson and
"Self-Reliance" and then, in

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:34.160
Dean's case, this guy
Napoleon Hill.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.760
Has anyone here heard
of Napoleon Hill?

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:36.920
Very few people have.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:41.220
He was like the first "how to
succeed in business" guru in

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:42.160
American history.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.920
And he wrote a book called
"The Law of Success" and

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:49.680
another book called "Think
and Grow Rich," which are

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:53.150
codifications of all that he
learned from Andrew Carnegie

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:55.680
and Henry Ford and John
D. Rockefeller and the

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:58.450
titans of his age.

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:03.010
He's like the Timothy Ferriss
of the early 20th century.

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:06.430
And Dead has imbibed that
philosophy of if you can think

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:09.690
it and conceive and believe it,
you can achieve it, which

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:14.300
is also the philosophy you find
on pop culture figures

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:17.500
like Oprah Winfrey, who is also
one of the celebrities I

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:18.520
profile in the book.

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:21.430
And it's a very tenacious
American idea.

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:26.640
And I think it is especially
prevalent in times when people

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.820
feel the normal channels of
upward mobility have been

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:30.940
closed off.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:33.940
So they have to fall back on
what might be a kind of

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:38.190
magical thinking about the
powers of the mind.

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:38.900
So that's one.

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:43.260
I mean, religion is a key in
the lives of many of the

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:45.920
characters in my book, but
not organized religion.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:48.180
They're not really involved--

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.790
Tammy Thomas, briefly--

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:52.940
but not so involved in a
particular church, but more

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:59.470
in, again, a kind of individual
faith that might

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:02.970
connect them to something
invisible, but not necessarily

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:03.970
to other people.

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:08.820
There is a real alone-ness to
the lives of these characters.

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:12.639
And they are very much carrying
the weight of their

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:16.330
lives by themselves.

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:17.139
Yes?

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:17.620
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:22.280
So there's a conventional wisdom
that's been around for

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:26.370
a while that says that first the
industrial revolution and

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:32.850
then the information revolution
have push jobs up

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:38.010
the educational food chain by
eliminating the need for

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:44.989
unskilled labor, but that the
high-skilled jobs that

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:47.449
replaced them have
been even better.

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:49.620
But then there's been
a counter push

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:50.914
to that idea recently.

00:34:50.914 --> 00:34:54.310
I know Paul Krugman wrote an
editorial recently in which he

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:58.520
warned about the day when
computers can take over the

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.650
functions of lawyers
and doctors

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:02.800
and software engineers.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:02.900
GEORGE PACKER: Software?

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.220
No, not software engineers.

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:05.790
AUDIENCE: Well?

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:07.935
GEORGE PACKER: You can't
take that away.

00:35:07.935 --> 00:35:11.880
AUDIENCE: Well, as they say,
the singularity is coming.

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.080
GEORGE PACKER: Yeah,
that's sort of a

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.370
Peter Thiel idea, too.

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:17.500
AUDIENCE: So I'm just wondering
where you stand on

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:18.230
this debate.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:21.630
And what do you think would
happen if computers became so

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:23.460
intelligent that none of us--

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:24.680
GEORGE PACKER: That there'd
be no need for us?

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.720
AUDIENCE: Yeah, basically.

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.370
GEORGE PACKER: No need
for writers?

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:30.240
No need for advertisers?

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:33.210
I'd say, we might
as well give up.

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:36.380
AUDIENCE: Or does it mean that
our concept of capitalism

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:39.150
itself needs rethinking?

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:40.810
GEORGE PACKER: There you
get closer to the

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:43.160
Jaron Lanier idea.

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.600
I don't know if any of you know
his new book, which is

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:49.200
also a critical picture of where
technology has brought

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.560
the economy over the
last generation.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.740
There seem to be a whole bunch
of books coming out right now

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:55.670
that are beginning to look more
critically at tech, which

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:56.660
I think is a good thing.

00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:00.530
Not that it deserves to be
torn down, but it's so

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:03.290
powerful and so successful
that it needs to be

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:08.110
scrutinized with as much
critical energy as the oil and

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:12.920
gas sector or the lobbying
industry.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.140
You've just outlined of
terrifying portrait of the

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:19.230
future where none of
us are necessary.

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:23.100
My editor who's here
is not necessary.

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:23.820
None of you are.

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.750
I mean, I thought at least the
software engineers would be

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:32.360
spared, just running around in
the ruins of the singularity.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:38.410
But is that conventional
wisdom?

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:40.300
Or is it wisdom that
you just outlined?

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:42.380
I mean, it seems to me that
is what's happened.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:45.760
The industrial revolution took
away a lot of jobs and created

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:46.710
a lot of jobs.

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:51.170
And the jobs it created were,
for a while, better jobs.

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:53.550
We're now at a stage where
a lot of those jobs have

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:56.520
disappeared partly because
of technology.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:00.600
But there are some very good
jobs that have been

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:01.580
created in the ruins.

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:03.330
And a lot of them
are right here.

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:06.370
I mean, what could be better
than working for Google?

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:09.290
You get all these benefits that
are just unthinkable to

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:12.030
people in other industries.

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:14.450
But there's not that
many of you.

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:17.330
Google's pretty big compared
to Facebook and Twitter.

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:25.470
What you're suggesting is with
Moore's law, we're getting

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:31.170
closer to the point where even
Google could reduce to maybe

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:35.760
200, or maybe 20,
or maybe two.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:38.920
And then the people at the top
will continue to tell us that

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:40.690
Moore's law is good.

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:42.370
But the question of
good for whom will

00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:44.330
be even more pertinent.

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:47.570
So I guess you pretty much
answered your question.

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:51.430
No one outside of a tiny, tiny
little group could be happy

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:54.040
with the picture that you've
portrayed of the future.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:38:00.040
I think there will have to be
some rethinking about the idea

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:04.170
of inevitable progress coming
with technological change,

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:08.160
which is not necessarily
an argument.

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:11.670
But it's almost a faith that
people in the tech world have,

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:14.400
and which people outside it
might be a little more

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:17.370
skeptical of.

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:18.366
One more?

00:38:18.366 --> 00:38:21.670
AUDIENCE: In your time travel
back to the late '70s, permit

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:25.610
me to observe that that's also
the era when deregulation

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:29.550
started to appear and gain
momentum, and looked to many

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:31.250
people like common sense.

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:35.440
Because they always pick the
horror story of needing five

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.400
guys to change a light bulb at
Lincoln Center, or whatever

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.790
the examples are always
phrased as.

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:47.000
Do you believe that contributed
to the unwinding?

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.020
Or do you think it's part of
the unwinding's emphasis on

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:53.190
personal choice and
personal freedom?

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:55.910
Why would I want to be regulated
if my own personal

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:58.860
freedom is the most
important thing?

00:38:58.860 --> 00:38:59.900
GEORGE PACKER: Right, right.

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:04.140
Well, one purpose of regulation,
actually, is to

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:08.780
create a little barrier between
you and the power of

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:10.660
corporations, which
could be called a

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:11.740
kind of personal freedom.

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:13.660
So I wouldn't pit regulations
against

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.350
freedom quite so neatly.

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:17.570
But you're absolutely right
that the late '70s--

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:19.070
and it started under Democrats,

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:20.540
too, we forget that--

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:24.580
in which transportation,
airlines, telecommunications,

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:27.960
oil and gas were all-- the
deregulation began then.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.400
In fact, Edward Kennedy was one
of the main champions of

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.130
deregulation.

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:33.170
It seemed like common sense.

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:35.950
And perhaps it was at the time
because the economy had really

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:39.550
run up against some pretty
serious contradictions.

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:44.250
The word stagflation, which some
of you might not be too

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:46.760
familiar with, was like
mortgage-backed

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.030
securities back then.

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:48.790
It was the thing.

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:51.440
It was like the virus that
we couldn't get rid of.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:56.020
And it seemed like deregulation
and the

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:59.850
financialization of the economy
through unleashing

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:01.960
Wall Street was the
answer to that.

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.800
So every answer creates
a new problem.

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:10.770
And the de-unionization, which
also really had its beginnings

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:13.890
in the late '70s with the
decline of manufacturing that,

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:16.100
too, to some people, seemed
like common sense.

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.280
Unions were standing in
the way of progress.

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:22.700
Well, unions also created a
middle class that would

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:26.160
provide a huge mass of consumers
for the products

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.110
that were made in
this country.

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:29.440
So for every problem you
solve, you might

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.185
create a new one.

00:40:30.185 --> 00:40:33.950
And now, I think we've run up
against maybe the outer limits

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:37.010
of maximizing freedom.

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:40.040
There's always a balance between
freedom and equality.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.900
And what we've done in the past
generation is moved as

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:49.280
far as you can get toward
freedom without having society

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.510
flying apart at the seams.

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:53.180
And that's what I see
happening now.

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:55.800
And yet there is this irony,
which is we've also become

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.350
more inclusive.

00:40:57.350 --> 00:41:01.530
I don't see why we couldn't
have become more inclusive

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:03.580
without becoming less equal.

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:08.880
Why we couldn't have gay boy
scouts and good public schools

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.880
at the same time.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.470
Maybe time for one
more question?

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:13.400
Is there one more?

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.374
Yes?

00:41:14.374 --> 00:41:18.130
AUDIENCE: So a lot of the
decline of manufacturing, I

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:20.960
guess, in the US correlates, I
think, with the decline in the

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:22.200
middle class.

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:25.620
And that correlates, I think,
with globalization.

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:26.460
Do buy in to that?

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:31.740
And if you do, should we feel
bad about the relative minor

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:34.950
decline in American standard
of living when hundreds of

00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:38.445
millions of Chinese have
significantly better standard

00:41:38.445 --> 00:41:39.420
of living because of this?

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:41.330
GEORGE PACKER: Right, right.

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:45.940
Well, you're asking why should
we care more about Americans

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:50.230
than about other people, which
is a big question.

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:51.650
This book is very insular.

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:55.260
It's very much focused on this
country, even though it's

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:58.810
aware of these big changes
happening elsewhere.

00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:02.225
I guess I feel concerned
about my country.

00:42:02.225 --> 00:42:04.240
It's like being worried
about your family.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:06.320
You don't want it to fail.

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:09.120
You want your children to
grow up in a good place.

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.690
We're not all just citizens
of the world now.

00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:15.590
We still belong to certain
physical places that are going

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:16.560
to shape our future.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:20.740
So that's one motive for
my writing the book.

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:24.340
You're right that globalization
brought benefits

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:27.950
to a lot of people and that
there was something

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:30.560
inevitable about it.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.180
I'm not going to fall into the
trap of saying we should

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:38.160
rewind to a period before we
had instant communications

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:38.610
around the world.

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:39.250
It'd be crazy.

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:44.660
But what I see happening is
along with these macroeconomic

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:48.650
forces sweeping in, there have
been social and even moral

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:53.690
changes coming through the back
door and taking advantage

00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:56.260
of the big upheavals
in the economy.

00:42:56.260 --> 00:43:02.070
Which is to say our leaders'
vision growing narrower and

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:06.510
more self-centered and more
willing to do what benefits to

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:09.250
them at the greater expense.

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:12.710
An idea that used to exist in
places where you wouldn't

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:16.990
expect to find it, of having
some responsibility beyond

00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:19.440
one's own most immediate
interest.

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.040
I don't see that very much.

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:23.540
I don't see it in elected
officials.

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:25.550
I don't see it in former
elected officials.

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:28.910
And I don't see it in business
leaders very much either.

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:32.090
And to ask yourself, did
it have to be this way?

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:35.955
You can compare us to a country
like Germany, subject

00:43:35.955 --> 00:43:40.610
to all the same forces of
globalization, immigration,

00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:42.660
the pressures on
manufacturing.

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:46.550
And yet, they made decisions
there that has retained that

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:49.950
social contract among Germans
that we have been

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:51.930
willing to tear up.

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:59.180
We decided we're going to let
the landscape be denuded and

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.920
new things will be built.

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:03.610
And so some new things are
being built, like this.

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:06.920
But I'm concerned about the
country my children are going

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:07.980
to grow up in.

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:11.380
And I'm not sure there'll be
jobs at Google for them.

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:14.590
So that's a long-winded
answer.

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:16.550
And I've been a little
long-winded in general.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:18.450
But I really thank
you all for your

00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:20.270
attention and your welcome.
