yeah I think they're trying to tie it
 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I think they're trying to tie it
all<00:03:29.440><c> and</c><00:03:29.620><c> like</c><00:03:29.769><c> the</c><00:03:29.890><c> creation</c><00:03:30.340><c> aspect</c><00:03:30.489><c> so</c><00:03:31.060><c> I</c>

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 align:start position:0%
all and like the creation aspect so I
 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.190 align:start position:0%
all and like the creation aspect so I

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
think that was kind of where that was
 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.300 align:start position:0%
think that was kind of where that was
