Speaker 2:          00:24          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:27          no. Okay. No, I listen to radio

Speaker 4:          00:39          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:40          [inaudible] I'll continue with here. Report the first large scale study comparing the prevalence of absolute pitch into normal populations by means of professor Diana Deutsch. Deutsch, why? Yeah, I'm going to turn down my head phone. [inaudible] I'm a professor psychology at the University of California San Diego. Can you still hear me dying? Okay. Hello.

Speaker 5:          00:59          Diana. Studies sound how humans perceive sound. She's a scientist. She has a lab, but every so often she will also release cds, right? These a cds of audio demonstrations that she uses in her research and that's why we called because it was in the production of her second CD that she stumbled onto the weirdest phenomenon. Well,

Speaker 3:          01:20          oh, I'll tell you what happened. Does that, um, when you do post production is, as you know of of speech, you look things, look things. Look things so that you can zero in on piece. Cool. That sound too loud. Nita, unpopular ss, that sounds two shops and so on. So you put things on loops in order to fine tune the way the speech sounds. So I had this particular phrase on a loop and forgot about it. What phrase was, this is a phrase that occurs at the beginning of the CD in which I say the sounds as they appear to you and not only different from those that are really present, but they sometimes behave so strangely as to seem quite impossible, quite impossible. Now I had sometimes behave so strangely looped the sounds as they appear to you are not only different from those that are really present, but they sometimes behave so strangely sometimes behave so strangely. Just those few words sometimes behave so strangely and forgot about sometimes behave so strangely, sometimes behave so strange.

Speaker 5:          02:29          So here's what happened. Diana leaves her studio, she closes the door, it goes into the kitchen to make some tea. All the wild. This loop is worrying away in the background

Speaker 3:          02:37          as she's sipping her tea. She thinks sometimes is someone singing strangely who's singing? I heard what sounded like song in the background. Wait a second, that's not singing. That's me talking that very phrase strangely. But at this point sometimes behave so straight. Appear to be sung rather than spoken strangely. Sometimes behave so strangely. This is sometimes behave so strangely, right? You still hear the words but there are some words rather than spoken words.

Speaker 5:          03:10          It's weird like it just switches it a certain point, three or four repetitions in, right? It's going, it's going and then pow becomes music and then now, now none of us can get it out of our head. Like the whole office is like sometimes VA. So strange sometimes VA. So strangely

Speaker 3:          03:27          and you know what if you do this demo and then you go back to the original sentence, it sounds like you know speech to begin with. And when you come to that very phrase as seem to be bursting into song, the sounds as they appear to you are not only different from those that are really present, but they sometimes behave so strangely as to seem quite impossible. I have to say this can continue for months and months. I sort of sort of like your brain gets altered for that particular phrase and it continues to sound like singing for a very, very long time. [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          04:07          alright, so here we have just one small indication that music is crazy. Will it behaves very strangely, right? I mean think about this. We started with some basic speech repeated a few times. Somewhere along the way it leaped into song strangely. How did it change like that and if that's all it takes to turn something into music. And what exactly is music really? Sometimes we hate. So same thing. This is Radiolab. Today's program is about answering that question or trying to, in any case some chat up. I'm rod here with me. [inaudible] Robert Krulwich my partner.

Speaker 6:          04:47          I think it a little hard to get out of your head. I know. It is really cool. I know. Yeah. Okay. So this hour, what are we doing? We are going to try and we will probably fail. You will ask. We will fail, but we will make an earnest effort to try to find the ingredients of music. Both its basis in languages basis in physics is basis in your brain will look everywhere we can software trying to find out what music is made of and why it touches us so intimately,

Speaker 5:          05:16          so strange, so strange and touches us sometimes. Not In a good way. If you've ever had this experience of going to a concert, hearing some music and it just made you upset for some reason, like irrationally upset, right? Almost like you wanted to hurt someone. If that rings a bell, there's a segment later in the show, you will not want to miss [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          05:39          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          05:39          this is Radiolab. Stick around. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          05:46          Eh, a pretty messed up. Shall we start?

Speaker 5:          06:00          Sure. Well first, thanks to the LaGuardia High School Chorus and Robert Apostle, they were the voices you just heard.

Speaker 3:          06:05          Hi Baby. Hey, we're here. More of them later.

Speaker 6:          06:09          So let's explore a little bit more closely this connection between language and music. You think of them as separate. The thing is they're really closely related, says neuroscientists, mark, Jude tremble when we speak. We Sing, you'd know how to use the pitch of your voice to convey emotion and meaning like, um, I went to the store just because I raised the pitch. The note, if you will, you interpret that as an interrogative, a monotonic speech, you know, talking at the same rate and rhythm in the same pitch and loudness. I mean that is not how humans talk,

Speaker 5:          06:50          but humans talking to all kinds of different ways in different languages. Each language has its own musical personality. German is different than French is different than Swahili and if you look at those differences closely, there are all kinds of things we can learn about music. Tick Diana Deutsch. Okay. She's recently been looking at tone languages, just published her results and the results are startling. Diana, before we start, what exactly is it? Tone language.

Speaker 3:          07:16          Okay. In 10 languages, words take on different meanings depending upon the tone in which they are enunciated. For example, Mandarin has four tones and the word mar in Mandarin means mother in the first tone, hemp in the second tone horse in the third tone and a reproach in the fourth tone. Could you say the name? Would you like me to? Yeah. Could you just say you were, I thought you were well up. You know I had them on CD, but I'd rather hear you say them well. Um, okay. So excuse my bad pronunciation without trying. [inaudible] means Martha Ma means hemp. Ma means horse and Ma is a reproach. Huh? [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          08:09          so conceivably if you screwed up the tones you could call your mom a horse.

Speaker 3:          08:14          Yes, indeed. In fact, there are quite a lot of jokes where westerners who don't speak the tones, right? Say terrible things. [inaudible] you have to be very careful. [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          08:30          see this is a basic difference in English. We don't really worry about pitch. We can see our words up here or down here or glycerin up or bended down and it's all the same. Not so with tone languages. In any case, this is where it gets interesting. One day Diana is working with some mandarin speakers and she notices something. There were these words, these words that they would say where they would all hit precisely the same note

Speaker 3:          08:56          with their voices, not just close to one another either. Exactly, precisely and consistently the same pitch even on different days. In fact, would you like me to play for you one person reciting a list of 12 mandarin tones on two different days? Yeah, definitely. Um, first you have the first word spoken on. Yeah,

Speaker 7:          09:22          day one followed by the same word spoken and teachers yell. Then you have the second word spoken on Day one, jaw followed by the same word, spoken day two [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          09:34          way here you can see the consistency is going to appear as though the words are being repeated immediately. Like in fact the repetitions are coming entirely different days. So each of those word pairs came out of the mouth of one person separated by like 24 hours. Oh, much more than that. Something like a week. Really. And it was a remarkable consistency Jean gene. Well that'd be like a sane, the word mom always at this note right here, mom, mom, mom. I concluded that basically this was a form of perfect pair.

Speaker 7:          10:10          Sure. [inaudible] she should be [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          10:16          I've never quite understood what perfect pitch is to be honest.

Speaker 5:          10:20          You don't know what that is.

Speaker 8:          10:21          No. Should I, and I know I should,

Speaker 5:          10:25          but whisper it to me as a musician growing up. Perfect pitches like that. It's like the thing, it's like the thing you wish you had and none of us have basically. It's like having a tuning fork in your brain here. I'll give you an analogy. Yeah. Okay. You see this Coffee Cup I'm holding? Yeah. What color is it? Brown. And you knew that how? Through my eyes. Right. You didn't need me to put this Brown Coffee Cup next to my blue jeans. No, I didn't have to see the Brown. I mean it's absolute brown. Absolute Brown. Perfect pitch. People have that with pitch. They hear a pitch. They knew exactly what note it is.

Speaker 3:          11:02          The rest of us have to run to the piano. So if the hero from an elevator, can they name the note? Yeah, that's exactly it. Anything with a pitch like a horn honk, they could tell you that horn is enough. Or those church bells, they're alternating between B flat and B and if the faucet were dripping, they could see that faucet is dripping in. It's d sharp. They don't even have to think about it. They just know it used to be the, the note names would jump out at me. Diana Deutsch is actually one of these lucky people to the extent that it would even be a nuisance. And why? Why is that good?

Speaker 5:          11:38          Well, it's really rare. It only happens like once every 10,000 people here in America. Europe. Yeah. And so it is turning your tongue to a poem and of the people who have it. Yeah. Well, let's see how many, how should I say this? If you look in your music history textbook, so you will see that every famous composer like the really big ones, right?

Speaker 3:          12:09          [inaudible] Beethoven,

Speaker 4:          12:13          [inaudible],

Speaker 3:          12:14          they all had it when really Mendelsohn, the list goes on and on. So if you have perfect pitch on some level, you are

Speaker 4:          12:23          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          12:23          closer to them.

Speaker 4:          12:27          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          12:27          he's got the gift. [inaudible] Danielle,

Speaker 5:          12:34          let's get back to Diana Deutsch. Okay. Okay. Let's talk about your latest experiment. That's the one really interested in. Okay. You see, you compare Chinese kids to American kids to see who has perfect pitch. More so the, explain how this works. You had a group of Chinese music students, Air Group of American music students at the Eastman School of music here in New York. You played them a bunch of notes I imagine in a room and ask them to guess what those notes were right now.

Speaker 3:          12:59          Well, the test consisted of piano tones, which began on the c below middle c, this note and extended up three up gives all the way to the that note. That's a big range. Yeah. 36 notes. Can you demonstrate you sure. Yes. Here is six chones. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Such as where given in the test.

Speaker 5:          13:27          So you would have played those notes to both sets of kids and asked them to name the notes without going to the piano. What were the notes? Really

Speaker 3:          13:34          what these notes were? D e g sharp, c sharp, d sharp and g.

Speaker 5:          13:42          Um, what were the results?

Speaker 3:          13:44          Well, it turns out the Chinese group far outperformed the small group of those students who started musical training ages four and five 74% of the Chinese group show. Perfect pitch. But 14% of the US non-tariff 74% the Beijing group was nine times roughly more likely to show perfect pitch than the American Jesus. That's the [inaudible] group daggering difference. It's a staggering difference.

Speaker 4:          14:12          Mm.

Speaker 8:          14:14          And it's your hunch that the difference is because they speak a tone language.

Speaker 3:          14:19          That's my hat. I mean the, it's, it's known that

Speaker 3:          14:25          the first year of life saved for made six months up to, you know, a little a year infants learn features of their native language. This is a very, very important stage. Let's suppose that tone and the absolute pitch of tones is a feature which is potentially available to anyone. Babies who are exposed only to an international language such as English are not given the opportunity to acquire, chose, then they're going to be at a real disadvantage when they come later on to learn to take Whittick lessons. So you think that as there, Huh? [inaudible] let me ask we this, as they're learning their language, which includes inherently music, right? To some degree, they are essentially learning two languages as they learn one. Is that right? It's a matter of fact, if you take the first tone [inaudible] it's a flat tone. It's really sung compared with English speech.

Speaker 3:          15:33          It's really more like song that's, that's always been sort of the stereotype of the Chinese languages. It's very sort of sing Sony. Yes. Tony soil mean Guido home bow share, Lambeau Shirley bow shoe for example, the third child in Mandarin Ma. It's sort of like a j type pattern. The second term, which is a gentle output, bless Ma, the fourth child, which is a rapid downward place ma. I mean these are all kinds of musical relationships. Yeah. Given the evidence on absolute pitch, one could speculate further said, well maybe other features of music are also enhanced for individuals who start off learning tone language. So, so the, here's my big question. Could this explain the experience that I had? And I think a lot of people have this experience when they're taking music lessons and we were playing little piddly pieces like [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          16:29          and here are these Chinese girls right here playing rough monarch. Brilliant. Yeah. Is this why? Well, I think it's a viable hypothesis. I mean, evidently it could be something else. It could be something else going on. Like what? I mean, one could argue that instead it might be genetic and so on, but they're seen as such a, it's such a boring theory, like always a boring theory. And furthermore, we don't have to assume that knowing what we do about exposure to tone language in very early childhood as a as a, it's just not fair. And I think we can look at it another way around here. We have a faculty that had been fought to be confined to a few rare individuals who are just extraordinarily gifted, right? That might in fact be available to any individual provided they're given the right exposure at a critical period. And that raises the question of what other sorts of abilities could be brought out if we only knew just what to do. There may be much more human potential than we had realized.

Speaker 5:          18:00          Diana Deutsch is a professor of music psychology at the University of San Diego, music psychology, music psychology. And as I mentioned earlier, she's also the releaser of two cds. She has two cds, one's called musical illusions and paradoxes. And the other one is called Phantom words and other curiosities. What w what would you put on a CD? Exactly. She puts these little audio pieces that she uses in her research. The stuff I guess that she will play to subjects as she tests them and she puts these on cities cause they're kind of fun to listen to. This is like an ear test or, yeah, sort of. We've actually put a couple on our website. Well what do they sound like? We just get that little sample. All right. I'll give you some samples. A, there is the chromatic illusion. Ken has a carnival feel to it. There's also the, uh,

Speaker 10:         18:49          Biana Ellucian. Oh, the can be up illusion

Speaker 5:          18:53          and of course the phantom word experiments. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa. None of those pieces are gonna make any kind of sense unless you visit our website, radiolab.org where all will be explained
