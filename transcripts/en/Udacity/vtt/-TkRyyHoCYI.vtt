00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.920
So to talk about other tools
that you might use for

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.944
prototyping, we've brought
in Cody from Pixate.

00:00:04.944 --> 00:00:06.573
&gt;&gt; Hi, there.

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:09.590
&gt;&gt; So Cody, what is Pixate?

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.770
&gt;&gt; Pixate is a prototyping
platform definitely used for

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:20.740
more intense animations or
detailed animations, interactions also.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.410
But it's all done natively, so on
the device that you're prototyping for,

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.890
you get the same effects on
scroll views, on the animations,

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.510
anything that you would normally see in
an app, we can reproduce through Pixate.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.830
&gt;&gt; Perfect, that's wonderful.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.910
So it sounds like it's good at these
sort of higher fidelity prototypes.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.810
It's good at these
micro-interactions and

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.240
getting things right when you're
doing some small part of the app.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.960
&gt;&gt; Right, it definitely focuses on
reproducing a real experience within

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.410
the app, as opposed to, maybe ones that
are more, you know, like paper for

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.210
instance, or
anything like that where it,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.150
you don't get the full feeling of it.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.600
What you can do is, when you prototype
through Pixate, you can basically

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.560
hand this over to someone, a developer,
someone maybe you're selling the app to,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.920
and show them exactly how you
expect it to work as the designer.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.010
&gt;&gt; So a tool like Pixate would make
it much easier to have a design

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.400
consultation, we'll be doing
later on in the lesson.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.754
So Cody, why are micro-interactions
important for a prototype?

00:01:16.754 --> 00:01:20.410
&gt;&gt; Micro-interactions are really
important from the design aspect because

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.350
you want to show exactly the animations,
the movement of the different elements

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.160
within the app to give everyone a better
idea of what you're trying to build and

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.190
what you kind of envision
as the designer.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.170
&gt;&gt; So what kind of questions do you get
from entrepreneurs about your product?

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.500
&gt;&gt; A lot of questions
we get are related to

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.570
what to do with it once
you've created a prototype.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.090
I feel like that may be kind of
a pain point for some people,

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.130
because they hear they have this design
and they can show it to whomever.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.245
However, they get to hand
this over to a developer now,

00:01:49.245 --> 00:01:51.547
and show them exactly
the animations they're looking for.

00:01:51.547 --> 00:01:55.325
And the developer, for the most part,
can translate that over to code, and

00:01:55.325 --> 00:01:57.050
then generate the app from there.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.256
&gt;&gt; Okay, so
once you've built the prototype,

00:01:59.256 --> 00:02:01.693
you get a lot of questions
about what to do with it,

00:02:01.693 --> 00:02:04.405
and your suggestions are pretty much,
have it built.

00:02:04.405 --> 00:02:06.880
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, that's correct,
yeah, just build it.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.750
Just hand it over to the developer and
build from there.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.020
We want to work on obviously a lot
of ways to improve that process,

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.570
like giving in code export or,
you know, other features like that,

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.110
which we're kind of working
on alongside other features.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.550
Ultimately, right now the best way
to do it is to just show them.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.950
&gt;&gt; Okay, perfect.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.390
So we've covered what you do once
you've gotten the Pixate prototype.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.440
What is the process for
getting in to the Pixate prototype?

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.320
Let's say we've got people who have
an InVision prototype or have a set of

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.070
screens that have already been made,
what do they do to get that into Pixate?

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.958
&gt;&gt; Ideally, the best way to do it is,

00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:43.050
so the way the Pixate works is
it works solely with assets,

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.190
assets being images or soon actually
video, and things like that.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.820
What they'll want to do is take that
information or those images they have

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.020
through InVision, those screens, and
transfer them into Sketch, Photoshop,

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.325
anything like that, and then from that
point they can put it into Pixate,

00:02:59.325 --> 00:03:00.920
create them as individual layers and

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.210
start playing around with
creating those interactions.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.480
&gt;&gt; Perfect, thank you.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.725
Thank you for coming in Cody.

00:03:05.725 --> 00:03:06.650
&gt;&gt; Not a problem at all, thank you.
