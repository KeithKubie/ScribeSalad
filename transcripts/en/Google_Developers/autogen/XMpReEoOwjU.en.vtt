00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.280
 I'm Michael, I work for 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.640
 devised a company of Cesena where development 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.240
 applications 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.610
 not only but currently with via chain e 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.900
 in this the twenty minutes I want to talk 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.590
 of how to make de florio in 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.590
 php application on google app engine 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:37.070
 that what I wanted to do was create 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.710
 an application was just the word l 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.330
 and do a kitchen sink type thing 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.390
 then a small china application 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.129
 that he could have some things inside 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.690
 a few examples to be able to show you 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.780
 how it was actually done 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.600
 php integration on google app 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.800
 engine I thought then that the world 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.110
 he absolutely needed one 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.760
 tutu application because those facts 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:04.360
 until now they didn't satisfy me 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:08.659
 totally brackets how many must php 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.060
 I thought less well ok all the code 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.799
 is available to that tab account is 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.159
 freely downloadable even now if 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.159
 want 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.380
 perfect so i left from 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.830
 a tutu application that does not 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.540
 nothing else after I will show you that 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.940
 accept a file a description e 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.130
 load everything and make the list said 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.970
 duch has entered one so far 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.590
 what is really interesting and we'll see 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.360
 like what are the necessary exteriors 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.250
 to be able to make it run on google 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.320
 app engine very quick introduction su 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.429
 what was with its features 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.440
 main php on google app engine 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:57.170
 first of all the php version 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:59.659
 available in 4 recently 5 between 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.979
 a lot of 56 will be released for 54 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.149
 consider that most of them 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:07.420
 applications run on 53 and some on 52 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.420
 so much so 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:14.269
 plus they vary in php turns in one 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.620
 this sandbox means that it has 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.459
 some features some 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:23.780
 limitations such as particular from some 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:26.660
 extensions not available in 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.560
 cool detail that I believe is fine 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.510
 an extension that more or less everyone is 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.910
 expect to have in a draw in 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.530
 php standard 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.900
 the magic to work with my vehicles 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.140
 then resize processing 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.660
 image and another 15 was an ad 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.519
 example the one to check i 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.860
 processes then create super processes 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:55.260
 hole that etc. of me 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:03:00.540
 the ecdc are rigid there are yes yes yes ones 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:05.100
 graph the question some functions are 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.380
 disable some permanent mode 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.430
 he quoted me some and it's that you can't 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.960
 execute processes run at commands 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.970
 from within php functions that 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.040
 work with files in general that 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.400
 create made frogs etc after we will see 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.660
 because some are partially disabled 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.300
 slash and pre grace type modification 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.710
 and others are disabled soft mode 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.780
 so it means that they can be 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.060
 manually re-enabled 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.710
 also here we will see later how it is possible 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.210
 do it what is the particularity the file 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.400
 system and read only 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.280
 that is why it is not possible to go 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.810
 to perform functions that work 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.940
 with temporary files and so on 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.070
 then your deputy code on a 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.240
 file system that read only 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.460
 so if you have apps that do 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.910
 caching on file system or yes 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.740
 expect to be predictable below 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.140
 it can be as problematic as you need to be 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.360
 rethink it so that it works the way 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.100
 different files can be explored 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.610
 on google plus store later I'll show you 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.550
 like other particularities it is not possible 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.860
 call external services directly 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.870
 that's why curl is disabled on 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.930
 google service called orf 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.900
 service and even later I'll show you 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:25.800
 how it is possible to implement 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.690
 quite transparent integration 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.710
 other features as he said before 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.260
 in the cold 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.930
 replies must be generated within 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.750
 some time 60 seconds per issue 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.250
 scalability efficiency and the 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.260
 size of the answers generated 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:45.380
 dynamically it must be the 32 best 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.380
 of me 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.180
 then the first experiment we have 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.420
 you made a graph to the question you deserve one 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.980
 handbag 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.170
 the first experiment we did 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.960
 when there is access to google app engine 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.330
 has been install without sadly 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.090
 we discovered that unfortunately symphony 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.560
 it depends on its own level is needed 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.660
 inside the kernel and other libraries 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.450
 depends strictly on the fact of having 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.430
 a filesystem that can be written to today 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.580
 I can tell you it's not possible 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:21.520
 installing symphony is possible 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:26.400
 install sinex that we would like the relative 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.400
 the small center child and we say so 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.390
 yes here I made an example with twigg that 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:41.170
 here too they have templating bridles 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.490
 php vaguely marty relative intrigues ad 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.910
 example you can disable the 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.530
 caching so it is possible to say that not 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:54.520
 go to write on file system are not 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:56.740
 sincerely smarty in that case though 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:08.650
 you could pre generate it before the fly 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:11.140
 harlow after christmas integrates done in that 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:15.490
 way there practically to see 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:19.490
 after other things the sessions natively 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:21.530
 are saved on the main cash e 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.789
 therefore practically all the functions of 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.460
 low level to work with 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:29.090
 sessions session start scene id etcetera 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:31.190
 they work as you would expect the play 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.750
 which contains all session data from 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.789
 great saw shaun this too 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.160
 works quietly without 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:40.400
 having to do nothing if you use a framework 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:43.220
 you may need to change landers 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:47.389
 that the framework sets and to use in 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:50.870
 effects in cash other particularities i 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:52.639
 logs are managed via syslog also here 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:56.120
 natively php has a function for 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:07:01.610
 write the log on exists 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:03.860
 and depending on or less than yours 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:08.150
 application that your vocation 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:09.680
 face caching does you have to rethink 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.240
 change this behavior because 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:16.460
 as we said before the file system is not 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:18.050
 writable end these were a lot 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.190
 quickly the peculiarities of 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.720
 I advise you to read the 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.280
 documentation that is very comprehensive 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.139
 very complete this case of doing 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.259
 really a summary of the things that 

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:31.360
 at least in my experience I am 

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:33.139
 found to face another step like it 

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.630
 preliminary for you could try 

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:39.979
 the app install to the sdk there is there 

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:41.300
 the link and requirements 

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:43.190
 you must have installed python on 

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:46.490
 car because most of the 

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:51.259
 Turkish supplies python and you need to have 

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:53.409
 installed at 1 php cga this because 

00:07:51.259 --> 00:07:56.270
 as I will show you later there is a 

00:07:53.409 --> 00:08:01.819
 server needs to test and needs the 

00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:03.289
 module via understand that you download everything 

00:08:01.819 --> 00:08:09.710
 put it where you want to talk to him about 

00:08:03.289 --> 00:08:13.159
 add this url all inclusive in 

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:15.800
 so that then leaders can go to 

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:20.659
 draw classes provided by the sdk 

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:22.190
 when you need to use another step 

00:08:20.659 --> 00:08:24.910
 next in a similar way to that 

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:26.830
 alex explained first 

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:29.560
 to deplore an application you must 

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:33.070
 create an apm file in the root and del 

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:37.440
 project shows us 

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:39.910
 I think it says ok what you have to write 

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.010
 first setting the name of the project 

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:44.560
 this was self-generated kept it that way 

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:46.420
 the version as explained by Alfredo before 

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:51.270
 it is possible to define more than one version 

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:57.330
 they are questioned about his penance in 

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:57.330
 time php enough nothing else 

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:03.610
 always in the same file you must say in 

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:06.430
 which way you want to manage the rl's 

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:09.120
 your application in my case in the 

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:11.680
 case of this application or defined 

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:15.430
 cooney and her in particular I said 

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:17.080
 that the rls they are mapped to 

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:20.710
 directory I'll show you better later 

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:22.270
 web css and javascript and so 

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:26.380
 the web is mapped 

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:28.480
 js all the rest is thrown into index 

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:30.910
 which is basically the front roller 

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:33.280
 ok then the php file from which it comes to 

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:35.350
 which all requests arrive and then 

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:38.070
 he internally makes the of space towards 

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.070
 right action 

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:44.560
 as I said before there are some 

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:47.140
 functions that are soft and dictated 

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:49.810
 you can re-enable them in this way here 

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:51.210
 defined a php.ini file always in the 

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:53.920
 root and your project 

00:09:51.210 --> 00:10:03.300
 and here you can through this directive 

00:09:53.920 --> 00:10:05.440
 of the cipe which functions to rehabilitate well 

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:07.060
 as he explained to him in the cold but it is 

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.560
 You can test your code in 

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.940
 see if it actually works 

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:13.360
 without having to complain about app engine 

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:16.800
 first this way the server starts 

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.800
 of development that you must pass 

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:22.840
 of the php cgi executable which is what 

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:24.910
 in fact it will take care of breaking away from the 

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.470
 php code e 

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:28.270
 the directory that contains yours 

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:33.030
 project 

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:33.030
 and you may also want to apply a host 

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:38.590
 make the server start up yours 

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:41.350
 tests once you have done everything e 

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:43.750
 you want to upload your own 

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:48.460
 app on app engine you have this 

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:50.620
 command update directory contains e 

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:52.720
 this project will require the first one 

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:55.960
 once the username and password are 

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.430
 those with whom he lived and benji and then 

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.700
 proceed to make him weak 

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:59.700
 application 

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:04.710
 at that point the application as it did 

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:07.690
 see in the cold but will be available on 

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:10.510
 the name of the project draft point 

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:16.360
 up point spot 

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:23.830
 ok of the slides I wanted you to show 

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:26.950
 now a little bit of code then first 

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:30.490
 let's start with the application this mine 

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:33.930
 wonderful application so I can 

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.930
 say I have to do the shopping 

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:46.060
 I enclose the perfect shopping list for 

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:47.950
 added a line this and that file 

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:50.320
 I can that is listed and can 

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:54.430
 download it from here I can give of 

00:11:50.320 --> 00:12:00.700
 erase that bastic entity really 

00:11:54.430 --> 00:12:03.850
 innovative because you laugh sorry is not ok 

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:06.100
 i show some code this is 

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:08.040
 the e-mail I mentioned earlier 

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:14.020
 you see quite big and the character 

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:15.790
 I'll take it as a yes ok I added 

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.630
 a directive to escape some files 

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:22.440
 in particular 

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:25.030
 the logs that are saved locally 

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:30.130
 on the local machine once deputies 

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:32.490
 they are saved on sysload and not there 

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.490
 more 

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:44.490
 if these here accept this parameter 

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.490
 which he accepts 

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:57.460
 yes we say that to date the majority 

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:59.110
 of non-legacy application we are using 

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:02.350
 all the paradigm neither from controller 

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:04.390
 so actually a php file just that 

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:06.610
 it flies all the requests then 

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:09.630
 internally, however, if you want you can do it 

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.630
 then having it done yes yes certain 

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:16.450
 I'll show you the code is not there 

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:20.220
 nothing really formidable 

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:23.290
 I don't know how many of you know silex 

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:25.840
 lots of perfect okay silex is a 

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:27.220
 micro framework is basically gives me 

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:33.820
 the possibility of defining in a way 

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:36.580
 quite simple of the routes and the 

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:39.670
 options that you can do on those 

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:43.740
 routes to dese this saying that when 

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:49.480
 I post to flash news 

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:54.960
 I perform this function here ok knock down 

00:13:49.480 --> 00:14:00.190
 simple is not rocket science 

00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:03.540
 here he defined the home routes here 

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:07.570
 it is not a repository that for scarce tools 

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:13.710
 the new that creates a new elite tool 

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:13.710
 of the Italian and download then 

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:24.630
 the first thing I told you was the logs 

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:25.170
 normally the logo would be saved on 

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.930
 file 

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:34.100
 ok so the default would be saved 

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:36.470
 on file I have to use syslog in this case 

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:39.870
 I have defined two configuration files 

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:41.490
 a local that specifies how it is 

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.000
 involves local and one application 

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:44.660
 prod 

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.490
 and that is controlled by this 

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:49.080
 There are a thousand other ways 

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:51.500
 this is definitely not the best but 

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:55.560
 it was the fastest so I did so 

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:58.920
 practically when I'm in the local thing 

00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:03.840
 I'm saying well first that the files 

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:06.690
 are loaded on file system that 

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:08.460
 the url to where I want to plodari file of 

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:10.340
 form that will allow me to file plodari 

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:13.380
 flash news 

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:16.520
 and that the files will be uploaded to 

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:19.620
 web upload directory 

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:21.740
 all end here 

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:26.760
 so let's say the place behaves 

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:30.810
 as I normally expect the remote 

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:32.460
 what happens instead I can of kos 

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:36.060
 use as I told you google cloud 

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:37.320
 google cloud storage storage gives you the 

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.660
 possibility to define budgets 

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:42.890
 so of hitters where you can go to 

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:45.630
 put in your files and how 

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:50.580
 you can log in as explained 

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:53.640
 first in the cold using sdk you can 

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:59.760
 go and say we create a 

00:15:53.640 --> 00:16:03.090
 vrl to upload my files and go 

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:06.420
 was in this parameter here that 

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:10.100
 parameter will then be used to populate 

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:10.100
 the action field of the form 

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:16.370
 once the file is completed 

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:19.890
 and a post is made 

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:23.190
 then l that you specify then i am 

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:25.140
 telling me a url to upload the file 

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:28.110
 and then when you're done 

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:30.900
 make a post with the content with the 

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:33.500
 files and other data, if any, in the 

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:36.900
 mail to stage news 

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:39.480
 ok that works in two steps 

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:42.360
 I do there is the form does the summit at 

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:44.790
 werder allo rl created by these 

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.510
 bookstore and then the bookstores do it on purpose 

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:48.510
 to the news 

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:49.200
 so if you noticed here I didn't have to 

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:54.420
 change anything 

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:59.070
 that is me anyway saying me 

00:16:54.420 --> 00:17:01.500
 appearance of the data imposed on the lorelle 

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:07.110
 slash new allow me to create a 

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:09.780
 new tool here also le files 

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:12.150
 file operations work the way 

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:14.959
 transparent nothing 

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:14.959
 thanks to the fact that 

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:20.190
 integration with a 

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:22.770
 cloud storage has implemented as one 

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:28.590
 stream x is indeed if we go to 

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:33.240
 see here i'm saying charge up gs 

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:35.490
 that google storage and the no of mine 

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.110
 then budget basically their own 

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:42.660
 of code I don't have to change anything 

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:46.550
 f this integration made at the level of 

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:52.730
 squeeze for the same passion 

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:55.260
 similarly it works for the 

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:57.630
 requests to external services 

00:17:55.260 --> 00:18:01.250
 I don't know if you noticed it wasn't 

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:01.250
 certainly visible at most 

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.920
 here I show the time here not here 

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:07.800
 I created it 

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:09.750
 but it is loaded by recalling a 

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:13.170
 external service there had been its own 

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:15.960
 external service doing total scraping 

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:18.420
 however many worked or looking for a 

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:21.230
 service remains to have the time 

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:24.240
 seems the hardest thing in the world 

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:28.770
 how the code works I show 

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:31.880
 even here curl has disabled but 

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:35.780
 functions that work with the file 

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:39.360
 accept work also with streams 

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:44.520
 import it is possible to create a context 

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:47.130
 this way saying st http method e 

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.600
 get and here I could pass others 

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:52.190
 additional parameters such as headers 

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:54.600
 http with customer streaming contest 

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:58.830
 we are going to physically create the object 

00:18:54.600 --> 00:19:01.140
 context we move to get file 

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.910
 conference which is therefore basic 

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:06.480
 simulating what it would do curious 

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:09.890
 making an http get request with those 

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.890
 parameters that we have passed 

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:23.190
 actually in my opinion a specific case 

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:31.110
 I'm doing a get so we could 

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:32.460
 put it to make a certain post if ok 

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:37.020
 so this and how it works 

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:38.580
 integration external services all 

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:42.300
 functions that work on files accept 

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:44.700
 it looks and you can work this way 

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:46.650
 in the same way all the functions that 

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:49.440
 work here file allow go to 

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:51.630
 read and refresh yourself on the gluck up 

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:58.680
 google cloud storage because that too 

00:19:51.630 --> 00:20:02.090
 see a stream as last as 

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:02.090
 work with the database 

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:10.800
 I'll show you the class too 

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:13.320
 really interesting simply a 

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.070
 repository for now to draw object 

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.940
 of a certain type 

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:20.430
 here I do nothing but create a 

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:23.430
 pd oe object you can make queries e 

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:26.310
 that make me return smooth objects 

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:30.030
 even these normal php code between 

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:36.450
 quotes as the integration takes place 

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:39.290
 well in case of environment of this must 

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:43.830
 medical I create a normal connection 

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:44.610
 of bilocale my name in the db username 

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:51.230
 password 

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:51.230
 nothing else app engine instead 

00:20:54.230 --> 00:21:09.389
 the part that interests us is this you 

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:11.429
 create one from google and the meter of 

00:21:09.389 --> 00:21:15.240
 connection is this unique link 

00:21:11.429 --> 00:21:18.509
 socket this string here where this 

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:20.070
 last piece is the name of the fresh is the 

00:21:18.509 --> 00:21:23.580
 project name two points in the name of 

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:25.850
 database for the rest minus a database 

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:29.309
 and this I seem to be all without passing 

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:34.860
 also other users to foreigners 

00:21:29.309 --> 00:21:36.919
 connection here from this pd or end 

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:39.919
 all the rest of a way 

00:21:36.919 --> 00:21:39.919
 transparent
