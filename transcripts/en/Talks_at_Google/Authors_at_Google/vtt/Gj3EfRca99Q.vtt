KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: Please
give a warm welcome to today's

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.413
speaker, a designer and
gardener, Leonie Cornelius.

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:15.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.380
LEONIE CORNELIUS: Hi, all.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.320
You're very welcome to
my talk on dream gardens.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.540
I'm absolutely
delighted to be here.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.020
It's a real honor.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.090
And I have to admit, I've
never actually given this talk

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.400
to a group of people
that may or may not

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.720
have an interest in gardens.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.710
So it's always been like garden
festivals and garden design

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.700
courses and things like that.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.290
So over the past week or so,
I've been kind of going, oh,

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.320
my god, how am I going to make
these guys not fall asleep?

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.790
And how do I make it relevant
to what you guys actually do?

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.280
And it actually got me thinking
about the overlap and the core

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.380
of what we do as designers, as
people that offer a service.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.830
And really what
it kind of boiled

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.230
down to for me was that
we offer an experience.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.050
We provide an experience.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.270
And that's something that's
really important to me,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.570
because I'm really interested
in people and in how people

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.500
experience a space, a
garden, how they walk into it

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.710
and feel from an
emotional point of view.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.640
And I think that has a lot of
overlap with what you guys do,

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.780
because what you're providing
is an online virtual experience.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.350
And the overlap there is
that if it doesn't feel good,

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.340
and if it doesn't feel right,
the user is gone immediately.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.870
So same thing in a garden.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.450
If it's a badly
designed space, and it's

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.540
not natural to move
through and feels good,

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.290
you're just never going
to actually go out

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.310
into that space.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.350
You can't move around
a space if it doesn't

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.970
circulate well, et cetera.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.870
So there's a lot of
similarities and core principles

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.160
that overlap.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.750
So within the virtual experience
and the tangible, the garden,

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.850
we have a lot of
overlaps, like making

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.630
a space or an experience, the
experience more usable, more

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.780
inspiring, more accessible,
more forward-thinking,

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.971
probably more so for you guys
than in my role as a garden

00:02:06.971 --> 00:02:07.470
designer.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.270
But having said that,
there's so much you

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.510
can do to think ahead,
even in garden design,

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.670
sustainability, et cetera.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.990
More beautiful and obviously
more joyful, and by that,

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.430
I mean that you either go onto
a webpage, and it feels good,

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.625
or you go into a garden,
and it feels good.

00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:27.000
And there's a huge
amount of that

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.690
in the book in how
you experience a space

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.999
and how it makes you feel.

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:33.540
And that's always
something I've been

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.600
interested in, because my
mom is a psychotherapist.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.140
So we've always kind of talked
things to absolute death.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.560
And it kind of bled
into my work as well.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.650
So the talk-- in a way, I mean,
there's plenty of garden stuff

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.090
there, and most
of it is gardens.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.040
But it's not just about gardens.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.270
It's about people and
about experiences and about

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.640
emotional reactions to spaces.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.080
So for today's
garden design talk,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.110
the talk is about you,
because you guys are actually

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.400
the clients in this situation.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.000
So I want you to think, right,
I want to design something

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.280
in this and come away with
something that can actually

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.910
be used in your own spaces.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.650
So whether you have a
balcony or a little patio

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.400
or a huge field or
a friend's space

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.110
that you want to
think about, it's

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.624
worth kind of thinking
about that as we go along

00:03:24.624 --> 00:03:26.790
and maybe just having
something to take away from it

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.640
that really inspires you.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.950
So the most important
thing, I think,

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.120
is when I go into somebody's
space is, who is that person?

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.400
So I kind of try and
leave my ego at the door

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.980
when I go into somebody's space,
and it's all about that person.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.590
So in this instance,
it's about you.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.897
And you need to think
about, who am I?

00:03:45.897 --> 00:03:47.730
If you're thinking about
designing a garden,

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.610
outdoor space for
yourselves, how do I live?

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.610
How do I spend my
day in the garden?

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.040
And that's often--
it's thought about,

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.195
but it's not given
enough attention.

00:03:59.195 --> 00:04:01.320
So what you're thinking
about is, what do you like?

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.310
What's your lifestyle?

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.740
How do you spend
time in the garden?

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.950
Who are you on a personal level?

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.440
Do you have kids, pets?

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.210
Do you read or write sports?

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.060
So they're all incredibly
important elements

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.560
to consider when you go about
designing any kind of a space,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.170
because that's kind of who
you are from a lifestyle

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.540
perspective.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.154
But when I started
writing my book,

00:04:23.154 --> 00:04:25.320
I kind of realized that a
lot of garden design books

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.050
go straight into that.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.570
And yes, that's
really important,

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.460
but there's something else
which is really important

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.920
and which often does get
completely forgotten about.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.660
And that's your
dreams for the space.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.690
And a few people were
like, oh, your dreams.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.200
Why?

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.790
Why do you have to
dream and all that?

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.890
You can just say, I
want that nice garden.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.950
And again, probably, because
my mom's a psychotherapist,

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.290
I like to take that step
back and just think, no.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.770
It's good to dream, and
it's good to open your mind

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.260
before you start going into
detail and into functions

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.120
and clotheslines
and compost bins

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.730
and all that stuff, which has
nothing to do with dreams.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.020
It's just practical in function.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.970
So in this instance, your
dreams are your vision

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.050
of your perfect space.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.580
So gardens are
intensely personal,

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.810
just like interior design is.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.120
They're part of you, part of
your home in the best scenario.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.054
They're extensions
of your living space.

00:05:19.054 --> 00:05:21.470
And that's why I think it's
really important to kind of go

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.440
into that in a
little bit of detail

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.200
before you start looking at
practicalities and functions

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.040
and things like that.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.036
So they're different from
your functional requirements,

00:05:33.036 --> 00:05:34.910
because they're personal,
and they're made up

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.300
of memories of times you've
spent in gardens, where you

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.800
felt amazing or just, say, your
grandmother's garden, where you

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.140
have a memory, a personal
connection to the past

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.640
or to people.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.650
So there's a lot more to
it than just dreaming up

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.600
a nice little space.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.762
But one massive thing,
even if you have a balcony,

00:05:55.762 --> 00:05:58.220
even if you have a very small
patio, one thing I always say

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.949
is at this stage, dream big.

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:03.740
And I know you're not
going to have the Taj

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.730
Mahal on your balcony or
in a small patio space,

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.180
but you can take elements
of the biggest dream

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.670
that you can possibly have and
condense those elements down.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.900
And there is an exercise
in my book, which

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.660
is called a Dream
Gardens Diagram, which

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.100
is just based around identifying
what it is you love about that.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.940
So if you were looking
at that, and that

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.610
was the space that you
choose for the exercise,

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.112
then you can zoom
in on certain areas

00:06:31.112 --> 00:06:32.570
and say, well, I
love the symmetry.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.390
I love the detail of
the filigree work.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.390
I love the planting.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.235
I love the water, the
reflections, the calm,

00:06:39.235 --> 00:06:39.860
whatever it is.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.140
You can pull all those
together, and they

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.810
can become your concept.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.760
So at this stage,
there are no limits.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.712
And again, every time I
go into somebody's space,

00:06:50.712 --> 00:06:52.670
they start going, OK,
and now I need the patio,

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.110
and now I need that, and I need
a circulation route to here.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.315
And I always have to stop people
and go, no, just go back to--

00:06:59.315 --> 00:07:01.490
be completely mad for
a while before you

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.080
start getting practical.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.324
So there is no--

00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:06.740
there are no limits
at this stage,

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.857
just dreaming up
your perfect space.

00:07:11.857 --> 00:07:14.190
I never know why I include
this one, but for some reason

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.760
it always makes me zoom
out a bit in my own head.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.770
So I've left it in
just for the sake

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.580
of kind of underlining that
idea of zooming out and not

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:28.130
getting into the nitty gritty
of detail at this point.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.860
So the exercise that
I have in the book

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.440
is really based on just a
memory of a place, where

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.690
you were really, really happy.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.270
So thinking of a garden
that you visited,

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.570
or a memory that you have
of having been in a garden,

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.300
and it doesn't even need
to be perfectly designed.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.090
It can be completely wild
meadowscape or anything

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.180
like that.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.650
And basically, what
you're doing is

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:55.460
you're thinking about what made
that space feel so good to you.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:59.690
Why was it-- why did you have
a personal connection to it?

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:00.334
Was it the fun?

00:08:00.334 --> 00:08:01.250
Was it the symmetries?

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:01.760
The wildness?

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.260
The dramas?

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.070
So each space-- and
that's something

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.800
you guys can do later on, if you
want, or take the books home,

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.644
and it's all kind of
outlined in that, too.

00:08:09.644 --> 00:08:11.060
And it's a really
good-- it sounds

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.040
like a very simple
exercise, but it's

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.340
a really good way of
allowing yourself to not

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.940
design before you design.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.700
So just going, oh,
I love that space.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.350
I really enjoyed that space.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:25.400
So this is my one,
unless somebody else

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.800
wants to give me one.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.990
I love the Alhambra
in the south of Spain,

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:35.544
which is an amazing, absolutely
amazing garden and palace.

00:08:35.544 --> 00:08:36.710
And they're Moorish gardens.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.710
They're really symmetrical,
but yet the planting

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:40.220
is really wild and free.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.080
So I love that
combination of those kind

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.590
of perfect architecture
and then the wild planting.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.200
So for me, it was the
timeless feel of it--

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.909
the balance, the water, the
wild planting, the harmony.

00:08:50.909 --> 00:08:51.950
And this is the exercise.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:55.045
What you're doing is a
simple sketch spider diagram,

00:08:55.045 --> 00:08:57.170
and you're putting the
characteristics of the space

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.450
above and the moods below.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.160
So the moods of
this space actually

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.630
become your concept
of your garden design.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.380
So you need to think,
right, that's what I

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.570
want to bring to my own space.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.150
And even if it is a
balcony, there's balance.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.879
There's calm.

00:09:11.879 --> 00:09:12.920
You want to feel at ease.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.450
You want to feel happier.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.010
You want to feel freer.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.770
If, say, you went for a meadow
that you felt incredibly

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.050
happy in and a
memory that you have,

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.450
there's so many ways of
bringing elements of a meadow--

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:27.860
the movement of the grasses,
looking at the wide, open sky.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.110
Why not try and create
something that kind of emulates

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:34.940
that feeling, even if it is a
tiny balcony or a small patio?

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:39.830
So really, that's just about
taking those and bringing them

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:40.890
into your concept.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:44.360
So for me, it was the
Alhambra, creating

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:49.640
a calm space inspired
by a Moorish palace,

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.940
yet the planting is wild.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.940
So there's not too much
perfection going on,

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.900
which can become
boring, and you're never

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.900
going to actually be able to
achieve and maintain anyway.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.300
So that's your
new found concept.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.960
So that was my scenario
there-- a calm space inspired

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.559
by the Alhambra gardens in Spain
with wild, natural planting,

00:10:08.559 --> 00:10:10.100
plenty of water,
and a timeless feel.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.350
So really simple but
there's so many elements

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.130
then that you can choose,
pick out, and build

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.210
into your design.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.360
So that informs your materials,
your colors, your water

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.380
features.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.050
It's easy then, because
I think a lot of people

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:24.770
don't know where to start.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:28.120
So this is a great way of
kind of identifying a concept

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.130
and then going, right,
the paving I need to get

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.740
needs to match that feel, and
the water needs to match that,

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.380
and everything needs to follow
that feel and underline that.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.590
And then a concept of the
garden works naturally,

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:42.130
and it's not disjointed.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:45.920
So the next part is
Form Follows Function,

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.060
which Louis Sullivan said.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:55.740
And as you guys know, within the
internet, you go into a page,

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.930
it doesn't work, you're
gone immediately.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:01.140
So the same thing applies
to a badly designed garden.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.600
If it's badly designed,
if it doesn't work,

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.320
never mind the look or
the beauty or whatever.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.040
It can be beautiful, but if it
doesn't work, it's annoying,

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.730
and you just don't want
to be in the space.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:17.430
So basically, our gardens, from
a tangible perspective, are--

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.890
they're spaces for living,
and they need to work.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.720
It's really simple.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.280
And the first thing I get my
clients to do is do out a list,

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:26.780
and--

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.650
I'm sorry, the second
thing after dreaming.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.450
Get them to do a
list of how they

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:33.700
spend their day in the garden.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.420
So basically how they--

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.640
the most boring stuff--

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.997
I hang my washing out.

00:11:37.997 --> 00:11:38.830
The dog goes around.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:43.190
The kids go to the trampoline,
all of those kind of things.

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:45.820
But also to say, I
like to entertain.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.300
So it'd be nice to have a
pool to dangle our legs in,

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.060
et cetera.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.160
That's us at the Bloom garden
this year dangling our legs.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.201
So I had to include that.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.354
So that's just really
an idea of what

00:11:58.354 --> 00:12:00.520
your day looks like in the
garden and all the things

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.600
the garden needs to function
for you. [? Like, ?]

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:09.040
So the functions of the
garden, and then the list

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.480
of functional requirements.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.080
That's it.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.390
Basically, really
simple, really easy.

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.900
List out everything you
need in the actual garden,

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.026
and it doesn't need
to be super detailed.

00:12:19.026 --> 00:12:20.650
But you need this
because the next step

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:21.952
is putting it onto paper.

00:12:21.952 --> 00:12:23.410
And when you put
it onto paper, you

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.420
need to take off each and
every single one of those.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.336
And if one of them is
missing, then the garden

00:12:27.336 --> 00:12:28.485
is not going to work 100%.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:35.140
So that was a client of mine
in Strand Hill and Sligo.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.464
The job was kind of half done.

00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:37.630
The builder's still outside.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.400
The dog, which they
weren't supposed

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.650
to have a dog-- the whole
garden was based around them

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:43.240
not having kids or a dog.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.830
They now have a child and a dog.

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:47.770
And he destroyed
the garden, but this

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.050
was before we did the garden.

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:54.055
And you can see there's nothing
there, and it looks horrendous.

00:12:54.055 --> 00:12:55.180
The house is getting there.

00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:00.730
Everything is brilliant, but a
lot of spaces that you see you

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.860
have to assess really,
really well in order

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.690
to get the design right.

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:08.410
So you're looking at everything
from soil samples, aspect,

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:09.790
garden climate--

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.320
probably pretty boring at this
stage, but it's so important.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.707
So even if you have
a small balcony,

00:13:15.707 --> 00:13:17.290
you need to make
sure that you address

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:22.540
things like wind,
privacy, views to make

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.670
sure you don't make any
mistakes and then end up

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.890
with the neighbor
right there looking in

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:30.882
at you, even though you wanted
this enclosed private haven.

00:13:30.882 --> 00:13:33.340
So there are things you need
to list out at the very start.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:37.102
Obviously, for bigger sites,
it gets a lot more complicated,

00:13:37.102 --> 00:13:38.560
and you need to
put in more detail.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.750
Sometimes we get
surveyors in, because it's

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.880
too detailed to do with slopes
and all that kind of stuff.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:47.240
But for small spaces, it's
relatively easy to do.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.300
The main thing-- common sense.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.250
You're looking at views.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:52.070
Does it have light?

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:55.200
So you're looking at the
strengths of the space.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.770
And how can you enhance them?

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.550
That's really important.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.730
And then you're also
looking at the challenges.

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:05.410
So you can see the two there.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:09.280
We do a show called RT Super
Garden, and pretty much all

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:14.080
the gardens we go into look
like that-- absolute disasters.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.610
And after the show leaves,
then they're ta-da.

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:19.240
Yeah, right.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.030
Five weeks later,
blood, sweat, and tears.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:25.450
But yeah, that's actually
the joy of it anyway.

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:29.050
It's television, transformation,
and we all love that.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:31.130
But as I say, nothing
is unsolvable.

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:34.390
And the main thing is having
that vision and the dream

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:35.350
for what is to come.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.480
And I think some
people find that easier

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.910
than others to imagine.

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:43.600
Like my mom cannot imagine
what a garden will look like.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:49.255
She's like, how can you even
visualize how it will be?

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:51.140
Yeah, probably
because I studied it.

00:14:53.996 --> 00:14:55.870
So yeah, it's all about
building on strengths

00:14:55.870 --> 00:15:00.810
and overcoming challenges in
gardens and garden design.

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:03.490
Site measurements-- I touched
on that briefly just there.

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:04.990
It can be incredibly
complicated,

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:08.230
and it can be very, very simple
to just doing a scaled sketch,

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.420
putting in your sizes,
your heights, and where

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:14.985
the entrance, exit,
where the pathways are.

00:15:14.985 --> 00:15:17.110
And then the first thing
is getting the site right.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:19.990
It's doing a very
simple scale sketch

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.115
and exploring what's
happening on the site.

00:15:22.115 --> 00:15:23.740
So I'm not going to
go into big detail,

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.600
because that is actually boring.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.060
But it's good to know,
and it's detailed

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.340
in the book as well
just to know that that's

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.900
how you have to
start if you want

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:35.200
to take on a plot of
any considerable size.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:41.740
Which actually that's kind of
a realistic, large city garden

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:43.750
that you could kind of
measure out yourself

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:46.960
as opposed to getting
somebody in to do it for you.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.420
So after that comes the
functional layout plan,

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.060
which is basically taking
the functions-- so what

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.840
the garden has to do for you
and plunking them on the plan.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.770
And they're bubbles.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:57.820
They're not designed.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:58.736
They're not beautiful.

00:15:58.736 --> 00:15:59.890
They're not details.

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:03.520
They're basically sketched
bubbles telling you

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.140
exactly what happens on site.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.200
So where you need privacy,
where you want a patio,

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.560
where you want screening,
where you need a wind screen.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.042
So all the things that you
looked at that were challenges

00:16:15.042 --> 00:16:16.750
need to be addressed
on this in a bubble.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:19.000
So it doesn't need to represent
the shape or anything.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.160
So it's actually
really easy to do.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.860
But it's so
informative to when you

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:25.510
start going to sketch
detail, and you

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:30.040
start putting in details in it.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.980
So that brings me to
the bigger picture--

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:36.040
great design, quite far
away from the bubbles.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.890
This is one of my
favorite pictures.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:41.050
It's Tom Stuart-Smith,
who's a UK-based designer.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:43.600
And it's just such
a beautiful picture,

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.540
because it shows how a garden
can blend into the landscape

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:48.790
beyond without-- it
just feels like it's

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:51.670
a part of the landscape.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:53.870
And I'll go back to
that in a minute.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:59.890
So what makes good design,
and are we born designers?

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:01.570
It's an interesting
question, because I

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:03.970
don't think we're
necessarily born designers.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:06.280
Some people are better
at it than others,

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.740
but it's definitely
something you can learn.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.500
And what does help-- and
I'm sure a lot of you guys

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.700
are design-based or
from design backgrounds.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:19.240
So you'd be aware of a lot of
these principles, and the fact

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.730
that they do kind of
influence everything from car

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:25.240
design to pen
design to everything

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.859
has those principles.

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:30.480
And again, it goes back to
what works and functions.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.660
It goes back to the
principles of these four

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.210
and then another one
I'll talk about after.

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:37.890
The first one we'll
look at briefly

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.080
is the unity and
harmony, and we'll

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.510
talk about it just
in the garden setting

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.219
and how it works with the house,
the garden, and the setting.

00:17:45.219 --> 00:17:47.010
And that's the picture
I showed you before.

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:50.010
This is the same one in
winter at the bottom.

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.230
Again, Tom Stuart-Smith
in the top one, too,

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:56.787
and it just shows how
the house, first of all,

00:17:56.787 --> 00:17:57.870
is linked with the garden.

00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.460
You can see the
colors, the textures,

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.370
pick up on the red brick,
the grasses, and the water,

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:03.270
and the sizes.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:05.340
So you've got a connection
between the house

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.590
and the garden,
the design space.

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:11.310
And then beyond that you have a
connection of the design garden

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:12.540
with the landscape beyond.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.000
So in the landscape
beyond, for example, you've

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.180
got darker spots of big trees.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:22.100
And Tom's brought that into
the foreground of the garden

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.110
by having darker shapes, the
topiary shapes in the front,

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:27.800
and then the lighter
ponds, which kind of echo

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.280
what's going on behind.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.275
So that creates
unity and harmony,

00:18:31.275 --> 00:18:33.150
because you're blending
all of that together.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.610
Simplicity-- I mean
the Persian gardens are

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:41.310
a huge influence
for me and I think

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.590
are a great example
of simplicity.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.420
Less is more, and
I think that really

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.660
applies to online as well.

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.980
There's so much being
chucked at you all the time

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:56.340
that it's really nice to have a
calm, simple design sometimes.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.860
There's nothing I like more
than looking at a website that's

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.480
just like, ah, calm.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.920
Not too many ads, not too many
things being thrown at you.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.980
But of course, there has
to be a balance, which

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.020
brings me to now.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.750
It should bring me to
balance, really, shouldn't it?

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:15.480
Scale and proportion.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.006
So really the same
thing as the links

00:19:18.006 --> 00:19:19.380
between the house
and the setting

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.434
and the views beyond the garden.

00:19:21.434 --> 00:19:23.100
It's the relationship
between the house.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.560
So you don't want the house
to be absolutely gigantic

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.110
and the person to
feel really small.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:29.160
Same thing with
planting-- so trees

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.000
can't be tiny and the house
really big or vice versa.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.250
So there's got to be a
relationship between everything

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.800
that's happening in the
space, the landscape beyond.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.610
And then also, obviously, the
house and the person because we

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:47.255
can't forget that it's you
that's experiencing that space.

00:19:47.255 --> 00:19:48.630
And the best way
of doing that is

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:53.160
to start sketching or thinking
in 3-D as opposed to 2-D

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.420
flat way.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.720
There's Alice.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.670
And there's balance.

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:03.120
So balance is really all about
everything coming together

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:06.530
in a pleasing composition,
and there's so much--

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:10.440
that work that comes into that
from all the other things we

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.670
looked at-- scale
and proportion.

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:15.150
It's actually really
easy to get balance

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.070
right when you have
a symmetrical garden,

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:19.080
so the likes of the Alhambra.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.910
If you take that as
inspiration, it's

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:22.660
quite easy to get it
right, because you've

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.270
got that inherent symmetry.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:28.377
Whilst if you kind of push it to
being asymmetrical, the design,

00:20:28.377 --> 00:20:30.960
it does get a little bit harder,
because you need to make sure

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.474
you get the balance of the
forms, the shapes, the sizes,

00:20:33.474 --> 00:20:34.390
and all of that right.

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:37.470
So it does get a
little bit trickier.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:41.370
You'll also have mystery,
excitement, light and darkness,

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:44.670
balance and color,
and structures also

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:47.685
need to be balanced.

00:20:47.685 --> 00:20:49.060
So there are great
ways, I think,

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.160
to start looking at design.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.240
I don't know what percentage
of you guys are design-based

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.780
or have a background in design.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.770
So I should have probably
asked that at the start.

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:03.850
I'm sure you're aware of some
of these or most of these,

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:06.430
but they're a great thing to
even-- even if you do know,

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:07.720
and you're aware of them--

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:11.840
to make sure you remind yourself
of on a kind of regular basis.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:15.610
The other thing that I always
find fascinating to look at

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:16.640
is the golden ratio.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.270
And again, you're
probably all aware of it,

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:22.030
but I find it quite
interesting in garden design,

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:26.140
because you're looking at
nature to inform nature.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:32.495
So from ferns and the way
they grow to succulents.

00:21:32.495 --> 00:21:34.120
There was actually
a garden at Chelsea,

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.080
which was based all around
the mathematics of geometry,

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.380
which had the succulent
on the right there.

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.670
It had a lot of those
kind of shapes and forms,

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.860
and the mathematics
behind it are just--

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.930
I don't do math.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:49.849
To me, it's absolutely
baffling, but it's incredible.

00:21:49.849 --> 00:21:52.265
It's really inspiring to look
at and to apply to projects.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.240
And the fact that
it's also found

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.840
in our bodies, and the
fact that it repeats,

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.320
and it's just incredible.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.820
I find it really,
really interesting

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.236
that when you
clench your fist, it

00:22:05.236 --> 00:22:08.790
forms into a perfect
golden ratio curl.

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:09.900
But that can inform--

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:15.100
that does and can inform
a huge amount of design.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.530
And I very cheekily stuck
it on top of Google.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:20.980
So I don't know if that actually
does, but it kind of works.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.710
But it works in garden
design, the Apple logo.

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:25.570
So that's-- car design
and everything--

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:27.290
it kind of influences
everything.

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:29.230
And the reason
for that is really

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:33.370
because we're using what is
inherently found in nature,

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:34.630
and that's informing design.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:36.490
So it's an interesting cycle.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:42.749
So the next thing is choosing
shapes for the garden.

00:22:42.749 --> 00:22:45.040
So we've gone and looked at
the functions of the garden

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.760
and putting that in in
bubbles and how it works

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.010
and how we make sure
everything is included that you

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:52.960
want and need in the garden.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:57.700
And the next bit is how to
actually put that into a plan

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:59.190
that you can work from.

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:03.537
And personally, I go
through the same thing,

00:23:03.537 --> 00:23:05.870
and I recognized this a couple
of years ago when I went,

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:07.036
OK, that's what's happening.

00:23:07.036 --> 00:23:10.630
I go through the
same kind of problem

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:12.010
every time I have a design job.

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:14.650
I start off going, this
is going to be amazing.

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:16.330
It's going to be
such a good project.

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:17.990
And then I start sketching,
and I start doing stuff.

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:19.870
And I'm like, oh, my god,
it's going to be a disaster.

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:21.036
It's going to be horrendous.

00:23:21.036 --> 00:23:22.390
The client is going to hate us.

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:23.980
And then I start
doing more on it

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.130
and force myself through that,
and I come out the other end

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:27.350
and go, OK, it's
going to be fine.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:28.030
It'll be great.

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:29.275
It'll be good.

00:23:29.275 --> 00:23:31.400
So I think a huge amount
of people go through that.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.340
I think designers
in general always

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:35.685
go through that kind
of stage of self-doubt.

00:23:35.685 --> 00:23:38.590
And the hardest part is
actually this, which, for me,

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.870
personally, is
putting the shapes

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:44.560
and making decisions as opposed
to just messing and playing.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:48.820
So I was happy when I
learned that it is actually

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.110
very easy to do.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:52.750
That basically you take
the functional layout plan

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:57.460
with the bubbles, and you sketch
over that with either a layout

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.440
paper or a tracing paper.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.140
And you just explore
the shapes based on what

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.520
you have from those bubbles.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.920
Because you know you want
the patio at the back door,

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.410
because that's where you want
to go from the kitchen, where

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:09.470
the door is.

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:10.720
So you know you want it there.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.136
You just need to
decide on shapes.

00:24:12.136 --> 00:24:14.330
You need to decide how
they link to each other.

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:17.225
So you've already made a lot of
decisions without knowing it.

00:24:17.225 --> 00:24:19.100
You've placed the patio
where it wants to go.

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.840
You've put the
trampoline where you can

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.760
see the kids from the kitchen.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.800
You've done all of
that background work

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.270
without realizing.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:31.570
So you just explore, and
you start looking at shapes

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:34.780
and what works.

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:35.830
I can see the square.

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:40.270
It's free-form,
circles, combination.

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.700
You can have completely
free-form shapes.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:46.240
It's really what appeals to
you and mostly, actually,

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.280
what your concept wants.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:52.990
So if you have a very
loose meadow-style garden,

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:55.180
and you want it to
feel really wild,

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.200
then unless you're
doing it on purpose,

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:01.004
you're not going to produce
large concrete slabs, which

00:25:01.004 --> 00:25:02.170
I actually love the idea of.

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:05.260
But then you'd be breaking
those rules for a reason

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.630
if that's what you wanted to do.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:09.610
So it depends on
what the concept

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:12.447
is to make it work for you.

00:25:12.447 --> 00:25:14.530
And then after that, if
you've chosen your shapes,

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.642
you've decided where everything
goes, comes the really, really

00:25:17.642 --> 00:25:19.600
exciting part, because
you've got your concept.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.127
You know how it's
supposed to feel,

00:25:22.127 --> 00:25:23.710
and you get to play
around, basically,

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:28.120
with materials,
colors, planting,

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.260
and it just all
follows your concept.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.509
So in my case, if
it's the Alhambra--

00:25:32.509 --> 00:25:34.300
god, I'd love an Alhambra
garden, actually,

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.950
now that I think about it.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:39.890
Don't Google my garden,
whatever you do.

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:41.880
I don't know if technology
is that advanced yet

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.191
to zoom in right down.

00:25:43.191 --> 00:25:43.690
Is it?

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:48.840
It's in a mess.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:52.090
But basically, it all
comes down to your concept

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:56.770
and how to bring that concept to
life through materials, colors,

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:58.060
and planting.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:59.630
Is it really?

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:03.272
Like, can you actually
see different plants?

00:26:03.272 --> 00:26:05.430
AUDIENCE: Let me
have your address.

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:08.790
LEONIE CORNELIUS:
No, no, no, it's OK.

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:09.570
Not much to see.

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:10.920
I've had a very busy year.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.600
That's crazy.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.790
I digress.

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:17.460
So the concept--
again, that goes back

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.590
to the idea of kind
of fleshing out

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:22.410
the whole design
to suit your feel

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:26.050
and to suit what your dream is.

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:33.090
So if it was a seaside garden,
what do you bring into it?

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:34.320
Do you bring in pebbles?

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.990
And then also think-- and I
go into this in the book--

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:39.900
don't be afraid to go for all
the materials that are expected

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.730
and then take some out
and break the rules.

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:43.590
And if it was a
seaside garden, it's

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:45.990
pebbles and ropes and all that.

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:48.660
Get rid of the ropes and
replace it with rusted metal,

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:52.110
or get rid of the
expected pebble

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.910
and replace it with concrete.

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:55.840
Or do something that
makes it new and fresh

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:59.234
and not the expected.

00:26:59.234 --> 00:27:00.900
I don't think I say
it there, but that's

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:01.775
outlined in the book.

00:27:01.775 --> 00:27:03.240
And it's actually
a big part of, I

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.540
think, what makes really good
garden design is breaking

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.370
the rules once you
know them, once you

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:11.350
know what you want to achieve.

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:13.080
So being selective--
if you're going

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.290
to go for colors and
materials, choose

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:19.260
two colors, two strong colors
and two strong materials.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:23.885
Don't go mad, because you
want the concept to be really,

00:27:23.885 --> 00:27:25.260
really strong,
and you can always

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.460
add little bits here and there.

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:27.876
You can always
create little rooms

00:27:27.876 --> 00:27:30.180
that have separate feels,
but you can see it in this--

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:33.450
the strength of that
rusted corten steel,

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:35.580
and then picking up on
that tiny little planting

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:41.310
bits in that same color
just balances so well.

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:44.310
This one, again, you can see
the designer, Luciano Giubbilei,

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:48.370
has chosen loads a kind
of neutral, muted tones.

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:52.860
They're different colors but
loads of different materials.

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.590
But they all work, because
they're all neutrals.

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:59.280
So again, the palette is
really simple, really clean.

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:03.750
Same designer-- again,
he loves neutrals.

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:07.407
But it really allows structure
and form to jump out at you.

00:28:07.407 --> 00:28:09.240
While as if there was
too many colors there,

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.698
you wouldn't see
those ball shapes.

00:28:10.698 --> 00:28:15.024
You wouldn't see the
multi-stem trees.

00:28:15.024 --> 00:28:16.440
And then this one,
Luis Barragan--

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.580
he's a Mexican architect--

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.500
so he chose loads of different
colors for the space,

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.460
but he used one material.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.670
So the colors are--
there's plenty of color--

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:28.980
the color of the
sky and the water

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.680
and loads of colors
but the same material

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.330
pretty much throughout.

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:35.970
And then the last
slide is really

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:39.420
to show that vegetable growing
can actually be pretty, too.

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:43.510
It doesn't have to be
a kind of ugly plot.

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:45.810
You can actually
use cool materials

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:48.600
like the wicker and the
timber and the terracotta

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:53.130
and make it really
colorful and pretty.

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:56.430
So the last bit I'll go into
is the planting perfection,

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:58.170
choosing planting.

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:00.810
So again, the planting
that you choose

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:03.250
needs to follow your concept.

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:10.680
So if your concept is you
want a jungle haven in Ranola,

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.020
you need to make sure all the
plants you choose not only

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.280
work for Ireland,
work for the space,

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.700
but that they also
work for the concept.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:22.710
And so you study what works,
how the jungle looks--

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:26.540
big leaves, the
foliage, the bamboo,

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.500
and how to make that work.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:29.640
And it's totally workable.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.707
I just wrote an article
about that, actually,

00:29:31.707 --> 00:29:33.540
and it can work really,
really well and look

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:36.624
really lush and jungle-like.

00:29:36.624 --> 00:29:38.040
And again, for the
planting, we're

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.440
also considering the
principles of design,

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.000
which are really important.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.200
So one more thing is
right plant, right place.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.260
And it's really about a
huge amount of interest

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:53.310
these days has been put
into creating sustainable

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:56.820
gardens that grow themselves as
opposed to having to maintain

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.820
all the time, and
it's really opened up

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:04.470
a lot of new kind of
avenues for young designers,

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:08.490
like Chelsea and Bloom and all
those places, where you're not

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:12.419
stuck in kind of old traditions,
which don't work, really,

00:30:12.419 --> 00:30:13.960
unless you have huge
amounts of time.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.584
So that's what we're
talking about here

00:30:15.584 --> 00:30:19.770
is the idea of having organic
ecosystems that just grow,

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:22.620
and that you can let die down in
winter, and they come back up.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:26.960
And there's that cycle,
that natural cycle, and yet

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.610
feel like they've
been there forever.

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:31.280
That bottom one is
a Chelsea garden.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.990
You know, you'd never think--

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:35.682
it looks like it's in the
middle of the Provence.

00:30:35.682 --> 00:30:37.640
And so there's a few
different planting styles,

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.140
and I'll just go through them
really quickly, because they're

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:40.754
all in the book.

00:30:40.754 --> 00:30:42.420
And there's so many
of them in the book,

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:45.720
and I've pulled out like
four or five of them.

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.480
And basically, the
cottage-style planting,

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:50.835
which is that real old English,
formal style, and looks

00:30:50.835 --> 00:30:52.460
like it's kind of
been scattered there.

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:54.412
But it's actually
pretty high maintenance,

00:30:54.412 --> 00:30:56.120
because you've got
kind of the box balls,

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:59.150
and all the
perennials dying down,

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:01.070
and the bulbs that
have to be taken up,

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:04.100
and all that kind of stuff.

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.860
Modernist-style planting,
which is very clean, very

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:08.510
modern-- a lot of
that gets combined

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:11.600
with kind of naturalistic,
kind of wild meadow planting,

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.710
which works really well.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:14.450
You can see the top one
there is a Chelsea garden,

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:15.700
and they've kind of done that.

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:19.900
That's the
naturalistic planting,

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:22.210
which really echoes what's
happening in nature.

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:24.130
And the idea of
naturalistic planting

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:28.450
is that it does just scatter and
grow and evolve into something

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:30.670
fresh and new, and
that has really

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:34.720
been a focus on planting styles
in the past 10 years or so.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:40.090
That it's gone away from that
uber planned and maintained

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:43.720
idea to a more kind of letting
nature do what it wants to do

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:44.950
and embracing that.

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:50.380
So that brings me back to
the core of what we do.

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:53.140
And just if there's
anything that I'd

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:56.380
love you guys to go away
with today after the talk

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:59.860
is that connection between,
first of all, everything

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:03.010
that we do as
people, whether it's

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:05.530
garden design or
an online platform

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:11.129
or any other creative or
design-based endeavor,

00:32:11.129 --> 00:32:12.670
that there is always
that connection.

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:15.250
And the connection is the
person and the experience.

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:21.510
And much like garden design,
everything is personal,

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:25.440
and to keep that
connection in mind.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.255
Thank you.

00:32:26.255 --> 00:32:31.105
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:34.580
I was dreading that.

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:35.890
I'm good now.

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:37.390
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
That was great.

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:37.710
That was really--

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:38.140
LEONIE CORNELIUS: Thank you.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:39.850
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: I'll let
you go here into the middle.

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:41.308
That was great,
really entertaining

00:32:41.308 --> 00:32:42.380
and really informative.

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.880
So we're going to open up to
audience questions in a minute.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.730
I'm just going to ask,
maybe, the first question.

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:50.930
So the reality for some people--

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:55.580
me-- is that I love the idea
of having a beautiful garden,

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:58.700
or like we talked
about, my little patio.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:02.731
But I do struggle to keep
the odd potted plant alive.

00:33:02.731 --> 00:33:03.606
LEONIE CORNELIUS: OK.

00:33:03.606 --> 00:33:05.439
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
Is this book beyond me?

00:33:05.439 --> 00:33:07.440
Is it a baby step, the pre-book?

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.690
LEONIE CORNELIUS: Oh, god, no.

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:09.860
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
What will I do?

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:10.430
LEONIE CORNELIUS:
Well, that goes back

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:13.490
to the right plant, right place,
finding out what plants really

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:14.090
need, I guess.

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:18.320
So identifying what the
plant that you choose--

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.120
what the needs are,
what the soil needs

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.280
are, what the
moisture levels are,

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.780
making sure there's
enough drainage,

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.820
making sure that
it doesn't dry out.

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:30.930
So if you do have, say, a
pot, you can control that.

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:31.650
So that's easy.

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:33.110
You just need to
inform yourself.

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:37.394
So use Google and find out
exactly what the plant needs.

00:33:37.394 --> 00:33:38.810
I actually use it
on a daily basis

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:43.220
for all sorts of stuff from
cooking to god knows what.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:46.160
But yeah, to inform yourself
of what that plant needs.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.770
Or to go, right, I
don't have huge amounts

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:50.870
of rainfall in that
particular area in the garden

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:51.890
where I have the pots.

00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:55.265
And to go, right, I'm going to
use drought-friendly plants,

00:33:55.265 --> 00:33:57.140
and then find out what
you could plant there.

00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:01.130
And then create a scheme
around that-- so a dry desert

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:03.590
feel space with grasses
or something like that.

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.090
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
So it goes back

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:07.587
to what you said a while ago
about just the knowledge.

00:34:07.587 --> 00:34:08.795
LEONIE CORNELIUS: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:08.795 --> 00:34:10.965
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
And for me, baby steps.

00:34:10.965 --> 00:34:12.971
Tiny little baby steps.

00:34:12.971 --> 00:34:14.429
I'm going to ask
one more question,

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:15.949
and then I'll go
to the audience.

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:18.949
If a community-- and I just
say a group of people who live

00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:20.360
in a housing estate--

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:27.500
decided to create a small
community garden or allotment,

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.170
would you have any
advice on what they could

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:33.500
do to make that a success?

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:35.790
LEONIE CORNELIUS: Oh, planning.

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:36.290
Planning.

00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:37.969
Definitely a huge thing.

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:40.370
Make sure that you know
exactly what you're doing

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:42.270
and look at who's
going to be using it.

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:43.909
So going back to the
user, is it going

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:46.699
to be the younger
people in the community?

00:34:46.699 --> 00:34:48.689
Will they be involved?

00:34:48.689 --> 00:34:49.980
Is it going to be older people?

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:51.830
So you might raise beds.

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:55.130
So finding out the user is
probably the main thing,

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:59.750
identifying who will be using
it, and then making it fun,

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:01.620
making sure that the
kids get involved,

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.500
and everybody wants to be there.

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:07.100
So maybe have some sort of
a social space or something

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:09.890
in it, like a small gazebo
or a little polytunnel,

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:11.480
where everyone can hang out.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:13.021
Because then you'll
want to be there,

00:35:13.021 --> 00:35:14.654
and you'll want to put work in.

00:35:14.654 --> 00:35:16.070
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
That's great.

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:18.300
Have we got any questions
from the audience?

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:21.350
Oh, we've got one here.

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:23.840
AUDIENCE: Yeah, my
first question to ask--

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.950
you probably get asked
this one all the time.

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:27.195
Is that on?

00:35:27.195 --> 00:35:28.820
LEONIE CORNELIUS: I
can hear you, yeah.

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:29.990
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:32.150
What's your take
on synthetic grass?

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:34.820
Because it's sort of when you're
doing a lot of other stuff,

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:38.672
it seems like an easy option,
but is it the right option?

00:35:38.672 --> 00:35:40.880
LEONIE CORNELIUS: It's funny,
because a lot of garden

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.860
designers, we had a big
discussion about this

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:44.060
during Super Garden.

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:46.640
And 90% of the people that we
were talking to at the time

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:47.880
were like, oh, it's horrible.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:48.470
It's horrible.

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:50.630
But there's an
absolute place for it.

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:53.480
Like Today FM have it
on their roof garden,

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.980
and they were ashamed of it.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.438
And I was like, no, but why
would you put real grass there?

00:35:57.438 --> 00:35:58.820
It would be head-wrecking.

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:01.190
So I think it depends
on your needs,

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:03.110
on your needs, on
what you need it for.

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:07.460
And if you think it'll make
your life easier and better,

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:09.536
and you can work it into
the design in such a way

00:36:09.536 --> 00:36:11.035
that it looks good,
then absolutely.

00:36:11.035 --> 00:36:12.230
Why not?

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:15.380
I couldn't be a snob about it.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:19.022
I think a lot of people do, and
they almost do it to pretend.

00:36:19.022 --> 00:36:21.302
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: Great.

00:36:21.302 --> 00:36:23.890
Got one in the second row here.

00:36:28.967 --> 00:36:31.050
We just have to check if
the microphone is working

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:32.604
before we get it to you.

00:36:32.604 --> 00:36:33.520
AUDIENCE: I can shout.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.800
That's fine.

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.000
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
We just want

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.958
to make sure that we hear
you on the recording.

00:36:36.958 --> 00:36:38.440
That's all.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.294
Thank you.

00:36:40.294 --> 00:36:41.710
LEONIE CORNELIUS:
Totally natural.

00:36:43.267 --> 00:36:44.850
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
Oh, it's working.

00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:45.512
That's great.

00:36:45.512 --> 00:36:47.220
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for the talk.

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.690
It looks absolutely
amazing and makes

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:52.129
me wish to just drop my job
and start gardening all week.

00:36:52.129 --> 00:36:53.920
LEONIE CORNELIUS: You
can come work for me.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.060
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:56.830
Hire me.

00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:57.530
What can we do?

00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:59.080
Like most of us,
we can't probably

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:03.430
afford at this stage to garden
in Dublin, let alone anything

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:05.290
in Dublin.

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:07.870
What can we do to create a
nice space on our balconies,

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:10.220
or if we don't even have
a balcony, maybe inside,

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:13.900
like a small oasis
to relax and enjoy

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.652
what we saw on the slides?

00:37:15.652 --> 00:37:17.110
LEONIE CORNELIUS:
Well, first thing

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:18.760
is I'm concerned with
that quite a lot,

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.700
because I hate
the idea of design

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:25.540
being exclusive and the
idea that only those that

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:28.447
have like 100,000 euro to spend
on the design could afford it.

00:37:28.447 --> 00:37:30.030
And the first garden
I did-- actually,

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:32.210
I don't think there's any
pictures of it in this--

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:35.650
a bloom was made with
old scaffolding planks.

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:39.910
And so if you want to
create something really

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:42.760
special without putting huge
amounts of money into it,

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:46.180
you have to kind of rethink
the materials you're using.

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:47.920
You have to rethink
the amount of time

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:48.920
you want to put into it.

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.230
So those scaffolding planks--

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:52.880
they looked absolutely stunning
when we were done with them.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.760
But we sanded and
sanded and sanded

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:57.640
and sanded to get them
to look really well,

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:00.130
and then stained them
again and again and again.

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:02.230
So reimagining old
materials is great,

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:03.730
but then everybody's
kind of started

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:04.960
catching on to that, too.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.480
So scaffolding planks
are hard to get.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.645
What do you call them?

00:38:08.645 --> 00:38:09.145
Pallets.

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:13.890
But be creative.

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:16.780
Get hands-on yourself,
and it doesn't need

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:18.910
to cost a huge amount of money.

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:21.160
It's hard to be specific,
because I don't know exactly

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.420
what you're talking about.

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:25.870
But say, instead of--
if you wanted something

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:29.440
on a windowsill inside,
instead of just getting

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.840
a plastic window box,
create something,

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.940
even if it's made
with driftwood or made

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:39.610
with timber that you stain up
to suit the color scheme inside.

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:43.240
Or go to Pinterest and
research certain things.

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.150
And there's so
many ideas you can

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:49.360
kind of bring in to the home by
just getting creative yourself.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.552
I know that's a
really bad answer.

00:38:51.552 --> 00:38:53.260
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
So it's about making

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:53.910
it a for-real project.

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:55.420
LEONIE CORNELIUS:
Creativity, yes.

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:56.020
Yes.

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:57.770
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
Not just a quick fix,

00:38:57.770 --> 00:38:59.730
which is what I kind of tend
to do when buying a new plant.

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:00.460
LEONIE CORNELIUS:
But in that way

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.620
you can work design
principles into it,

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:04.660
and then you'll create
something beautiful, as

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:06.679
opposed to just
placing something

00:39:06.679 --> 00:39:09.220
that somebody else mightn't have
put a huge amount of thought

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:09.720
into.

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:13.630
So it's the thought process, and
then making it personal to you.

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:17.200
Because if you make it yourself
or have it made, even if it is,

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:20.590
like, say, a gate,
a rusted steel gate,

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:23.050
it might be old materials,
but you thought it up.

00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:25.671
So you know it's going
to be perfect for you.

00:39:25.671 --> 00:39:27.004
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: OK, lovely.

00:39:27.004 --> 00:39:29.279
Anymore audience questions?

00:39:29.279 --> 00:39:29.779
OK.

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:36.070
AUDIENCE: So I'm moving
into a new house.

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:39.580
We just bought a new
house just down the road.

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:42.160
And we've got a roughly
basic square garden,

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.480
nothing spectacular.

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.780
Right now, it's rubble.

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:47.530
Myself and my wife
were talking about what

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:48.714
we do from the start.

00:39:48.714 --> 00:39:51.130
So, for example, obviously,
we'd be busy inside the house.

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:53.380
But do you have
any advice in terms

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:56.470
of if we wanted to put down,
let's say, trees first,

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:58.420
we start from big and
work our way down?

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.610
Or do we start with
little potted plants

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:01.662
and work our way up?

00:40:01.662 --> 00:40:03.370
Have you kind of come
across that before?

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:03.970
Where would you start?

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:05.170
LEONIE CORNELIUS: Oh, loads.

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:08.020
And the main thing, I think,
is before you start planting,

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:11.009
before you start doing
anything is dreaming that,

00:40:11.009 --> 00:40:13.300
that kind of figuring out
what you want from the garden

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:16.150
before you start placing
things, and even before you

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:19.820
start going into the privacy
and all of those kind of things.

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:22.330
So making sure that your
dream for the house, which

00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:24.100
you probably already
have, and you

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:26.830
have materials and
features in there

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:29.130
that you want to pick up on
and the style of the house.

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:30.550
Try and bleed that out.

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:32.902
So pick up on colors,
materials on the floor.

00:40:32.902 --> 00:40:35.110
Like if you have, say,
concrete floors, bleed it out.

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:38.380
Or if there's tiles or
timber, try and continue that,

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:40.990
because then it will become an
extension of your living space.

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:44.800
But making sure you identify
what kind of feel you want,

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:48.070
what kind of style
you want, and then

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:50.410
bleeding that in
through the whole space

00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:51.430
and connecting them.

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:54.160
And then you can always
start by planting a few trees

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.840
if you wanted to now.

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.800
And then work with
the rest around that.

00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.869
But just make sure
that you don't end up

00:40:59.869 --> 00:41:01.910
putting them somewhere
where you don't want them.

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:03.700
So making sure you
follow the process

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:07.540
in your head a little bit
of, where do I need privacy?

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:10.690
Where do I need windscreen?

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:13.570
So do analyze the site
a bit before you look

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:15.260
at trees or that sort of thing.

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:16.760
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
OK, we probably

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.660
have time for one more question.

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:21.990
Any final audience questions?

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.730
No?

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:24.259
Oh, yeah.

00:41:24.259 --> 00:41:25.050
Two more, actually.

00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:25.430
We'll fit them.

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:26.388
We'll fit them both in.

00:41:28.925 --> 00:41:31.830
AUDIENCE: It's a very
practical question.

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:34.250
I was wondering, like,
is there any place

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:35.870
that you would
recommend us to go

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:38.630
to if we want to design, for
example, our little balcony

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:42.950
or so, like a garden center we
can go to that you could really

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:43.640
recommend?

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:48.020
Because I looked for plants,
and I finally went to Ikea.

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.090
And they were all sold out.

00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:51.860
So that wasn't really a success.

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:53.600
So maybe there is a
better place to go

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:55.280
to that's also affordable.

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.529
LEONIE CORNELIUS: You're
talking about outdoor plants?

00:41:57.529 --> 00:41:59.480
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
outdoor, just as indoor.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.022
I don't know.

00:42:00.022 --> 00:42:01.854
LEONIE CORNELIUS: Yeah,
I mean there's loads

00:42:01.854 --> 00:42:03.430
of places in or around Dublin.

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:05.490
There's a place
called Garden World.

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:07.448
I don't know if you've
come across Garden World

00:42:07.448 --> 00:42:08.520
and Kilquade.

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:09.410
In Kilcoole?

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:11.240
Kilquade.

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:11.870
Can't remember.

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:15.350
I think it's-- yeah, in Wicklow.

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:16.220
They're fantastic.

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:19.910
They have incredible plants,
good quality plants, too.

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:22.730
I generally deal more
with the wholesale end

00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:26.495
of things, so larger plants,
but they're fantastic.

00:42:26.495 --> 00:42:29.120
And they have a huge selection,
and they're very knowledgeable.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.420
So they'll actually help talk
you through whatever you need.

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:35.460
Materials-wise I
love Salvage Yards.

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:38.120
So if you have ideas for a
balcony or something like that,

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:41.120
go to old architectural
salvage and just choose

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.689
that interesting,
cool, even one thing,

00:42:43.689 --> 00:42:45.230
and then build around
it if you don't

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:48.104
have a specific idea in mind.

00:42:48.104 --> 00:42:50.187
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: If
you can just pass the mic.

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:57.260
AUDIENCE: A place more
in the city center-ish

00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:59.760
would be Plant Life
on Cork Street.

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.560
LEONIE CORNELIUS: Oh, yeah.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:03.580
AUDIENCE: Closer by you
if you don't have a car.

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:04.720
LEONIE CORNELIUS: Yeah.

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.930
AUDIENCE: My question
kind of comes back

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:07.230
to what we discussed earlier.

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:10.180
It's like around
style, about style.

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:13.190
Is there like an Irish
style that you've

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:16.040
seen over the years, or
how has that developed?

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:19.160
Or is there something that
makes Irish gardens stand out

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.532
from other, let's
say, European gardens?

00:43:22.532 --> 00:43:23.990
LEONIE CORNELIUS:
It's interesting,

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:26.810
because for a long
time, Irish design

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:29.990
would have been influenced
hugely by the likes of Chelsea,

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:35.990
the RHS shows, Tatton Park, and
all of the big shows, garden

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:39.260
shows, show garden
shows in the UK.

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:43.750
I think since Bloom was
launched, which is what?

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:45.230
11 years ago now.

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:48.330
I think that kind of gave
Irish designers a platform

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:50.690
here to showcase.

00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:53.120
So I think there's been
a huge shift in that.

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:58.130
And I think an Irish planting
style and feel has developed,

00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:02.270
which is a little bit more
relaxed and natural than, say,

00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:03.470
its English counterpart.

00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:07.550
Having said that, trends
kind of cross over and back,

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:11.070
and you've got trends coming
from the south of France,

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:14.780
and there's like an overall
trend of naturalistic planting

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:17.600
and sustainability,
and allowing gardens

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.390
to just be the way
they want to be,

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:23.120
which, actually, last year,
came back a little bit

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.490
to be more structured, again.

00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:27.630
So there are trends that
go across all of them.

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:29.240
But I do think
Irish designers have

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.810
developed their own styles.

00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:34.280
And I think this year at Bloom,
it was interesting to see.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.020
There was a lot of
interest at Chelsea,

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:38.840
and the Chelsea designers were
tweeting a lot about designers

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.460
here and about what
gardens they liked

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:43.610
and stuff, which was
amazing to have that coming

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:45.134
back to Ireland.

00:44:45.134 --> 00:44:46.550
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
That's great.

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.960
Thank you.

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.120
Thank you, Leonie,
for your time.

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:48.450
LEONIE CORNELIUS: Thank you.

00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:49.752
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: And thanks,
everyone, for your questions.

00:44:49.752 --> 00:44:51.168
LEONIE CORNELIUS:
Thank you, guys.

00:44:51.168 --> 00:44:54.910
