[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.100
CAROL FULP: Our organization
is a diversity consulting

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.340
organization.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.290
And over the years,
we have actually

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:22.070
provided leadership development
for 4,000 executives

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.930
and professionals of color.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.680
It's been a journey for me
being at the partnership.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.360
What led me to the
partnership was really

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.700
when President
Obama appointed me

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.950
to be the US representative
to the United Nations

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.860
for the 65th General Assembly.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.650
And it was a really
humbling experience.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.170
Each year, the president
has the opportunity

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.210
to appoint someone outside
of the State Department

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.580
to be a part of the delegation.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.980
And this was a role that Eleanor
Roosevelt filled, Coretta Scott

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.440
King filled, and then I had
the opportunity to fill.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.710
So you can imagine how
humbling this experience was.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:23.030
And when you stand up on the
stage of the United Nations,

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.230
at that iconic podium,
and you look out

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.950
amongst the sea
of ambassadors, it

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.170
hits you that the
world is primarily

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:47.760
black and brown and yellow by
the ambassadors that you see.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.690
And so when I came
back to Boston,

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:58.880
I wanted to help Boston to be
more reflective of the United

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.350
Nations.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.260
And so I left my
job at John Hancock

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.419
and took on this role at
the partnership as CEO

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:14.970
in order to help companies
advance in diversity.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.220
And so that's what I've been
doing these last six years.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.360
And that's what led me to write
"Success through Diversity."

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.960
Now, we were talking earlier.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.340
And while I might be
passionate about diversity,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.940
I only want to
approach diversity

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.680
from a business perspective.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.040
I don't want to approach
it from my passion.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.990
I want to approach it from,
why is it good for business?

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.610
And so thus the tagline, why
the most inclusive companies

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.930
will win.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.310
Because it's about winning.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.710
So let me share
with you this story.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.340
"Toy giant Mattel
is another example

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.510
of a company that catapulted
its business forward

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.370
by appealing to a
diverse marketplace.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.200
For decades, since its debut
in 1959, the Barbie doll--

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.240
flawlessly thin, high
heeled, and white skinned--

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.610
was a cultural sensation, and
one of the world's best selling

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.290
toys.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.360
Over the years, Mattel
modestly diversified

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.680
the toy's occupations
and ethnicities,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.140
creating a Barbie business
woman, 1963, a Barbie

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.770
astronaut, 1965, an
African-American Barbie, '67,

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.940
and a Barbie surgeon, '73.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.110
Mattel's efforts
enabled the doll

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:08.060
to maintain about a 90% market
share in girl-oriented toys

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.630
for most of the 20th century.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:17.930
By the mid 2000s, Barbie's
dominance and brand appeal

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.300
began to lag.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.340
After four straight quarters
of plummeting sales,

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.100
it was no longer the
best selling doll.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.030
The brand was losing
relevance, said

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.290
Lisa McKnight, senior
vice president at Mattel.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.150
We knew we had to
change the conversation.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.390
A creative team
within Mattel worked

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:53.210
for two years under the
secretive code, Project Dawn,

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.760
began Barbie's modern makeover,
designing a more inclusive set

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.510
of dolls that more
accurately reflected

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.320
the size and complexion
of America's children.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:15.280
In 2015, Mattel unleashed
the fruits of Project Dawn,

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.790
launching a new generation of
dolls, complete with curvy body

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:30.790
sizes, 23 hair colors, 22
hairdos, 18 eye colors,

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.840
and an array of skin tones.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.480
This product launch, Mattel's
most significant rebranding

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:47.380
effort to date, has proven
revitalizing and lucrative.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.340
Parents and children
alike flocked

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:58.600
to the ethnically, racially, and
bodily diverse product lines.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.820
Barbie became the most
diverse doll product line

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.350
and at the Toy Industry
Association's annual Toy

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:13.150
of the Year awards
in 2017, the company

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.730
won the coveted Doll
of the Year Award.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.520
This new generation
of Barbies wouldn't

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.110
have been possible without
a diverse workforce

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.270
inside Mattel.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.890
To help design a culturally
sensitive and compelling

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.820
black Barbie, for
example, the company's

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.510
marketing teams
consulted with Mattel's

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.620
African-American
forum, the toy maker's

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.300
African-American
employee resource group.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:55.330
Members helped get the doll's
names, skin tone, and hair

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.790
just right.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.040
They asked us very
candid questions

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.080
about the look of the doll.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.420
Did they get the
skin tone right?

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.040
What about the nose?

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.890
And the hair, said
David Simmons,

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.400
associate manager
of account planning

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.030
and a member of the ERG group.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:21.010
This was important,
because consumers roundly

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:26.620
criticized the 1967
African-American

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:32.950
Barbie, Colored Francie,
for her inauthenticity.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:36.610
Besides having a
darker skin tone,

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:42.040
she lacked any bodily
features or hairstyles

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.910
typical of African-Americans.

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:50.860
As African-American Tom
Burrell, a diversity advertising

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:57.310
trailblazer famously
quipped, black people are not

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:01.270
dark-skinned white people.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:06.010
A lack of authenticity plagued
previous Barbie diversity

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.130
efforts as well.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:14.500
With the wheelchair-bound
Share a Smile Becky doll, 1997,

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:19.810
lacking the correct proportions
to fit into her dream house

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.810
elevator and the
computer engineer

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:26.770
Barbie product
line requiring help

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:30.250
from boys to actually code.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:36.940
However, for its 2016
line of gamer Barbies,

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:41.559
Mattel drew on female
engineer leaders,

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:47.860
such as Molly Proffitt, CEO
of Ker-Chunk Games, Julie Ann

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:54.820
Crommett, entertainment industry
editor in chief at Google,

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:59.650
and Kimberly Bryant,
founder of Black Girls Code,

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:06.550
to help design a compelling
doll that resembled a real tech

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:07.600
geek.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:13.840
These women advised Mattel
during their design process,

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.140
ensuring the new
career game developer

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.760
Barbie was authentic,
compelling, and would help

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.890
inspire a new generation
of budding female computer

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:31.120
scientists and STEM leaders.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.680
The computer has
JavaScript on it,

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.970
and you can see various
instances of game engines

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:43.270
on her laptop, said
one of the leaders,

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:46.910
commenting on the new line.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:51.220
I really know the girls need
an icon that shows them they

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.580
can be part of the tech space.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.490
And Barbie does that.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:00.670
She has the power
to tell girls they

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:04.280
can be makers and builders.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:09.240
Even Barbie's companion, Ken,
received a totally diversity

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.740
makeover in 2017.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:16.520
Prior to the new
iteration of Ken dolls,

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:24.030
Barbie's plastic beau typically
sported blonde hair, blue eyes,

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.600
and a chiseled figure.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:33.320
Revamped Ken comes, in
one case, with a man bun,

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:41.420
while another sports a dad bod,
a Fortune article observed.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.720
All of this increased
diversity has

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.100
led to more prosperity
for the company.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:56.630
Mattel's brunette Latina Barbie
with curves and brown eyes

00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:05.060
became the company's 2016 best
seller, a feat the Huntington

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:10.760
Post senior reporter Emily
Peck calls, a clear victory

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.670
for the toy maker giant.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:19.010
Following four years of
declines, sales of the dolls

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:26.570
increased 7% in 2016,
earning nearly $1 billion

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:35.660
for the company, certainly
proving that diversity sells."

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:36.583
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:11:36.583 --> 00:11:37.500
CAROL FULP: Thank you.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.630
SPEAKER 1: Well, I'm so glad
that you showed that excerpt,

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.880
because it really leads
into the first question

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.300
that I wanted to ask you.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.740
And that is, as a woman of color
writing a book about diversity,

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:55.690
you took the lives of not moral
compass leading or anything

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.150
that would say, as a human
being, this makes sense,

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.760
but you instead went the
route of really highlighting

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.430
why, as a business, like
you said about the tagline,

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:06.850
why it'll make you win or
why it is a business case.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:09.100
Can you speak to why
you went that route

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.900
when writing the book?

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:15.530
CAROL FULP: Because at the end
of the day, we are in business.

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:17.920
And at the end of the
day, we want to win.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:23.840
And we have to approach
things from the bottom line.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.630
And so when we
look at diversity,

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:31.000
we want to look at the
changing landscape.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.270
It's important for
us to understand

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:39.430
this changing demographic
shift we're experiencing.

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.910
Today, there are
more babies of color

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:47.620
born in this country
than Caucasian babies.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:52.180
Today, there are more students
of color in this country

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.760
than Caucasians.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:59.320
In 2042, the Census
Bureau indicates

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.730
that there will be more
people of color in America

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.860
than Caucasians.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.990
That's our workforce.

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:10.570
That's our marketplace.

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:16.060
And so in order for us to
produce goods and services

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:21.110
for our marketplace and for
our global marketplace--

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.661
I talked about the UN--

00:13:23.661 --> 00:13:27.220
we need to have individuals
in our companies

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:31.520
that are reflective
of our marketplace.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:35.530
And so it only stands
to reason that we want

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:39.520
to have a diverse workforce.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.770
And then you look
at all the studies.

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:44.680
You look at the
McKinsey studies that

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.550
indicates the more
diverse workforces are

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:53.350
the more profitable
workforces, because again,

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:56.890
at the end of the day, you
want diversity of thought.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:59.710
And the best way to get
diversity of thought

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:04.220
is to have people not only
with different experiences,

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:07.660
but different cultures
and who can add

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:11.930
a different lens to a problem.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:15.320
And so diversity is critical.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.770
There's a new
study that came out

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:23.360
that said that the more
innovative companies,

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.440
the companies that
are more diverse,

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:30.610
are the more
innovative companies.

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:35.980
The more innovative companies
are producing more patents.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:40.000
And when they did the studies,
those innovative companies

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.710
were the diverse companies.

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:43.780
The more diverse
companies produce

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.930
more innovative companies,
the more patents,

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:48.402
they receive more patents.

00:14:48.402 --> 00:14:50.110
SPEAKER 1: I definitely
can believe that.

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:53.148
And I'm sure you know Google's
goal is to be among the most

00:14:53.148 --> 00:14:54.190
innovative of companies--

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:55.290
CAROL FULP: Oh, absolutely.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:56.832
SPEAKER 1: To be on
the cutting edge.

00:14:56.832 --> 00:14:58.630
So then the next
question I have for you

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.785
stems off of that same thought.

00:15:00.785 --> 00:15:03.160
I know there are some folks
in the room that are actually

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.290
on our recruiting
teams, but a lot

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:08.230
of this office in
particular don't really

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:12.430
have a touch point with our
recruiting or hiring and HR

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:14.410
teams, heavily engineering.

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:17.560
How would you say, for those
who are interested in kind

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.560
of seeing the needle move here
but don't really work in a role

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.710
where they can directly hire,
let's say, more diverse talent

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.590
to get us that innovation
that you were speaking about,

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:29.740
how can we still kind of
show our passion for this

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.990
or try to make some
progress on the topic,

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:34.900
although it's not necessarily
a part of our core roles

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.290
here at Google?

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.830
CAROL FULP: It is a
part of your core roles.

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:43.720
And it's important for
you to understand how much

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.330
influence millennials have.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:51.100
Today, there are more
millennials than baby boomers.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:57.340
And corporate understands that
millennials are our leaders

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.290
and our future leaders.

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:03.460
And your voice is
incredibly powerful.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.910
And corporate and
executives understand

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:11.740
that millennials think
differently and understand

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.450
that you have a lot of options.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:20.560
And they understand that
you care deeply about values

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:26.500
and that a company has to
have ethics and values.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.350
And if you say
this is important,

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:33.460
it becomes important
to the company.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:37.240
I can give you an example.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.590
Charlottesville occurred.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:45.990
And there were a number of
companies where the CEO wrote

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:51.540
a letter to their employee
population saying,

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.100
this is not who we are.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.820
We condemn this.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:01.590
And as recently as
six months ago, I

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:09.720
was speaking to a HR
executive here in Boston

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.440
and they said to
me, we still are

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:20.430
feeling the effects of not
coming out and saying something

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:23.160
at Charlottesville.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:28.089
And so your voice is important.

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:33.360
And so employees, if diversity
is important to you--

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.710
and it is.

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:40.360
Millennials are far more
diverse than baby boomers.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.620
It's what you know.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:48.900
You don't want to be living
or working in a society

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:54.060
where there is just
one of any kind.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.640
You value diversity.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:01.230
You are really stimulated by it.

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:06.780
And so if you say this is
important for your growth

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:12.120
and development, your
executive management

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.920
will respond to that.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:19.350
And so I would say
give voice to this

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:25.890
and say it is important for
you and that it is something

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:31.260
you are willing to step up
and help take responsibility

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:37.020
for and help be on teams to
help increase the diversity

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.060
of your organization.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.490
SPEAKER 1: We can
accept that charge.

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:43.090
That's a really good idea.

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:44.970
I know that one
reason, a lot of times,

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:47.580
we see that women
of color or women

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.190
in general or any
underrepresented minority

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:53.320
maybe is not seen progressing
through corporate America

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.490
as quickly is due to unconscious
biases that we may hold.

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.860
And Google has, like I
think many companies,

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.680
we have an unconscious
bias training

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.060
that all employees have to take.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.030
But I know that you've
actually spoken out,

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:07.500
saying that you
don't necessarily

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:11.640
believe in having a mandatory
unconscious bias training.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:15.610
Can you speak to why that is
and what might work better?

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:18.540
CAROL FULP: Well,
I don't personally

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.980
want to go to a class
called unconscious bias.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:26.430
I think that the
term makes you feel--

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:29.220
it puts you-- it
makes you tense.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:36.060
And so I do want to
go to a forum, a class

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.440
on leading for the future.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.510
And that's what we call our
forums at the partnership,

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:45.490
leading for the future.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:50.400
And so we talk about,
what does that look like?

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.990
What does the
population look like?

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.920
What are the technologies
going to look like?

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.700
There is so much change.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:04.920
And because there
is so much change,

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:11.230
what would get in the way
of us accepting this change?

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:15.330
And so we begin to peel
back the onion that way.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:18.480
And that's how we get
at unconscious bias.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:23.880
But I find uncomfortable going
to a session called unconscious

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.780
bias.

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:29.700
I'd much rather go to a session
called leading for the future,

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.880
because all of us want
to be good leaders.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.920
And then we find
out, OK, well, what

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:39.340
might get in the way of
us being a good leader?

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:43.230
And something that gets in the
way of us being a good leader

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:48.040
is this unconscious
bias, which we all have.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.540
And one of the things
that I always do is,

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:56.040
in this leading for
the future forum,

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.160
is I tell people of my bias.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.010
When I walked into
the partnership,

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:04.500
the partnership had all women.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:08.020
And I love being a woman.

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:15.640
And so the personal side of me
was most comfortable with that.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:22.590
But I also knew that I
was missing something

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:26.380
from an organizational
standpoint.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:30.750
And so my first
few hires were men.

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:35.190
And my culture shifted
in the organization.

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:37.170
It expanded.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:41.660
We had perspectives
that were not there.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.900
And so my organization
was better

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:49.250
because we opened
up the organization

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:52.070
so that it was more diverse.

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:55.970
And while we're an
organization that

00:21:55.970 --> 00:22:01.130
focuses on ethnic diversity,
we have individuals

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:05.780
who are white who work
in our organization,

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:11.570
because I don't want to
have one of any kind.

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:15.500
I want our organization to
be reflective of the world,

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.040
to be reflective
of organizations,

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:22.370
and we are going
to build together.

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:27.530
So unconscious bias--
first, let's think about

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:32.870
why and who we are and
what our own biases are.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:36.110
And let's check them
at the door before we

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.332
come into the organization.

00:22:38.332 --> 00:22:39.290
SPEAKER 1: I love that.

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:42.253
You should teach our
unconscious bias training

00:22:42.253 --> 00:22:44.420
and we can change the name
and you can tell us that.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.760
That was really thoughtful.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.803
Thank you for sharing that.

00:22:48.803 --> 00:22:50.720
I know that you were
speaking about your goals

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.510
for the partnership
and your employees

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:56.810
and what you would like
to see reflected there.

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:58.410
We, as a company--

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:00.560
and I'm sure many
companies-- are also

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.740
trying to diversify the pipeline
and make sure that we've

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:04.810
got talent coming in.

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:08.030
But a lot of times, folks say,
well, there's just not there.

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:09.800
We're looking for this
role and we're not

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.070
seeing a lot of minority
groups represented

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:15.590
for this specific role or job.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:17.180
What do you say to that?

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:20.060
And how would you
challenge folks to resolve

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:21.672
that issue for their company?

00:23:21.672 --> 00:23:23.630
CAROL FULP: Well, first
of all, let me tell you

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:28.820
that I don't use the word
minority, because in the world,

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:32.030
people of color are
not the minority.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:39.330
In Boston, people of color
are 54% of the population.

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:41.360
So we're not the minority.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:45.920
So I call us people of
color rather than minority.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.150
And the word minority has a
certain connotation as well.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:54.870
So I use the word
people of color.

00:23:54.870 --> 00:24:00.450
So I encourage people
to do that as well.

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:04.880
And I encourage people to
move beyond the traditional

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.780
recruiting sources.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.480
We have 4,000
individuals who have

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:16.700
been through the partnership
training programs.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:21.860
Next month, Carmen will
be training over 250,

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.800
I think you have starting.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:32.600
There are people who are
in our greater Boston area.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:37.280
You have to look beyond
the traditional sources.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.610
You went to Howard University.

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:47.180
There is a Howard University
alumni chapter here in Boston.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.610
That's a great place to start.

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:54.890
Here at the partnership,
we've created a job board

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:59.060
for companies who want
to be able to advertise

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:06.290
their jobs through us, because
individuals know that people

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:11.990
who are advertising on the
partnership's job board website

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:15.780
really value diversity.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:21.020
So there are ways that
you can approach and find

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.120
and resource people of color.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.530
One of the strategies
that I mention in the book

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:29.870
is the Rooney rule.

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:34.900
And that is to say that
when you have a job

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:42.830
open to ensure that you
interview diverse talent.

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:47.690
You don't fill that job unless
you have a diverse pool.

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:52.070
Now, we're not telling you
to hire a diverse talent.

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:57.350
But we're telling you to make
sure that the pool is diverse.

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:02.120
And this rule
comes from the NFL,

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.750
when they tried to
increase diversity

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:09.540
amongst their coaches.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:15.830
And it just so happened
that they were at its peak

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:21.650
when, one Super Bowl, they had
two African-Americans playing

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:25.550
against each other, two coaches.

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:30.620
But for a long time,
there was no coaches

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.750
who were African-American.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.640
Now, we still have
a long way to go.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.940
And we still have a long
way to go with the NFL.

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:44.070
But the Rooney rule is
really an opportunity for us

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:47.770
to ensure our pools are diverse.

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:52.770
Managers can select whomever,
but at least we're seeing,

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:58.040
we're being intentional about
seeing candidates of color.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.370
SPEAKER 1: That
makes a lot of sense.

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:03.000
I know that there are some folks
in the audience who might also

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.040
have questions.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.587
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:27:07.587 --> 00:27:08.670
The excerpt was excellent.

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:10.170
I'm really excited
to read the rest.

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:11.520
CAROL FULP: Well, thank you.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.570
AUDIENCE: And I
was wondering, what

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:14.400
were some of the biggest
challenges for you

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.138
in writing this book?

00:27:16.138 --> 00:27:17.805
CAROL FULP: Oh, that's
a great question.

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:26.130
Well, I think the some
of the biggest challenges

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:36.840
were finding companies
that had really excelled

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.590
and were exceptional.

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:46.160
And I was able to find
Hallmark Health, who

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:53.610
had used the Rooney rule and
seen their profits go up.

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:55.850
So it's one thing to
use the Rooney rule,

00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:59.550
but I wanted to be able to
relate that to profitability.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:01.970
And so when
interviewing their CEO,

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:06.060
they attributed that
to their profitability.

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.550
So I was glad to see that.

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:14.600
And then the other
challenge was to be

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:25.370
able to find CEOs who
would be able to indicate

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:27.860
what they did wrong.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:32.450
And none of us want to
indicate what we did wrong.

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.690
And so those were the
biggest challenges.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:36.730
But that's a great question.

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:37.597
So thank you.

00:28:37.597 --> 00:28:38.430
AUDIENCE: Hi, there.

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:39.650
Thanks for coming today.

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:41.390
CAROL FULP: Hi.

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:44.000
AUDIENCE: I was curious, as
you were doing your research,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.390
was there a certain industry
that excels in this area?

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:50.330
And if they do
excel in this area,

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:53.120
are they as equally successful
in retention as well

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:53.863
as recruiting?

00:28:53.863 --> 00:28:55.280
Are there things
that we can learn

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.400
from other industries that might
be doing it better than ours?

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.370
And along those
lines, if they are

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:03.437
successful in their
recruiting methods,

00:29:03.437 --> 00:29:06.020
is there something they partner
with retention methods as well

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.910
that helps them be successful?

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:13.400
CAROL FULP: Yeah, I found
that the finance industry

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.340
is particularly good
at it, because they've

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:21.080
been doing it a longer
period of time, number one.

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:26.090
And recruiting is certainly
linked to retention.

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:30.350
And there's one finance
company that has

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:35.630
27 ERGs in their organizations.

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:37.550
Do you know what ERGs are?

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:39.470
Employee resource groups.

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:41.300
27.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:46.190
So they have a resource
group for every difference.

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:53.580
So people feel valued
there and that they can--

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.820
their difference is valued.

00:29:55.820 --> 00:30:01.970
It's supported by their company,
and that they think twice

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:07.310
about leaving, because
ERGs are really

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:10.350
a core part of the business.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:15.320
The other thing that I found
is that ERGs are merging,

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:20.060
are moving towards
business resource groups.

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.620
So the Mattel story--

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:26.510
so it's just not an
ERG now, that companies

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:31.610
are using the ERGs as
business resource groups.

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:34.340
And they are being
valued even more

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.690
and being brought
into the business.

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:40.880
And that's really
helpful for employees.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:44.910
And it's helpful for
companies as well.

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:45.730
Great questions.

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:46.610
AUDIENCE: I actually
have one more question.

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:47.880
CAROL FULP: Yes, please.

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.010
AUDIENCE: Do you find that
there's any particular--

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:52.468
whether it be finance or another
industry or company that's

00:30:52.468 --> 00:30:58.900
really skilled at upward
mobility for people of color?

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.650
It's something we talk
about all the time.

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:02.000
I sit on the university
programs team

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.875
and we do university
recruiting and so forth.

00:31:03.875 --> 00:31:07.920
And we control so much of the
students' experience on campus.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.942
And we want to make sure
that we want to set them up

00:31:11.942 --> 00:31:13.150
for success wherever they go.

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:14.770
So whether they end up at Google
or they end up somewhere else,

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:16.070
we want make sure they're
having a good experience

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:18.480
and that when they get there,
they can really flourish.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.355
So there's a lot of
companies, I can imagine,

00:31:20.355 --> 00:31:22.462
that do pretty well
recruiting and retaining,

00:31:22.462 --> 00:31:24.170
but don't necessarily
see people of color

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:26.205
moving up at the same
rate as other folks.

00:31:26.205 --> 00:31:27.830
Are there any companies
that you notice

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:29.372
through your research
that are really

00:31:29.372 --> 00:31:32.120
good at promoting upward
mobility for people of color?

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.730
CAROL FULP: The
company in Boston

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:38.720
that I think does it
best is Eastern Bank.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:42.260
And that's because of
the executive leadership

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.460
of that company.

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:50.180
So Bob Rivers is
the chairman and CEO

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:55.610
and is actually named
after Robert Kennedy,

00:31:55.610 --> 00:32:01.890
and so takes the issue of
diversity and inclusion

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:07.730
very personally and
chose specifically,

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:11.810
when expanding the
business, chose

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:17.270
to expand in areas like
Lawrence and Lowell

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:19.250
and was able to
make the business

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:26.250
case for moving into those
socioeconomic depressed areas

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:32.180
and build those
areas and make money.

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:36.560
In that company, the
chair of the board

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:39.730
is an African-American
woman and she

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:48.730
succeeded an African-American
male chair, Bob's successor,

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:52.420
the vice chair of the
board and president,

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:56.200
is an African-American male.

00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:03.880
When he started, 90% of
the board was white male.

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:11.950
And now, 50% of the board
are women, people of color,

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:12.600
or LGBT.

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:22.810
And that attracts a
whole set of people

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:26.410
who want to be able
to work for a company,

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:30.070
because the culture has shifted.

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:35.380
So at the end of the day, what
is happening with diversity?

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:38.830
It's all about culture.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:45.250
And you have to create a culture
where difference is valued,

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:49.960
where difference
is not tolerated,

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:53.800
where your difference
is an asset, where

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.400
your difference
is valued and can

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:02.440
be seen as a business value.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.980
And that is why
people will stay.

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:10.100
And so when you're bringing
in these students--

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:15.100
and if you don't have it, if
you don't have it all together,

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:17.469
you ask them for their help.

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:20.510
You say, here's
where we want to be.

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:22.639
And we're not here yet.

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:25.000
But we need your help.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.120
And help us get there.

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:34.600
Empower them to help
shape your culture.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.889
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:39.550
It sounds like the book
and a lot of your work

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:40.860
is in the business context.

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:43.030
I'm definitely super
interested in reading it.

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:45.219
I'm curious, though,
to what degree

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:48.159
you've run into similar
issues in other domains,

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:50.020
like politics, for
example, if you

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:52.385
have any stories
or research that

00:34:52.385 --> 00:34:53.760
might not be
included in the book

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.659
that you could share about that?

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:56.919
CAROL FULP: In terms of?

00:34:56.919 --> 00:35:00.040
AUDIENCE: In terms of the
value of diversity and the way

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:03.070
it can benefit countries
or political systems,

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:05.200
in addition to businesses.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:10.480
CAROL FULP: Oh, well,
yeah, that's who I am.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.970
Yes, well, the
world is changing.

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:19.210
And so it's so important
for us to be accepting.

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:21.500
We look at our country.

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.880
And it's really important
for us to understand

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:30.530
that the landscape and the
demographics of our country--

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:32.530
it's shifting.

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:38.440
And it's important that
we accept that and that we

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:42.740
understand that, at
the end of the day,

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:46.510
everyone in this
country is an immigrant.

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:50.770
Everyone comes from
that background.

00:35:50.770 --> 00:36:00.370
And that we need to
not hold on to power,

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:06.820
but we need to open the
door for others, just

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:12.290
as others have opened the
door for us when we came.

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:16.090
And that's the challenge
we're experiencing now

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:21.520
in our country, that
there are so many who

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:27.580
are fearful of the change,
the changing demographics,

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:31.790
and want things to
remain the same.

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:34.400
But they're not going
to remain the same.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.860
The numbers are changing.

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:42.400
And so it is best for us
to look at the advantages

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:48.460
that diversity brings,
as opposed to fear it,

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:55.720
look at the advantages of
what different cultures bring

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:56.950
to this country.

00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:59.800
It's who we are.

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:07.180
And not fear the change that
is coming and understand

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:14.230
that if we continue to
resist, the rest of the world

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:16.630
is going to pass us by.

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:24.730
And so it's so important that
we focus on the best side of us

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:27.630
and not our fears.

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:28.980
AUDIENCE: So I'm recently--

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.260
I live in the city
of Boston, and I'm

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:35.770
in the process of enrolling
my kids into a school system.

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:38.460
And what I noticed was I
was attending a few sessions

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:41.220
on various programs, but
Boston public schools

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:45.990
have a high school
graduation rate in the 60s.

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:48.780
And so you take a look around at
the Boston public school system

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:50.740
and it's largely a lot of--

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.610
I know you don't like
the word minorities,

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:54.480
a lot of people
of color that have

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.220
no other option but
the public school

00:37:56.220 --> 00:38:00.690
system, which I think a lot of
people agree is largely broken.

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:03.810
And I think in order
for people of color

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:06.600
to have the same opportunities
to get into companies that--

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.100
like Google or like
the banks you're

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.540
talking about that have
all these resources,

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:13.350
they need to be exposed to kind
of that environment and that,

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:16.020
as a path for when
they grow up, this

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.180
is what you can
have a career in.

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:22.140
And I feel like, if we have
something like a 60% graduation

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:24.810
rate in the Boston
public schools,

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:28.950
it just doesn't seem like--
there's no funnel of talent,

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:30.720
at least in the city of Boston.

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.330
And so I guess I was wondering
if you had any thoughts of--

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:35.680
I know a lot of your work
has been with companies,

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:40.080
but how can we, as a larger
company in Boston area,

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:45.930
how can we help improve that
high school graduation rate?

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:48.690
CAROL FULP: Well, first
of all, as you know,

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:52.120
this is the educational
mecca of the world.

00:38:52.120 --> 00:39:01.410
And so there should be no reason
why we should have that rate.

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:05.910
But what we need to
do as corporations

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:09.540
is to partner with our
public school systems,

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:15.000
partner with our
city halls to help

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.300
address the issues, to help.

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:21.850
Because this is our
future workforce.

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:26.130
So we were just at
Biogen the other day

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:30.000
and they have this
wonderful community lab,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.450
where they have
students coming in

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:36.410
and they're teaching
students science.

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:41.070
But this is a real opportunity
to take students and bring them

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:45.900
into companies, so that
they can learn and can see

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:49.050
that they can work here, too.

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:52.440
There are a number of
different programs,

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:56.910
but I do believe
each company should

00:39:56.910 --> 00:40:02.370
be engaged in the community
and have programs connected

00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:06.360
to the public school
system, because that just

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.340
makes good business sense.

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:13.270
So whether it's adopt a
school, or whether it's

00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:20.400
going across industry and
teaching across the school

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.820
system.

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:25.110
But we need to realize
this is our future.

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:29.190
And we won't succeed
as a business community

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:38.490
with an uneducated workforce
in our public system.

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:40.470
SPEAKER 1: So I know
that a lot of times,

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:43.080
when people are going
into some of the biggest,

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:47.010
most celebratory moments, or
moments that become ones that

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:50.490
they're most proud of-- for
me, I'm reflecting on your time

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:53.700
at the UN General Assembly--

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.110
those are preceded
by things that

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:56.670
maybe are a little
more challenging

00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:58.290
or you don't know
that that's coming

00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:00.082
and you can be kind of
going through a time

00:41:00.082 --> 00:41:03.160
of either complacency on
what you've been doing,

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.860
or trying to switch
gears or change gears.

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:08.910
And I know, as folks trying to
move through corporate America,

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:12.180
folks can be in jobs for a
while and then getting antsy

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:15.030
for that next big thing or that
next large opportunity that

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.760
could be coming.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:19.260
And your career has been full
of very large opportunities

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:20.910
and really amazing work.

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:23.640
Has there ever been a time when
you were going into something

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.290
and you didn't
necessarily see your way

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:28.170
or weren't aware that that
next big thing was coming?

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:31.860
And how did you navigate
that stage before the time

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:34.320
where you were moving
to the next big thing?

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:38.070
CAROL FULP: You always
create opportunities.

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:43.260
You never wait for anything.

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:48.150
You put yourself in creative
environments, like this.

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:57.090
You always think of ways to open
doors for the next generation.

00:41:57.090 --> 00:42:02.670
You come up with creative
ideas to bring along others.

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:07.770
I'm so cognizant that so
many people fought and died

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:12.750
and sacrificed so that
I could be sitting here,

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:15.090
so that you could
be sitting there.

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:18.450
So my job is so small
compared to what

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:25.840
others have done for me, so
there is always work to do.

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:31.170
And we all have a
responsibility to develop

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:33.900
the next generation of leaders.

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:37.880
And that requires a lot
of work, whether it's

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:40.470
the Boston public
school system, which

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:43.740
is something you're
focusing on, or whether it's

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:48.090
developing leaders
at our C-suite level

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:50.550
in the partnership.

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:53.685
But you never wait for anything.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:03.180
You are always focused on
building and developing,

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:06.330
because others
fought and died so

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:09.030
that we could be sitting here.

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:10.225
And we have a job to do.

00:43:10.225 --> 00:43:11.850
SPEAKER 1: Thank you
all for your time.

00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:12.930
And thank you, again.

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:13.930
CAROL FULP: Thank you.

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:15.780
Thank you.
