00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.126
Before we describe the theory as to why this is the case, can you think of any

00:00:04.126 --> 00:00:10.008
situations that you've experienced where you saw this bystander effect? That

00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:13.016
is, have you been in a situation where somebody really needed help, and there

00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:18.190
are a bunch of people around and nobody did help? Have you ever been driving

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.190
and noticed a person on the side of the road with a flat tire, or the hood of

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.340
their car open with steam coming out of the engine, and just drove by without

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.617
stopping to help? Perhaps as you were driving you saw the person and thought,

00:00:29.617 --> 00:00:34.312
well somebody must have called to help that person. I'm not the only person who

00:00:34.312 --> 00:00:38.605
saw that person needed assistance. Somebody must've called for help. So my

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:43.114
question then, can you think of any situation that you've experienced? This

00:00:43.114 --> 00:00:45.339
would be a great time to share it on the forum.
