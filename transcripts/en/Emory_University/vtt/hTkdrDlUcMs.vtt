00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:01.850
This program is brought to you by Emory University.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:17.140
[music] My family history is that I have no heart disease in the family

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.850
but for years I suffer from gastric reflux.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.960
And the gastric reflux gives you symptoms very similar to heart attacks.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.520
One night I start having chest pains

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.980
so I just say its refluxed and I'm just going to go to sleep and don't worry about it.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.720
and the next day I wake up and I go about my life

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.880
except that my heart rate is higher than
usual.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:52.940
Ernie started having chest discomfort that wasn't really typical of ischemic heart disease.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.700
On the EKG it wasn't really obvious that he had any abnormalities

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.480
but he kept on having those symptoms

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.000
and eventually the cardiologists decided
to order a nuclear cardiology test.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.250
We used the Emory Cardiac Toolbox to diagnosis

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.710
that yes indeed he he did have ischemic changes.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.040
Usually the physician tends to
concentrate on the area that's

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.720
more severe, that's easily recognizable by just visual analysis.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.580
What the Emory Cardiac Toolbox does is

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.670
helps identified that secondary that doesn't seem so obvious.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.750
Because we're looking at the heart at the
molecular level.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.920
So it's a really remarkable that Ernie developed the Emory Cardiac Toolbox.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.000
A few year's ago Ernie was able to use his own technology

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.450
to save him from having a heart attack
or potentially more harmful complications.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.940
So that was a little strange, [laugh]

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.380
to know that, to sit there, and see

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.860
the that tool that we developed being able to just see my heat there

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.060
and I was at that point very sure of what was going on with me.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.940
So the Emory Cardiac Toolbox has at least 30,000 licenses all over the world

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:22.500
and to walk into a clinic you know in Italy

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.700
see that they're using your tool for
diagnosing patients

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.740
that actually was very rewarding. That feeling is very rewarding.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:39.160
When it was used on me it was more like a trusted friend telling me what's really going on with me.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:52.860
