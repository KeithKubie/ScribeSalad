00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.360
The efforts of engineers are all around you.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.340
Take a stroll down the street and you’ll
spot one feat of engineering after another.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.110
But what you can’t see are all the feats
of engineering people are carrying around
inside their bodies.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.700
Because engineering isn’t just about what’s
around us; it’s also about what’s inside us.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.780
From medical implants to artificial limbs
and the bandages that cover your cuts,

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.920
so many things have been designed from a special
set of materials that work well with the human body.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.460
These biomaterials are vital to medicine,
healthcare, and the world as we know it.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:42.700
[Theme Music]

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.400
It takes special effort to design things that
work directly with the human body.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:54.840
Technically, you could try and use any material
as a biomaterial, but to be successful, it needs
to be compatible with the biological system
it’s interacting with.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.540
All the materials we’ve talked about in this course
– metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites –

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.220
and even living cells and tissues can be
candidates for biomaterials, as long as they
have the right skills for the job.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.220
That’s where biocompatibility comes in.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.580
That’s a general term for how compatible
a material is with living tissue.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.620
It’s not only an important feature of biomaterials,
it’s what makes something a biomaterial.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.660
There are four main ways a material can interact
with your body:

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:26.080
it can hurt you; it can dissolve and be replaced by
cells; your body can surround it with a protective layer;
or it can bond with your living tissue.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.120
Biocompatible materials are the ones that
result in healthy bodily responses.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.800
They don’t tend to cause blood clots or infections,
and lead to normal, uncomplicated healing.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:44.240
Which can be really important, because for most applications, your biomaterials will at least partly come in contact with bodily tissues or cells, and often for long periods of time.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.160
Months. Years.
Maybe decades.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.160
Over the years, the materials we consider
biocompatible have changed a lot –

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:58.460
from the animal tissue used by ancient Egyptians to
stitch wounds, to the wood used in olden-day peg legs,
to the carefully-engineered materials we use today.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.580
Some of the more prominent ones today are
titanium and stainless steel, used everywhere
from joint replacements to dental implants.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:14.191
There’s also polyurethane, a type of polymer used in
catheters, artificial heart valves, and other flexible
devices, and hydrogels, for things like contact lenses.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.900
Each type has different properties that make
it useful as a biomaterial.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.200
We’ve already talked about one use for alloys,
like titanium and stainless steel, for example: braces.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.920
Titanium and some other alloys can be classified
as biologically inert materials, which means they
cause little or no reaction with nearby tissues.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.240
Your body may recognize them as foreign
materials and try to surround them in fibrous
tissue, but it doesn’t outright reject them.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.840
In the US alone, over four million people
wear braces, many of whom have the metal kind.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.400
And that’s not counting all the people who
have already spent a couple of years of their
lives with alloys digging into their gums.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.460
You’ll also find these alloys in plenty
of other things that we put in people’s
bodies for an extended period of time.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:59.000
Titanium is often used in place of stainless
steel because it lacks things like nickel that can
sometimes cause allergic reactions.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.060
It also has a lower density compared to other metallic
biomaterials, so a titanium implant will be lighter than
a similar one made from stainless steel.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.000
And when it comes to artificial body parts, “lighter”
usually translates to “much more comfortable.”

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.780
But both titanium and stainless steel have
excellent mechanical properties like strength,
resistance to bending, and durability.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.720
That’s why they’re used for things that tend to
get a lot of wear and tear, like teeth and joints.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.500
Titanium is also often used to surround things
that wouldn’t be biocompatible otherwise – a
pacemaker, for example.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.280
On their own, having a battery and electrical
circuits inside you wouldn’t be great.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.380
Surround them with a biocompatible material
like titanium, though, and it becomes much safer.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.960
Sometimes, you can change the surface of a
material to do even better than just not causing harm.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.500
For example, sometimes implanted devices that
come into direct contact with blood, like pacemakers,

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.720
cause dangerous blood clots or narrowing of blood vessels as the person’s body tries to heal around them.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:01.960
But scientists have found that coating the titanium
in a mixture of collagen proteins and a blood thinner
called heparin could someday help prevent those
complications.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.500
The research is still in the early stages,
but the fibrous tissues that form around implants
are often collagen-based,

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.660
so coating the titanium
in the same proteins might speed up healing.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.260
Meanwhile, the blood thinner might prevent
clots.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.660
Other types of titanium coatings are already
used for surgeries where you need to get an
implant to bond with the surrounding bone.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:30.780
Some knee replacements, for example, are coated with things like proteins and silver, which give the alloy the ability to bond with living tissue and discourage bacterial growth.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:39.480
With things like knee replacements, that can be really important, because for the surgery to be successful, you typically need to get the implant to bond with the surrounding bone.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.780
So when it comes to biocompatibility, alloys
like titanium are super useful.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.200
And with some clever engineering, you can
make them even better.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.470
Sometimes, though, you need a material that’s
a little more flexible, like for a heart valve.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.500
And for that, engineers often turn to polyurethane.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.220
Like other polymers, polyurethane is made
up of long, repeating chains arranged into
larger molecules.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:06.760
But the smaller segments of the polymer alternate
between hard and soft, which gives it a super
useful set of properties.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:13.560
Polyurethane has a high level of elasticity,
so it’s pretty flexible, but it’s also durable and
resistant to tearing.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.220
Combine these properties and you end up with
a biomaterial that performs well under both
static and dynamic loads.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.440
More importantly, though, those hard and soft
segments make polyurethane biocompatible.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:34.820
In the 1980s, researchers discovered that the molecules in the softer segments helped make the polymer more blood-friendly because the platelet cells that cause clots didn’t stick to them as much.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:45.060
Since then, engineers have worked to make polyurethanes with even better biocompatibility by changing the chemical structure of the hard segments so they don’t accumulate platelets as much, either.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.870
But polyurethane isn’t the only polymer
that’s widely-used as a biomaterial.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:56.280
There are also hydrogels, materials made up of things
called hydrophilic structures, cross-linked polymers
capable of holding large amounts of water.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.860
Think of the polymers we’ve talked about
before, with those long chemical chains,

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.620
but now they’re linked repeatedly between the chains,
forming a network-like structure.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:10.660
That network can then swell with water to
fill in the gaps between the chains, leading
to some interesting properties.

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:18.500
For example, one of the most widely used hydrogels
is something called PHEMA, a material that’s pretty
unreactive and supportive of biological processes.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:28.620
It’s tough and doesn't degrade easily, isn’t absorbed by the body, and it can take on many different shapes and forms, making it the sort of swiss army knife of biomaterials.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.990
These characteristics are what make PHEMA
hydrogels so well-suited for contact lenses.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.280
There’s even research on using them to deliver
medicine to the eye!

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:42.720
In fact, the unique chemical structure of
hydrogels in general could make them ideal
for delivering drugs across the body.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.380
Say you swallow a hydrogel capsule filled
with medication that you might normally take
in a shot.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.139
When the pill enters your body, the water
inside you will try to fill it up.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:59.800
The hydrogel will take in the fluid and swell up to
maintain its equilibrium, effectively pushing out the drug
into your body and releasing it where it needs to go.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.820
And if you use a hydrogel that your body
can gradually absorb, it will just dissolve
after it’s done its job.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:10.840
The potential for future hydrogel applications
is vast, including wound-healing bioadhesives,

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:16.580
artificial skin and cartilage, sexual organ
reconstruction, and even vocal cord replacements.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:20.740
So far, we’ve mostly talked about building
devices to put in the body.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.600
But biomaterials can be used to help boost
the body’s existing behaviors, too.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:30.850
For example, some researchers are working
on a gel that can that can stick to your bodily
tissues and help heal them faster.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:38.060
This gel can help prevent internal blisters
and infections by filling the dead space that’s
created by surgeries like tumor removals.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.800
After your body has the time to heal, the
gel degrades and is absorbed.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.760
On a much smaller scale – like, the size
of individual cells –

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:51.820
researchers are also looking into biomaterials
that could deliver things like DNA directly into cells
they otherwise couldn’t get into.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:59.600
By creating biomaterials that mimic viruses,
you can trick cells into taking in these molecules,
like some kind of cellular Trojan horse.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.280
We might even be able to use them for cancer
vaccines!

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.120
But like anything else in science, and especially
medicine,

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:13.880
there are certain protocols biomaterial engineers are
expected to follow to make sure what they’re designing
is more than just effective – it has to be safe.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:22.740
For example, early research might include testing the
material on cells outside of the body, to get an idea of
how biocompatible it is without risking anyone’s life.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:30.060
Other times, it might involve animal testing,
to see how a material affects the physiology of
other animals before trying it on humans.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.020
But the proper precautions aren’t always taken,

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:40.180
and there have been some cases where devices
that were said to be safe caused reactions as mild
as a rash or as serious as death.

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:43.680
Like the Dalkon Shield, an early IUD contraceptive.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:51.320
When it was introduced in the late 1960s,
the Dalkon Corporation marketed the Shield
as superior to other IUDs on the market.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:57.740
They said it had a lower failure rate, at
about 1%, and that it was easier and less
painful to insert and remove.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.000
And then people started getting infections.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.080
Which was weird, because the uterus is normally
sterile.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:09.460
By 1974, it had caused problems in tens of
thousands of people, including at least 18 deaths.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:15.540
Later investigations revealed that the culprit
was the tail string attached to the IUD to
help remove it.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:20.060
The string was made of a bundle of thin nylon
fibers with a shell of nylon around them,

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.860
and it acted like a wick, drawing bacteria
up into the uterus.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:28.860
Turns out, the parent company that bought Dalkon
had known about this problem the whole time.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:36.940
When one of their quality control employees insisted
they address it, the company fired him instead –
something that would be illegal in the US today.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:43.100
On top of that, there were so many flaws in the
human safety trial for the IUDs that it would take
me another ten minutes just to list them all.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:47.080
We’ll discuss the ethics of engineering
in more detail in a later episode,

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:52.580
but what happened with the Dalkon Shield was a clear
violation of even the most basic safety protocols.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:58.180
They released a product they knew could
be dangerous, didn’t tell anyone about the risk,
and hoped for the best.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.240
That plan didn’t work out well for anyone.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.180
Biomaterials can be an incredibly powerful
tool for improving people’s lives.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:08.100
But as engineers, it’s up to us to wield
that power responsibly.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.660
So today we learned all about biomaterials.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:18.420
We talked about alloys like titanium and their
coatings, the special chemistry of polyurethane,
and the cross-linked structure of hydrogels.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:24.900
We also looked at ways to use biomaterials
to boost the body’s existing behaviors,
as well as their enormous future potential.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.000
Finally, we talked about the importance of
safety research.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.540
I’ll see you next time, when we’ll shift
directions a bit and learn about process control.
