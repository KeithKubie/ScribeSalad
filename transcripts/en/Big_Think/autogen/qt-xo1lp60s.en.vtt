from his eyes then pass through an

object bounce off on something and then

object bounce off on something and then
 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.359
object bounce off on something and then
they're detected back by Superman but we

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369
they're detected back by Superman but we

they're detected back by Superman but we
see things when an external light saw

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859
see things when an external light saw

source the light bounces off the object

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:24.409
source the light bounces off the object
 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:27.489
source the light bounces off the object
and then the reflected light strikes our

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:27.499
and then the reflected light strikes our
 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:30.909
and then the reflected light strikes our
eye if the light is not reflected from

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919
eye if the light is not reflected from
 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.600
eye if the light is not reflected from
the object but instead bends around the

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610
the object but instead bends around the
 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.930
the object but instead bends around the
object then as far as our eyes are

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940
object then as far as our eyes are
 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.910
object then as far as our eyes are
concerned it's as if the object isn't

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920
concerned it's as if the object isn't
 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.460
concerned it's as if the object isn't
there because the only way we know about

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470
there because the only way we know about
 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.230
there because the only way we know about
the presence of the object is that is

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:44.240
the presence of the object is that is
 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.090
the presence of the object is that is
when it reflects light and we can see

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100
when it reflects light and we can see
 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.560
when it reflects light and we can see
that light by our eyes so metamaterials

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570
that light by our eyes so metamaterials
 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.830
that light by our eyes so metamaterials
had something called what's called a

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840
had something called what's called a
 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.560
had something called what's called a
negative index of refraction so the

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570
negative index of refraction so the
 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.150
negative index of refraction so the
index of refraction normally is a

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160
index of refraction normally is a
 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.539
index of refraction normally is a
positive quantity and is responsible for

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549
positive quantity and is responsible for
 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.760
positive quantity and is responsible for
like the Mirage effect that you see when

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770
like the Mirage effect that you see when
 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.130
like the Mirage effect that you see when
you're putting a pencil in a glass of

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140
you're putting a pencil in a glass of
 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.230
you're putting a pencil in a glass of
water and look at the interface between

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240
water and look at the interface between
 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.749
water and look at the interface between
air and water the pencil will appear

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759
air and water the pencil will appear
 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.749
air and water the pencil will appear
broken and that's because the light

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759
broken and that's because the light
 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.120
broken and that's because the light
travels faster in air than it does in

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130
travels faster in air than it does in
 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.940
travels faster in air than it does in
water and so the difference in the speed

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950
water and so the difference in the speed
 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.399
water and so the difference in the speed
of light in water creates a bending of

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409
of light in water creates a bending of
 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.940
of light in water creates a bending of
the light rays and so our eye processes

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950
the light rays and so our eye processes
 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.520
the light rays and so our eye processes
that as the pencil appears to be broken

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530
that as the pencil appears to be broken
 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.379
that as the pencil appears to be broken
because of the difference in the speeds

00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:32.389
because of the difference in the speeds
 

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:35.139
because of the difference in the speeds
of the of light in the different medium

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149
of the of light in the different medium
 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.050
of the of light in the different medium
a negative index refraction would bend

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060
a negative index refraction would bend
 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.349
a negative index refraction would bend
the pencil all the way backwards and

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:41.359
the pencil all the way backwards and
 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:45.489
the pencil all the way backwards and
still be broken and for an object that

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:45.499
still be broken and for an object that
 

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:47.109
still be broken and for an object that
was coated in a material that had a

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119
was coated in a material that had a
 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.090
was coated in a material that had a
negative index of refraction these meta

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100
negative index of refraction these meta
 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.779
negative index of refraction these meta
materials the light would Bend around it

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789
materials the light would Bend around it
 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.359
materials the light would Bend around it
but not strike it and bounce towards our

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369
but not strike it and bounce towards our
 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.269
but not strike it and bounce towards our
eyes so the material would appear to be

00:01:58.269 --> 00:01:58.279
eyes so the material would appear to be
 

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:02.800
eyes so the material would appear to be
invisible from our point of view this

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810

as a multitude of wavelengths so we're a
