00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.639
For this video, I’m going to show you how
to take a handful of rubber bands, and make

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:07.299
the worlds simplest, semi-automatic, rubber
band handgun.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.080
I found this cool rubber band shooter at a
sporting goods store, but it comes with a

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.630
heavy price tag. $16 for the gun, and another
$2 for the bag of bands to go with it. We

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.359
can do better than that, so save your money
and let’s make a super simple version, for

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.099
free. Chances are, you already have two of
them on hand.

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.470
To start, you’ll need a bag of assorted
rubber bands like these. The colored ones

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.160
are a bit more fun, and you can usually find
them at the dollar stores.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.320
Now to stalk up on the best rounds of ammunition,
try picking out the thicker bands that are

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.940
as wide as three fingers held together.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.600
When you're to ready load your weapon, simply
hold one end of the bands with your pinky

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.470
finger, then stretch it all the way back,
and around behind your thumb, so you can position

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.040
the other end on the tip of your pointer finger.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.370
Your elastic handgun is loaded, and ready
to fire.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.100
Use your pointer finger to aim at the target,
then simply open your pinky finger to fire the shot off.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.320
Now check this out we still have 2 more fingers,
and that means we can take this idea, to the next level.

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.870
Start by loading a rubber band the same way
you did before, then put 2 more rounds in

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.750
the chamber with a second and third band,
on your fourth and middle fingers.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.430
You’ve just upgraded your weapon to semi-automatic.
With this setup you can fire at multiple targets

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.530
without having to stop and reload after each
shot. And with some practice, your aim can

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.650
get impressively accurate.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.700
Now with a slight variation in your shooting
technique, you can easily switch from semi-automatic,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.130
to shotgun blast. Simply release all your
fingers at the same time to send all the rounds

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.240
flying at once. This method spreads the ammo
out, so you can hit small targets from a distance,

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.670
or pump more power into targets at close range.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.950
Well now you know how to use spare rubber
bands, to make a semi-automatic, elastic blasting

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.200
handgun. So go ahead, and have all the same
rubber shooting fun, while enjoying the savings,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.260
of your 5 finger discount.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.620
Well that’s it for now. If you like this
video, perhaps you’ll like some 
of my others.
