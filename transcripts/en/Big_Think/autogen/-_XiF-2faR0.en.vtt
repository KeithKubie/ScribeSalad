00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.919
I try to make safer drugs every day and

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929
I try to make safer drugs every day and
 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.669
I try to make safer drugs every day and
that I look for the twetos to using

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679
that I look for the twetos to using
 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.460
that I look for the twetos to using
animals and so I have models that live

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470
animals and so I have models that live
 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.609
animals and so I have models that live
in little tissue culture flasks and

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619
in little tissue culture flasks and
 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.519
in little tissue culture flasks and
little organelles that swim around you

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529
little organelles that swim around you
 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.980
little organelles that swim around you
know reagent flasks and then I try to

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990
know reagent flasks and then I try to
 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.339
know reagent flasks and then I try to
model what's reality and try to make

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349
model what's reality and try to make
 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.050
model what's reality and try to make
safer drugs for patients it's actually

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060
safer drugs for patients it's actually
 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.780
safer drugs for patients it's actually
interesting because traditionally safety

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790
interesting because traditionally safety
 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.940
interesting because traditionally safety
is thought to be you know occurring

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950
is thought to be you know occurring
 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.889
is thought to be you know occurring
pretty late in the process and drug

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899
pretty late in the process and drug
 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.410
pretty late in the process and drug
development so you spend years of

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420
development so you spend years of
 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.869
development so you spend years of
defining your target developing

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879
defining your target developing
 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.209
defining your target developing
molecules looking at efficacy and then

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219
molecules looking at efficacy and then
 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.459
molecules looking at efficacy and then
at some point you ask the question oh is

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469
at some point you ask the question oh is
 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.049
at some point you ask the question oh is
it safe to now go into a patient and try

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059
it safe to now go into a patient and try
 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.209
it safe to now go into a patient and try
it out in a trial and so you have to go

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219
it out in a trial and so you have to go
 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.830
it out in a trial and so you have to go
through a rigorous you know safety

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840
through a rigorous you know safety
 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.910
through a rigorous you know safety
testing in the animal and so that's what

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920
testing in the animal and so that's what
 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.310
testing in the animal and so that's what
has traditionally been done and on many

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320
has traditionally been done and on many
 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.560
has traditionally been done and on many
occasions we thought it was safe in the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570
occasions we thought it was safe in the
 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.420
occasions we thought it was safe in the
animal and then later on in the patient

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430
animal and then later on in the patient
 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.460
animal and then later on in the patient
we saw that you know it had liabilities

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470
we saw that you know it had liabilities
 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.859
we saw that you know it had liabilities
anyway so the thought that we have was

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869
anyway so the thought that we have was
 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.350
anyway so the thought that we have was
in Pfizer at least you know a lot of us

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360
in Pfizer at least you know a lot of us
 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.300
in Pfizer at least you know a lot of us
by now as to really start this much much

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310
by now as to really start this much much
 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.520
by now as to really start this much much
earlier so the minute somebody says I

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530
earlier so the minute somebody says I
 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.260
earlier so the minute somebody says I
think this is a good target we start

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270
think this is a good target we start
 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.880
think this is a good target we start
thinking about it you know what do we

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890
thinking about it you know what do we
 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.590
thinking about it you know what do we
know from competitors what do we know

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600
know from competitors what do we know
 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.690
know from competitors what do we know
from the literature can we you know

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700
from the literature can we you know
 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.510
from the literature can we you know
identify possible risks for that target

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520
identify possible risks for that target
 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.420
identify possible risks for that target
or for that chemical series that might

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430
or for that chemical series that might
 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.609
or for that chemical series that might
target it and then we start thinking

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619
target it and then we start thinking
 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.520
target it and then we start thinking
about it and and also designing some

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530
about it and and also designing some
 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.950
about it and and also designing some
experiments around it

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960
 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.020
