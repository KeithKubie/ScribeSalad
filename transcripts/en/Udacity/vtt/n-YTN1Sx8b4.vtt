00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Looking at the two model equations we gave you,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
you can figure out which one belongs to prey population

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and which one to the predator population by considering

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the signs of the various constants in the information that we gave you.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We told you that the prey grows at constant rate of 0.5 per year.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So since population growth is, of course, positive it depends on the population already present,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
we can see that this term Ax(t) should be part of the equation dealing with the prey.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Similarly, we told you that the predators die out.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Similarly, we told you that the predators have a fixed lifespan of five years.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This means that the rate of change of the predator population

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
while the negative component that is also directly proportional to the total population at a given time.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This matches this term right here, -Cy(t).

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Now that we know that x represents predator and y represents prey,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Let's talk about these terms that includes an x*y factor.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
This factor of x*y represents predator times prey

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and this proportional to basically how often individuals of the two species meet.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We know that whenever a predator meets its prey, the situation, as it has been,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
pretty advantageous for the predator but not so great for the prey.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
This was shown in our equations by the fact that this interaction turn

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
in the equation for the rate of change of the predator population has a positive sign in front of it.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Whenever the predator meets its prey, this population can grow,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and opposite is true for the prey population since this interaction will lead to members of the prey dying.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Determining these constants A, B, C, and D should actually remind you of it

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
of dealing with our SIR model problems in Unit 3.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Our coefficients dealing with lifespan and growth rate

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
corresponds to the different time constants that we use from moving people

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and mosquitoes to the infected, recovered, and susceptible populations.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Since we've already matched with the growth rate of the prey population, we can write down A=0.5/year

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
In the same way, since C corresponds to loss in the predator population,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
we can set its value equal to 1 over the predator lifespan or 1/5 years.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
In order to calculate B and D, the other two constants,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
we need to make use of the last piece of information that I gave you.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
That our ocean populations reach an equilibrium situation

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
then there are 5.010⁶ tons of prey and 1.010⁶ tons of predator.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
We do some simple algebraic manipulations of the equations that I showed you above

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and also plug in 0 with the rates of change divided by population showing equilibrium situation.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
We can solve for B and D by simply inputting the values for A and C that we just decided upon.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:35.000
This results in B=5.010⁻⁷, 1/yearton. D=4.010⁻⁸, 1/yearton.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We plugged all four of these values into base values.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
We can move on to the next part of the problem.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
In the function food chain, we implement the forward Euler method

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
using the rates of change that we just figured out using our differential equations.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Of course, you've plugged in prey in the place of x and predator in the place of y.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And finally, we move on to our sensitivity analysis.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
To account for the lower limit values, we make a copy of the base values dictionary

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and multiply each value corresponding to each key by 0.9

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and we do the same thing for the upper limit by multiplying each value by 1.1.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
These lines down here select the most critical parameter based on which parameter

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
has the greatest difference between its high results and its low results.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
However, we can also figure out the most critical parameter

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
by just looking at the plots that we get when we run the program.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Our first plot shows the amount of prey in tons versus time

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and the second shows the amount of predator in tons versus time.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
The colors dictionary which you may have seen throughout the top of the code

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
paired each of the code parameter that we're looking at with a different color.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Remember, we're interested in seeing which of these parameters

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
has the greatest impact on the maximum value of the prey?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So in order to pick out the most critical parameter, we need to compare the maximum amount of prey

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
graphed by the upper and lower curves of either series in this top graph.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
You can see for example that if we look at the yellow curves,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
their maximum values here and here are not really that far apart.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
If we look at every pair of curves that are the same color,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
we can see that this one that is cyan or the light blue has the greatest distance between its peaks.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Looking back at our colors dictionary, we see that cyan or C is paired with D.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Let's look at our final graph again for just a little bit more analysis.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
We can see that both graphs exhibit periodic behavior.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
It looks almost like we have a Cos and Sin function.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Initially, our prey population increases which leads to an increase

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
in the predator population shortly afterward.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
This however leads to a decrease in the prey population and so on and so forth back and forth.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Upon closer inspection, you can see that these are actually not perfect Sin and Cos functions.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
In fact, the Euler method leads to a blow-up of periodic functions overtime.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
We see a very clear example of this explosion of amplitude if we increase the end time and step size.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Let's see what our plot looks like now. This is a very interesting-looking plot.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
We can see that the in the predator population,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
we start with a peak-to-peak height of approximately 60,000 tons

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and after 200 years have passed, we have a peak-to-peak height of approximately 150,000 tons.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
That's a pretty dramatic increase.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
If we use this implicit Euler method instead of the forward Euler method here,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
we could prevent this expansion and amplitude just as we talked about

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
in our earlier problems involving mechanics.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
You can see that many methods prove useful in different situations

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
whether they're dealing with diseases or fish populations or pendulum.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Great job on Unit 4 and get excited for Unit 5. We're going to look at something totally different.

00:05:18.000 --> 99:59:59.999
How anti-lock brake systems work.
