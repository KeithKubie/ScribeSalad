00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.640
A new super-stretchy polymer material from
Stanford University can heal itself at room

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.099
temperature and could lead to self-healing
electronic circuits as well as electronic

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:11.900
skin for prosthetics and robots.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.640
And EPFL scientists have proposed a new model
for understanding how the brain processes

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.689
information.

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:23.490
Suggesting that stimulus is processed unconsciously
and then perceived consciously in 400 millisecond

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.699
intervals called Time Slices.

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:26.699
Vsauce!

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:27.699
Kevin here.

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.900
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.140
Teslaphoresis causes nanowire to remotely
assemble using a force field.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.030
A Tesla coil designed by researchers from
Rice University oscillates positive and negative

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.250
charges in each carbon nanotube which causes
them to chain together.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.760
They created a functioning circuit connecting
two LEDs that is powered by the tesla coil

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.760
field.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.390
It’s the first time electric fields have
been observed moving matter on a large scale

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.230
and they believe this could lead to breakthroughs
in regenerative medicine, and artificial systems

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.449
that can self-assemble without physical contact.

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.870
SkinHaptics uses ultrasound to provide tactile
feedback for interfaces on your hand.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.130
The array emits ultrasound through the back
of the hand to create sensation in a focused

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.510
point of the palm.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.770
The prototype is admittedly large but they’re
already working on a significantly smaller

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.380
version - with the plan one day to implement
this alongside flexible screen technology

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.890
to turn your hand into an interactive electronic
device.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.230
Which could pair quite nicely with ultraflexible
organic photonic skin.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.770
The smart e-skin system, developed at the
University of Tokyo, allows for a two-color

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.960
logo display as well as a red seven-segment
digital display.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.020
Along with being a display that’s one order
magnitude thinner than the epidermal layer

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.620
of skin, the plan is for this to also monitor
health by measuring oxygen levels in the blood.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.490
Challenges to further development include
protecting the e-skin from being destroyed

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.900
and finding a power source like flexible batteries
or the energy from harvesting your body heat.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.610
A neural bypass is allowing a man to retrain
his paralyzed hand.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.959
In 2014, researchers at The Ohio State University
Wexner Medical Center implanted a chip in

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.090
Ian Burkhart’s brain - an algorithm then
translates his thoughts into impulses for

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.430
a sleeve on his arm, bypassing his spinal
cord.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.440
In less than two years of working with and
training the system he’s gone from picking

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.950
up a spoon to playing Guitar Hero and swiping
credit cards.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.730
And they’re confident this system could
help stroke victims as well as differently

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.050
abled people in the future.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.050
We may be one step closer to functional smart-clothes.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.530
Researchers at Ohio State University were
able to embroider circuits into fabric with

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.410
0.1mm precision, a perfect size to incorporate
sensors and memory devices into clothes.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.520
Further development could see smart phone
antennas in shirts, performance-monitoring

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.350
sports equipment, and even bandages that can
tell your doctor how tissue is healing.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.520
The best part is the embroidered wires feel
the same as typical thread.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.430
Mind Blow #43 back in June 2012, featured
Joggobot - a drone designed to accompany joggers

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.730
by using tracking markers on a special t-shirt.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.599
Well Skydio is a new drone that autonomously
follows bikers and joggers while avoiding

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.280
obstacles without requiring special clothing.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.120
It uses a multi-camera array and onboard computing
to map and plan its navigation rather than

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.910
simply reacting to things it might crash into.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.870
While this is just a prototype - their goal
is to bring it to consumers and in their words

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.230
create a “magical experience.”

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.040
Finally, check out this new augmented reality
demo from Magic Leap - this video is shot

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:48.840
through the mixed reality technology.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:04:00.700
I’m gonna leave you with an animation from
NASA on the future of space exploration.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:13.130
And as always - thanks for watching.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:28.020
Fingertip shopping will be one of the many
homemaker's conveniences.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.491
This video console will be channeled into
the store of her choice.

00:04:34.491 --> 00:04:35.491
There, a camera will scan a display of wares
she which will select by push button.

00:04:35.491 --> 00:04:43.020
What the wife selects on her console, will
be paid for by the husband at his counterpart

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.020
console.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.300
All bills and transactions will be carried
out electronically.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.659
Also at his disposal, is an electronic correspondence
machine or home post office.

00:04:53.659 --> 00:05:20.470
Which allows for instant written communication
between individuals anywhere in the world.
