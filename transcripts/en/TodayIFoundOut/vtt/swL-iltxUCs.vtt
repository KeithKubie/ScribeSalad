00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.830
Occurring between 1665 and 1666, the Great
Plague wasn’t exactly the first time London

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.330
had experienced such a terrifying spread of
disease, with periodic cases being reported

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.160
in the city for decades up to this point and,
of course, that time about two-thirds of China’s

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.480
population and then a decade later about half
of Europe’s, including an awful lot of people

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.080
from jolly old England, up and died during
the “Black Death”.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.860
Nevertheless, the Great Plague was certainly
noteworthy.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.780
According to the Bills of Mortality from the
year, in 1665 alone 68,596 deaths occurred

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.420
in London as a result of the plague.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.681
However, it is generally thought that this
number is drastically under-recorded as the

00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:55.860
likes of groups like Quakers did not report
their death tolls and many poor were simply

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.539
dumped in mass graves without their deaths
being recorded.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.899
This latter point is particularly significant
as many of the more affluent city members

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.560
left London when the plague broke out, including
King Charles II and his entourage who left

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.700
the Lord Mayor of London, Sir John Lawrence,
to deal with the plague while the king and

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.410
court retired to Salisbury; they possibly
brought the plague with them in the process,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.810
as it broke out there after they arrived.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.960
Once this happened, the king and court retired
to Oxford to wait it all out.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.590
In the end, somewhere between 25%-50% of the
population of London died as a result of the

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.110
plague during 1665-1666.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.950
With everyone dropping like flies and nobody
knowing what was causing the plague in the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.340
first place, this lead to some interesting
methods of preventing its spreading, as we’ll

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.340
get to in a moment.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.209
So how did it all start?

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:50.000
Well, this was one of the many waves of the
bubonic plague that had been literally plaguing

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.350
much of the developed world for a few centuries
up to this point off and on.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.869
We now know that the plague was generally
transmitted via fleas that carried strains

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.560
of Yersinia pestis microbes they had picked
up via rats.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.340
As for this specific iteration of the plague
around London, the first recorded instance

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.050
was just outside of the city in a parish known
as “St Giles-in-the-Fields” sometime early

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.280
in the spring of 1665.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.690
Soon after this, the number of reported cases
and the death toll rapidly increased until

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.300
it reached its peak in the summer of the same
year, during which thousands of Londoners

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.690
were dying each week.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.420
In fact, the death rates became so severe
that daytime collection of bodies was banned

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.800
as those in charge feared a mass-panic if
people were to see the massive amount of bodies

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.140
being carted off by dead-cart drivers and
dumped into mass graves every day.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.180
(One such mass-grave was found to house 1,114
bodies, being dug down until the grave diggers

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.180
hit the water table at about 25 feet.)

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.520
However, this daytime ban didn’t work out
at all because there were simply too few dead-cart

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.690
operators to keep up with carting away all
the bodies just at night.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.930
As a result, it was common for people to stack
the bodies in the streets, rather than wait

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.319
for a dead-cart driver who had room on his
cart.

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.350
With rotting corpses literally piling up,
the ban on daytime collection was lifted.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.050
As you can imagine from all this, fear ran
rampant and terrified Londoners tried anything

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.470
and everything possible to ward off the disease.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.000
As mentioned, since the actual cause of the
plague was still a mystery at this point,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.020
many of these preventative measures were either
useless or harmful in of themselves.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.490
For instance, it was a common idea back then
that the plague was caused or at least facilitated

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.100
by “bad air”.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.920
As a result, besides bonfires being kept burning
throughout the city at all times by order

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.630
of the authorities and homes also having their
fires going day and night, regardless of outside

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.700
temperature, many took to smoking tobacco
as a way of keeping the air going into their

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.220
lungs free of disease.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.420
This led to a rather surreal situation in
which people of all ages, including children,

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.240
were essentially forced to smoke (or start
smoking if they hadn’t previously).

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.880
For instance, AJ Bell wrote a few decades
after the plague,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.430
For personal disinfections nothing enjoyed
such favour as tobacco; the belief in it was

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.410
widespread, and even children were made to
light up a reaf in pipes.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.440
Thomas Hearnes remembers one Tom Rogers telling
him that when he was a scholar at Eton in

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.919
the year that the great plague raged, all
the boys smoked in school by order, and that

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:27.030
he was never whipped so much in his life as
he was one morning for not smoking.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.660
It was long afterwards a tradition that none
who kept a tobacconist shop in London had

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:32.660
the plague.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.980
(If you think that’s weird, how about the
time when people commonly blew smoke up a

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.560
person’s arse to save them from drowning,
including equipment for the procedure hung

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.900
along major waterways like the River Thames,
much like AEDs are today.)

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.980
Other more sensible preventative measures
included cleaning money in vinegar before

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.190
handing it to a shopkeeper, not letting those
same shopkeepers touch raw food with their

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.150
bare hands and wearing dead toads around your
neck…

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.340
(Not to keep being linky, but there was also
a time when putting frogs in milk was used

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.340
as a way to preserve it, sans refrigeration.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.420
Be glad you live in the 21st century!)

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.010
Another thing that Londoners believed helped
spread the plague was the many stray cats

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:18.040
and dogs that roamed London’s streets; so
much so that an official edict from King Charles

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.520
II stated that “no Swine, Dogs, Cats or
tame Pigeons be permitted to pass up and down

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.720
in
Streets, or from house to house, in places

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.720
Infected.”

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.100
As a result, many thousands of these animals
were killed and promptly buried or burned.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.260
While in some sense they weren’t exactly
wrong on this one (the dogs and cats carried

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.730
fleas that may or may not have been previously
infected with the offending microbes), this

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.810
nonetheless is generally thought to have had
a net effect of helping the plague’s staying

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.370
power as the stray cats and dogs formerly
helped keep the more worrisome rat population

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.910
somewhat in check.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.040
Perhaps the most extreme thing Londoners did
back then to help curb the spread of the disease

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.520
was quarantine any house that had been host
to a plague victim by sealing it shut for

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.520
40 days.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.100
The doors to these houses would be locked
and then marked with a huge red cross, above

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.720
which the words “Lord have mercy upon us”
would be scrawled.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.840
To ensure that nobody escaped, a guard would
also often be posted outside.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.530
Since it was common to seal a house with all
of the occupants still inside, regardless

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.050
of whether they were sick, many Londoners
took to bribing the guards tasked with searching

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.070
homes for signs of the plague to ignore any
such signs in their home, which is one of

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.090
the reasons records from that era are so lax.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.860
When this didn’t work, some resorted to
fleeing their homes and all their possessions

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.690
before their house could be sealed, choosing
to risk living on the street rather than succumb

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.410
to plague or starve to death locked away.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.530
Even when a house was bolted shut and placed
under the watch of a burly guard, there were

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.420
still a number of escape options available
to an enterprising occupant.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.490
One of the more popular and straightforward
escape methods was to simply convince the

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.720
guard to temporarily leave his post, usually
via a bribe.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.810
Some of the more clandestine escape methods
from the time included tunnelling to freedom,

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.690
enlisting the help of friends to poison or
drug the guards and stealthily making a daring

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.980
rooftop escape at night like a plague-ridden
ninja.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.780
Other, less subtle, methods of escape included
punching through the thinnest walls of the

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:21.110
property to the outside world or setting fire
to the building and escaping in the confusion.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:26.030
In at least one case, a man used a makeshift
explosive crafted from fireworks to blow up

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:31.199
his front door as he and his entire family
leapt from a first story window to escape

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:32.390
at the same time.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.100
It turns out, going out the window wasn’t
necessary though.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.820
The blast had killed the guard.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:42.460
Arguably the most ingenious method of escape
was to, essentially, go fishing for guards.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.900
In this method, the occupants of the home
would carefully lower a noose from windows

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:52.479
to settle around the necks of the guards outside
their homes and either drag them upwards to

00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:55.890
their death, or just choke them until they
surrendered their keys.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:59.699
In the event of the former, the guard’s
body would then be discretely disposed of

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:04.420
by wrapping it in a sheet (thereby disguising
it as the body of a plague victim which nobody

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:09.840
would check very closely) and dumping it unceremoniously
into a passing dead-cart.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.480
Amazingly, it’s noted that at least “a
score” of guards (about 20 to you and me)

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.120
were killed in this way by desperate citizens.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.870
Luckily for both citizens and guards, the
worst of the plague passed by the fall of

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:25.990
1666 and absolutely nothing terrible happened
to London ever again…

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:30.250
Unless you want to count the huge fire that
tore through the city just a year later, destroying

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:35.610
approximately 85% of the walled area of the
city, leaving about 65,000 people homeless,

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:40.919
and destroying an awful lot of records concerning
the recent plague, making it difficult to

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:46.279
nail down things like the exact death toll
and how many people were infected but ultimately

00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:47.279
recovered.

00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:50.290
Then, of course, there were all the other
times horrible things happened in London throughout

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:54.550
its very eventful history.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:09:04.350
But who’s counting?
