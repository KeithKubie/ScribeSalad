00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 in this capsule we will see reminder of 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.510
 derivatives of function imagine that we have 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.880
 a f function that take as argument 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.000
 a variable that is a scalar 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.500
 summoned x and imagine that we want 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.630
 have information about our 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.520
 function f specifically of 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.250
 information on how this function 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.519
 love varies if I vary on the x argument 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.949
 ore to get that kind of information 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.500
 when we can use it's the calculation 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.780
 of the derivative of the function of which 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.320
 community drifting and a function f 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.710
 2 x compared to his x argument of two 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.700
 ways either f bonuses of x or sometimes one 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.980
 see there a hood is rather dve 2 x / 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.579
 dx is by definition what that is 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.190
 matches 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.750
 that's the limit when you take a gap 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:59.190
 deltort and that we tend towards zero of f2 ex 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.430
 plus the deviation deltort - f2 x / the value 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.290
 of school and so that's their ratio here 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:11.790
 change of fgx when added 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.920
 delta to the value of x / the value of 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.729
 the gap but when taking the quarters 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.869
 in question and that time to this 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.939
 which is interesting with the steal 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.610
 it is firstly the sign of drift 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.070
 and will actually give me the direction 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.860
 of increasing the function so between 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.229
 others if we have a positive sign for the 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.070
 drift and without meaning that f 2 x is going 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.439
 increase so exactly to the inverted if 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.310
 the negative sign and the xv has rather 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.960
 decreases 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.149
 when we will increase x also the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.310
 absolute value of the drift actually 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.290
 give us the rate of increase where the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.619
 rate of change finally from our 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.110
 function if we change the value of x 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.610
 so the absolute value that is high 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.890
 it means that a tiny change 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.149
 of x will involve big changes 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.790
 in the value of fgx 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.350
 then in absolute drift and who 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.220
 small it means that very little 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.349
 changes of direction barry x in 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.720
 entry now for the rest the 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.490
 notation rather than using so 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.800
 the idea here i'm going to use rather 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.720
 symbolic is the symbol of drift 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.910
 and partial which is more general than the 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.290
 derivative and we will see the drift and leave 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.030
 later donate but all I'm going 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.850
 do it in my notation changed 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:31.040
 use of a six by the symbol of 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.040
 partial debris that looks like this 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.330
 so let's see some first drifts 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.850
 and simple visual defects 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.400
 so if we have a constant to whom 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.630
 regards mankell and the drift and the 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:50.400
 constant compared to xcm now 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:52.200
 drift and 2x to hate or hate and 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.360
 where is a constant of speak no x 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:00.000
 it's going to be nxx to hate neighbors the 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.880
 derby of the function the oc ii x dad and 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.430
 that will match an on x plea 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.660
 high of the potential ex of x will not do x 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:13.320
 it's very simple it's just 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:14.790
 the exponential of excellent enough of that 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.120
 if you want to get derivatives for 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.400
 function compositions one has by 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.680
 example that the derivative of a constant 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.230
 time a function is 6 compared to 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.690
 x it's going to be the constant time drifting 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.660
 and drifting tours and a 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.780
 hate function versus x that 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.769
 will have hate once f 2 x hate 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.850
 monthins times the derivative of the function 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.820
 then of his high debt of the ex 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.489
 potential of a function of x will not do x 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:49.500
 it's going to be the exponential of freaks 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:52.320
 times drift and techs and so 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.660
 similar the derivative of the loch of a 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:59.070
 function of x with respect to x this 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:02.910
 step 1 on f2 x times the drift and of 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.440
 fgx relative to fixed so we notice 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.480
 in fact we basically have the 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.900
 first term which corresponds to the drifts 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.790
 visual but with eve 2 x rather than x 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:17.549
 that we multiply on the right by the drift 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:20.310
 and mtx versus x making 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.200
 some examples then imagine that we 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.480
 be calculated the derivative of the function 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.970
 with what is equal to 3 xx to the map 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.980
 so drift and bishops this is the 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.130
 der veer of three ex arast cap par 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:36.700
 relation to x the der vis of a function of 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:39.610
 x times a constant is the constancy 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.700
 which is three times the function that was 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.730
 the other part of three times and xanaka 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.010
 so there are four and the drift and of 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.620
 mixer to 4 versus x is too much 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.880
 for four times exhales at 3 so we have 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:58.710
 3 x 4 dosing times excellent to you 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.710
 who are our tv of our public service 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:06.310
 then his wish the derby of the function 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:09.490
 of fgx which is the exponential 2 xo because 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.320
 is divided by 3 so we have the dvd rw 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.540
 eaks he derived from the experience there 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.740
 would have divided by three compared to x 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:20.320
 that's going to be equal to using hervé's 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.790
 the ex potential of our function the 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.200
 beginning of the national exhibition is 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.260
 simply the exponential of the 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.730
 function times the derivatives of the function 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.240
 inside that we have to do 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:34.030
 so the der wiel excels at 2/3 by 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.650
 compared to those of his hell this drift 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.290
 is here here so we still 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.830
 the exponentially these excerpts released 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:44.860
 by three times the drift and 2x to the body 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.230
 is divided by 3 so we have explored 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.990
 a constant which is one in three so 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.910
 that's equal to the constant one on 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.650
 three times the drift and a mix at 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.870
 square by appear 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.570
 there is only this part of 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:01.540
 the dlv has completed the square dereliction 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:06.490
 compared to aix and 2 xx so having 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:09.370
 two medupi left xx so the drift 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.770
 of rtx and exponential equal of xo since 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.360
 and divided by three his two-thirds for 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.070
 exponential election because is 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.070
 divided by 3 white 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.440
 now for combinations of 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.900
 function of the compositions functions a 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:29.460
 little more complex we have that drift and 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:31.740
 of two functions of xj dxy h2x by 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.380
 ratio to an x6 simply the sum of 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:38.100
 hervé so the sum of the hervé of 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:41.160
 gdx in relation to aix plus the derbi of 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:43.830
 gdx by paris now the derivative of the 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:47.070
 product of two functions dxg of 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.960
 the exploit h2x it's going to be drifting and of 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:52.590
 league lodgings will be done by x times the 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.150
 function h2x plus function gdx times 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:58.910
 the drift and axes of the experts 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:07:03.090
 devices and finally the drift and of 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:06.450
 generix / hdx so the function ratio 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:13.260
 it's going to be the derivatives of the numerator j2x 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:18.330
 compared to xx 1 / hdx - j2x from 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:26.400
 departure hdx squared times drift and 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:28.830
 h2x compared to x for example so 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.720
 imagine that we are the function xx 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:35.010
 the exponential dx is our function 

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:37.530
 public then drift and f2 xperia 

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:40.770
 x1 but we'll pretend it was 

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:42.990
 our explicit gide was neutral h2x 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:46.200
 in the formula we had previously 

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:49.470
 we will see the drift and 2x in relation to 

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:51.900
 xp the exponential x + x times the duration 

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:54.150
 from the nancy expo the bike experts the 

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.160
 derbi two experts in paris xi 1 so we 

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.630
 at the exponential 2x simply here 

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:02.790
 predicts reliving the experience and 

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:04.830
 to excel differential of xxx times 

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:06.750
 the elite experience then the drift and of 

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:08.730
 exponential xp of x this is 

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:13.170
 the experience of the ex more expo 

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:14.370
 the exponential dx were doing another 

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:16.530
 example 

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:21.090
 so let's not imagine the function f 2 x 

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:23.280
 which is exponential of x / x so in 

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:26.370
 this case we can use the formula 

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:28.980
 we saw where we had a gdx function 

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:31.020
 that experiential Israel 2 x / one 

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.760
 hdx function which in this case would be 

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.190
 simply 

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:37.340
 x in this case if the formula tells us that 

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:39.440
 the drift and 2f of the exp report x that's 

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:43.490
 the drift and gdx so the experience 

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:48.890
 yale 2 x by ben xx 1 on our 

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:51.740
 function h2x chi x - j2x that he is 

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:55.100
 possible to x / hdx squared which would 

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:58.160
 x squared times drift and h2x so 

00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:00.050
 the video x versus x the derivative of 

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:04.190
 yen experience 2 x is the experience 

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:06.980
 of x the empty dice extra excess 1 so 

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:08.690
 we only have drift and fgx 

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:11.750
 report to x and the derby of the experts at 

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:14.600
 paris xe - experience her talking 

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:17.900
 the d926 pro bike is the feat 

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:24.080
 that of an expert / x - the experience and 

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:26.240
 the x / x in case we could have drifted 

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.100
 this result in another way that 

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.440
 will actually give the same result 

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.600
 so it's an alternative derivation 

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:40.450
 could have seen this here as being in 

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:44.870
 do j 2 xx 1 h2x where I have extracts 

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:49.160
 the exponential 2x as before but h2x 

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:50.360
 it would rather be an x ​​and as we go 

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.900
 to see that gives exactly the same 

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.840
 result 

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.700
 that is to say that we have evoked the rule 

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.160
 for the function product whose 

00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:00.440
 lifetime ex compared to x it's going 

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.420
 to be the derivative of the ldx experiment by 

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:06.710
 report to xxx 

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:08.630
 my function h2x qe1 on x plus the 

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:10.520
 jdx function which is exponential of x 

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:13.190
 times the der wiel and hdx which in this case 

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:15.320
 here and one on x that we will end here 

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:17.660
 that it appears to live the experience 

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:21.680
 of an exponential exponential explorer 

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:25.610
 of xx 1 on x so / x the drift is 

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:27.830
 of 1 on x so one on aix actually 

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:31.760
 can advance as the ex partial exploit 

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:36.860
 during x at the - la dvi two excellent 

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:40.040
 - hours would be less x at least in 

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:44.889
 less so minus two which is equal to 

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:47.920
 damask - hours on x squared 

00:10:44.889 --> 00:10:50.049
 then we would have that here we do not rattle 

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:53.139
 exponential of x times the hervé of a 

00:10:50.049 --> 00:10:55.089
 on exqi and - hours on aix because and so 

00:10:53.139 --> 00:10:58.269
 we will divide by mitsou square 

00:10:55.089 --> 00:11:00.339
 we would have before 1 - which appears 

00:10:58.269 --> 00:11:02.669
 ok so that's another way of arriving 

00:11:00.339 --> 00:11:05.739
 to the same result 

00:11:02.669 --> 00:11:08.619
 so to make the relations of a 

00:11:05.739 --> 00:11:10.989
 data function it's normal to have 

00:11:08.619 --> 00:11:14.249
 different animations but they 

00:11:10.989 --> 00:11:14.249
 should arrive at the same result
