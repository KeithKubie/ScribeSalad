00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.500
We have 4,5000 equals 3
thousands plus how many

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.600
hundreds, question
mark hundreds?

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.240
So let's write this
left-hand side,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.823
but I'm going to
write it out in terms

00:00:10.823 --> 00:00:11.917
of thousands and hundreds.

00:00:11.917 --> 00:00:13.500
So I'll write the
thousands in orange.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.225
So this is equal to
4 thousands, which

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:22.580
is the same thing as just 4,000,
plus 500, which you could also

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.060
view as 5 hundreds.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.930
So this is the left-hand side.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.560
Now let's look at
the right-hand side.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.460
We have 3 thousands.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.470
So it's 3 thousands.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.220
Now let's not even
look at this right now.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.594
Let's just think
about what do we

00:00:36.594 --> 00:00:38.597
have to add to this
right-hand side

00:00:38.597 --> 00:00:40.180
in order to get the
same thing that we

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.210
have on the left-hand side?

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.480
Well, if you compare
the 3,000 and the 4,000,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.310
you see you have an
extra 1,000 over here.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.770
So let's add an extra
1,000 on the right.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.480
So we're going to
add one extra 1,000.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.710
And now we just have
3,000 plus 1,000.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.870
This makes it the 4,000.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.030
But then, of course, we
also need another 500.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.170
So we're going to need
plus a 500 right over here.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.280
So in order for these
two things to be equal,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:24.520
we need to say 4,000 plus 500
is equal to 3,000 plus 1,500.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.280
Now, the way they've set
this up, we need to express--

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.960
so it almost looks the same.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.040
On the left-hand
side, this is 4,500.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.850
So this right over here, this
is the same thing as 4,500.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.980
This is this right over here.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.420
And on the right-hand
side, we have 3 thousands.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.860
So that's this right over here.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.450
That's the 3 thousands.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.130
And then we just need to
express this as hundreds.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.464
So 1,500, this is the
same thing as 15 hundreds.

00:01:52.464 --> 00:01:53.630
So let's rewrite everything.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.087
We can rewrite this
as saying 4,500,

00:01:57.087 --> 00:01:59.670
just to get the exact same form
that they wrote it over there.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:11.300
So we could write 4,500 is
equal to 3 thousands plus-- now

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.310
we have to just write
this in terms of hundreds.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.810
Well,

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.540
This is 15 hundreds.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.720
Literally, if you
took 15 times 100,

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.270
it's going to be equal to 1,500.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:28.250
So this could be viewed as 15
hundreds, so plus 15 hundreds.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.331
So in this situation, the
question mark is equal to 15.
