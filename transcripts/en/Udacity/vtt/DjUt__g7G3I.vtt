00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.580
Having this information, being able to

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.300
know this information up front, right when,

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.520
at the beginning of your pregnancy early on, is that something that's important

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.820
to you in the process? Was that something you were happy to know

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.220
about, or do you wish you kind of, couldn't find out maybe until later?

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.329
&gt;&gt; I'm going to skirt that a little bit and I'm going to

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.110
talk about it in third person because it's such a personal choice.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.590
&gt;&gt; Sure. I'm going to tell you that I have

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.040
friends that have fallen into all of these different categories.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.110
I have one friend that buried three babies in

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.485
five years because they kept coming up with that

00:00:31.485 --> 00:00:34.730
25% chance. I have one friend who has two

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.710
average size children. So they came up with that

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.730
25, the other 25% twice. and I have friends

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.490
that have said, oh, we'll never get pregnant, because

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.300
we don't want a dwarf child. We went through

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.430
so much ourselves, we would never want that for our,

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.800
our child. I have friends that say, I'm scared

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.140
to death of having an average sized child, which I

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.570
don't understand because I teach high school. You know,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.110
that is not a big deal, and I have these

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.300
great friends in LA, whose son, as I just

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.090
told you, is 6 foot 4. so, you know, this,

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.230
this choice that we are now given, or the

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.930
access to this technology, maybe. Is, is very, very powerful.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.540
I'm going to tell you a quick story. We, we had a regional conference in Los

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.720
Angeles about a year ago. Three women all in their 20s all kind

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.440
of grew up together by default. I mean not necessarily in the same town.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.140
But because they're been Little People of

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.570
America members all of their lives. All pregnant.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.990
Now, they all have had the testing. One of them did not want to have the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.550
testing, for religious reasons. But far along

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.210
into the pregnancy decided, I don't want to go

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.820
through baby showers, I don't want to decorate

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.720
a nursery, unless, there's a reason to. So

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.290
it's not going to change anything about the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.110
pregnancy. I'm going to go through the pregnancy but

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.670
I need to know. And so she knew she

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.250
was carrying a double dominant. And there she was with

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.970
a smile on her face with the other two

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.220
women. One of whom had already buried a double dominant

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.190
and was on her second try and knew that,

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.340
that one, I believe was going to be average size. And

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.380
then the third young woman knew that she was having

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.050
a heterozygous dwarf and there they were all happy and

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.730
talking, and I just, the strength that the girl had that knew that she had

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.680
a double dominant inside of her, was just amazing. It gets a little bit

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.920
more sad, so, the baby lived a few hours. They waited the three months that they

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:55.160
were told to wait. They got pregnant again. And again, had a double dominant.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.860
And, and kept it. And that's their own choice, and

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.480
aren't we lucky in this country that we have choices.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.650
&gt;&gt; Right. Knowing everything you know now as yourself and with the

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.090
current technologies even maybe thinking about

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.170
the possible advances in technologies that

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.350
we'll have in the future in your lifetime or even possibly, you

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.640
know, beyond that, would you change, would you choose to be different?

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.370
And sort of as a variation of that, you know if you could choose this for your

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.409
children how, would you?

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:38.020
&gt;&gt; I think, like my, my first answer is we call

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.380
it the magic pill. You know if you had been able

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.750
to take the magic pill to not be a dwarf. And

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.740
I think my response to that magic pill would have been

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.190
different depending on what decade of my life you were

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.270
asking about. I would most likely have taken that magic pill

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.890
in middle school and probably high school. prior to that

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.440
I don't think I really cared. I was just a kid.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.070
I've never faced out right discrimination in my

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.270
job at Hunts. So I think that magic

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.580
pill may have been between middle and high

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.970
school, but after that you kind of get awfully

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.120
comfortable in your skin. Is do you think it's harder to be born disabled or to

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.320
become disabled later on in your life. And

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.480
the people that are really on it and thinking

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.220
have actually, it blows my mind when they

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.270
give me the answer that I'm looking for.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.990
Which is this. Most definitely it's harder to

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.020
become disabled because something has been taken away from

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.120
you. With the exception perhaps of being blind

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.450
or deaf. Because if you become blind later

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.490
in life you, you know what things look

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.560
like. So you can reference that when you can

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.490
no longer see them. If you become deaf later in life, you've learned how to

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.860
talk. You can talk. And I just, I just want to kiss em when they give me

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.910
that answer. because they truly are thinking about it. And so when I think about

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.500
our soldiers that come home disabled I really

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.760
feel for them. Especially soldiers who were big,

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:24.980
strong. Buff guys and gals and they no longer are. And

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:30.190
that, and I feel for them. And I'm so proud of them when they turn that around

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.390
and they become the wounded warriors or

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.530
the wheelchair rugby teams or something that

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.830
they're putting that, energy and they're channeling

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.230
it into a different realm, a positive realm.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.820
&gt;&gt; What,

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:44.880
what do you say to people who

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.360
have their own struggles and particularly with your

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.930
perspective, how would you tell them to, to

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.550
what's the best way to handle their struggle?

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.215
&gt;&gt; This is probably trademarked, but it does get better.

00:05:59.215 --> 00:06:00.687
[LAUGH]

00:06:00.687 --> 00:06:03.636
It's a catchy phrase.
