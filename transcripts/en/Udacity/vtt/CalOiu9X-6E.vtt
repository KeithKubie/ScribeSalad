We need a number greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10 in this box. So I'm

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:09.929
going to use 1.6. I know large numbers have positive powers of 10. So I know

00:00:09.941 --> 00:00:15.099
there needs to be a positive number in this box. When I think about changing 1.6

00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:19.952
into 16 million, I know the decimal place needs to move 7 places to the right.

00:00:20.062 --> 00:00:21.491
So I have 1.6 times 10 to the 7th.
