00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.335
- [Voiceover] In this video,
we're going to be talking about

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:06.072
using the small x approximation to solve

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:09.312
equilibrium problems when Kc is large.

00:00:09.312 --> 00:00:14.047
And by large, I mean
that Kc is greater than

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:17.244
or approximately equal
to 10 to the fourth.

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:22.155
So we have another video
before this that talks about

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:26.392
using the small x approximation
for when Kc is small,

00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:28.561
and I would say that's probably
a simpler place to start

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:31.164
if this is the first
time you're seeing it.

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:33.533
And in this video, we'll be talking about

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.535
the opposite situation.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.504
As we talked about in the previous video,

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:41.174
the steps for solving this
kind of problem are fourfold.

00:00:42.064 --> 00:00:44.624
So there are four steps.

00:00:44.624 --> 00:00:49.582
The first step is to assume
that the reaction goes 100%

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:51.584
in the favored direction.

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:55.221
So the favored direction
when K is really large

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.882
is that means we're going
all the way to products.

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:04.214
We're assuming we have almost
no starting materials left.

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:08.201
The second step is to set up an ICE table.

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:10.403
And then to solve for x in our ICE table,

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:14.441
assuming that x is small,
hence small x approximation.

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:17.577
And then the last and possibly
the most important step

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:19.218
is to check our answer.

00:01:19.218 --> 00:01:21.815
So make sure that the size
of x is actually small

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:24.250
compared to what we said
it was smaller than,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.353
and also to make sure that
it gives us the right answer

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:30.123
when we plug it back in to calculate Kc.

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:32.759
In this video, we're going to
go through an example problem.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.724
The example is the reaction of

00:01:37.611 --> 00:01:42.434
NO gas reacting with

00:01:42.434 --> 00:01:47.307
chlorine gas to make

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:52.307
2NOCl gas.

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:56.478
And this particular reaction has a K value

00:01:56.478 --> 00:02:01.294
that is equal to 6.25 times 10

00:02:01.294 --> 00:02:03.177
to the fourth.

00:02:03.177 --> 00:02:06.326
So that is indeed on the
order of 10 to the fourth,

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:10.448
so we should be able to use
the small x approximation.

00:02:10.448 --> 00:02:12.932
We're going to do it two ways.

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:15.195
So we're gonna set up our ICE table,

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:21.302
and we know the initial
concentrations are 2.0 molar

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:25.545
for NO, and 2.0 molar for Cl2.

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:29.048
And we have no NOCl at the beginning.

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:32.986
So if we are setting up an
ICE table as we normally did,

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:36.356
we would say, "Okay,
we'll, we're going to make

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:38.858
"some amount of NOCl."

00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:42.695
So we'll just say minus 2x for our NO

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:47.365
since for every one Cl2 we use up,

00:02:47.365 --> 00:02:51.894
we'll use up 2NO, which means
we'll have minus x for Cl2,

00:02:51.894 --> 00:02:56.635
and we'll make 2x molar
concentration of our product.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.913
And in the end, once we reach equilibrium,

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:02.949
we'll have to 2.0 molar minus 2x,

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:06.152
and we just get that by adding
the initial concentration

00:03:06.152 --> 00:03:08.154
with the change.

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:13.154
In the same way, we get 2.0
molar minus x for chlorine gas.

00:03:13.893 --> 00:03:17.830
And for a product, we just
get 2x at equilibrium.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.334
Let's look back at our original
steps that we talked about

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:23.525
at the very beginning of this video.

00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:28.608
We just made an ICE
table, so that's step two.

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:31.778
Did we assume that the
reaction goes to 100%

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:34.452
in our favored direction?

00:03:34.452 --> 00:03:35.682
It turns out we didn't.

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:39.319
We actually skipped step
one to set up our ICE table

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.474
in what seems like a pretty natural way.

00:03:42.474 --> 00:03:44.057
And it turns out that's not good.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:47.299
So we'll see what happens
when we skip step one

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:48.834
and keep going.

00:03:49.696 --> 00:03:53.299
So if we keep going, we can solve for x,

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.455
assuming x is small, and we'll get for

00:03:58.471 --> 00:04:00.506
our equilibrium expression,

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:05.478
we get Kc is equal to 2x squared

00:04:05.478 --> 00:04:10.012
divided by 2.0 molar

00:04:10.012 --> 00:04:13.646
minus x, which our Cl2 concentration,

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:18.591
and multiply that by 2.0 molar minus 2x,

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:21.861
and that's all squared since
we have that stoichiometric

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:24.097
coefficient of two in front.

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:26.099
Just to point out, we already started

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.101
with a balanced reaction,
that's pretty important,

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:31.137
or else our Kc expression would be wrong.

00:04:31.137 --> 00:04:34.398
So make sure everything is
balanced before you get started.

00:04:35.274 --> 00:04:38.344
So we've written our expression for Kc,

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:42.081
and now we are going
to erroneously assume,

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:43.680
we're just going to be
like, "Oh, I don't care."

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.049
(chuckles)
"I'm just going to assume

00:04:45.049 --> 00:04:46.152
"x is small.

00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:47.963
"I don't care if that's a
good assumption at all."

00:04:47.963 --> 00:04:51.090
So if x is small, what
we're really seeing is x

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.279
is a lot smaller than
two molar, here and here.

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:57.463
So we're really seeing 2x is
a lot smaller than two molar.

00:04:57.463 --> 00:05:00.833
So we're seeing this is
approximately equal to

00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:04.671
2x squared divided by

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:06.194
2.0 molar.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.142
Since x is a lot smaller than two molar,

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.210
we'll just ignore it entirely,

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.813
and x is a lot smaller than 2x,

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:16.783
or sorry, x is a lot
smaller than 2.0 molar

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:18.785
even if you multiply x by two,

00:05:18.785 --> 00:05:22.076
so this is going to be 2.0 molar squared.

00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:28.928
And so if we multiply this out,
we get that this is equal to

00:05:28.928 --> 00:05:32.532
x squared over

00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:37.370
this two squared is
canceled out by this two,

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.040
so we actually get x
squared over two is equal to

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.310
our Kc, which is 6.25

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.795
times 10 to the fourth.

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:50.083
So that's what we get for x squared.

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:53.524
So if we multiply both sides by two,

00:05:53.524 --> 00:05:56.547
we get that x squared is equal to

00:05:56.547 --> 00:06:00.893
1.25 times 10 to the fifth,

00:06:00.893 --> 00:06:05.298
which means x is equal to
the square root of that,

00:06:05.298 --> 00:06:07.075
which is 354.

00:06:08.186 --> 00:06:09.936
So this is where...

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:10.903
Well, okay.

00:06:10.903 --> 00:06:13.206
So we've gone through steps two and three,

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:15.174
and now we're going to check our answer.

00:06:15.174 --> 00:06:18.157
We're going to see if
our answer makes sense.

00:06:18.157 --> 00:06:21.983
So we're saying that the
change in concentration here

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:24.884
is 354.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:28.988
That clearly doesn't make sense
because it actually gives us

00:06:28.988 --> 00:06:31.290
a negative concentration here.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.294
So we're getting negative
concentrations for NO

00:06:35.294 --> 00:06:37.463
and Cl2, so that's bad.

00:06:37.463 --> 00:06:38.564
So that doesn't make sense.

00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:42.802
The other thing is that
this already tells us

00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:44.804
that our assumption was really bad.

00:06:44.804 --> 00:06:47.573
We assumed to solve our equation for Kc.

00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:50.235
We assumed that K is a
lot smaller than two,

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:53.513
or sorry, we assumed that x
is a lot smaller than two,

00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:57.450
but then we got that x is 350,
which is clearly not smaller

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:58.451
than two.

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:02.655
So it looks like skipping
step one was bad.

00:07:02.655 --> 00:07:04.891
So let's give this another try.

00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:06.588
Try number two.

00:07:06.588 --> 00:07:08.461
What was step one?

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:12.064
Step one says assume
the reaction goes 100%

00:07:12.064 --> 00:07:14.467
in the favored direction.

00:07:14.467 --> 00:07:18.704
And since Kc is really large
for this particular problem,

00:07:18.704 --> 00:07:23.176
we're saying it's going
all the way to products.

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:26.179
What this basically means
is that we're gonna set up

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:28.447
our ICE table again,

00:07:28.447 --> 00:07:31.150
except that this time,
our initial concentrations

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.920
are going to be assuming that

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.115
our reaction already went
all the way to products.

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:41.527
And we can figure that out,

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:43.596
we can figure out those
initial concentrations

00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:45.565
using stoichiometry.

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:49.692
So in the beginning, we
started out with two molar NO

00:07:49.692 --> 00:07:52.238
and two molar Cl2,

00:07:52.238 --> 00:07:56.375
and we know that the NO and
Cl2 react in a 2:1 ratio.

00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:59.145
So since we have the same
amount of both of these,

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:00.963
our limiting reactant

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:04.739
will be the NO.

00:08:06.252 --> 00:08:08.254
And so that will get used up completely

00:08:08.254 --> 00:08:10.256
when we get to equilibrium.

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:13.593
So that means if we assume
that it goes all the way to

00:08:13.593 --> 00:08:18.064
products, we'll have zero molar NO left,

00:08:18.064 --> 00:08:22.034
and will make 2.0 molar of our product.

00:08:22.034 --> 00:08:26.005
And since we had our Cl2 in excess,

00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:29.508
we'll use one molar of it
to react with two molar

00:08:29.508 --> 00:08:32.359
of our NO, and we'll
have one molar left over.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.450
So this is the special step
where we actually followed

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.267
step one and assumed

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:47.649
we got 100% of product.

00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:51.697
And the reason why we made this assumption

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:54.333
was because we know
that K is really large.

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:58.004
So we know that at equilibrium,
we should have all product

00:08:58.004 --> 00:08:59.639
or mostly product.

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:01.641
So now let's go through the other steps.

00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:04.043
We assume that it's going to all product,

00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:06.112
but we're not quite at equilibrium.

00:09:06.112 --> 00:09:10.483
So if we're going to
equilibrium, that means we assume

00:09:10.483 --> 00:09:14.453
that we'll see a little
bit of NO at equilibrium,

00:09:14.453 --> 00:09:17.283
so that'll actually be plus 2x.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:21.894
And we'll expect to see
a little bit more Cl2

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:22.895
at equilibrium.

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:25.807
So that'll be plus x because
of the stoichiometry,

00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:31.732
and that would give us
minus 2x for the NOCl.

00:09:32.004 --> 00:09:34.707
We expect a little of
this to get used up to go

00:09:34.707 --> 00:09:36.709
in the reverse reaction.

00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:39.045
So then if we add everything
together from the initial

00:09:39.045 --> 00:09:42.836
and change, then we get 2x

00:09:42.836 --> 00:09:45.684
for our NO concentration,

00:09:45.684 --> 00:09:48.087
we get x for our Cl2 concentration,

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:52.141
and we get 2.0 minus 2x

00:09:52.141 --> 00:09:54.882
for our product concentration.

00:09:57.863 --> 00:09:59.952
So far, so good.

00:10:01.792 --> 00:10:05.004
So now we're going to set up

00:10:05.004 --> 00:10:08.007
our Kc expression just like we did before.

00:10:08.007 --> 00:10:11.811
So Kc is still equal to 6.25

00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:14.280
times 10 to the fourth,

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.772
and this is equal to the
concentration of NOCl squared.

00:10:19.618 --> 00:10:24.123
So that is 2.0 minus 2x squared

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:27.159
divided by 2x squared,

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:30.596
which is our concentration
of NO squared times x.

00:10:30.596 --> 00:10:32.631
Oh, oops, I made a mistake.

00:10:32.631 --> 00:10:36.802
This is actually 1.0 plus x, sorry.

00:10:36.802 --> 00:10:40.006
So this should be x plus 1.0 molar.

00:10:41.574 --> 00:10:44.443
So that is our full expression for Kc

00:10:44.443 --> 00:10:49.091
using our equilibrium concentrations,

00:10:49.091 --> 00:10:52.469
and we have made zero approximations of R.

00:10:53.586 --> 00:10:56.022
But now we're gonna
assume that we can assume,

00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:57.120
(chuckles)
now we're gonna assume

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:57.952
that x is small.

00:10:57.952 --> 00:10:59.688
We're gonna assume that assume.

00:10:59.688 --> 00:11:02.017
So if x is small, what
we really mean is that x

00:11:02.017 --> 00:11:05.031
is a lot smaller than one molar.

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:08.501
And we're also saying it's a
lot smaller than two molar.

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:12.438
So then we're saying that our
numerator is approximately

00:11:12.438 --> 00:11:15.408
equal to 2.0 molar squared,

00:11:15.408 --> 00:11:17.410
because we're saying that this is small.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.179
I'm gonna make this an
approximately equal sign.

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:22.882
The 2x squared stays the same.

00:11:22.882 --> 00:11:25.918
Since we're assuming x is
a lot more than 1.0 molar,

00:11:25.918 --> 00:11:27.820
this just becomes 1.0 molar.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:32.681
So now if we multiply this
all out, we get that four

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:38.130
divided by 4x squared

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.099
is equal to Kc,

00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:42.168
and the fours cancel out.

00:11:42.168 --> 00:11:46.005
So x squared is equal to one over Kc,

00:11:46.005 --> 00:11:49.762
or 6.25 times 10 to the fourth.

00:11:51.143 --> 00:11:53.145
And then if we take the square
root of both sides here,

00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:56.415
we get that x is equal to, let's see,

00:11:56.415 --> 00:11:59.685
we get x is equal to 4.0 times 10

00:11:59.685 --> 00:12:02.588
to the minus three molar.

00:12:02.588 --> 00:12:05.925
So this is where common sense is needed

00:12:05.925 --> 00:12:09.328
to make sure that, well,

00:12:09.328 --> 00:12:11.330
everything worked this time around.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.332
So first of all, we can ask ourselves,

00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:15.935
"Okay, is this x actually a
lot smaller than the numbers

00:12:15.935 --> 00:12:17.903
"we said it was smaller than?"

00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:21.207
So now we're comparing x to one,

00:12:21.207 --> 00:12:23.776
which, it's about three
orders of magnitude smaller.

00:12:23.776 --> 00:12:24.743
So that's good.

00:12:24.743 --> 00:12:27.980
And we can also compare 2x to two.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.216
And again, it's about three
orders of magnitude smaller.

00:12:30.216 --> 00:12:31.684
So, so far, so good.

00:12:31.684 --> 00:12:34.920
But our final test will
be to plug it back in

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.580
our Kc expression.

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:41.127
So if we plug in our
value of x, we get that Kc

00:12:41.127 --> 00:12:42.962
is equal to 2.0 molar

00:12:42.962 --> 00:12:47.166
minus two times 4.0

00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:51.670
times 10 to the minus
three molar, all squared,

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:56.308
divided by two times 4.0

00:12:56.308 --> 00:13:00.127
times 10 to the minus three molar,

00:13:00.127 --> 00:13:02.314
and that's also squared, four,

00:13:02.314 --> 00:13:06.452
and that's the NO
concentration at equilibrium.

00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:10.222
And then the last part
is our Cl2 concentration,

00:13:10.222 --> 00:13:15.222
which is 4.0 times 10
to the minus three molar

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:18.017
plus 1.0 molar.

00:13:19.498 --> 00:13:23.636
And so if we multiply that all
out, what you get is that Kc

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:28.199
is equal to 6.23 times 10 to the fourth.

00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:31.844
And so we can compare
that to the value of Kc

00:13:31.844 --> 00:13:33.846
we started out our problem with,

00:13:33.846 --> 00:13:34.847
which is, let's see.

00:13:34.847 --> 00:13:37.616
It is 6.25 times 10 to the fourth.

00:13:37.616 --> 00:13:39.718
And this is actually pretty good.

00:13:39.718 --> 00:13:42.288
We did make an approximation,
so our answer isn't

00:13:42.288 --> 00:13:43.289
exactly right.

00:13:43.289 --> 00:13:44.356
But it's pretty close.

00:13:44.356 --> 00:13:46.358
And so if we wanted to get it even closer,

00:13:46.358 --> 00:13:48.761
there are other methods we could use.

00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:52.131
But for most purposes, this is actually,

00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:55.034
this tells us that our
approximation was good.

00:13:55.034 --> 00:13:58.971
So we can see that when
Kc is really large,

00:13:58.971 --> 00:14:01.941
what we need to do is assume that we have

00:14:01.941 --> 00:14:04.577
100% product when we're
setting up our ICE table,

00:14:04.577 --> 00:14:07.613
and that'll help us safely
assume that x is small.
