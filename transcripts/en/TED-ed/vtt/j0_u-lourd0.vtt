00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Think about how your favorite stories hook you.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
"When he was nearly 13, my brother Jim

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
got his arm badly broken at the elbow.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
When it healed, and Jim's fears of never being able to play football

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
were assuaged, he was seldom self conscious about his injury."

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
"All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
are pretty much true. One guy I knew really was shot

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
in Dresden for taking a teapot that wasn't his."

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
"My father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
or more explicit than 'Pip.'

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip."

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Imagery, intrigue, emotion: each introduction makes you want to read more.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
If you have an assignment to write a literary analysis,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
your introduction will be just as important.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
There will be four elements in your essay:

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
your introduction,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
thesis statement,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
analysis and conclusion.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
If you begin writing a literary analysis with the introduction,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
you may be discouraged.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Here's a tip for writing a great introduction:

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Write it last,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and write your thesis first.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Figure out what you want to analyze before you actually analyze it.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Your thesis is the foundation for the rest of your essay,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
including your introduction.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So how do you find your thesis?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Start by asking questions.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
To Charles Dickens you may ask,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
"why do you draw attention to characters' hands?"

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
"What's up with their names?"

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
"Pumblechook? Really?"

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
To narrow your concept for analysis, answer the questions yourself.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000
"Estella ridicules Pip's hands, Jaggers constantly washes his hands,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Pip insufferably burns his hands,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Mrs. Joe brings Pip up by hand."

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Are there patterns in your answers?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
"Estella's comments smack of cruelty,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
while Jaggers' cleanses his immoral conscience.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Pip finds a second chance,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
while Mrs. Joe abuses a child under the guise of love and dedication."

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
What can you analyze with this pattern?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
"Hands symbolize social class inequities,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and through Dickens' criticism, he exposes the dire need for reform

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
in Victorian London.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
What you will do next, which is an entirely different lesson,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
is to draft and revise your analysis.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Only after you write your analysis,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
return to your introduction.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Like authors earlier,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
try to intrigue and inspire your reader.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Avoid starting with famous quotations,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
dictionary definitions

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
or rhetorical questions.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Consider the historical context of your topic,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
or an anecdote or some larger idea or concept.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Here's an example:

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000
"27 bones in the hand and wrist allow humans to concurrently create

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and destroy. Thousands of hands have been behind history's astounding creations.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Hands represent a powerful symbol,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000
one that was not lost on Charles Dickens.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
In Great Expectations, Dickens uses hands

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
to symbolize social class inequities,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and through his criticism, he exposes the dire need for social reform

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
in Victorian London."

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Take time crafting and revising your thesis and introduction.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Remember, if you are bored while writing,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
your reader will be bored while reading.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
By the way, did you notice the introduction to this lesson?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
It didn't start with "here's how to write a thesis and introduction."

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Would that have hooked you?
