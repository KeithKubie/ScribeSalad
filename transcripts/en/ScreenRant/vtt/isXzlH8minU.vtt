00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.890
Creating new technology is one of the fundamentals
of Disney’s animation department that keeps

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:08.890
them flourishing.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.509
It’s important to embrace technology so
you are ahead of the curve and this knowledge

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.910
is typically known as movie magic.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.410
Movie magic helps make a scene come to life
or character more lifelike to the viewer.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.990
This magic keeps the audience engrossed in
the film and let’s them forget they are

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.000
watching a movie.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.369
Here is Screen Rant’s list of ten Disney
Animation Movie Magic Secrets.

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.290
Make sure to stick around to the end to hear
how an everyday office product saved Disney’s

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.290
animation department.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.870
Sulley’s Fur in Monsters, Inc.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.920
The lovable blue, scarer Sulley was one of
Disney’s most ambitious characters created

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.030
back in 2001.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:50.830
His had over 2.3 million individual strands
of fur, to be exact 2,320,413 strands of fur.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.840
This made the render times lengthy for the
animators at Disney.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.700
They would spend 11 to 12 hours just to export
a single frame when Sulley was on screen.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.350
With films requiring 24 frames per second
that is a minimum of 11 days per second of

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.350
film.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.890
That’s a lot of overtime for the animators.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.049
Toy Soldiers Walk in Toy Story

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.600
Bringing toys to life was a magical treat
for kids and grownups alike in 1995’s Toy

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.600
Story.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.100
The animators knew they had to make the toys
appear real and worked hard to create this

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.369
enchanted world.

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.939
The characters that the animators hard a hardest
time formulating a look realistic look for,

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.060
were the toy soldiers because of their walk.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.450
They animators could not get the appropriate
walk down so they nailed shoes to plywood

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.240
and filmed people walking around the studio.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.299
400 Plus Skellington Heads in The Nightmare
Before Christmas

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.149
The Nightmare Before Christmas is the first
stop-motion animated feature to be entirely

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.530
converted to 3D by Disney in 2006.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.179
Still in 1993 they had to make Jack Skellington
flawless on screen, which involved a painstakingly

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:55.670
long process.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.170
One minute of film took an entire week to
capture and they designed over 400 distinctly

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.880
different heads for the facial features of
Jack Skellington.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:11.390
That’s more heads than emotions we can think
of.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.990
Unique Characters in Wreck-It-Ralph

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.390
To bring the arcade world to life, Disney’s
animators had a task that Cecil B. DeMille

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.760
would be proud of.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.460
Wreck-It-Ralph had the largest cast of unique
characters created for this 2012 animated

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.460
film.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.350
That is over double the amount of unique characters
that are normally animated for a Disney film,

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.970
for example Tangled only had 64 unique characters.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.160
Luckily for the animators some of these characters
were only from 8-bit games.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160
Curley Hair in Brave

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.260
Claudia Chung, the simulation supervisor for
Brave stated that, “Curly hair defies physics

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.110
in the way it moves and behaves."

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.240
That is why it took them years to develop
the film, Brave and Merida’s hair started

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.740
out as a series of springs on a computer.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.340
It took the animators almost three years to
get her hair perfect and 2 months were spent

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:05.430
on the scene where Merida removes her hood
and reveals a full volume of hair.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.510
Sound FX in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.620
At the time Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
was released Jimmy MacDonald was the head

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.150
of Disney’s sound department.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.450
He was the inventor of numerous contraptions
to achieve expressive sounds for characters

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.990
like Casey Jr., the circus train engine from
Dumbo and Evinrude the dragonfly from The

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.990
Rescuers.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.480
Despite the numerous Sound FX he created for
Snow White, it was Roy O. Disney that used

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:37.330
his wallet to create the sound of the floor
creaking with Dopey's slow footsteps.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.150
Snow in Frozen

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.630
Even though other animated films have had
snow in them Frozen’s filmmakers knew they

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.290
had to take it to a new level.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.960
Disney’s animators of Frozen consulted scientific
experts about the precise physical properties

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.320
of snowflakes.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.550
The animators and special effects team were
even sent to Cheyenne, Wyoming to walk through

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.480
snowdrifts to see how snow reacted to movement.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.110
Their work paid off and made it possible for
Olaf to be a much loved character.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.180
Xerography in 101 Dalmatians

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.040
In 1959 Walt Disney was urged to close down
his animation department and focus on TV production

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.040
instead.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.540
He disagreed and looked for new technology
to save his dire animation department while

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.950
making the film 101 Dalmatians.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.740
The technology that saved his beloved department
was what is commonly known as Xerox today.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.830
Before Xerox each cell would have to be hand-inked
and that took many hours, but with Xerography

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.400
all they had to do was make a Xexox copy.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.530
Computer Animation Production System in The
Little Mermaid

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.330
Today Computer Animation Production Systems
or CAPS is widely used in animated film productions.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.340
This process was the beginning of a digital
ink and paint program used to digitally color

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.590
films in post-production.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.509
1989 CAPS was tested on a scene in The Little
Mermaid, it was used to color the rainbow

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:51.090
that was across the sky.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.800
Since it was successful, Disney decided to
use this process in 1990 with The Rescuers

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.800
Down Under.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.840
The rest is animation history.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.469
Rapunzel's Hair in Tangled

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:09.660
It seems that if you want to reach new heights
of technology in a Disney animated film, make

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.740
the character’s hair complicated.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.960
The algorithm that manages the way Rapunzel’s
hair moves is based on similar algorithms

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.969
for cloth.

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:21.189
At the end of the "When Will My Life Begin"
montage you can see this algorithm in motion

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:23.520
as she tosses her hair around in a spiral.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.099
The hair almost looks like ribbon being flung
around her room and makes for a beautiful

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:29.099
scene.

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:30.139
