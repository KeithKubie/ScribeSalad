the effects of technology on our social
connectedness is interesting because

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.200
connectedness is interesting because
 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.680
connectedness is interesting because
it's neither bringing us together nor

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:16.690
it's neither bringing us together nor
 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.190
it's neither bringing us together nor
separating us alone there was a study

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.200
separating us alone there was a study
 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.740
separating us alone there was a study
done about 15 years ago where

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750

individuals were given access to the

Internet

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230
Internet
 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.490

and what they found was that access to

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.259
and what they found was that access to
the Internet increased feelings of

the Internet increased feelings of
 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.140
the Internet increased feelings of
loneliness it didn't decrease now the

reason that happened was because people

research has suggested is that if one
