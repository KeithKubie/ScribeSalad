00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.000
When you buy a US
Treasury security,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.770
you're essentially giving a loan
to the US federal government.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.290
And just as an example here,
I have a US Treasury security,

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.420
in which it says that the
owner of this piece of paper

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.340
will be paid $1,000 in one year.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.057
So if you buy this
from the Treasury--

00:00:19.057 --> 00:00:20.890
or maybe you're buying
it from someone else,

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.570
but let's just say that the
government is issuing them

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:30.080
right now-- let's say
you buy it for $950,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.320
and the government will give you
this security right over here.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.950
Now fast forward one year.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.080
You're holding this
security, and what happens?

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.040
So you know, all that
stuff is written there.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.174
What happens a year later?

00:00:46.174 --> 00:00:47.840
Well, written on the
security-- and I've

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.580
simplified it just
for this example--

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.670
it says the holder of the
security will get $1,000.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.770
So at this point,
the US government

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:03.232
has to give you $1,000.

00:01:03.232 --> 00:01:04.940
So when you look at
just the money flows,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.940
it's pretty clear that
you just lent them money.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.740
You gave them $950 now,
and then a year later they

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.957
give you $1,000.

00:01:12.957 --> 00:01:14.540
And if you wanted
to put this in terms

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.581
that you normally associate
with borrowing money,

00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:19.030
in terms of how much
interest did you get?

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.250
Well, you lent $950,
and you got back $1,000.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.500
So let's think about this way.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.960
Let's get a calculator out.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:36.830
So 1,000 divided by 950 is
equal to 1.05-- and just

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.090
to round it-- 1.053.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.090
So you got 1.053-- or
105.3%-- of your money back.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.230
So let me put it this way.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:54.865
So this is 105.3% of money
lent, of money given,

00:01:54.865 --> 00:01:56.780
of money given to
the government.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.110
Or another way to think about
it is, you got a 5.3% interest--

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.570
or you lent your money out at
an annual interest of 5.3%.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.820
You got your money back, plus
you've got 5.3% after one year.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.510
So you could imagine, if
all of a sudden many people

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.030
want to buy this
government security,

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.820
and now the price goes up.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.720
Instead of being $950, let's
imagine that it is now $980.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.710
What is the implicit yield that
the person would now get on it?

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.310
Well, we get the
calculator back out here.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.410
So you're going to
get $1,000, and if you

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.296
paid in $980 instead of
$950, then a year later when

00:02:40.296 --> 00:02:41.920
you get the $1,000
back, that will only

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.470
be 102% of your money.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.750
So in that situation it
would be 102% of your money.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.070
So with the $950 price,
you're essentially

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.370
lending the government
money at 5.3%, and at $980

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.870
you're lending the
government money at 2%.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.520
And I'm doing this
to show you a point.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.160
When the price of
the treasury security

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.230
goes up, as happened in
this case, the yield--

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.130
the interest-- that you're
getting on your loan goes down.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.200
Because in either
situation you're

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.320
going to just get $1,000 back.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.180
If you lend $980
and get $1,000 back,

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.930
you're only getting
2% on your money.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.737
If you lend $950 and get
$1,000 back, you get 5.3%.

00:03:25.737 --> 00:03:27.320
And so this is what
people are talking

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.450
about when they say if
treasury prices go up then

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.870
the yield goes down.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.950
So if there's more
demand for treasuries

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.647
the interest rate on
treasuries will go down.

00:03:40.647 --> 00:03:42.230
In the next video
we'll talk about how

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.700
this might change for treasuries
of different maturity dates.
