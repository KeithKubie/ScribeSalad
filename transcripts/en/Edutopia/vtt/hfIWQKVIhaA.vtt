00:00:05.896 --> 00:00:10.126
&gt;&gt;Peggy: Usually by starting with an
authentic problem in the community,

00:00:10.126 --> 00:00:13.676
or in the neighborhood, you anchor
the unit with a driving question.

00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:17.606
So students are given this question,
for example, "What's in our water?

00:00:17.606 --> 00:00:18.526
And how did it get there?"

00:00:18.946 --> 00:00:21.606
And then the students
choose different paths

00:00:22.016 --> 00:00:23.516
to explore that question.

00:00:25.346 --> 00:00:28.796
&gt;&gt;Sheela: Start to examine what's
happening in your local community.

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.666
What are some problems?

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:31.986
What are some needs?

00:00:32.106 --> 00:00:37.486
Who are people that you can connect
with, that perhaps can offer insight

00:00:37.486 --> 00:00:40.546
into a need or an opportunity?

00:00:41.596 --> 00:00:46.776
Very often when you are able to bring
in a person or a group of people,

00:00:46.776 --> 00:00:51.506
or a representative to a
community issue, a community need,

00:00:52.416 --> 00:00:53.776
it becomes very real for kids.

00:00:54.196 --> 00:00:55.956
&gt;&gt;Lisa: It's knowing people.

00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:58.916
And knowing that the teachers
in your building know people.

00:00:59.156 --> 00:01:02.236
So reaching out, sending out a
mass email, "Hey, does anybody know

00:01:02.236 --> 00:01:04.006
in the community that works on this?"

00:01:04.436 --> 00:01:06.476
And then just being very persistent.

00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:07.596
Emailing, calling.

00:01:07.596 --> 00:01:10.176
A lot of the experts
that we had only came

00:01:10.176 --> 00:01:12.036
because I wouldn't
stop emailing them.

00:01:13.626 --> 00:01:15.826
&gt;&gt;Sheela: We find that
the best way is

00:01:15.926 --> 00:01:18.436
to take the kids out
into the community.

00:01:18.756 --> 00:01:22.856
If that's not possible, then
make an invitation to who

00:01:22.856 --> 00:01:25.546
from that organization can
come into your classroom?

00:01:26.246 --> 00:01:31.136
If that's not feasible, we have done
really well with using technology

00:01:31.596 --> 00:01:37.126
as a means of connecting with people
who may not be able to find a way

00:01:37.126 --> 00:01:40.006
to come into the classroom, to the
school or for us to get to them.

00:01:40.316 --> 00:01:44.796
So we found some powerful experiences
through Skype, through email,

00:01:45.026 --> 00:01:47.656
through telephone conferences.

00:01:48.406 --> 00:01:52.946
&gt;&gt;Peggy: Once you're aware of
this type of approach to teaching,

00:01:53.426 --> 00:01:55.466
it's like you have
little antenna out.

00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:57.856
And you start to look
around, and you see things

00:01:57.856 --> 00:01:59.576
that could easily make
a good driving question.

00:01:59.806 --> 00:02:01.376
You might see something
in the newspaper.

00:02:01.756 --> 00:02:04.166
You might see something from a movie.

00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:09.106
Or you hear a conversation,
and that is a great way

00:02:09.106 --> 00:02:11.426
to start a problem in your classroom.

00:02:11.576 --> 00:02:14.666
So usually these questions are
really all around us, it's just kind

00:02:14.666 --> 00:02:17.106
of paying attention to the
things people are talking about.
