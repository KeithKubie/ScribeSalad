00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.820
 Well, Brady, we'll talk about the number of particles in the universe 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.860
 We will calculate the number of particles in the visible universe 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.680
 So this is, as you know, the part of the universe that we can see 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.260
 Where light can be reached from us 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.840
 What particles are we talking about here? 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.700
 So we will be interested in the particles that are particles that we are aware of 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.980
 Which is essential, we are interested in which has a block 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.660
 So, we're not talking about photons, for example 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.560
 What we are going to talk about is things like quarks, electrons, and things 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.455
 So quarks, of course, will live within protons and neutrons 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.760
 The electrons will be in orbit around those protons and neutrons in the atoms 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.740
 Pretty much everything else is unimportant 

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:45.045
 How do we do this? So we will use four units of data 

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:47.300
 Part of which would be cosmological data 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.000
 Data from the Blanc satellite, which measures cosmic microwave radiation 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.080
 Scientists call it the radiation left by the Big Bang 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.595
 As you know, it's the radiation you get when the first type of neutral atoms starts to form 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.300
 So, we'll use data from that 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.960
 We will use a little bit of particle physics data, as well 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.700
 So these are the four parts of the information that we will use 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.640
 So the first of these elements is the critical density of the universe 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.100
 So this is a good measure of what energy density is in the universe 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.440
 This is because we know that the universe is very close to being spatially flat 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.585
 So it's not a ball or a horse 

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:27.520
 It's somewhere between the two 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.740
 Because of this, we know that its density is very close 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.035
 Of the critical density, which is actually an actual density in fact 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.600
 If you look at it, compare it with water density 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.440
 Water density is one gram per cubic centimeter 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.040
 This is a million million million times less, right? 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.455
 So, it's pretty cool, right? Because this is the universe we are talking about 

00:01:49.455 --> 00:01:52.325
 The next part of the information we will need 

00:01:52.325 --> 00:01:54.975
 Represents a fraction of the budget of that energy in the universe 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.740
 Stored in barions. Now, why are barions? 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.075
 Well, the barions, in this context, are just 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.320
 Protons and neutrons, is the place where quarks live 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.240
 The other thing the size of the universe can be observed. Again, the data coming from Blanc 

00:02:08.765 --> 00:02:11.645
 We get this number from about 10 to twenty-eight centimeters 

00:02:11.645 --> 00:02:14.100
 One with twenty-eight zeros thereafter 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.140
 So, many centimeters, but the universe is big, right? 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.720
 Brady: "Why is it in the centimeter? 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.700
 Well, you put it in the centimeter, because it was a centimeter, and I do not want to start 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.260
 All my modules are corrupted. So I thought it was safe to keep a bunch of units there 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.560
 The last thing is that I will need a proton block 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.080
 The barions we are concerned with are protons and neutrons 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.800
 They have the same mass, very close, you know, the cluster is largely identical 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.160
 Thus the mass of the proton is ten to minus twenty-four grams, approx 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.600
 These are the four things we will need to work, as you know 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.835
 How many particles are in the universe 

00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:49.915
 So, let's start, we will determine the number of barions in the universe 

00:02:49.915 --> 00:02:53.015
 In other words, how many protons and neutrons, in total, are there 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.680
 The first thing we will do to calculate that is that we will say 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.000
 What is the energy density stored in barions? 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.800
 Or stored in protons and neutrons? 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.920
 Well, that's just a part of the barions 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.400
 Fold the total density. This gives us the energy density stored in the barions 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.860
 Want to know the total energy, so the total mass stored in the barium 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.760
 We need to double the size of the universe 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.340
 But we know how big the universe is, right? 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.620
 They are given through this radius. If the size is the size of the ball 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.600
 Only for this radius, which is four, pi to three, and then radius 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.980
 This gives us the total energy stored in the barions 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.720
 Well, these barions, as we said, are essentially protons and neutrons, essentially the same mass 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.960
 Therefore if you want to know the number of existing barions 

00:03:39.305 --> 00:03:42.365
 We just divide the block on one barion, okay? 

00:03:42.365 --> 00:03:44.940
 So we divide the proton block 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.200
 This gives us the number of barions 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.400
 That's not what we want, no. So we want to know the number of particles 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.420
 So we must think about how to distribute those particles 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.620
 Now, one thing we know is that the universe, on average 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.340
 Electrically neutral, okay? 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.020
 Thus, the number of positive points of the stock balances the number of negative charges. 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.320
 For our purpose, this means that the number of protons will balance the number of electrons 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.440
 The other part of the information we can use is 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.600
 We know where these baryons are stored 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.760
 Well, we know that 75% of them are stored in hydrogen atoms 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.200
 And 25% in helium atoms. There are other atoms as well, but they are not important 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.560
 Brady: "Not us" 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.580
 Yes, not to us, but in the broader scheme of things, it does not matter 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.880
 By and large, the vast majority of them are up to 75% in hydrogen and 25% in helium 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.640
 This is where all this is stored 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.660
 We know that by looking at distant clouds 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.240
 As we also know from one of the great triumphs of cosmology, nuclear synthesis 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.480
 So, given this information, suppose we took a sample of four atoms 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.160
 We know that three of these atoms will become hydrogen, and one of them will become helium, right? 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.920
 Well, the hydrogen atom consists of a proton and one electron 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.860
 These three contain three protons and three electrons 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.500
 The helium atom contains two protons, two neutrons, and two electrons 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.740
 Thus, now, well, we can divide this, because each of these protons contains three quarks 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.440
 Each neutron contains three quarks. So exactly how many particles 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.700
 Which we get from these four atoms? Twenty-six serious 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.140
 How many barons did we need to get these twenty-six particles? 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.400
 Well, we have three protons 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.840
 Two other protons, and two neutrons, and those seven baryons, okay? 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.480
 So we get twenty-seven of seven bariums 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.180
 So we know how many barions in total 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.615
 We know of every seven barions we get twenty-six grams 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.880
 So if we want the total number of particles 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.620
 We only need to double this number by twenty-six to seven 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.760
 So we do just plug in all the numbers 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.680
 You'll get 3.28 times, then Ramzaleshri, from ten to eighty 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.015
 This is the number of particles present in the universe 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.420
 Sounds like many are not you? 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.520
 Ten to eighty, like this one with eighty zeros, that's a big number, right? 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.740
 But in fact, the universe is a big place, this is about one particle per cubic meter 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.880
 It is hardly anything, is it? But of course, as you know, most of the space 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.440
 Is an empty space 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.780
 Brady: "This is not one atom per cubic meter, this is one particle" 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.420
 One particle per cubic meter, yes, exactly 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.520
 So, the other wonderful thing you think is that you can ask 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.260
 How many particles are in the normal human body? 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.060
 Well, we know that the human body contains two-thirds of hydrogen, about a quarter of oxygen 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.200
 So during all of our information, you can figure out the number of particles 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.860
 In the human body, about 1.46 times from ten to twenty-nine 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.480
 Well so they seem to number a lot of particles 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.340
 But of course not that number in the whole universe, right? 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.315
 So how many people will they need 

00:06:44.315 --> 00:06:46.815
 To use all particles in the whole universe? 

00:06:47.395 --> 00:06:49.995
 Well, of course, you only take the proportion of those, of these two, right? 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.920
 So you need 2.25 times ten to one fifty people 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.480
 To use all particles in the universe 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.500
 So, there are about 7.5 billion people alive today, are not they? 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:07.140
 The current population growth rate is about 1.11 percent annually 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.220
 So I think it would be interesting to know how long it will take for us 

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:17.300
 Given this growth rate, for us to use all the particles in the universe, right? 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.440
 So that we can do so 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.900
 If we take the population when they use all the particles 

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.040
 This number is divided, so this is the population that corresponds to this number 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.360
 Divided by the population now 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.620
 Which is about 7.5 billion 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.500
 P is now 7.5 times ten to nine 

00:07:35.505 --> 00:07:38.895
 And then this is linked, through exponential 

00:07:39.445 --> 00:07:42.885
 To R growth rate of 1.11 per cent per year 

00:07:42.925 --> 00:07:45.705
 1.11 percent annually 

00:07:45.705 --> 00:07:48.300
 I can plug in all these numbers, and I can rearrange this equation 

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.855
 I get one T on the logarithm P in P length now 

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.760
 So I'm just plugging in the numbers, and it turns out we'll have to exhaust them 

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.440
 Population continues to grow at the same rate 

00:07:59.445 --> 00:08:02.715
 We will consume all particles in the universe 

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.060
 In humans 

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.680
 In the years 8604 

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.940
 Which is not so much 

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.400
 Brady: "I thought it would be ..." 

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.740
 I know, it's amazing. This is exponential 

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.360
 Brady: "We will forget the use of fossil fuels, and we will use all the particles." 

00:08:22.365 --> 00:08:25.625
 We talk about the deep influence on the planet, the effect on the universe, right? 

00:08:25.625 --> 00:08:28.665
 Population growth, that is. In less than ten thousand years 

00:08:28.665 --> 00:08:31.635
 We will use and continue to grow at the same rate 

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.420
 We will consume all the particles of the universe, in the form of humans 

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.860
 Sure, this will happen beforehand, right? 

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:43.360
 Well, we may have only 8604 years here in the universe 

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.360
