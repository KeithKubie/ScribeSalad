00:00:07.131 --> 00:00:12.633
A pungent blend of onions, cheese,
and cat urine with hints of...

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:15.611
is that…wet goat?

00:00:15.611 --> 00:00:18.051
Most of us don’t need more than one whiff

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:24.823
to identify that generally unpleasant, 
characteristic smell we call body odor.

00:00:24.823 --> 00:00:27.511
But it’s a surprisingly complex phenomenon

00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:32.523
influenced by our genetic makeup, 
age, diet, and hygiene.

00:00:32.523 --> 00:00:34.552
So what is this odor, exactly?

00:00:34.552 --> 00:00:35.681
Where does it come from?

00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:38.247
And can we do anything about it?

00:00:38.247 --> 00:00:42.263
To start, you just need two things 
to produce that familiar scent:

00:00:42.263 --> 00:00:44.381
your armpit’s own secretions

00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:47.230
and the bacteria that feed on them.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.920
Most people associate 
body odor with sweat,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.362
and it’s an important piece of the puzzle.

00:00:52.362 --> 00:00:57.031
Your body has millions of sweat glands, 
and they come in two major types:

00:00:57.031 --> 00:01:00.102
eccrine glands are found 
all over your skin

00:01:00.102 --> 00:01:03.151
and secrete mainly water and salt.

00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:07.192
Apocrine glands, on the other hand, 
develop at puberty in your armpits

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:09.292
and a few other places on your body.

00:01:09.292 --> 00:01:13.531
The sweat they secrete 
is full of proteins and fats.

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:17.644
By themselves, 
these secretions are usually odorless.

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:19.983
That’s where bacteria come in.

00:01:19.983 --> 00:01:25.350
Every square centimeter of our bodies 
is covered with thousands of bacteria.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.975
Many microorganisms thrive 
in moist environments, like our armpits.

00:01:29.975 --> 00:01:34.412
There, you can find about a million 
bacteria per square centimeter,

00:01:34.412 --> 00:01:38.003
one of the highest concentrations 
anywhere on the skin.

00:01:38.003 --> 00:01:43.513
Lurking in this throng of microorganisms 
are species of Corynebacteria,

00:01:43.513 --> 00:01:45.042
Staphylococci,

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:46.452
Micrococci,

00:01:46.452 --> 00:01:47.693
and others.

00:01:47.693 --> 00:01:52.355
When these bacteria feed on the proteins 
and fats in apocrine sweat,

00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:57.872
they turn the odorless compounds into
new ones that can smell very unpleasant.

00:01:57.872 --> 00:02:02.232
Some of the worst offenders may be 
sulfur-containing chemicals;

00:02:02.232 --> 00:02:05.823
those give body odor its oniony aroma.

00:02:05.823 --> 00:02:10.780
Carboxylic acids are in the mix, too, 
adding notes of cheese.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.972
These molecules waft up from the armpit 
and can be sucked directly into our noses,

00:02:15.972 --> 00:02:20.803
where they’re trapped and detected 
by an array of specialized receptors.

00:02:20.803 --> 00:02:22.852
Those can recognize odor molecules

00:02:22.852 --> 00:02:26.863
at concentrations 
of less than one in a million.

00:02:26.863 --> 00:02:30.690
So what determines how strong 
your body odor might be?

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.621
It depends on the resident microbial
populations in your armpit,

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:38.283
and the nutrients that 
your glands provide them with.

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:41.462
Your genes help determine 
what compounds you produce,

00:02:41.462 --> 00:02:42.732
and in what quantity,

00:02:42.732 --> 00:02:45.922
so everyone has a slightly different set.

00:02:45.922 --> 00:02:49.822
In fact, a gene variant that virtually 
eliminates body odor

00:02:49.822 --> 00:02:53.030
is common in people of East Asian descent.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.403
Adrenaline increases the ratio 
of apocrine to eccrine sweat,

00:02:58.403 --> 00:03:02.052
so body odor can be more intense
when you’re nervous.

00:03:02.052 --> 00:03:07.332
Bacterial composition and concentration 
also varies between individuals

00:03:07.332 --> 00:03:08.933
and plays a part.

00:03:08.933 --> 00:03:13.422
Even what you eat can have 
a small effect on how you smell.

00:03:13.422 --> 00:03:16.433
So how can we deal with body odor?

00:03:16.433 --> 00:03:21.402
Washing the armpits with soap and water 
helps but won’t remove all the bacteria

00:03:21.402 --> 00:03:25.542
since many are buried 
in deeper layers of the skin.

00:03:25.542 --> 00:03:31.632
Deodorants, however, inhibit bacterial 
activity and mask odors at the same time.

00:03:31.632 --> 00:03:36.742
Antiperspirants work by forming tiny
gel plugs that block sweat glands,

00:03:36.742 --> 00:03:38.932
drying out the armpits.

00:03:38.932 --> 00:03:43.523
While we continue to battle body odor, 
scientists are trying to understand it.

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:44.952
We don’t know why the brain

00:03:44.952 --> 00:03:48.930
often interprets these particular 
odors as off-putting.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.733
But some researchers have proposed 
that secretions from the armpit

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:55.512
could have a positive function, too,

00:03:55.512 --> 00:03:57.182
like cementing social bonds

00:03:57.182 --> 00:04:00.193
and providing a means 
of chemical communication.

00:04:00.193 --> 00:04:02.892
We don’t know yet if that’s the case.

00:04:02.892 --> 00:04:05.664
For now, body odor seems to be

00:04:05.664 --> 00:04:09.050
just another smelly part 
of the human condition.
