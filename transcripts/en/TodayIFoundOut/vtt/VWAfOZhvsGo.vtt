00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.540
Why Do We Call Crazy People a "Basket Cases"?

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.830
At first, “basket case” didn’t mean
someone who was crazy.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.400
Instead, it referred to someone who had a
physical disability.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.000
The phrase has its origins in World War I.
Funny enough, one of the earliest known documented

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.590
instances of the phrase was actually in denial
that “basket cases” actually existed,

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.120
as found in a bulletin issued in March of
1919 on behalf of the United States Surgeon

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.120
General:

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.790
The Surgeon General of the Army… denies…that
there is any foundation for the stories that

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.180
have been circulated…of the existence of
basket cases in our hospitals.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.470
But just what was the Surgeon General referring
to when he said “basket case”?

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.010
When this bulletin came out, many newspapers
felt the need to define the phrase for their

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.690
audiences, so apparently the phrase wasn’t
widely used at this point.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.510
They defined it as “a soldier who has lost
both arms and legs and therefore must be carried

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.640
in a basket.”

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.960
(The Syracuse Herald, March of 1919)

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.850
Whether they were literally carried around
in baskets as the newspapers stated or the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.869
phrase originally was just referencing the
then common colloquial idea of associating

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.999
baskets with beggars or helplessness, given
the grisly nature of the First World War and

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:23.329
anecdotal reports, it seems plausible enough
that there probably were at least some “basket

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.200
cases,” despite the Surgeon General’s
denial.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.189
As you can imagine, the original meaning of
“basket case” was never incredibly common.

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.549
It wasn’t until World War II that the phrase
prominently resurfaced.

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:39.560
Near the end of the war in May of 1944, once
again, the Surgeon General attempted to deny

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.319
that there were any basket cases:

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:46.429
…there is nothing to rumors of so-called
‘basket cases’—cases of men with both

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.170
arms and legs amputated.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.209
After World War II, the original meaning fell
out of favor altogether, likely due to the

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:54.639
lack of literal basket cases.

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:59.090
However, for a while the phrase expanded to
mean someone with a physical disability who

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.450
was unable to get around by themselves easily.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.569
Today, of course, it has further evolved to
mostly be a slang phrase for someone with

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:10.090
a mental disability, or someone who seems
to have been moved to act in a crazy fashion

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:21.350
for 
whatever reason.
