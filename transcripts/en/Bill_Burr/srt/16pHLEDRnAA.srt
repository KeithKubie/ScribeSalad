1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:01,430
Okay.

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:02,270
Hey, what's going on?

3
00:00:02,271 --> 00:00:06,890
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the
Monday morning podcast for my gay Monday,

4
00:00:06,891 --> 00:00:11,390
July 25th, 2016 what's going on?

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,310
How? What's going on? Um,

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,550
the final Monday in July
of 2016 and a old freckles.

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,110
Ol Billy red beard. Oh,

8
00:00:24,111 --> 00:00:27,770
fucking belly fat face. Fucking
trying to get the weight off. Can,

9
00:00:27,771 --> 00:00:30,230
I'm trying to get the weight off.
Working out during the day, eating great,

10
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:33,050
having a beer at night, fucking
lose everything that he worked for.

11
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:38,030
It's fucking ridiculous. It's ridiculous
what one beer does. And I just,

12
00:00:38,031 --> 00:00:38,661
I gotta do it.

13
00:00:38,661 --> 00:00:42,560
I got a bunch of beers left over from
the fucking 4th of July that taken up all

14
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:47,400
this space in my fridge and I'm
not going to throw him out. I mean,

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,050
there's children that work in the
Budweiser factory that fucking, you know,

16
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,303
okay.

17
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,460
They sleep on piles of Hay, right?
They pay him 29 cents a month.

18
00:00:58,461 --> 00:01:00,260
I don't know if that's
true. Maybe it's hops.

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,560
I don't know what they sleep on now.
There's no people. There's no children.

20
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,880
There's no children working at
Budweiser. That's bad paint, man.

21
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,880
It wouldn't invest in Budweiser. There
was children there under just go, go.

22
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,840
Give me a couple of birdwatchers.
We had protection issues.

23
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,310
Um, my wife's on steroids. What Marie?

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,510
He blew out his shoulder.
Mike [inaudible].

25
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,930
Toshi at human growth hormone. Thrasher,

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,270
I'm going to show you about that
before. Put my balls on somebody's head.

27
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:36,730
I'm sorry. I believe in
anonym in a great mood. Um,

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,460
yeah, so I've got these fucking, I
got all these bears in my fridge.

29
00:01:39,461 --> 00:01:41,350
What am I gonna what am I, what the
fuck am I supposed to do with them?

30
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,150
I can't throw them out. I got Boddingtons,

31
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:48,010
I got some millis so I just
have like one a night, right?

32
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:52,120
And then I have a home pour of
fucking whiskey. That's all she wrote.

33
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,990
That's all she wrote. I barely
even get buzzed off of that too.

34
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,210
When I wake up the next day
and I f I just feel like shit.

35
00:01:58,211 --> 00:02:01,660
I don't know why I keep doing
it. It's a habit I have to break.

36
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:04,720
I am a w I am a one and
a half drink alcoholic.

37
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,440
I have to have one and a half drinks
and get a little buzzed every night.

38
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:14,690
I want to go to a fucking AA meeting and
say like, that's my problem. You know,

39
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:19,040
I'll never forget when I started going
off the rails when I, uh, I would have,

40
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,970
I'd have one m mellow
light tall in a can. And,

41
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,280
uh, then I'd have a home
pour of a whiskey and a,

42
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,540
of course after I finished that,

43
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:34,541
I would just stop and I'd go to sleep
and the next day I'd wake up and I'd be

44
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:38,960
totally functional and I'd
go to work. But I, you know,

45
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,300
I'd definitely be a little
grouchy. And, uh, that's my story.

46
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,593
Yeah.

47
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,480
Okay. Thank you for sharing.

48
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,120
Next guy comes up.

49
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,570
My uncle raped me with a
12 pack when I was five.

50
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,120
Right. They'd throw me out of
there. They'd be walking up,

51
00:03:00,121 --> 00:03:01,650
put down him donuts.

52
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,290
I don't know why they all have
southern accents in my world.

53
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,850
Everyone in AA is from the south.

54
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,090
You know why they never got over the war.
They're still fighting it down there.

55
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,790
South's going to rise again and do what?

56
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,340
You're gonna succeed from the Union.

57
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,510
You're going to get old stonewall
Jackson, junior, junior, junior, Julia,

58
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,520
to come back and take over for you.
You know what I say to that? I say,

59
00:03:26,521 --> 00:03:30,300
good luck dye. Say Good
fucking, you know, do it.

60
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,100
Just know this.

61
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,850
You can't have Florida and if you
can't have Florida and you can't go to

62
00:03:35,851 --> 00:03:38,250
California, where are you
going to take your kids?

63
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,673
Huh?

64
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,150
Well, they say I,

65
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,960
you know when they did fucking sitting
there watching your confederate TV,

66
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,233
right?

67
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,430
And it's a small world comes on,

68
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,160
which is even more apropos,

69
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,000
whatever the fuck you say it because
you just like nine fucking states down

70
00:03:57,001 --> 00:04:01,890
there. Whatever the hell you are,
right? It's a small world after all.

71
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,340
And they're like, you want it? What
do they call fathers down in a,

72
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,690
what are the, what do they
call did it? The GM dad. Oh,

73
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:13,670
I want to go to Disney world. You can't
because you seceded from the union.

74
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,010
You can't go to Disney land and
you can't go to his fucking world.

75
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,070
You know what? You can go Talladega.

76
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,810
You can go see the Winston Cup series.
They got a water slide out there.

77
00:04:27,811 --> 00:04:30,820
I don't think they do.
They've got a bunch of adults.

78
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,540
Skip it around and fucking outfits
that scare children. They do not.

79
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,210
So let me tell you something fucking
there. Mason diction, Mason and Dixon.

80
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,770
Why don't you think twice?

81
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,840
Think about everything you're going to
lose out on a few seceded from the Union,

82
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,170
Huh? No more Disneyland.
No More Disney world

83
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:53,641
sea worlds down there.

84
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:56,490
You don't get to see those fucking
fish that don't want to be there. Yeah,

85
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,990
I love that. People think like fish,

86
00:04:57,991 --> 00:05:01,320
like don't give a fuck that
they're in the tank. You know?

87
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:07,130
Just because they don't have an ability
to speak to us that therefore that means

88
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:08,790
they have to have fine with it.

89
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,140
We treat fish like immigrants. You know
the fish is fucking looking at you.

90
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,870
You just like right English. You
got a problem with that tank.

91
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:27,560
Spit it out. Fucking sit
there staring at me. Yeah,

92
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:32,530
I was on the side of you fucking
scaly head. Be happy I didn't eat you.

93
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,250
You go get me one more time.
I'll cut your fucking head off.

94
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:41,370
I'll roll you into some flower with an
egg wash and deep fry you motherfucker.

95
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,710
And I'll make your friends watch.

96
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,793
Okay.

97
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,530
Sit there and fucking stare at me like
I work for you. I don't work for you.

98
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:56,500
Who here is in a tank? I try.

99
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,700
I didn't so I didn't think so. Um,

100
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,950
anyways, um, Bill, why you show off
the fucking walls today? You know why?

101
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,760
Because I,

102
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,640
we wrapped at least the script writing
part of season two of f is for family,

103
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:18,641
which means I get to go back to being a
fucking 14 year old who has no fucking

104
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:23,270
job, no responsibilities, no nothing,

105
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,200
just a bunch of beers in my fridge
that I'm slowly going to kill.

106
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,080
I'll do the elliptical in the morning
and then I give it all back with the can

107
00:06:31,081 --> 00:06:33,590
of beer and that's what I do right?

108
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,610
While I fucking wear out my joints.
That's all I'm really doing right now.

109
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:40,640
I'm just maintaining. Um,

110
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,710
isn't that what a lot of people in this
digital age, you're just trying to do?

111
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,870
Aren't they just trying to maintain,

112
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,430
just trying to keep their heads above
water in this time of change and robots.

113
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,670
Um, if they fucking does the
election, has that happened yet?

114
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:07,280
Jesus fucking, he ain't go near the
Goddamn TV. Everybody's so fucking scared.

115
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,780
Oh, it's going to happen.

116
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,160
Nothing is going to continue
on the way it's supposed to go.

117
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,840
And whether the fucking comb-over
or the clam gets in the house,

118
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,260
it's going to go in the direction
that the money wants it to go into.

119
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,190
And if it doesn't, okay,
they're going to Dallas.

120
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,920
Right. And then not
going to be in a Tesla.

121
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:34,480
They're going to fucking roll out that
63 fucking stretch Lincoln convertible.

122
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,930
That's right. Now you're gonna get
the old right there, Fred to there.

123
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:43,670
Fucking Jesus Christ, the two
of them. You know what I mean?

124
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,280
Their heads. You know what?
If I was in secret service,

125
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,990
there would be a head size that
you could not be above, you know,

126
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,680
or, or else the president would have
to sign a waiver. Just like, you know,

127
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:59,450
both of them, Hillary and
fucking in Trump, they have,

128
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,410
they have like,

129
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,550
like if you could make sliders
out of Ted Kennedy's head,

130
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,800
that's what the fuck they have.

131
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,410
That is the most amazing
thing about Ted Kennedy.

132
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,560
He had the biggest fucking
head out of all of them and he,

133
00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:15,890
nobody ever took them out. You know,

134
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,410
you would think that that
fucking guy out of all of them,

135
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,450
they all had big
squashes, right. You know,

136
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,650
it's all good looking men do, right?
You've got to have a big head,

137
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,240
big stupid head with this squared jaw
that look in your eye like everything's

138
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:35,480
going to be okay. The kind of
thing that make women go, oh,

139
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:38,330
he could pay for all my stuff. Right.

140
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,980
One of those heads, well, what's his face?

141
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,610
Ted Kennedy was at of his
time, no pun intended, right?

142
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,600
If you want to know how
fat people were gonna get,

143
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,820
if you want to know how big
sodas we're going to get,

144
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,860
if you want to know how
fucking ridiculous, you know,

145
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,480
mcmansions and all this shit and all this
stuff that we were going to by the age

146
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:03,780
of consumerism, right? If you were
back in the 1950s trying to guess,

147
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,640
you had to wage you, which
way is it going to go?

148
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,730
Are we going to go back to living
on dirt floors and log cabins?

149
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,030
Are we going to have
kegerators and Fucking, uh,

150
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,260
chocolate fountains in our houses?

151
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,100
All you had to do is look at Ted
Kennedy said it'd be like, there it is.

152
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,320
That right there. That's an omen.

153
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,993
[inaudible]

154
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,430
you know the interesting thing
about Ted Kennedy's had a,

155
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:29,160
it was in his entire time he was
alive. It was never backlit ever.

156
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,660
People tried, they just was
never enough light. You know,

157
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,380
there's not even a picture of him
like blocking out the fucking, like,

158
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:40,650
not even the sun could reach around
either side. It just became night.

159
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,650
You walked outside. Hey, I'm saying
he had a big head. You know, um,

160
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,440
I've got a big head. I got a big kid. I do

161
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,420
literally and figuratively.
I get a giant head.

162
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:58,440
I got a fucking ego and a half
because I got the whole week off.

163
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,820
And what am I going to do?

164
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:03,420
I'm going to rest up getting
ready for my European tour,

165
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,380
like the red fucking
headed whore than I am.

166
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,800
And I'm gonna fucking Tuesday night I'm
going to be at the Steve Allen Theater

167
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,910
on Hollywood Boulevard,
the boulevard of dreams.

168
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,070
Um, I'm going to be there and, uh,

169
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:25,890
just basically saying my shit. So,

170
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,950
you know, I just, I'll need to do is
just fucking say it a few times, right?

171
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:31,770
Just moderate to myself. Walk
around the block, talk to myself,

172
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:36,270
hands in my pocket, vigorously scratching
the side of my ball sack. Right.

173
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,100
Having the cops come by, having them
pull over, asking me what I'm doing.

174
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:42,930
Do I live around here? Are you a vagrant?

175
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:49,080
I'm sorry. Did you guys see Rudy
Giuliani speech about the police? Man.

176
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,750
That was one of the funniest fucking
things I've ever seen in my life.

177
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,610
The way he was trying to get
that crowd going. You know?

178
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,810
That's [inaudible]

179
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,440
all right. I wanted him to keep going.

180
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,110
You know, he just basically distract,

181
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,100
describe police officers jobs,

182
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:13,230
but I wanted him to keep
going and I wanted him to, to,

183
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,810
to portray how wealthy he is and,

184
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,210
and the influential friends that he
has. You know, they come to house,

185
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:27,190
they say you're under arrest, but you
have your lawyer made up in the driveway.

186
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,290
They say Rodeo turned himself.

187
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,870
The charges go away.

188
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:43,950
I wanted, I wanted him to go that far
because here's the deal. You know,

189
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:48,210
the way the police would be paid
right now is fucking ridiculous.

190
00:11:48,211 --> 00:11:50,910
It's the same way, you
know, if one comic sucks,

191
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:54,280
then every fucking comic out there
has a lampshade on the fucking head.

192
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,300
You know what I mean?

193
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,360
There's definitely some terrible
people that are police officers,

194
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:03,370
but that doesn't mean that they're
all bad. Okay? Now, Rudy Giuliani,

195
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:08,490
you can't fucking stand there where you
exist in society with your skin color

196
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:13,660
and think that you can accurately
describe police officers. You know,

197
00:12:13,661 --> 00:12:15,400
and you need somebody a
little more mid range.

198
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,390
Well maybe it's good that he said that.
Okay, now we got the high end right.

199
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,700
Black people fucking said their end
and then you just need somebody in the

200
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:28,330
middle now. He still can't do it. You
still can't do it because of racism.

201
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,400
You got to try to balance the whole
fucking thing out. Um, I dunno. Hold on.

202
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,410
Say Yeah, you think, you
know, it'd be great with the,

203
00:12:35,411 --> 00:12:38,560
with the fucking cell phone cameras
and then the cops filled themselves.

204
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:42,940
What would be great is if
somebody fucked up as a cop,

205
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,440
if they actually got fired,

206
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,980
if they actually fucking were
punished and went to jail,

207
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,130
they actually murdered somebody. Not like,
you know, one or two or three people.

208
00:12:51,131 --> 00:12:54,790
If they'd actually just started doing
that. I don't know. I don't know.

209
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,100
I don't know if there's any fucking
solution to it. You know what I mean?

210
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,290
It's a hell of a fucking job to have
when you've got to walk up to a fucking

211
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,510
car, not knowing if you're
going to get shot or not.

212
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:07,150
That would make me a little
edgy. You know what I mean?

213
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,870
And I think a lot of cons can sit in
there fucking led living room perfect when

214
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:13,520
they're perfectly safe, being like,
oh, you know what I wouldn't do?

215
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,000
This is what I would've done. Right?

216
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,900
Like when you watch your
fucking quarterback throws
an interception and then you

217
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:22,240
say, oh, what had dumped it
off to the tight end? Oh,

218
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:25,690
is that what [inaudible] that's what
you would've done on your fucking couch.

219
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,640
[inaudible] I think it's an impossible
job. And I also think that's a,

220
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:35,670
there's an element to that
job that fucking statistics
psychopaths are attracted

221
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,020
to bouncers and all those things.

222
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:41,410
There's a lot of people that just want
to beat the shit out of people that go

223
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:44,230
for that job. Then there's
other ones that go there.

224
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:46,480
They have their heart in the
right fucking place, you know?

225
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:49,390
But they don't really make the
news, you know what I mean?

226
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,740
It's kind of like comics. Like
every night we tell jokes,

227
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,020
nobody gets offended and then one cop
gets fucking offended and then all of a

228
00:13:56,021 --> 00:13:59,230
sudden, is that what it's like
bill? Somebody getting unarmed,

229
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,470
somebody unarmed getting murdered is
like somebody getting in trouble for

230
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:06,730
Caitlyn Jenner joke. GI Bill. Thanks
for fucking explaining that one. Dow.

231
00:14:06,731 --> 00:14:11,200
Fuck you. It's my podcast.
Okay. I choose not to read.

232
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,970
I choose not to be informed.
That's my choice. Okay.

233
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,710
I'm like one of those feminists,

234
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,360
you know when they fucking
start yelling about that. Oh,

235
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:22,840
tell me what they do with my body. Right.

236
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:26,770
Don't tell me what to do
with my podcast. All right.

237
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,470
No more podcasts shaming.

238
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,330
Oh Shit. I had the fucking greatest
set I've had in fucking months.

239
00:14:37,331 --> 00:14:39,820
Saturday night at the comedy
store in the main room,

240
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,150
there was this chunk of material
I've been trying to work out.

241
00:14:43,151 --> 00:14:47,200
I finally set it in a row the
right way and then I came home.

242
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,160
I was so confident of it. I played
it for my wife and even she,

243
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,580
and that's the deal. When you try
something new, this is, this is,

244
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,130
this is the litmus test. And I
mean, know what the fuck that means.

245
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:03,020
I don't even know if I'm saying
it right. Litmus Lat, Miss Modal,

246
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:07,030
right. My fucking test is I plan,

247
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:10,080
play it for the lovely Nia.
And if she fucking left,

248
00:15:10,081 --> 00:15:14,260
you can make your fucking wife get
behind the new shit that you're doing.

249
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,250
Then you know you're onto something.
You know, because in general,

250
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,450
what they do when they first meet you,
they are like, oh my God, you're amazing.

251
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,740
Oh they just fucking pump you up,
right? So you start going like, whoa,

252
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,590
she's really cool man. Right?
And then once they get you,

253
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,010
okay,

254
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,750
once you fucking in the relationship,

255
00:15:32,751 --> 00:15:34,430
once you give him the
ring and you get married,

256
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:39,140
then they fucking just grabbed the reigns
and shot. You ain't going back. Whoa.

257
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,690
Wow. Right.

258
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,740
They start yakking the fuck
back now cause they're jerks.

259
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,450
It's just out of fear.

260
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,140
Hmm.

261
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,650
He's going to do something new.
He's gonna find something new.

262
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:57,090
He's going to find somebody new.
That's what they do. Unlike guys,

263
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,060
everybody knows that men are
totally secure with who they are.

264
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,160
Okay?

265
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,670
I'm just doing this right now for any
guy who's listening to this podcast next

266
00:16:08,671 --> 00:16:11,580
to a woman just to listen
to her going, oh my God,

267
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:16,440
how could you Ms. Guy such an idiot?
Let me tell you something lady.

268
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,220
All right. And don't look at him
right now cause he's not saying this.

269
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:24,900
I'm talking to you sweetheart. In the
background, shaking your fucking head.

270
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:30,050
It's your man who's gonna die
before you let him have his labs.

271
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,730
Okay? What you feel right fucking now is
what a man feels when he comes home and

272
00:16:35,731 --> 00:16:39,690
you're walking, you're watching those
botox squawk and fucking whores.

273
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,921
Okay?

274
00:16:40,921 --> 00:16:45,450
Doing the recap of their fucking season
with that Andy Cohen or whatever his

275
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:49,470
name is, that fucking
genius. He's like bs.

276
00:16:49,471 --> 00:16:51,300
Like the Gay Byron Allen.

277
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,830
You know where they just found
a show where there was no shelf.

278
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,200
Everybody was like this no show here.

279
00:16:59,170 --> 00:16:59,350
Yeah,

280
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,590
and the genius of that guy
to be like, yes there is.

281
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,070
Yeah,

282
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:04,903
it's not enough.

283
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,910
Did you got a bunch of screaming hordes
yelling at each other that someone's

284
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:10,940
going to sit down and watch
it every fucking night.

285
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:15,560
The fact that he then does
the recap, it just sits there.

286
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,650
You don't have to write anything
new. They do it for you.

287
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,570
He just sits there in effortlessly
host the show. He's a master.

288
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:24,980
Okay.

289
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,840
He just sits, yes. Is this
fucking setlist like a comic?

290
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:33,980
But all it is is to get these women
yelling at each other and he just,

291
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,460
he just, just watch the
brilliance of that man.

292
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,280
He just fucking sits there and if it's,

293
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:44,890
if it's fucking Samarin he turns
up the heat, you know, you know,

294
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,040
in episode four, Kathy, she,

295
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:54,090
she had some choice words in the moment.
That's all he has to say. Oh my God.

296
00:17:54,091 --> 00:17:58,560
When she called me a fucking con and then
she goes and he just fucking lays back

297
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:01,860
like Ali. Right. And when he
was fighting George Foreman.

298
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:05,250
And he just lets these women start fucking
punching each other out and they run

299
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:08,640
off set and he sits there and this
is the brilliance of this man,

300
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,910
is he sits there and he
actually has a look on his face.

301
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:13,680
Like he truly gives a fuck.

302
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,410
Like he actually gives a shit about these
people. He's just sitting here going,

303
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,400
that's a great TV. And we go,

304
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,790
that just sold some toothpaste
and he's just fucking raking it.

305
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,400
And look at the guy, he
looks like 1 million bucks.

306
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:30,270
A lot of people don't know this about
that man. He's 83 fucking years old.

307
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,180
You know, everybody
talking about Dick Clark,

308
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:35,730
how great he looked right
to the fucking end. Yeah.

309
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:39,930
Well close to the end that I should've
said that, but fucking, you know,

310
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:42,960
whatever. We all go out
like that. Right. But um,

311
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,560
he's fucking 83 a lot of people don't
know that. You think that guy was like,

312
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:50,940
you know, like whatever. What,
37 I have no fucking idea.

313
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:52,830
Yeah.

314
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,520
There's gotta be people hosting real
shit that's fucking difficult going.

315
00:18:55,521 --> 00:18:56,850
Why the fuck didn't I just do that?

316
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,423
Yeah.

317
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,220
What he is is he's doing a
sophisticated Jerry Springer. You know,

318
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,760
everybody's sitting down, there's no
punches thrown. They scream and yell.

319
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,820
They cross their legs. This is the one
thing I'll say about the real housewives.

320
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,510
They're fucking legs are
incredible. It's fucking amazing.

321
00:19:13,511 --> 00:19:18,130
Their legs are like fucking 22
year olds, their fucking faces.

322
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,970
Whoo. You know, Jesus Christ,

323
00:19:21,971 --> 00:19:25,330
and I got a lot of fucking nerve saying
this. Considering the way I look,

324
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,450
considering the way I traveled the world,

325
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:33,870
looking like an albino balding
Hellboy minus the working out.

326
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,983
Right.

327
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,670
I look like the thing. If it was skinny
and didn't have that skin disease,

328
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:47,530
you know what I mean? But yet could not
go out in the sun. That's what I am.

329
00:19:47,531 --> 00:19:51,190
I'm a middleweight thing minus whatever.
What's it may not have come on.

330
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,650
Come on. Comic cons. You know
what he's made out of, you know,

331
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:59,260
he turned into that. Was it
another accident in a lab? Huh?

332
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:04,090
Did he come here from another planet and
then get bit by a spider and then got

333
00:20:04,091 --> 00:20:05,380
blinded by some shit.

334
00:20:05,381 --> 00:20:09,160
Now he's a fast aunt living
in somebody's fucking head,

335
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:14,170
you know, driving a jet
ski down to Middle Earth.

336
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,780
Jesus Christ. Yes.

337
00:20:16,781 --> 00:20:21,520
When you think just when you fucking
think that the real housewives is the

338
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,590
dumbest fucking thing
you're ever gonna Watch,

339
00:20:23,591 --> 00:20:26,590
they come out with another
stupid fucking superhero movie.

340
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:32,650
Jesus fucking Christ. Can Somebody
get the gist collectively?

341
00:20:32,651 --> 00:20:36,260
Get these nerds, some hookers.
You know, why don't they go away?

342
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,160
What are the kids go on now? It tastes,
what does that, what does that fucking,

343
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,960
you know, it's one of those apps,
whatever the fucking is, it's not,

344
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,640
is it Tinder? One of them is like the
Horry and then the other one's like, Ooh,

345
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:52,280
you know, I like [inaudible]
food and link to hill.

346
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:57,030
The three children, you know the dose
app and then you got the other ones.

347
00:20:57,031 --> 00:21:01,350
Just like, you know, hey,
you know, I've got some bows.

348
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,510
You know, I got a dangling, I
want to stick it in your fucking

349
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,400
fucking Kooky all there. Whatever it is.

350
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,450
That's fucking amazing. God bless
this generation. You know what I mean?

351
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,620
That's fucking great. They have
that, you know, it's weird.

352
00:21:19,621 --> 00:21:22,500
Every year like life becomes
easier. You have to think less,

353
00:21:22,501 --> 00:21:26,310
but it gets more expensive. It's
fucking nuts. You know what I mean?

354
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:27,530
Okay.

355
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,520
I can tell you right now,

356
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:33,050
if there was fucking free porn and there
was these dating sites and how much

357
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,420
easier your fucking life would
have been when you were a kid,

358
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:42,580
just not having a fucking, Oh God, Jesus.

359
00:21:42,581 --> 00:21:44,500
I remember having to go out
to those stupid fucking,

360
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,630
you just going out to these fucking clubs.

361
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:51,720
You know I was going out there and the
fucking late eighties walking into a

362
00:21:51,721 --> 00:21:54,750
nightclub, bump up a doll, pop
it up and out. Bow, don't talk.

363
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,930
[inaudible] that girl
is boy then. Ah Yeah.

364
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,980
Inability would they have fucking
puppy as peds walking around.

365
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,900
We were in driving gloves inside.

366
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,513
Okay.

367
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,670
Fucking music. Loudest Shit in La.

368
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,130
Now you can sit there and your fucking
underwear just scrolling through people

369
00:22:15,131 --> 00:22:19,450
like you're a fucking rock star on. You
know, like whenever you hear that shit,

370
00:22:19,451 --> 00:22:23,260
like how the roadies would go out and
pick the fucking women that the band was

371
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,660
going to fuck and they'd be like, yeah,

372
00:22:25,661 --> 00:22:29,800
you put your friends got his stay and
then the fucking friend would leave it.

373
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,723
She'd be like

374
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:31,703
Marcy.

375
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,990
And she just fucking walks
away just for one night.

376
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,163
Yeah.

377
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:42,410
With to, to fuck the guy. Some
guy from deep purple, right.

378
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,010
Or then years later, the
two of them mate, you know,

379
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,400
at a high school reunion and then the
fucker one that left the other one left

380
00:22:52,531 --> 00:22:54,810
Marcy behind is all fucking nervous.

381
00:22:54,811 --> 00:22:58,860
That Marcy's going to let her or
now husband know that she fucked,

382
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,140
you know the Maracas player,

383
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,650
the Maracas player from deep purple,

384
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:10,100
he wasn't even a full member. They just
had him on for that one fucking song.

385
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,320
Cause Santana's scared
the fuck out of him.

386
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:15,530
They thought that was the
direction of music was going to go.

387
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,370
Then once they realized that mainstream
music was only going to accept one

388
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,410
Santana, right.

389
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:26,210
And there wasn't going to be another
fucking type of Santana tell those guys

390
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,940
Bombo today. Yeah, boom layer. And then
there was Ricky Martin. How's that?

391
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,480
[inaudible] right. And years
fucking later they're at the,

392
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,870
they're at the fucking
heist, the ice core at union,

393
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,700
and she's just fucking with her
eyes. She's trying to be like, oh,

394
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:49,010
so to see you, she's fucking like
bringing her in. Like, you know,

395
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:53,210
trying to fucking sort of muffle her
and choke around like don't fucking say

396
00:23:53,211 --> 00:23:57,980
shit to my husband. And then they fucking
around [inaudible] be powerful. Right.

397
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,090
And then Marcy, she's
just not, she's a woman.

398
00:24:02,091 --> 00:24:05,810
She's just not going to come out and
say it was the fun there. Then the,

399
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,240
then it's over, you know, it's
like a cat playing with the mouse.

400
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:12,710
She's just got an linger. She's going
to start talking to the husband.

401
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:17,840
Yeah. Act It all interest. Not Looking
at fucking, you know Marcy. Right.

402
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,430
And then she's going to kind of glance
over at her and then she's just going to

403
00:24:21,431 --> 00:24:25,220
just slowly let it out.
Yeah. Me and your wife. Yeah,

404
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:26,780
we were crazy back then.

405
00:24:26,781 --> 00:24:30,210
Remember all those concert we went to
and she's just going to watch their,

406
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,810
I forget who's Marcy at this point.
The fucking chick who got lead.

407
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,850
We'll just say Marcy's the
married one. All right.

408
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,690
You just going to see her face
fucking fall. It says fucking chick.

409
00:24:38,691 --> 00:24:43,100
Just twist the fucking knife. Is she
going to tell? Is she not going to tell?

410
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,910
And then she'll back off and change the
subject and then she'll gradually come

411
00:24:46,911 --> 00:24:49,820
back around to it. And this
fucking guy's just standing there,

412
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:54,650
doesn't know a fucking
thing. Um, I'm sorry.

413
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,790
I was just, you know, I was just doing
a table read for a fucking screenplay.

414
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:02,420
I'm writing called a Marcy's a cunt.

415
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:03,891
You know,

416
00:25:03,891 --> 00:25:07,220
and I've been shopping around Hollywood
forever and I'll tell you is great.

417
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,530
It's the script is for
whatever fucking reason,

418
00:25:09,531 --> 00:25:13,730
they just cannot get
past the title, you know,

419
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:17,360
it's just this politically correct
age that we live in. All right,

420
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:21,500
let's get to some of the reeds here
for this week for Christ sake. Bill,

421
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,520
did you even fucking, did you even
fucking know you didn't? Yeah.

422
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,770
Here we go. All right, here we go.

423
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,600
Four reeds and don't Chino Indochino

424
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,451
the fuck is this.

425
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:39,230
Talk about how good it feels to have a
suit that is one of kindness is uniquely

426
00:25:39,231 --> 00:25:43,820
yours. Talk about how when you
look good, you feel confident.

427
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,010
Let me talk about that.

428
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,560
Why don't you fucking write
some shit for me to talk about?

429
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:54,320
What is this? An interview? Talk about
wearing suits. All right. And No.

430
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:58,820
China window, Chino. Alright.
Indochino is reinventing. Oh,

431
00:25:58,821 --> 00:26:01,550

Nico Rosberg came in second and
now Lewis Hamilton. That's the,

555
00:33:30,971 --> 00:33:33,950
that's the fifth time he won
that race and I learned that, uh,

556
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,900
he passed our Craig shoemaker
stand up comedian and legendary.

557
00:33:38,901 --> 00:33:42,770
A fucking f one driver.

I don't know shit about this sport.

561
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:01,830
It's just seem whoever was in first like,

562
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,320
like the race was to the first turn
and then it was just fucking over you.

563
00:34:05,321 --> 00:34:07,740
You couldn't get past anybody, you know,

564
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:12,790
who is that fucking lunatic zigzag
and behind the red bull. Huh?

565
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,940
Going back and forth, he cut off
the front of his fucking car.

566
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:21,410
Was it Sebastian Vettel
was at Max per stopping.

567
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,740
Ladies and gentlemen.

568
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:35,640

569
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:38,740

shit. Uh, [inaudible] heads. It's warm.

571
00:34:43,391 --> 00:34:46,310
It's race for fourth was really
entertaining, but I didn't like how that,

572
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,960
you know, there was no way for fucking
Nico to even try to pass Lewis.

573
00:34:49,961 --> 00:34:52,300
Once he got out in front, that
fucking track, it was just, you know,

574
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:57,060
kind of stunk. Like Lewis Hamilton
was just driving around and

575
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:03,320
right. The whole fucking
time. And you know,

576
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,650
they would just show in like the race for
fourth and fifth and third and fourth.

577
00:35:06,651 --> 00:35:10,580
And then like they were on the final lap
and it was so fucking boring out front.

578
00:35:10,581 --> 00:35:15,050
They was still back, you know, watching
that Guy Zigzag. Hey Formula One fans,

579
00:35:15,051 --> 00:35:17,810
I don't understand where they, I
like the fucking rules. Well Bill,

580
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:20,270
why don't you look them up? Well,
it's easier to ask you guys.

581
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:23,060
It's also funny or if I talk about them
and I don't know what I'm talking about,

582
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:26,660
I don't get out when the guy who
cut off the front of his car, right.

583
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,230
One of the fucking fins. I did find
it funny that they were like, yeah,

584
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:33,110
people do that all the time and it
doesn't affect the performance of the car.

585
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,900
Um, doesn't seem to anyways, um,

586
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,200
where they was saying you were
only allowed to make one move,

587
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,890
like you went to the right and then he
came back to the left and then back to

588
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:46,670
the right. And that was considered more
than one move. And I was just like,

589
00:35:46,671 --> 00:35:48,470
what the fuck? You can't do that.

590
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:53,920
I thought I left this behind with the
NFL season you this is like, you know,

591
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:55,480
he's got to make a football move.

592
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:59,940
That fucking guy, when
he tried to go around,

593
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:03,540
the other dude didn't do anything that
I don't do when I'm on the highway,

594
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:06,930
when I'm behind some fucking Douche
driving too fucking slow in the left lane,

595
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:08,843
right?

596
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:09,880
Yeah.

597
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,640
Oh, you know what [inaudible] and I'm
in the, I'm in the second to left lane.

598
00:36:12,641 --> 00:36:12,791
Right.

599
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:15,670
And there's some guy driving medium
speed and then somebody doing that just

600
00:36:15,671 --> 00:36:18,340
making a wall. And I'm like, what the
fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck?

601
00:36:18,341 --> 00:36:19,870
What the fuck? And then
you go around to the right.

602
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:21,460
Okay.

603
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:25,270
Coming around now when I watched
the race, it was Lewis Hamilton,

604
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,170
then Rosberg and I
remember it was a red bull,

605
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,150
then a Ferrari, then a
red bull, then a Ferrari.

606
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:35,820
And then today it's saying red
bull, Ferrari, Ferrari, red bull.

607
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,570
So did somebody get penalized?
It's fucking unreal.

608
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:44,010
I don't get it. Like, it's, there's
always like, after the fucking, Oh,

609
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,610
you thought you won the race, but,
uh, somebody said something in ta,

610
00:36:47,611 --> 00:36:50,940
don't shift into seventh gear. And
they're like, oh, you can't do that.

611
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:55,080
Don't tell him what he
shouldn't do. You know,

612
00:36:55,081 --> 00:36:57,600
he's only driving a car at
200 fucking miles an hour.

613
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,680
One guy spun up, that was it.

614
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:06,150
There wasn't really any crashes or
anything like that, but it was funny.

615
00:37:06,151 --> 00:37:08,260
I'm actually totally into
it. My wife can't stand it.

616
00:37:08,261 --> 00:37:12,360
She says when I have it on, it sounds
like a bunch of bees flying around,

617
00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:16,470
but um, it's still fucking coolest
shit. Although that, I dunno,

618
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:19,980
that was probably of all the races I've
watched, that's been my least favorite.

619
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,940
Um, just because there was
all this, like the, the,

620
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,910
the start of the race was the most
exciting and then it was just a bunch of

621
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:30,420
people in the back trying to go around
people and they couldn't do it except for

622
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:34,860
Kimmy. Raikkonen the flying Finn
evidently see the flying Finn.

623
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:39,030
I have no fucking idea. Um, anyways,

624
00:37:39,031 --> 00:37:41,640
but this is really getting me through
the fucking dog days of baseball.

625
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:44,460
I fucking love baseball,
but I just, you know,

626
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,050
I can't get into it in July and
August. I like it in April, you know,

627
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:50,340
into May.

628
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:55,230
You start seeing what's going to happen
and then I just fucking veg out. June,

629
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,510
July, August, the same
way the players do, right?

630
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,240
They're just standing up there
like, dude, what the fuck?

631
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,380
How many fucking games do you have to
play in the regular season before we know

632
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:09,370
who deserves to win the
division hundred and 62 five.

633
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:10,960
Isn't that, isn't that insane?

634
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,003
[inaudible]

635
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:16,690
that has to be, if you're going
to own a professional team,

636
00:38:16,691 --> 00:38:21,160
that's gotta be the sport
to do it. 162 home games.

637
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:25,720
If your teams selling out
the Ballpark, Jesus Christ,

638
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:30,520
those things have to be, I've got to
look this up right now. Look at this.

639
00:38:30,521 --> 00:38:34,880
I'm actually going to do
research professional.

640
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:38,740
See, I know franchises.

641
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,330
Okay.

642
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:42,130
I should have put sports
in there right now.

643
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,320
If suddenly going to be fucking
talking to being about McDonald's

644
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,310
worth the most.

645
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,233
Okay.

646
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:56,210
Okay. Well, this is everything. Okay.
The Dallas cowboys, for whatever reason,

647
00:38:56,211 --> 00:38:59,480
are worth $4 billion. Real Madrid,

648
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:04,790
I'm guessing is some sort of
football club in Spain is where?

649
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:07,340
Three point $7 billion

650
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:13,700
and then there's another one in
Barcelona. Is that also Spain?

651
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:18,620
3.6 billion. The New York
Yankees. There you go.

652
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:24,230
Well that makes sense that like
a world football as we call it,

653
00:39:24,231 --> 00:39:26,660
soccer would be worth that
much money cause that's,

654
00:39:26,661 --> 00:39:28,850
that really is when you're
winning a world championship,

655
00:39:28,851 --> 00:39:31,760
you're winning the World Cup. You're
playing against the fucking world, right?

656
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:37,160
It's like an Olympic medal, except you
get paid a, then the New York Yankees,

657
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:41,690
3.4 billion, then man United 3.3 billion.

658
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:46,130
Oh, and then the New England patriots.

659
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,630
Everybody's favorite fucking
team to hate on 3.2 billion.

660
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,410
Then the New York Knicks. What?

661
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,840
3 billion.

662
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:58,500
Okay.

663
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:03,150
Jesus Christ. No New York. I'll tell
you, that's a fixer upper right.

664
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:07,270
That New York, nextera.
A fucking tear down. Oh,

665
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:11,830
this is weird man. Then the
Washington Redskins, 2.9 billion

666
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,000
invaluable sports team
in the world. The NFL.

667
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,030
[inaudible] this year's list by force.

668
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,370
Shut up.

669
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:18,490
We're feeling good dollars.

670
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,740
I hate when this happens. Yeah.

671
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,370
Now you've got to figure out where
the fuck the voice is coming from.

672
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,040
Rankings in 2011 that he soccer.

673
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,550
Shut up. Oh, there it is.

674
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:30,243
All right.

675
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:35,020
All right. The Redskins
are worth 2.9 billion.

676
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:40,600
Then the giants are 2.8
building, building billion.

677
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:45,250
Then the Lakers a 2.7 the Lakers
are worth less than the Knicks.

678
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:50,860
If anything says that this state is
going to fall into the ocean one day,

679
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:55,690
it's the fact that the fucking nicks
are with more fucking money than the

680
00:40:55,691 --> 00:40:59,290
fucking Lakers. Jesus Christ.
What are the Celtics worth?

681
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,400
Oh my God. Rappaport's
gonna fucking love that.

682
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:06,521
Well,

683
00:41:06,521 --> 00:41:10,060
you know something that actually makes
sense because you know when you move to

684
00:41:10,061 --> 00:41:14,410
Manhattan, you fuck. Can you
fucking let me get to the site?

685
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,300
I hate when fucking sites do this.

686
00:41:16,301 --> 00:41:20,950
They just got to suck the fucking
information out of you, Forbes,

687
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,140
to give you my fucking email.

688
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,770
What so time magazine can start
fucking spam and me. I don't think so.

689
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:31,300
Why Hillary Clinton should be
thankful. Election is not today.

690
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,100
I don't know why is there pantsuits all
in the fucking dry cleaners. All right,

691
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:41,030
let's uh, let's, let's do sway of
where am I? How much time have I done?

692
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,520
41 minutes. You know,

693
00:41:43,521 --> 00:41:47,930
some days it feels like work
other days that doesn't, um,

694
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:53,060
you know, I've become obsessed with
as of last night is, is uh, you know,

695
00:41:53,061 --> 00:41:56,030
I've been doing this grip strength thing
and I've been fucking doing great man.

696
00:41:56,031 --> 00:41:59,060
I can go up a pegboard
now at 48 years of age.

697
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:04,040
I can go up a climbing rope leaving my
skinny fucking Alabaster fucking albino

698
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:08,360
legs just dangling like
a fucking, I don't know,

699
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:13,670
couple of appendixes, right? Jesus.
I never had to make that plural.

700
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:18,710
Appendix. Appendix is, um, tits. Today's

701
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,593
um,

702
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:25,540
yeah, cause you know what? I got
those, those atomic fucking holds.

703
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,670
Those motherfuckers better
send me some free shit.

704
00:42:27,671 --> 00:42:30,730
I'm sick of hyping those guys up, but
they, they shit, they are the shit.

705
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,560
So now I want to be
able to do one of those,

706
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:35,900
is it called a front lever
or a front lever? Um,

707
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,880
and I watched this guys a youtube
video. I'll, I'll repost it.

708
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,480
The six easy steps, eh, hey,

709
00:42:43,481 --> 00:42:46,270

to do a front lever.

Um,

00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:53,420
did you hear about Paula
Abdul? No. What? She's,

712
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,390
she's a singer and she was a Laker girl.

713
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:02,463
[inaudible]

714
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:06,980
Paul Abdul at the national job. No,
I have to eat my cereal. Oh, okay.

718
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,840
I had to pick someone, you
know, if I was like, yeah, go.

719
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:28,410
Did you hear about Paula Abdul? Like
that's not funny. What is funny?

720
00:43:28,411 --> 00:43:29,244
It is funny.

721
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:32,250
And you're going to sit there and act
like you're not going to do it to me.

722
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,690
That's true. Who would you pick? Hmm?

723
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,920
One of your rock icons probably, you know,

724
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:42,940
kind of helps you pick a name. Well,

725
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:46,150
I can't tell you because then it's not
going to be a surprise when I do it right

726
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:49,020
? No, it isn't because you already
told me you're going to do it.

727
00:43:49,021 --> 00:43:53,640
See what I did there? Uh Oh yeah, I guess,

728
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:57,240
but I can flip it. I don't know.
It's, it's the morning still here.

729
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,460
Drink some of your juice. I
brought it for you. Oh thank you.

730
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,850
Well I got to do a podcast if you don't
mind just journey right now though. No,

731
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,240
I people give me shit cause I
try not to drink on the mic,

732
00:44:06,241 --> 00:44:09,120
but I have to hold the microphone.
Just take a sip. All right.

733
00:44:09,121 --> 00:44:12,990
Then talk to them while I drink it.
Okay. So on my snapchat last night,

734
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,820
if you guys follow me on Snapchat,

735
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:19,440
I made my fresh squeeze watermelon
juice and I'm giving it to bill.

736
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:23,310
Who loves a wow. He's
taking it down like a champ.

737
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:30,180
You give me anything in this glass? I
suck it down. Just like my, my juice.

738
00:44:30,181 --> 00:44:34,690
I drink at night. Daddy's Madison,
Daddy's medicine. Um, all right,

739
00:44:34,691 --> 00:44:38,640
I gotta get back to the podcast,
Nia. Okay. Alrighty. All right. Okay.

740
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:42,000
What you're talking about,
um, I don't really know.

741
00:44:42,001 --> 00:44:45,420
This has just been one of these
stream of conscious stays. Um,

742
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,880
that's their whole podcast.

743
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:51,020
I've talked about some lady with a basket
on her head trying to get water once

744
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,100
she fought off a cobra.
I do remember that.

745
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:57,690
And I also talked about how big the
heads are of the people running for

746
00:44:57,691 --> 00:45:02,640
president and how I'd be concerned
if I was the head of security. Okay.

747
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:07,410
What else? That's all I
can remember. Oh, riveting.

748
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,070
Okay. All right, I'll see you.

749
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,340
Hey neenee do you hear about Lady Gaga?

750
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,650
She had a meat dress. Alright,

751
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,820
let's get to some of the
questions here. Um, oh yeah.

752
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,820
So I became obsessed with the, uh,

753
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:29,910
that front lever and uh,

754
00:45:29,911 --> 00:45:32,880
this guy has a six step thing on how to
do it cause I always wanted to be able

755
00:45:32,881 --> 00:45:36,240
to do the human fucking flag. You know,

756
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:40,200
that's just a great thing to be
able to do if you're not a gymnast.

757
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,980
Cause people just expect you to be able
to do it. But if you just like a dad,

758
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:46,230
you've got a couple of kids, you know,

759
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,700
you fucking into roofing now that's a
physical job. Whatever you fucking build.

760
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:52,403
I don't know.

761
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:57,020
It just be something just funny to do
that day that you could actually fucking

762
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:00,930
do that. Just weird people out.
Um, you know what that reminds me,

763
00:46:00,931 --> 00:46:03,570
I wanted to do a bit on these
fucking crossfit people,

764
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:07,170
but I just feel like it's just too hacky
and every comics going to have a bid on

765
00:46:07,171 --> 00:46:12,060
it. So what, what's, why
do these crossfit people,

766
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:16,410
why do they have to like work out
in the gym and outside? Why is,

767
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:20,400
it's just so fucking, look at me.
We're working out. I work out too.

768
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:23,160
I work out my garage with
the fucking door closed.

769
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,980
It's the most narcissistic shit you ever
see when they just like did fucking run

770
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:32,610
down the street with like a goddamn
fucking tire behind them. Right.

771
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,940
Somebody show me a picture of a guy
doing that. Every tweeted it right.

772
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:40,800
Running down the street, dragging a
tire. When you just run up a hill,

773
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:43,500
you fucking moron, you know?

774
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:48,090
Oh cause the tire adds more difficulty
when they've run up the hill more times.

775
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,760
Increase your reps, you stupid. Fuck

776
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,570
well what do you train
in for the standards?

777
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:00,180
I was fucking somewhere in Santa
Monica. These fucking jerk offs.

778
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:02,340
It's like 10 of them
outside and they've got,

779
00:47:02,341 --> 00:47:04,170
you know when they got
the double fucking ropes,

780
00:47:04,171 --> 00:47:07,440
that thing that they do that,

781
00:47:07,441 --> 00:47:11,100
the only reason you really need to do
that is if you're fighting in the UFC.

782
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,560
They're the only people who
seem to need to have to do that.

783
00:47:13,561 --> 00:47:18,030
Then everybody else wants to be in UFC
shape without having to actually have the

784
00:47:18,031 --> 00:47:21,570
balls to get in the octagon. All right,

785
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,620
so fucking dumb. And the,
or even when they're inside,

786
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:27,510
there's like down the
street, there's one from me,

787
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:32,170
it's like this giant garage and they
just have it open. Like, look at us.

788
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:36,850
We're crossfitting. I talked to Nia
about and she was saying like, yeah,

789
00:47:36,851 --> 00:47:40,300
it was like all the rage to be on one
of those social media things and like,

790
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:43,900
oh I did, you know, take filming yourself,

791
00:47:43,901 --> 00:47:47,200
working out Hashtag
crossfit. It's just, I dunno

792
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:52,420
when I was a s when I was a kid, if
you wanted people to look at you,

793
00:47:52,421 --> 00:47:56,770
you got into show business. Okay? You
became a male stripper. You told jokes,

794
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,240
you joined a band.

795
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:03,520
You know now these fucking assholes that
they're making a bunk cake and they got

796
00:48:03,521 --> 00:48:08,521
like fucking 80,000 fucking hits and
everybody's walking around with the same

797
00:48:09,281 --> 00:48:12,850
arrogance that I have. It's,
it's not fair people I earned,

798
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:17,800
I earned my Eric, it's
um, I'm fucking with you.

799
00:48:17,801 --> 00:48:18,820
You want to work outside.

800
00:48:18,821 --> 00:48:21,490
You want to run down the street
with a fucking tire behind you.

801
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:23,243
Okay.

802
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:24,663
You know what I mean?

803
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:26,693
Okay.

804
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:30,730
I don't quite understand when to apply
the white privilege thing because I am

805
00:48:30,731 --> 00:48:34,300
white and who's kidding who I am
one of the widest of all time.

806
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:35,583
You know what I mean?

807
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:40,450
I would say Hitler would not be
disappointed if I walked into his office,

808
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:42,760
but I think the red hair,
I think I might be out.

809
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:45,300
Okay.

810
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:50,260
[inaudible] chuck white skin,
chuck on the Blue Eyes. All

811
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:56,610
this one's defective. Alright.

812
00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:01,650

I just get credit for driving traffic
to their site and then they kicked me a

818
00:49:18,491 --> 00:49:20,590
little doe ray me, you
didn't have to do nothing.

819
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:22,480
Nobody knows anything

820
00:49:22,481 --> 00:49:24,790
I go out and I buy myself a
ham sandwich. You can do it.

821

If you want to get dope, that's fine.

822
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:30,340
If you're listening to this podcast and
you're like, I hate this thing, Gee,

823
00:49:30,341 --> 00:49:32,530
I wish there was a podcast network.

824
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:35,080
They had had a bunch of other
podcasts to choose from.

825
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,880
I would say to go to all things,

826
00:49:36,881 --> 00:49:41,881
comedy.com the podcast network started
by myself and Al Madrigal and a bunch of

827
00:49:44,921 --> 00:49:48,580
other people. We've got
Irish, a fear over there.

828
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:50,560
I should really go onto
the website right now.

829
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,650
We'll give you and give you a
bunch of fucking names, right?

830
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:56,060
Oh,

831
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:57,320

50 minutes in Professor
Dick Wad. Hey Bill,

847
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:59,360
you hemoglobin laden Aretha site.
I had to look all of that up.

848
00:50:59,361 --> 00:51:03,620
That's basically a scene. I have a lot
of red in me. A lot of red blood cells.

849
00:51:03,621 --> 00:51:08,420
I guess let's make this as short and
sweet as possible. Hey, all right.

850
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:13,400
Why are you fucking don't lecture me
you cunt. Um, I go to a nice college.

851
00:51:13,401 --> 00:51:16,580
I also manage a movie
theater in my town too.

852
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:22,950
Why would you say also and too, I
manage a movie theater in my town also,

853
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,230
or two to one also mean
the same thing. Right.

854
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:30,540
I also manage it movie theater
in my town to comma to alright,

855
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,400
at school, I've got a film,

856
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:35,490
even said you're gonna make it short
and sweet at school. I've got a,

857
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,410
I got a film studies class with one of
those pretentious fucking professors that

858
00:51:40,411 --> 00:51:43,830
wears young kid clothes to come
off cooler than he really is. Yeah.

859
00:51:43,831 --> 00:51:48,390
You know what that means? He's gonna
fuck us, don't it? I love movies.

860
00:51:48,391 --> 00:51:51,690
I've seen plenty of them. That's the
reason why I'm taking this class. Well,

861
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,880
that's great. Gravitate
towards you what you want.

862
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:57,270
Every time before we watch
a movie in this class,

863
00:51:57,271 --> 00:52:00,630
the professor asks us to raise
our hands if we've seen it before.

864
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:05,250
I raised my hand almost every time that
I look around to see if anyone else is

865
00:52:05,251 --> 00:52:08,250
raising their hand. They
rarely are. Sure I'm a nerd.

866
00:52:08,251 --> 00:52:12,090
I've seen the fucking movies. Maybe if
he didn't play the most standard choices,

867
00:52:12,091 --> 00:52:16,050
like Cassa blanket and shit, I wouldn't
raise my hand every time. Look at that.

868
00:52:16,051 --> 00:52:19,920
You like movies, you're doing your
homework, you taking a class on it,

869
00:52:19,921 --> 00:52:23,880
you're gravitating towards what
you want. Very nice. All right.

870
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:27,210
So anyway, I was just recently hired.

871
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:30,600
I was just recently hired on an employee.

872
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:36,640
Dude, you're killing me. I just
recently hired on as an employee.

873
00:52:36,641 --> 00:52:40,150
You left out the ass at my theater. Um,

874
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:44,580
who also happens to be a
student of my film studies Pref.

875
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:49,500
Oh, you went by an employee.
So anyway, I just recently,

876
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:54,530
I was just recently hired by an employee
at my theater who also happens to be a

877
00:52:56,041 --> 00:52:58,500
student of my film studies professor,

878
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,020
but in a different class
at a different school.

879
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,230
I think I conveyed what you were
trying to say that as a joke.

880
00:53:04,231 --> 00:53:05,610
One day I asked the kid,

881
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:09,480
so does Mr So-and-so ever
talk shit about our class?

882
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:13,740
The kid looks me square in the eye
and says, yeah, actually he does.

883
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:17,250
Doctor So-and-so says
there's this one kid in your,

884
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:21,480
your your all's class,
you mean y'alls class?

885
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,780
Who always raises his hand when
he asks if he's seen the movie.

886
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:26,970
But really he probably hasn't.

887
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:30,900
And then he looks around the run and
makes sure everyone is looking at him to

888
00:53:30,901 --> 00:53:34,930
know he's seen the movie
before. That's hilarious.

889
00:53:34,931 --> 00:53:38,800
This guy's getting insecure. You're
making your teacher insecure.

890
00:53:38,801 --> 00:53:40,750
So now he's got a Jesus.

891
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:43,630
That's probably why he's wearing
the young people's clothes.

892
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:48,070
He's talking shit about the other
class to make himself seem cool. Ah,

893
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:53,110
this guy's a fucking, this guy's a bitch.
I don't like this teacher. He goes,

894
00:53:53,111 --> 00:53:53,921
so there we go.

895
00:53:53,921 --> 00:53:58,780
This guy talks shit about me to his other
classes when all I'm doing is gently

896
00:53:58,781 --> 00:54:02,230
raising my hand after being asked
if I've seen the movie or not.

897
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,230
In any other case, I'd probably
just confront him about this,

898
00:54:05,231 --> 00:54:08,260
but I don't want to risk failing the
class. There's something petty like that.

899
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:12,850
Am I overthinking this? What should I
do here? I'd walked right up to the guy.

900
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:17,720
I just want, who gives a fuck
this fucking insecure comment?

901
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:21,890
He'll probably give you a better
grade cause what does need to be like?

902
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:24,760
Just walk right up to him.
But yeah. Listen man, uh,

903
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:29,080
there seems to be some confusion on your
part that you seem to be trying to work

904
00:54:29,081 --> 00:54:33,410
out with the other class as to why I
raised my hand every time I happen to love

905
00:54:33,411 --> 00:54:36,350
movies, I work at a movie theater. Okay.

906
00:54:36,351 --> 00:54:41,300
And I've seen all these movies and I look
around just to see if anybody else has

907
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:42,163
seen the movies.

908
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:45,680
Cause I love movies and I want to talk
to people about movies if he don't want

909
00:54:45,681 --> 00:54:48,650
me to keep, you know, raising my hand.

910
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:53,810
Stop doing this paint by numbers. Basic
Horse Shit movies that you keep picking.

911
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:57,520
What are you going to have
next week? Days of Duh. Huh?

912
00:54:58,540 --> 00:54:59,373
Okay.

913
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:01,810
You've given me shit. You're
going to come in here.

914
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:06,870
Dress like you could go
into a fucking, yeah.

915
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:10,100
One of the young kids listened to,
I used to just go see the weekend.

916
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:13,160
Is that the right thing?
Who's the other guy?

917
00:55:13,161 --> 00:55:16,700
Who's the rapper who won all the
fucking grammys? Kendrick Lamar.

918
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:20,450
I know who they are. I don't,
I know a few of their songs.

919
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:21,943
Okay.

920
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:24,850
I know the weekends CD
starts off going right.

921
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:25,960
Wait

922
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,413
[inaudible]

923
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:35,480
you can actually play the
beginning of the weekend.

924
00:55:35,481 --> 00:55:38,570
I think rednecks do it as much as they
probably don't like your skin color.

925
00:55:38,571 --> 00:55:41,090
They probably play that when
they're out. Duck hunting

926
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,120
to try to get the young ducks. You
know, we're into all this fucking, um,

927
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:50,720
I'm fucking with you.
I'm a fan of the weekend.

928
00:55:50,721 --> 00:55:52,760
I wasn't rattled a little
[inaudible] that anyway,

929
00:55:52,761 --> 00:55:55,690
it was hard to write that last
y'all guy little Apollo. All right,

930
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:59,990
I'm a Billy calorie count.
Thoughts on Melissa Muck.

931
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:04,850
Kathy getting flack for losing weight.
Uh, all right, my first thought,

932
00:56:04,851 --> 00:56:05,661
I'm Melissa McCarthy.

933
00:56:05,661 --> 00:56:09,980
I did a movie with her a number of years
ago was called the heat directed by

934
00:56:09,981 --> 00:56:12,590
Paul Feig starring Melissa
McCarthy, Sandra Bullock.

935
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:17,660
And that's where I first met,
uh, Michael Rappaport, you know,

936
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:23,590
um, dropping names all over the place and
she is truly one of the most naturally

937
00:56:23,591 --> 00:56:28,591
funny fucking hilarious human beings
I have ever met and she's an absolute

938
00:56:28,811 --> 00:56:31,730
sweetheart. Um, so anyways, I didn't
realize people would give him,

939
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:33,760
why would you give somebody
flagged for losing weight?

940
00:56:33,761 --> 00:56:37,150
Aren't you supposed to say,
hey, great job, good for you.

941
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:39,130
Okay.

942
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:40,550
You know. Anyway.

943
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:44,230
Say people are saying she's doing
it because of Hollywood pressures.

944
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:50,510
That's so fucking dumb. All right.
Yeah. People are just add, isn't it?

945
00:56:50,511 --> 00:56:54,500
That's not what it is. It's, it's,
it's, it's the same towny mentality.

946
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:57,710
When you're, you're finally
deciding that, you know,

947
00:56:57,890 --> 00:57:01,670
wearing your football jacket and
continuing to drink in the local bar,

948
00:57:01,671 --> 00:57:06,400
you want more out of life and then all
a gong call forgetting a part also.

949
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,330
What do you think is smart
now? Like all of them,

950
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:12,050
they don't want to see her get
her shit together. You know,

951
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:14,330
misery loves fucking company. You know,

952
00:57:14,331 --> 00:57:18,560
they would stay here and be out of
shape. Good for her. Fucking assholes.

953
00:57:18,561 --> 00:57:21,470
What kind of an asshole? When somebody
makes a positive move in their life,

954
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:25,850
tries to make it negative. Well me,
I'm a comedian. I do that all the time.

955
00:57:25,851 --> 00:57:27,470
But besides people like me anyways,

956
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:31,100
these people who always say you should
be comfortable in your own body,

957
00:57:31,101 --> 00:57:32,450
no matter what you look like,

958
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,560
completely ignore basic information like
clogged arteries and such. Absolutely.

959
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:40,310
Maybe Melissa Carte McCarthy doesn't
want to die of a heart attack because she

960
00:57:40,311 --> 00:57:44,530
wants to meet her grandchildren's one
day I lost 30 pounds since listening to

961
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:48,200
you fat. Shame everyone. I honestly
didn't know I was getting fat.

962
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:52,400
I was never fat ever. But then three
years in an office job in college,

963
00:57:52,401 --> 00:57:57,050
I'm 24 I put on the gross 30.
I recently lost. Yeah Dude.

964
00:57:57,051 --> 00:57:59,390
At 24, man, you are headed towards being,

965
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:03,620
you are going to die if you are 30 pounds
overweight at 24 that is not a good

966
00:58:03,621 --> 00:58:07,160
thing. So congratulations. Anyways,

967
00:58:07,161 --> 00:58:08,780
he said I feel a thousand times better.

968
00:58:08,781 --> 00:58:11,870
I never looked fat because I'm
a tall guy and I carry it well.

969
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:15,530
So I never heard anything from
anyone. I did it on my own for myself.

970
00:58:15,531 --> 00:58:19,730
These fat defenders are ignorantly judging
and assuming thoughts on this. Also,

971
00:58:19,731 --> 00:58:21,980
when the fuck do we get
to see your gym video,

972
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:26,780
I want to see your pasty legs dangling
from a pull up bar like meat hanging in a

973
00:58:26,781 --> 00:58:30,230
locker. Ah, you fucking cuts. Uh, no.

974
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:32,570
This is the thing about this business. Uh,

975
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:35,450
the only pressure that it
is as far as I'm concerned,

976
00:58:35,451 --> 00:58:39,080
the only pressure in this
business is what you x.

977
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:42,920
You as an individual choose to accept.

978
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:44,420
All right?

979
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:48,140
And everybody does it to a certain point
when you first get into entertainment

980
00:58:48,141 --> 00:58:50,300
because you don't know
what the fuck you're doing.

981
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:53,510
You come into this business with
your hat in hand, you're like,

982
00:58:53,511 --> 00:58:56,900
I'll sweep the floors, I'll do whatever
you want. Just give me stage time. I'll,

983
00:58:57,140 --> 00:59:02,140
I'll drive to another state to do five
minutes for no money for $5 gas money.

984
00:59:02,421 --> 00:59:05,480
We all do that shit. Um,

985
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:10,210
but at some point you then have to put
a value on what the fuck it is you're

986
00:59:10,211 --> 00:59:12,320
doing, right? And then
you start getting paid.

987
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:16,670
Then what happens is you're like
going, fuck. You know, you know,

988
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:17,690
you get in this business,

989
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:21,050
it takes a while to get going and
everybody starts creeping into 30.

990
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:25,160
So you start freaking out going, oh,
what is, what is the industry casting?

991
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:26,930
What are they looking at?
What is the blah, blah,

992
00:59:26,931 --> 00:59:29,630
Blah and all that type of shit. Okay. Now,

993
00:59:29,631 --> 00:59:34,631
a lot of people do not ever get past that
because they don't put a value on that

994
00:59:36,551 --> 00:59:40,760
talent. And I'm not even
talking monetarily. This is
just my own belief system.

995
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:46,160
You have to believe that you have
something to say that you know,

996
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:51,080
you know, you can't be married to the
results. You just gotta do that Zen thing.

997
00:59:51,081 --> 00:59:52,730
Like I'm talking about this shit,

998
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,140
I'm doing this and like take me all right?

999
00:59:57,141 --> 01:00:01,640
I came in and the business, all
right, a fucking redheaded con male,

1000
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:06,380
you know? So from day one, there's
not going to be a lot of rules for me.

1001
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:11,690
There's not a lot of redheaded male
leads and shit. You know, I'm the friend,

1002
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:16,940
right? That's the deal.
That's how it works.

1003
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:21,800
The Red Ed and male is not the fucking
cool guy. So to make matters worse,

1004
01:00:21,801 --> 01:00:24,740
I started losing my fucking
hair and I was like, ah, fuck.

1005
01:00:24,741 --> 01:00:29,330
Now what do I go out and get plugs
and all that shit and just one day,

1006
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:32,540
right? You know, Neil was just,
just bus your fucking head down.

1007
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:37,130
And I was just like, and I just came to
this epiphany of just like, yeah, Bill,

1008
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:40,790
why are you walking around like you
losing your fucking hair is a big deal.

1009
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:45,170
Does that mean you're not funny
anymore? Does that mean you know,

1010
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:49,040
what were you going to be the next
Brad Pitt if you kept your fucking hair

1011
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:51,200
right? And then I just
said, yeah, fuck it.

1012
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:55,400
So then I did it and this and I ever
since I had the philosophy of basically

1013
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:59,330
this is what I look like
and this is what I do.

1014
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:04,370
If you want to book me, thank
you. If you don't, I understand.

1015
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,820
The second I went into that mindset,
I never fucking stressed again.

1016
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:11,020
So I really think that
all that whole, you know,

1017
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:13,520
the pressures of fucking Hollywood is,

1018
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:16,580
I understand that when you're young,

1019
01:01:16,581 --> 01:01:19,370
but as you're getting
older you have to fucking,

1020
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:23,030
it really has nothing to
do with Hollywood. I also,

1021
01:01:23,031 --> 01:01:27,350
I think it has more to do with, you
know, why you got into this business,

1022
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:32,520
you know, the self-loathing, you
know, and not liking yourself.

1023
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,220
I think, and I have to tell you a,

1024
01:01:35,221 --> 01:01:39,630
this past weekend I watched
Allie Wong special and um,

1025
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:42,690
it was so fucking great.

1026
01:01:42,691 --> 01:01:47,691
And I was sitting there with my wife
and I was saying like what I loved.

1027
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:51,930
She went out there and it just
was, she was fucking original.

1028
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:56,040
All of us stuff was just, it was just
fucking, it was just a great set.

1029
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:59,580
It was worthy like this, it
really was a standup special.

1030
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:04,470
And you know, she's, she
went out there, you know,

1031
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:07,350
and everybody's making a
big fucking deal that like,

1032
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:09,750
because she was pregnant that
she did it. Oh my goodness.

1033
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:12,870
All these fucking questions. And
I understand why they did that.

1034
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,190
Cause no one's ever done that.

1035
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:18,540
But there should be more questions
about how great the material was.

1036
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:22,350
But I was saying to my wife when I
was watching this, I go, you see this?

1037
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:27,660
She had a special to do and she didn't
give a fuck that she was pregnant and she

1038
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:29,280
just walked out and then she owned it.

1039
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:34,430
And now what she's done is she's
established herself that now she can just

1040
01:02:35,011 --> 01:02:39,060
basically do whatever the fuck she
wants. She wants to have another kid.

1041
01:02:39,061 --> 01:02:44,061
She can literally go on
tour while pregnant because
she's established that this

1042
01:02:44,971 --> 01:02:47,070
is who I am. This is what
I'm doing. I'm married,

1043
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:50,640
I'm starting to fucking family
and I'm writing killer jokes.

1044
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:52,830
This is what I'm doing now.

1045
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:57,510
All these fucking feminist who sit
there going alien again. Hollywood love,

1046
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:58,650
let you be pregnant.

1047
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:02,760
I would argue your giving them
way too much fucking power.

1048
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:05,340
Way Too much power. Just go out.

1049
01:03:05,341 --> 01:03:08,580
If every fucking woman out here just
started getting pregnant cause they wanted

1050
01:03:08,581 --> 01:03:12,660
to and continue to go on auditions, the
whole fucking business would adjust.

1051
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:17,080
You, make it adjust to you rather than
the other fucking way around. And um,

1052
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:20,100
if you haven't seen her
special, you know, you know,

1053
01:03:20,101 --> 01:03:23,670
a lot of the hype on it is the fact
that she did at seven months pregnant.

1054
01:03:23,671 --> 01:03:27,900
But I'm telling you, just as,
uh, someone who still f you know,

1055
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:32,520
as long as I've been doing this, a huge
fan of standup comedy, you know, um,

1056
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:39,230
it's the jokes of a fucking killer.
The subject matter, all of it.

1057
01:03:39,231 --> 01:03:43,820
It was just like, you know, God knows
it's a Zillion fucking specials out there,

1058
01:03:43,821 --> 01:03:48,500
but you know, every once in awhile,
you know, someone comes out like with,

1059
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:53,030
with that, that was, that was one of the
best ones I've seen in awhile. So, um,

1060
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,140
I guess I would tie all of
that back into that. It's like,

1061
01:03:57,141 --> 01:04:00,590
I would say that she's losing
weight. Yeah. She's married,

1062
01:04:00,591 --> 01:04:02,870
she's got kids and who the fuck
doesn't want to lose weight?

1063
01:04:02,871 --> 01:04:05,390
I'm trying to lose weight. No one
wants to walk around being overweight.

1064
01:04:05,391 --> 01:04:09,590
It's not fun. Your life is
easier. And people who, uh,

1065
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:11,870
give a shit about that, I
would just say, you know,

1066
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:15,950
I feel bad for them because I know
they don't want to be out of shape too.

1067
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:20,750
You know? I mean [inaudible] like
being proud to be out of shape.

1068
01:04:20,751 --> 01:04:24,650
That's like being proud to be like
a fucking alcoholic, you know,

1069
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:25,850
you know you've got issues. You,

1070
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:29,060
your fucking heart isn't fucking
excited that you're overweight. Like,

1071
01:04:29,061 --> 01:04:29,894
that's right.

1072
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:36,230
Every pound of fat is five
miles of capillaries. You know,

1073
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:37,580
you get 20 pounds overweight,

1074
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:41,540
your heart's got to fucking go an
extra hundred miles every fucking beat.

1075
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:45,020
You stupid. It's not, it's
not a good thing to be doing.

1076
01:04:45,021 --> 01:04:48,830
So congratulations to
her. Um, and you know,

1077
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:52,050
I'm struggling right now to lose
fucking weight. Oh, I'll tell you,

1078
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:55,190
it's not easy. Well, Billy
booze bag. All right.

1079
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:59,240
A Christian girls sexual
boundaries. Hey Billy Bo Berman.

1080
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:03,170
I listen to all your specials multiple
times and really loved the advice

1081
01:05:03,171 --> 01:05:05,240
segments you do on your podcast.

1082
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:09,200
I'm back home for the summer from my
first year of college and I'm hooking up

1083
01:05:09,201 --> 01:05:12,740
with this six to 10. Chris, what?

1084
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:17,500
Oh six out of 10 Christian girl the
last couple of months of school.

1085
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:21,880
I barely even just retained any of that
cause I was hoping everything that I

1086
01:05:21,881 --> 01:05:26,500
said came off as positive. And
that last thing, um, anyway,

1087
01:05:26,501 --> 01:05:27,161
let me reread this.

1088
01:05:27,161 --> 01:05:30,040
I've listened to all your saying that
the dad back for the summer. Okay.

1089
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:33,010
I'm hooking up with this girl,
this six out of 10 Christian girl,

1090
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,510
the last couple months of school.

1091
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:39,150
The encounter is basically consisted
of me aggressively finger bla Jeez.

1092
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Easy finger blasting her to
quench her sexual deviancy.

1093
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:49,850
Oh, I love how you're just fucking
innocent in all this and her giving my,

1094
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:55,120
Oh, okay. Okay. Oh,

1095
01:05:55,121 --> 01:05:59,380
this is a woman rightness and hurricanes
are given my carpet. A midnight snack.

1096
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:03,810
What? Oh No, this is a guy.
Why are you saying your carpet?

1097
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:10,540
Giving my carpet a midnight snack while
jerking me off. You lost me in that one.

1098
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:15,440
What is your carpet? Your pubes.

1099
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:21,720
What does the snack cause
you come on yourself.

1100
01:06:21,721 --> 01:06:24,070
I don't even know what's
going on here. Anyway,

1101
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:28,050
she's a devout Christian so she won't
get involved with oral sex or anything

1102
01:06:28,051 --> 01:06:32,760
further a, the thing is her
idea of boundaries are pretty,

1103
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:38,430
uh, a morphous. I don't know what
that means. Nah, you fucking asshole.

1104
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,560
Now I gotta look, you know
what, actually keep doing this.

1105
01:06:40,561 --> 01:06:43,610
Maybe I'll get smart one day. A morphous

1106
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:48,270
amorphous without a clear,
defined shape or form.

1107
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:54,930
How did I never hear that?
My whole fucking life?

1108
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,890
There's so many fucking words in English
language and then they always say that,

1109
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:01,710
but we use like 19 of them. Four
of them are curse words. All right?

1110
01:07:01,711 --> 01:07:06,210
She's begged me to pleasure her
with the hilt of my screwdriver.

1111
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:12,260
Dude, are you from another century? What
the fuck is a hilt? Is that the handle?

1112
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:17,810
Don't know why I even had one at college
and jerk me off onto her face when we

1113
01:07:18,841 --> 01:07:23,480
took a late night sleepover
shower together. Ah,

1114
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:26,310
yeah, but that's not really a
facial when the water's right there.

1115
01:07:26,311 --> 01:07:29,910
You know what I mate, that's like,
you know, you're going to run,

1116
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:33,330
you're going to go walk on some hot rocks
and you just fucking do a running leap

1117
01:07:33,331 --> 01:07:36,780
and touch one for half a second. You
keep going, right? She's also into being,

1118
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:40,110
it's like picking up dog shit with the
little fucking plastic bag around your

1119
01:07:40,111 --> 01:07:43,680
hand. You know, you're still touching
dog shit, but you feel the warmth of it.

1120
01:07:43,681 --> 01:07:46,170
But you know, there's
a boundary there. Uh,

1121
01:07:46,171 --> 01:07:48,240
she's also into being
choked and tied up to her.

1122
01:07:48,241 --> 01:07:51,060
Jesus fucking Christ
up during dry humping.

1123
01:07:51,061 --> 01:07:54,240
Apparently that stuff's still
Christian enough for her.

1124
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:56,600
I've had sex a few
times before this. Cute.

1125
01:07:56,601 --> 01:07:58,920
Why are you judging this
girl so harshly? All right.

1126
01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:02,850
This is this religion thing. This is
where she's at. Just fucking relaxed.

1127
01:08:02,850 --> 01:08:06,630
It seems like you having a hell of a
time because I had sex a few times before

1128
01:08:06,631 --> 01:08:11,430
this girl and know that even protected
fucking is infinitely more pleasurable

1129
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:14,820
than outsource masturbation.
My question to you is,

1130
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:19,250
do you think she'll ever
realize how ridiculous it is
to take a load on her face

1131
01:08:19,251 --> 01:08:24,251
but not accept kind of Linkous
will she ever want premarital sex?

1132
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:27,200
I know I should go to
a gym, lose this girl,

1133
01:08:27,201 --> 01:08:29,990
get some sleep and take
advantage of the pussy Colosseum.

1134
01:08:29,991 --> 01:08:32,720
That is my universe
camp, university campus,

1135
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:35,870
but I'm lazy and want to
fuck the low hanging fruit.

1136
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:39,710
What can I do to convince her that
college, sexist, natural, wholesome.

1137
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:43,130
It would make her feel incredible.
Thanks so much and go fuck yourself.

1138
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:46,100
I would say, you should
let this girl go because a,

1139
01:08:46,101 --> 01:08:48,280
you don't have any feelings
for you using as a,

1140
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:51,710
you're using her as a fucking blow
up doll. You just say, you know,

1141
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:53,780
I know I should go meet some other people,

1142
01:08:53,781 --> 01:08:58,460
but this girl's an easy
fucking sex hookup. Um,

1143
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:03,450
I dunno, I mean, meantime, is
she getting feelings for you?

1144
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:08,470
Because if you just sitting there hanging
around waiting to be able to fuck her,

1145
01:09:08,471 --> 01:09:13,140
so then you can then leave, um, you're
already saying she's a six out of 10.

1146
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:16,470
That's, that doesn't sound like you have
feelings for her. So I'd let her go.

1147
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:20,850
I'd let her go and I'd find some girl
then just, and just let them know,

1148
01:09:20,851 --> 01:09:23,940
you're young, so I'm not judging you
here. What you got to do early on,

1149
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:26,700
and this is what nobody
ever tells young men,

1150
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,640
it's just just out of the gate.

1151
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:35,310
Tell women what the deal is. All
right. Because believe it or not,

1152
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:39,900
they can have fun. We eat. They don't
flip out when you just say, yeah,

1153
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:42,780
there's no way I'm going
to marry you. You know,

1154
01:09:42,781 --> 01:09:46,620
if you say it right from the beginning,
the second you meet them, right?

1155
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:50,850
If you're not feeling anything
but you're just attracted to them,

1156
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:56,230
just tell them that and just
fucking let them, you know,

1157
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:57,490
work that out.

1158
01:09:59,670 --> 01:10:02,350
And maybe they're in the same place
you are and they just want to fuck.

1159
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:04,180
They don't want to have a relationship.

1160
01:10:04,181 --> 01:10:08,220
But if you get into that
type of a situation, you've
got to make sure that you,

1161
01:10:08,221 --> 01:10:12,200
you got to have like, you know,

1162
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:15,560
you fuck and then you don't call each
other or talk or do anything else.

1163
01:10:15,561 --> 01:10:19,310
You do not hang out and there's gotta
be at least 10 days between the fucking

1164
01:10:19,311 --> 01:10:23,840
hookups or, or somebody starts failing
something and then it's a fucking mess.

1165
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:26,360
Or they get jealous cause you
with somebody else. So whatever.

1166
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:30,730
You know what I mean? And this is what
you fucking say from day one. You,

1167
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:33,310
you tell him that. All right, let's deal,

1168
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:36,160
we're going to hook up anything
you ever wanted to fucking do.

1169
01:10:36,161 --> 01:10:38,200
You can do with me. You're
not going to get judged.

1170
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:42,190
You have to worry about getting judged
because it is what it is. Right?

1171
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:45,460
And then that's it. We
don't call each other.

1172
01:10:45,461 --> 01:10:47,830
This is what we just fucking
use each other for this.

1173
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:51,310
Anytime you're feeling already, if
you're not in a fucking relationship,

1174
01:10:51,311 --> 01:10:53,950
I don't give a shit if you date
other people, believe it or not.

1175
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:55,540
If you come out of the
gate with that Shit,

1176
01:10:55,541 --> 01:10:59,140
you would be surprised how many
women are also looking for that.

1177
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:02,440
It's a great fuck fuck buddy is.
It's the greatest thing ever.

1178
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:08,110
Greatest fucking thing ever. It's
like having fucking, I don't know,

1179
01:11:08,111 --> 01:11:12,220
free tickets to Disneyland. You
get to ride all the fucking rides.

1180
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:17,400
You know you've got VIP parking. It's
like ordering a pizza. It's tremendous.

1181
01:11:17,401 --> 01:11:20,400
And you know what? Women also order
a pizza, if you know what I mean.

1182
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:24,060
So have fun with that. But let
this girl go, man. All right.

1183
01:11:24,061 --> 01:11:28,470
First Time flying at 30 years of age. Hey,

1184
01:11:28,471 --> 01:11:30,990
they have Billy the ginger bats.

1185
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:34,650
Just want to say I've been a huge fan
for over 10 years and have loved every

1186
01:11:34,651 --> 01:11:36,480
special you had. Well,
thank you very much.

1187
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:41,810
I'm 30 I've never been on a plane and
heights kind of freaked me out to top it

1188
01:11:41,851 --> 01:11:46,140
off. My flight is on nine 11 and
makes two stops in between here,

1189
01:11:46,141 --> 01:11:47,400
Connecticut in Chicago.

1190
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:51,360
I'm going there for my job and I'd really
hate to miss out on the opportunity.

1191
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:52,081
Basically,

1192
01:11:52,081 --> 01:11:55,590
I'm just looking for advice and how to
not freak out and look like a fucking

1193
01:11:55,591 --> 01:11:59,370
idiot on the plane. Seeing as how
you've had so much experience flying,

1194
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:03,120
I'd figured you'd be a good person to
talk to. Thanks and go fuck yourself. Um,

1195
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:08,550
yeah. It's no big deal. It's
completely safe and uh, you know,

1196
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:13,170
you're going to be fine. This is the
deal. You're going to go up there, right?

1197
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:14,191
This is what you do.

1198
01:12:14,191 --> 01:12:18,570
Get on the plane and then just
say to the person next to you yet,

1199
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,420
believe it or not, this is the
first time I've ever flown,

1200
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:25,110
hopefully not next to a douche. If
they'd seem open, just tell them that.

1201
01:12:25,111 --> 01:12:26,820
All right. But to believe
me, you're not going to,

1202
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:30,060
if you ever just stomped on the gas when
you've been driving a car and you just

1203
01:12:30,061 --> 01:12:31,320
get back in your seat,

1204
01:12:31,321 --> 01:12:34,620
it's just sorta like that and then
you fucking up in the air and it's the

1205
01:12:34,621 --> 01:12:36,720
coolest thing ever. It's fucking great.

1206
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:41,070
And you're going to go from fucking
Connecticut to Chicago in like fucking two

1207
01:12:41,071 --> 01:12:45,990
seconds. You know, we got two stops
there. Okay, well that's cool. Be Fun,

1208
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:49,650
you know, then you'll be a veteran by
the end of it and yeah, welcome to the,

1209
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:54,510
uh, the, the fucking 21st century.
You're going to be fine. Um,

1210
01:12:54,511 --> 01:12:57,720
what I would say is, you know, just, uh,

1211
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:00,690
make sure you eat well before
you go to the airport, you know,

1212
01:13:00,691 --> 01:13:03,120
maybe bring some food to go
onto the plane, you know,

1213
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:05,160
because the food and the plane sucks.

1214
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:09,060
It's fucking overpriced and that
type of thing. And uh, you know,

1215
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:12,030
that's the only thing I
would say. Other than that,

1216
01:13:12,031 --> 01:13:13,500
you have nothing to worry
about. It's going to be great.

1217
01:13:13,501 --> 01:13:17,720
Get a fucking window seat too, if
you can. That's the best, you know,

1218
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:20,850
first time you fly, you
get to look down. Um,

1219
01:13:20,851 --> 01:13:23,850
it's actually pretty incredible to be
doing that at 30 years of age cause you

1220
01:13:23,851 --> 01:13:26,130
can actually take it in. You know,
I came the first time I flew,

1221
01:13:26,131 --> 01:13:28,020
I was so young that I don't
ever have that. Like, oh,

1222
01:13:28,021 --> 01:13:31,570
this is what it looks like from the
fucking year. Um, you'll be fine. All

1223
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:35,280
Right William, I've been dating
my girls. This is the last one.

1224
01:13:35,281 --> 01:13:38,550
And then I gotta I gotta get off my
day here of doing absolutely nothing.

1225
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:39,720
William William,

1226
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:43,440
I've been dating my girl for a few years
now and everything started out great.

1227
01:13:43,650 --> 01:13:45,660
However, over the course
of the past few months,

1228
01:13:45,661 --> 01:13:48,600
I've noticed a sudden change in her
behavior and was wondering if he's dealt

1229
01:13:48,601 --> 01:13:50,670
with anything like this before. Yeah.

1230
01:13:50,671 --> 01:13:55,050
She's either using drugs or fucking
someone else. Um, or she's depressed.

1231
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,060
I'm fucking with you. Let
me read the rest of this.

1232
01:13:57,061 --> 01:14:00,150
Basically when we hang out lately,
she just won't stop asking questions.

1233
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:05,010
She may ask, what are you listening
to? I might say the bill bird podcast.

1234
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:09,300
Then she will ask, why I don't
know, because I enjoy it. He says,

1235
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:11,100
then she will follow it up with,

1236
01:14:11,290 --> 01:14:15,730
why don't you listen to the
radio or another podcast
and down the rabbit hole it

1237
01:14:15,731 --> 01:14:20,080
goes, oh, I don't like this
person already. The thing is,

1238
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:22,780
these questions are
nonstop and so subjective.

1239
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:26,470
It got to the point where I straight up
asked her if she was trolling me and she

1240
01:14:26,471 --> 01:14:29,380
denied it. Everything else in
relationship is going well,

1241
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:30,640
so I'm not sure what to do.

1242
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:33,580
I've talked to her and told her
she asked too many questions.

1243
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:38,080
She then turns around on me and says,
I never want to talk to her. Any.

1244
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:39,460
Oh, she turns it,

1245
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:42,490
turns it around on me and says that
I never want to talk to her anymore.

1246
01:14:42,670 --> 01:14:45,640
That's not talking. It's just asking
a bunch of fucking question. She'll,

1247
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:48,430
what should I do? Break up with
her. Just answered the questions.

1248
01:14:48,670 --> 01:14:52,780
What would you do, Bill? Why is your
name bill anyways? Why not, Dave? Huh?

1249
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:55,630
Why isn't it Dave? Bill, why
aren't you answering me? Bill?

1250
01:14:55,870 --> 01:15:00,280
Don't want to talk anymore. Why is the
podcast an hour anyways? Why not an hour,

1251
01:15:00,281 --> 01:15:03,460
10 or 50 minutes? Hot
Bill. Yeah. All right dude,

1252
01:15:03,461 --> 01:15:07,290
I just walked in your shoes
there. Yeah. Uh, yeah. I, I,

1253
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:10,840
I would break up with her.
I'd break up with them.

1254
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:14,440
Um, I maybe a, but if you really like her,

1255
01:15:14,441 --> 01:15:16,240
I give her one last
chance and just be like,

1256
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:20,830
just tell it you're driving
me fucking insane. And um,

1257
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:25,870
yeah, it just, you're driving me fucking
insane. I like everything about you,

1258
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:29,710
but that, and if my life with you is
going to be that, I'm going to leave.

1259
01:15:30,910 --> 01:15:34,600
Okay. Um, but I gotta be honest with dude,

1260
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:38,380
I don't know how people
change. Changing yourself,

1261
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:42,070
who the fuck you are is really difficult,
so hopefully it'll work out with you.

1262
01:15:42,071 --> 01:15:44,080
So that's, that's what I would
do. I would just say, listen,

1263
01:15:46,130 --> 01:15:49,970
I like everything but that everything
about you is great except for that.

1264
01:15:49,971 --> 01:15:52,100
But that is so fucking horrific.

1265
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:56,240
This is going to walk out that
fucking door if you don't cut it up.

1266
01:15:56,870 --> 01:16:00,590
That's it. That's it. If I
could redo my whole dating life,

1267
01:16:00,591 --> 01:16:05,570
it would have been fucking communicating
instead of just being like, Woo,

1268
01:16:05,610 --> 01:16:08,600
fuck. And then gone out and getting
shit faced. What was wrong with USA?

1269
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:11,550
No thing. I'm sorry. And then you
don't fucking work it out. Hey,

1270
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:14,100
we're going out. Okay. All right.
That's the podcast for this week.

1271
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:17,380
Go fuck yourselves. I'll
check it on Thursday.

1272
01:16:17,710 --> 01:16:22,500
A thank you to everybody
who's been listening to the
podcast and I'm obviously,

1273
01:16:22,501 --> 01:16:27,210
I am beyond excited to do
this tour. Um, starting, uh,

1274
