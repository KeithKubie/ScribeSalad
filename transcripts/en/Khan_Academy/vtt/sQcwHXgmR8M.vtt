00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.123
- [Instructor] In this video,

00:00:01.123 --> 00:00:03.440
we're gonna do a brief overview

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.130
of how amendments to the Constitution

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.040
and federal legislation

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.110
have increased voting rights over time.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.530
Now, why does this matter?

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.970
Apart from just the innate value

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.510
of voting rights in a democracy,

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.820
it matter because who participates

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.050
in the political process at any one time

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.853
affects what political outcomes are.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.530
So, as we go through
these amendments and laws

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.350
which increase voting rights,

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.600
think about how each new group of voters

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.030
might affect the overall opinion
of the voting population.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.070
The first major expansion of voting rights

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.723
happened in 1870 when the
15th Amendment was ratified.

00:00:58.862 --> 00:01:01.250
And the 15th Amendment extended suffrage,

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.550
the right to vote, to African American men

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.640
and men in particular, at the time

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.240
women were also hoping
to get the right to vote

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.880
but there really was
only the political will

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.960
to grand suffrage to African American men.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.230
Now, this happened immediately
after the Civil War,

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.410
which ended in 1865,
and before the Civil War

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.873
really only white men
had the right to vote.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.290
Now, the Civil War ended slavery

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.580
but it didn't clear up the question

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.180
of what the legal citizenship status

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.040
of formerly enslaved
men and women would be

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.060
and a lot of states in the south

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.420
passed laws after the Civil War

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.010
specifically denying the right to vote

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.020
to African American men.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.440
So, in 1870, Congress kind of fought back

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.160
against this and then they
passed the 15th Amendment

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.300
which was then ratified by the states.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.900
The next notable
expansion of voting rights

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.800
didn't concern so much who got to vote

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.850
as who people got to vote for.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.890
In 1913 the states
ratified the 17th Amendment

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.850
which provided for the
popular election of senators.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.880
So, before 1913, senators
were actually appointed

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.600
by state legislatures

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.030
instead of directly elected by citizens

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.440
like members of the
House of Representatives.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.620
And switching to popular
election of senators

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.280
is important because it
gives citizens more say

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.813
over the national government.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.370
So, more say over who goes into Congress

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.460
and therefore more say
over what kinds of laws

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.083
that Congress passes.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.091
And in 1920, women finally
got the right to vote

00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:56.230
in the 19th Amendment, which doubled

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.203
the voting eligible population.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.580
Now let's talk about some more recent

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.660
voting rights amendments and laws.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.590
In 1964 and 1965 there were two amendments

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.410
and pieces of federal legislation

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.300
that had a major impact

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.810
on African American voting rights.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.500
Now, although African American men

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.240
technically got the right to vote in 1870,

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.050
African American women
technically got the right to vote

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.700
in 1920, there were a number of measures

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.140
of voter suppression
enacted in southern states

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.330
that effectively prevented
them from voting.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.050
One of these was the use of poll taxes

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.340
which is effectively paying
money for the right to vote.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.070
The 24th Amendment outlawed that

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.150
and then the Voting Rights
Act took that a step further

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.760
by adding a number of other bans

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.840
on voter suppression
tactics in southern states.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.270
So, in addition to poll taxes,

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.430
the Voting Rights Act
banned literacy tests

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.570
and forms of voter suppression
like grandfather clauses

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.680
which were laws that
said you could only vote

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.860
if your grandfather had voted.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.050
And while you might
think, oh, literacy tests

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.240
don't sound that bad,
seems like a good idea

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.400
to have a literate voting population,

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.530
literacy tests really weren't fair

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.440
because they were administered
by local voting boards

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.740
who got to decide who
was and was not literate,

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.040
so if you were an African American man

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.860
you could have been a
Pulitzer Prize winning author

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.130
and still had your local board say,

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.080
oh, you're not literate soy
you're not eligible to vote.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.770
So, things like poll
taxes and literacy tests

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.543
and grandfather clauses,

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.660
nowhere in the language
of these voting laws

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.060
did they say you can't
vote if you're black

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.410
but they were very carefully crafted

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.710
to specifically single out and suppress

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.770
the votes of African Americans.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.523
The Voting Rights Act also
provided for federal examiners

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.713
who had the power to
register people to vote,

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.380
to monitor elections in jurisdictions

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.360
that had large black populations

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.820
but few registered black voters.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.883
And this effort was enormously successful.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.210
By the end of 1965,

00:05:29.647 --> 00:05:34.647
250,000 new African American voters

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.640
had been registered in southern states.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.070
So, imagine how all of
these new participants

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.860
might change legislative outcomes.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.230
Okay, there are two more
things I'd like to discuss.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.410
Now, one aspect of voting rights

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.160
you might not have heard of

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.910
is that until 1971,

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.310
when the 26th Amendment was ratified,

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.130
you had to be 21 years old to vote.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.920
Now, you can kinda guess at the
reason behind this amendment

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.400
based on its year.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.270
In 1971 the United States

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.190
was involved in the Vietnam war

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.350
and young men were being drafted.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.480
So, it would have been possible

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.980
to be drafted for the U.S. Army at age 18

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.270
without ever having cast a vote.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.380
It's amazing to think
that the right to vote

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.170
for 18 year olds is
less than 50 years old.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.510
The last piece of legislation
that I want to talk about

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.460
is the Motor Voter Act
which was passed in 1993.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.200
The official name of this was the

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.210
National Voter Registration Act of 1993

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.890
but it's called the Motor Voter Act

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.610
because it requires states
to provide individuals

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.730
with the opportunity to register to vote

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.303
when they apply for or renew
their driver's license.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.350
So, this makes it easier
to register to vote

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.910
in the first place and it makes it easier

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.980
to maintain your voter registration

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.720
if you move to a new state

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.170
because you'll need to
get a new driver's license

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.720
so you can quickly make sure
you get on the polls to vote

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.750
in your new state.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.450
The Motor Voter Act also requires states

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.480
to allow individuals to register by mail

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.650
30 days before a federal election

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.980
and to allow individuals
to register to vote

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.160
if they're going to an office

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.460
providing services to people

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.943
with disabilities or public assistance.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.040
So, in general, the Motor Voter Act

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.450
makes it easier

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.700
for people to get registered to vote

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.490
and to stay registered to vote.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.940
So, it kinda removes barriers
to political participation.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.290
So, I know there's a
lot of information here,

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.450
it's a lot to take in,
but the biggest thing

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.250
to take away from this, again,

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.640
is how participation affects outcomes.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.160
Who gets to vote, and more
importantly who does vote

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.290
in any given election,
has an enormous impact

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:03.370
on what kinds of politicians we elect

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.753
and what kind of policies they enact.
